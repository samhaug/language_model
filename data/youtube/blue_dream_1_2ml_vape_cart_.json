{"xtba40sLaoY": "Bammer TV [Music] welcome to Bamber TV cart reviews a brand new segment on the channel where we review the best carts around now we normally do we'd review x' and we will have a playlist of that in the description we are also going to make a brand new playlist for these cart reviews so very exciting stuff here our first cart review is none other than blue dreams so very excited Dave what you have to say about Blue Dream Blue Dream is a west coast legend amongst weed it is a crossbreed between blue berry indica and a sativa known as haze and this dream child amongst these two makes it a very potent hybrid and of course when you think about blue dream automatically the flavor comes to mind it's one of the most flavorful strains around so I was really excited to taste this and it really stays true to the bud it's very flavorful the oil has a night nice light golden color to it so very appealing as well now the main difference between the strain and the oil is well the oil is a concentrated version of the weed itself so this oil right here is about 78 percent THC by volume and it has a couple of other good cannabinoids and high amounts in there but then the rest of the oil is known as terpenes and that's the flavor profile but all natural flavors that are in the bud itself now blue dream is known for having a lot of stress relieving properties to it as well as depression fighting and nausea preventing busts so that makes it a very good medicinal weed alright so normally I just cut to the score but Dave I have a two-part question for you today I want to know which one you prefer in terms of the weed strain or the oil strain and also of course the Bama rating me personally Pat I really enjoy the flour from Blue Dream it's been a little bit since I've smoked it however I do remember all those beautiful floral notes especially when you use it so it's one of my favorite strains to smoke as far as my Bimmer rating for this cart I mean we started off with a really really good one so we asked her to make it known that this is a really good kart right off the bat I'm gonna give this one a four out of five okay so there you go a legendary strain translating very well to a legendary oil so that is our first cart review guys if you like this video smash the like button think about subscribing and for everything else and weed and weed related keep it here on Bammer TV [Music]", "fGwzqng9AOI": "[Music] hey guys dr. Shawn Mira VG here and it's time for another cannabis product review today I'm reviewing good Supply Blue Dream and this is a vape cartridge using the 510 system it's got a lot of good information even just on the box it says our oil what's inside cannabis distill a plant-based terpenes and the terpenes are quite nice in this one no additives which is what I like and premium ceramic core that sounds good anti leaked technology perfect don't want that leaking in direct airflow system alright so already I'm liking this product it's really kind of cool funky green color there's some good easy to read information on the box so this retails for $43 ninety five cents on the Ontario cannabis store it's got 75 to 83 percent THC meaning it's a quite a potent cannabis cartridge there's really no CBD in here it's a sativa dominant hybrid so a little bit about blue dream so blue dream is a really classic strain that originated in California it was made using two strains blueberry which is known for its sort of blueberry flavor owing to a sort of fruity terpene profile and a really classic sativa strain called haze it's so blue dream has been pretty much known for its sort of full body relaxing effects without being sedating now the licensed producer behind good supply is \u00e1free\u00e1 they're basically a giant here in Canada a huge licensed producer with a lot of brands under its name but good quality products I know a froyo well they're out of Leamington Ontario if anyone wanted to know and they pride themselves with this 509 step process which is basically just means there's they take five hundred and nine steps in they're sort of quality assurance program so everything's held up to a really big standard I guess 5:09 really doesn't mean much to the average person but I'm guessing if you went to their plant and they went through the whole system you'd be pretty impressed anyway so that's a little bit of the backstory about this so let's open it up I really like this box it's really cool so you open it up using these tabs so there's two tabs here so if you push them both in and then you can push the inside of the box out so really kind of sleek and cool and good child protective mechanism there and so your cartridge is inside here and you can just sort of bring it out and that's what it looks like it's got a nice heavy metal heavy metal alright a metal tip which you know it's got a good mouthfeel to it and of course just like all the other 5-10 oops 510 cartridges it fits into your battery just by turning it like this so there you go and then you're ready to go so about blue dream what really stands out about this particular product is the flavor so the flavor is very fruity notes forward it's very true to the blueberry ancestors of blue dream yeah probably one of the most fruity besides maybe the tangerine dream from San Rafael this would be the second most fruity vape I've tried now the effects pretty typical to a blue dream there's this sort of wave of kind of like hazy it just says the name suggests relaxation so I didn't feel particularly what should I say focused during the effects of this one it kind of makes your thinking a bit hazy and sloppy but at the same time it's very relaxing and other point to mention which I notice with this one is it's not sedating at all so I wouldn't recommend this for nighttime use cuz it might keep you up a bit unless you can augment it with something that's a little bit more sedating so yeah so that's pretty much it in a nutshell I'm gonna give this one hmm this is gonna be a tough one because I do like the flavour a lot I like the effects but I'm not crazy about the effects I'm gonna have to give this a seven and a half out of ten yeah a little bit shy of an eight just because the effects aren't my favorite and you know what it is is if I'm going to be taking a sativa that's not going to be sedating that you know is probably better for daytime use I want like I want to have a lot of focus a lot of energy I want to be able to get things done which is not really what this one brings to the table and maybe it's not what this one's designed for this one's really more about chilling and relaxing like during the daytime because it's not sedating but very relaxing so I think a seven and a half for me is fair some other people who want like a more chilled out experience will probably rate it a bit higher but that's what I'm going to give it all around a great product are really happy with the purchase oh yeah and I bought this from a new dispensary in my area of town called Miss Jones I want to just give them a shout out because the the store looks beautiful first of all and the staff was really friendly and I enjoyed talking with them so shout out to you guys at Miss Jones alright that's it for me I'll be back with another cannabis product review for you guys shortly", "tCNZnYk6xMU": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from that if you couldn't tell from the title it is another cartridge video uh it's another populous herb cartridge video you know i only have i would say about one and a half videos on it i do have another video where you know we're we've just picked up pop herbs but i didn't really you know get into detail um the other flavors were pretty good um but i just had to i just had to try blue dream for myself i don't know i'm not really fond of blue dream but i rarely see it in a cartridge and i figured you know it's nine dollars you know if you didn't see my other papa herbs video it's nine dollars for a half gram cart of blue dream so you know i had to pop cop it and uh let me know you guys opinion on blue dream homie stevie says that purple punch is the new blue dream let me know your thoughts on that that's what he says but yeah it's the cartridge itself i already been smoking on it as you can tell you know they don't come this low but very very enjoyable very very candy-like uh i wouldn't say blueberry taste but i don't let's just get it handy i'm gonna put it in my tutron family so cheers like i get a slight weird taste to it like the similar taste that you would get from like i don't know it's like that weird black licorice taste i don't know if it's exactly it's like a weird taste but then you get the the the sweetness uh kind of um like a like a candy taste um but overall good it is just lit when it comes to papa herbs it is going to be distillate uh if you didn't see the back it is running at 87.60 or 87.63 percent uh packaged on packaged on august 10th of 2020 and uh it says right here manufactured by sublime so yeah uh i mean the cartridge itself very very nice but for those of you who are expecting live resin you're not going to get that for nine dollars for a half gram but overall very very good for your budget cartridge smokers you know if you have nine dollars after you purchase all this stuff and you want to get a cartridge you know i'll definitely recommend this and i'd like to say that nine dollars is the price that i pay in modesto california obviously it's going to be different where you're from even different dispensaries in same cities range different prices so just please just keep that in mind when you're like looking for this car it's not going to be nine dollars if you're not where i'm at you know i'm saying so but yeah blue dream very very good strain from them uh as of right now the probably the best strain that i've tried from papa herbs their cartridges is the gelato but i would say that maybe this is the second best out of all the ones that i've tried i've tried forbidden fruit i've tried wedding cake the consensus with my friends saying that the wedding cake is actually the best but i didn't really like it it's too i don't know i just didn't i mean it's not bad but i didn't enjoy it as much as i would say this or the forbidden fruit one which kind of added like a little pomegranate taste and you guys know like i'm not i don't prefer my cartridges to taste like fruits and all that stuff because it just i think it they don't get me as high when it tastes like fruit it has to taste like wheat to me and it might just be a thing in my brain that kind of just does it's like an anti-placebo or placebo um but yeah it just i don't i don't hate it you know obviously there's some pros to it you know like if i'm smoking this they're just going to think that i'm hitting a blueberry vape or something but yes i do prefer you know when it tastes like the butt itself cannabis derived terpenes instead of fruity terpenes but nonetheless still a really really good buy you know i still this like maybe the the second this is the second time i bought a papa herbs cartridge and it's because it's so affordable and why not you know and uh yeah like like i said in the first pop earth video when it costs nine dollars uh and it's good it's a win-win because at the end of the day it's nine dollars and it's good and even it like it's so cheap you know what i'm saying like even if you did pay nine dollars and it's shitty you just paid nine dollars you know so i'm gonna take one more hit one more no actually two more hits i'm gonna take another one and then i'm gonna show you guys how much smoke i'm actually getting or vape or whatever cheers oh you see don't have that much left but it's been getting me getting me through the week you feel me oh all right let's take start here peace out guys [Music] you", "uv2qrTaKd3o": "hi it's mattad Rafal studios and welcome to our review of the heavy hitters prefilled cannabis concentrate vaporizer pens [Music] we're going to be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you enjoyed this review of the heavy hitters solvent free concentrated cannabis wax pens if you did please hit

carts by the company arita hemp so this is my first time trying any delta 8 at all so i'm excited to see what happens let's check it out and this is the official unboxing so here we have a cool postcard here special note it's pretty cool what else we got in here this is the sticker notice to law enforcement customs and all regulatory authorities i'm not going to be taking this any crazy places so i don't really have to worry about that you have the research lab of this specific strain and all the data here so maybe i'll probably check that out in more depth later the piso resistance however you say it i'm not french oh nice durbin poison kush i didn't order this i just guess they threw that in there which was awesome smells like bud to me so what i got here were these two limitless cartridges og kush and blue dream so i'm gonna switch up camera angles here in a moment i have both of these sitting upright just so the oil settles in i'm going to do that for let that happen for about 30 minutes i believe o.g kush is the indica and the blue dream is the sativa so i will be back in a bit to try those out and let you know what i think this is kind of funny not really since this is a review video but i put the cartridge on and i realized i said both of them next to each other so i don't know which one's which i have no idea what i am vaping right now it's either og kush or blue dream so it's either an indica or a sativa but whatever i just took one hit i just got this pen so i was making sure i was preheating it properly so tastes good i've never been one to uh you know care so much about the taste just really the effects but give me a second here [Music] you know i always do that i was under always underestimate with these pens here but initial thoughts um i'd say similar to my experience with like you know cbd hemp flour at least right now i'm going to do a separate video on that that's a product that i tried in the past say a month or so ago and i want to give a breakdown on that but anyway as i'm talking i definitely feel like i'm a lot more you know kind of like getting in my head a little bit almost like that feeling of you know if you had uh number nine it's kind of calming down so it's that little kind of initial oomph and then just kind of oh nothing else is really happening but i know this is much different because this is not just you know cbd hemp bud or whatever i never had the delta eight before but i'm definitely feeling that nice you know calm effect really [Music] hmm [Music] well i do like this for sure my plan was i haven't eaten dinner yet i'm gonna walk to the store so i'm feeling good still just like a little bit more of i'd say more of an intense feeling than the uh just like you know cbd bud so it's interesting i'm interested to see what it will feel like if this feeling will continue to kind of build and it's just uh pretty much an a stronger effect as the feeling i described before i'm not feeling like i'm just completely baked or anything like that i mean i know that's not gonna happen with this stuff anyway but just based on the amount because i know there's a lot of people have said that you know if they don't have a certain tolerance to it they aren't used to aren't used to this specifically this delta eight it you know it could be a bit different until you build up a tolerance versus you know how many hits or drags or whatever you would uh take on it and yeah i guess i've noticed that that you know that voice always going on your head not in a you know schizophrenic sense but you know just that constant voice of you know saying anxiety whether it be i'm not really experiencing any anxiety you know before or after i was or not after i don't even know yet but before i film this you know i haven't you know had any you know say bad anxiety today or anything like that really to speak of in the first place but it's one of those things where now even though i was going to cut this video off but i feel much more i'd say much more aware and in the sense that you know we're always we can always be this aware in the sense where i feel very present because it's a matter of being able to let go and detach from that voice that's going on as far as you know even the anxious voice or whatever however kind of plays out in your head whether it be the voice or just that big jumble of scenarios and images and everything that's like uh like a very low tv volume in the background that's always going and sometimes it's pleasant sometimes it's not so pleasant but that has calmed down drastically and it's almost like when certain as i'm speaking right now as when certain thoughts or things would come up that would allow you to just kind of go on this thought track whether it be good or bad i can almost sense them in a way of kind of rising up but then i don't attach to them and that's a really nice feeling so hope that makes sense it's uh i feel like it will to a lot of people but that's just my initial thoughts on it now i don't know what's going to you know be the case say an hour from now two hours from now but i'm going to as i said a little bit ago walk to the store just grab some food come back make some dinner and just go about my evening and then see what happens all right it is about two hours later and i think that was the blue dream i mean if i were to take a guess it's going to be cool to tomorrow try the other try the same time same circumstances and see so i can actually see a difference because i literally don't know which one was which but overall absolutely fantastic it's one of those odd things that happens to me like as i'm say walking to the store or for the past you know hour or so i was i tend to do this when i you know smoke or whatever and you know whether even with uh the hemp bud but you know i was getting way out there and in a good way just like thinking about like these different goals and nature of like reality in my life and perception and how all these things are tied together i watched a lot of actualized.org leo stuff so if anyone else watches this stuff then you probably you know know what i'm getting at and that you know you probably vibe with what i'm saying in some way shape or form with that but the other than that you know feeling great it was that very just nice positive mood type feeling and then also not in a not in a fake way just a very real just you know positive mood but yeah so overall a thousand percent i would recommend trying this out i think it's fantastic you know while this stuff is great it's not something i would suggest doing every single day or anything like that and i'm gonna you know make sure i try to not do that at least to that higher extent because as with anything i feel like we'll all build up even just a mental dependency to something but that's my take on it right now because that's been my take on that with certain things in the past so that's my overall experience a thousand percent i would check it out for yourself if you're interested at all this is my first time with using any you know anything with delta eight in it and i think it's fantastic so i will be back for day number two when i try the other one whichever it is the og kush or the blue dream leave me any comments below if you've tried this stuff before if you thought about it whatever the hell you want to say subscribe for all that fun stuff you know hopefully this will kind of get me going in the groove of like oh yeah maybe i kind of want to post videos and do more videos more frequently in this realm and i'm going to shoot this next one tomorrow and compare the whatever it was to the whatever it was so yeah see in the next video thanks for watching",

than like 10 15 minutes without hitting it it was so addicting I brought it with me everywhere I went Seema Herman never expected that what she thought was a harmless habit vaping would end up nearly killing her I took two days for my lungs to fail and I almost died the 18 year old going viral with this photo from her hospital best a tube still pumping oxygen to her failing lungs in her hands a call-to-action asked for like a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate and I wrote I want to start a no vaping campaign that was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes Seema's story is just the latest in a landslide of incidents linked to vaping sparking what many officials are calling a national health crisis what we've seen in the course of the past let's say month is an increased number of people coming in with respiratory problems as a result of vaping so far the Centers for Disease Control report more than 450 possible cases in 33 states of lung illness associated with vaping and six deaths have been confirmed in California Illinois Indiana Minnesota Oregon and now Kansas last Friday the CDC issued a stark warning if you are vaping no matter how old you are you should consider stopping like I didn't think of myself as a smoker the vaping just makes it seem like it's nothing like you're doing nothing wrong Seema was in high school when she started vaping nicotine I was 16 the first time 15 and even the first time I bought it at the smoke shop I went in and I was like can I get a pack of jewel pods and they were like how old are you and I said 22 and they were just like okay it ended up becoming my oxygen I couldn't live without it I needed it all the time every day but because all of my friends were doing it all the time and no one else had symptoms that I had I couldn't like I wouldn't even have imagined that maybe this is killing me sima was an active healthy teen she'd been dancing for years even making dance team her freshman year of college but as her vaping habit increased adding in cannabis her ability to dance disappeared she was vaping a cartridge a day that's like smoking the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes in one day her parents had no idea their daughter had become hopelessly addicted this healthy dancer dancing 12 hours a week stopped dancing because of it stop living because of it stop going to school in college because of it Sima says she was feeling sick all the time over a year I lost like 50 pounds without trying 50 pounds yeah by this summer Seema had stopped going to her college classes she says her health issues were getting worse but no doctor could nail down what was wrong did you not tell the doctors that you've ached I actually did I made sure that every hospital every ER every doctor's office I went to I told them that I smoked but you never thought I can't breathe I feel like I'm gonna die maybe it's because I'm vaping every 10 to 15 minutes no doctor ever said like maybe you should stop vaping it all came to a head on August 15th when Seamas dad rushed her to the ER I said go fast don't let me close my eyes don't let me fall asleep or I won't wake up now why did you say that because I knew I was dying you felt death on you yeah it was terrifying the worst part was I couldn't I couldn't let it like my parents watch it happen to me but hospital staff couldn't figure out why Seema couldn't breathe two days later doctors had to put her on a ventilator I was begging them found her faster event her faster she's going to die it was terrifying it was in that agonizing moment that Seamas cousin revealed her secret addiction she said you know she smokes every day what what are you talking about you said she smokes every day she smokes that beep I said you tell the doctors right now you go tell the doctors right now and I ransacked her room and I found all the vapes it looked like gum wrappers they look like little candy wrappers they look like little cute a mascara wands this progression is so fast dr. Catherine Melamed is a pulmonologist at UCLA Medical Center she worked on Seema's case this was Seema's chest x-ray when she came into our Hospital these hazy white areas here at the base at the bottom of her lungs just show that she could have a pneumonia but what you can then see is if we choose an x-ray from just less than 48 hours later now her lungs all of this white haziness here is inflammation from just day 1 to day 3 is remarkable dr. melamed is on the front lines of what health officials fear is an emerging crisis the National Youth tobacco survey found a 78 percent jump in East cigarette usage among high school students alone but any research on the impacts of vaping lags far behind part of vaping is heating oil and then inhaling that oil and that's not something the lung is used to inhaling and so with that comes an inflammatory reaction that then produces phlegm and sputum and gives the lungs sort of that wet cough when property that sounds terrible and dangerous yes last month 17 year-old Tristan zou fell described how he spent 18 days in the hospital fighting for his life after vaping I woke up just throwing up everywhere how it was just pounding on my chest going 100 miles an hour Tristan lost 15 pounds and said he had to relearn to walk and just yesterday a Texas teen had to be rushed to the hospital after vaping at school passed out and you and I wake up like he was not waking up in Wisconsin today a man was arrested for making thousands of illegal THC vaping cartridges the state of New York is taking an aggressive approach in an attempt to find answers and crack down on black-market products you shouldn't be vaping products that clearly you don't know what you're you're smoking or vaping many vaping products are popular with young adults and teenagers but no company has taken more heat than Jul the industry leader the company says it's designed to get adult smokers off cigarettes but just this week the FDA sent a warning letter to Jewell accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine bait products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof Jewell responded we share these concerns about youth vaping it adds it shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and recently began deploying new technology to verify IDs this yeah.but Seema's mom blames the whole industry for trying to hook kids early the fact that they market this crap to children and they turned into pink pretty purple packaging candy pisses me off there's a lot we don't know about the both short-term and long-term consequences of vaping and so I would just say don't and the week since Seema has worked to rehab her lungs she still feels that pull to pick up the vape now I don't necessarily crave the nicotine I don't necessarily crave the weed it's just craving like the act of smoking so that's been my hardest thing of like staying away from it but she hopes that going public with her story can keep her and countless others like her alive what would you tell somebody who's under 18 who's thinking about vaping and says I'm just gonna try it one time to see what it's like I would show them my pictures and say I tried it once too and then I tried it another time and then another time it's just remembering that you don't need it like it's gonna kill you for nightline I'm Adrienne banker in Los Angeles hi everyone George Stephanopoulos

video with me your host tyler green today i'm going to be taking a look at two new flavors of the goods disposable distillate vape pens if you've been watching the channel you would have seen my review of the grape ape last month and boy did i enjoy it there are two new flavors out this month straw nana and blue dream both of which i really enjoy anyway so i am going to try these out in the video today and let you know my thoughts so if you want to get your hands on any of the goods distillate vape pens you can do so on the hemphealth website they retail at 19 pounds 99 however at time of filming they're on offer for 15 pounds you can even use the discount code i smoke 10 for 10 off let's take a quick look at the packaging that they came in so the box says ingredients broad spectrum cbd distillate and terpenes instructions for use our vapes are auto draw activated simply take slow smooth drags until the desired effect is reached do not exceed 70mg cbd a day must be 18 plus to use this product good manufacturing process certified gmp big thanks to the goods for sending these over for me to have a look at today they come in the same packaging that the grape flavour does that the maui wowie flavor does with the package that you peel open to ensure freshness inside this little box inside we have the vape pen which looks like this and it's actually a proprietary vape pen it's not using a c cell cartridge but rather is using their own device in this pen is 45 cbd distiller in this case flavored with blue dream and in this case flavoured with straw nana this is part of their hustle range which is for the daytime and this is part of their chill range which is for the evening although being a cannabis consumer i tend to just consume them whenever i want that flavor profile and with great results as well each of these will deliver up to 300 puffs but that is going to completely depend on how big your puffs are you can treat this more like a dab pen and do some quite big puffs and get some quite big clouds with it or you can sip it and it will last longer they don't actually have a charging port because they are single use you just use it until it runs out and actually you never need to worry about charging it worth mentioning obviously as a disposable product in 2020 it's not as eco-friendly as something that you would use again and again but they tend to last quite a while and i'm still only using my second or third pen so i'm not creating a lot of waste with it so what i'm going to do now is try out both of these flavors and let you know my thoughts starting with the blue dream here we go oh that's got a nice flavor profile to it so it's kind of sweet blue and berries like all together as one literally no hemp taste at all it's just pure terpenes and that is very very nice blue dream is actually up there on my list of cannabis strains the distillate delivers a really nice turpee flavor although it's not going to taste like if you were smoking blue dream in a bong for example i'm impressed with that really easy to vape as you can see you don't need to press any buttons hold it to your lips and inhale let's take a look at the straw nana flavor profile which looks very similar it's the same device but it has a different logo printed on it this is a really cool thing about the goods range say you had different flavors just sitting there on your desk you can flip them over and see which flavor is which very easily you're not going to get mixed up not that you would once you've tasted them anyway but the the color code and the little icon on the back is really handy in that regard looking at the straw 9r1 i could actually smell this when i opened it and i was like really excited just from opening it out of the packet and getting that terpy aroma i'm going to taste it now oh that is the terpest of them all that is strawberry and banana and the blue turp and yeah mercene all the nice ones that that go into um like the sort of sweet good sex tracks i think leaves a lovely sort of taste on the inside of my lips there and it's really present during the exhale as well really can taste it as i'm breathing it out lovely straw nana really really good indeed which do i prefer out of the two that's an interesting one i did this with the grey paper and the maui wowie and the grey paper came out on top when i'm trying to pick between the blue dream and the straw nana i'm leaning towards the straw nana because the flavor profile is just so distinguishable you can smell it you can smell strawberries and bananas you can taste strawberries and bananas both of them deliver a really nice smooth vaping experience but this one has got a really deserty kind of feel to it which i really like so do i think this is a good product and how do i think it compares to other stuff on the market personally i'm not vaping c cell devices anymore i'm just vaping these distillate pens from the goods i didn't vape a lot of vape pens anyway but these deliver a really nice responsive result and a really nice flavor as well so i've just found myself vaping these i also think they're worth it as a product on their own merit because 20 pounds for a single use vape pen that's going to actually last you quite a while and give you regular hits of cannabidiol i think is quite a good deal when you factor in how good it tastes it does make it a really easy decision for me and i will certainly be getting some more when this runs out but if you are really stuck for flavor profiles and you can't pick between them then go with the straw nana or go with the grape ape in my opinion you will not be disappointed one thing i wanted to try was just trying out these flavor profiles together just to see what they taste like blue nana or straw dream it's a nice combination guys what do you think of this video have you tried any of the good disposable vape pens from the hemphealth website do leave your comments below let me know your favorite terpene profiles and i will catch up with you in another video in 2021 folks thank you so much for watching it has been an absolute pleasure this year here on the channel thanks for joining us on our 2020 journey looking forward to 2021 as always thanks for watching and keep talking [Music] so [Music] you", "qL-WBjAQYjk": "[Music] hey [Music] what's going on guys tony robb here back from another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day um if my voice and my articulation is a little messed up well that's because i just got my wisdom teeth removed a few hours ago like maybe a little over 10 hours ago and my mouth is a little bit swollen and that's not gonna stop me from making a youtube video and like i always do i push through and yeah so i hope you guys are going to enjoy this video because this is going to be a review yeah let's get it started all right what we have here today is a wax pen you know with cartridges thc and all that good stuff i didn't even open it i bought this from a local dispensary it's from the company good supply um this is a indica strain it has 880 808.76 milligrams of thc um there's a little bit less than five milligrams of cbd and a little less than a total of seven milligrams in the whole thing of cbd um it weighs about 0.5 grams it was packaged the 24th of march 2020 and yeah without further ado let's open up the packet and i was gonna use my mouth to open up this packet but i will not um yeah i can't wait to use this i bought it specifically because i was gonna get operated and i could not smoke and i know that vaping it isn't better than just regularly smoking it but i prefer to try to inhale the cleanest smoke possible so i don't get it infected some of my friends smoke backwards the day of their operation nothing happened but i prefer not to take the risk because i'm an unlucky person we have the good supply this pack cost me 58 it comes with the cartridge which is blue dream and it comes with the good supply vaporizer battery pack so it comes with included comes with a battery usb charger a usb chargeable it's 4 000 it's 400 milliamp hours three available temperatures standard 500 510 thread include yes and here it is yep this is what it looks like this is the packaging and this is what the thc box looks like so i'm gonna open it up and is this it um that's how you open up the box i don't feel like ruining the box wait oh okay i guess it opens up like this what is this right here like what does this do absolutely nothing okay okay so this whole box wow you could smell it through the cartridge that's sick damn smells like kind of smells actually the actual blue dream not even gonna lie with you about that so this is the cartridge this looks like a regular thc cartridge and we all know it's not fake so here we have the box and we have user instructions so i'll keep it here and i'll focus it and i'll read the instructions usage charge battery before use turn 510 threaded cartridge clockwise onto battery do not over tighten push button rapidly five times to turn on off led light will flash when batteries turn on off push button rapidly three times to alternate between three heating settings preheating push button rapidly two times no led will change colors push button one time to quit preheating when ready to use press and hold the button inhale through the mouthpiece turn off remove cartridge from battery when not in use the battery is not waterproof um do not expose battery to the direct sunlight and not expose battery to freezing temperatures do not tamper with battery charging turn battery clockwise into usb charger provided you do not use other usb chargers not over tighten usb indicator red equals charging green equals charge storage conditions store in a cool dry place between 4 and 30 degrees celsius troubleshooting cartridge connectivity issues button will will flash red remove cartridge and re attach tightly low battery indication led will flash 10 times charge battery usb provided restrict the airflow clog preheat for five seconds before vaping all right so here we have this baby right here so yeah my bad for the cut the audio software just stopped recording so i had to restart it but at least i got the supply pack charged so this comes with the battery pack right here this beautiful baby right here i charged it up you need to charge it before using it but at least the audio cutting helped me charge it up then you have the specific charger just like joule they're trying to make you not use a regular old charger they want you to use the specific charger you gotta screw it on and then you can charge it to tell if it is fully charged this thing is gonna turn green and this thing is gonna turn green so that's what happened it turned green and yeah i got it fully charged so without further ado let's uh get it started i'm gonna take one puff one puff only i'm not gonna puff it too much i'm not gonna start [ __ ] around with the smoke in my mouth because as i just said previously i just got my mouth operated so [ __ ] that i'm not gonna risk having an infection so yeah what we have here uh i need the instructions actually i'll keep the instructions in front of me so that way i don't mess up so here we have the pod the wax pod i'm gonna take off this cap right here come on baby yes sir got that cap off and let's screw it on they said not too tight it's not too tight and let's remove this over here and here we have it the blue dream distillate yes sir so with the blue dream this lit how do you turn it on push rapidly five times turn it on so one two three four five it's on no led will flash when batteries turn on press rapidly press button rapidly three times to alternate between three heating static settings one two three it just flashed blue uh one two three now it's red one two three now it's white okay um what are the colors like what's the the the you know the the chart the color chart um preheating rapidly twice okay one two so this is the preheating okay okay [ __ ] it so i'll take a puff okay that was one puff i'll take a second one hmm tasted actually fairly good didn't hurt too much my uh my molar my wisdom tooth area whatever so this thing actually gives me decent size drags actually wow and yeah so i'm gonna turn it off so i got my three four puffs in so another one last one all right so turn it off how do i turn it off press rapidly five times so one two three four five so is that it one two three four five one two three four five nothing i so i think it's off turn this off got the cartridge off so i had a little piece here i'll keep that protected and i'll put this on top of the cartridge so i can protect the cartridge and um i'll try to keep it standing up so i can prevent the hc from spilling over so my thoughts i can already feel the buzz coming in it's obviously a wax so it's a little stronger airflow was good it didn't feel like those cheap ass uh vapes has a good cartridge the battery is good the only downside i think is the charger the the screw-on charger i guess that's new i just lost the screw-on charger so you're pretty much screwed losing the screw-on charger if you lose it because um i don't know where the hell you can buy this except from a cannabis store or online on amazon but yeah make sure not to lose your screw-on charger make sure not to lose the cartridges the lady at the dispensary told me you can keep it pretty much anywhere in your pocket whatever i don't trust that hole so i'm gonna keep it somewhere warm and tidy so it doesn't melt or it does not uh lose its potency i'm gonna keep this somewhere safe too and overall good product seven out of ten if i would give it a number uh it was decently expensive the cartridges aren't expensive i think it's just the battery pack and the starter kit that's expensive um the vaporizer got me high i feel a little higher and a lot more elevated than i was a few mil a few moments ago obviously the whole product is good uh like i said seven out of ten pick it up if you want something discreet and that will let you get high on the low low um yeah that's pretty much it i don't have much to say about this product more than this gets you high gets the job done good ass blue dream i can't taste the blue dream that much and the high i guess reflects the blue dream high but not too much because it's a distillate in wax so it's a little stronger it's a sharper buzz but yeah if you guys enjoyed this

this is sony rob you guys know the drill drop a like hit that subscribe button um out", "7MWC1JbP12E": "hey guys so I got another review here I got this fresh cartridge it's a 1 gram it was on sale for 30 bucks so it seemed like a good deal on paper 96 percent supposedly tested THC nothing really fancy going on here it looks like a new company you know it's not a super corporate looking so I decided to give him a try see see if they're legit or not it's blue dreams Teva you know it's the beginning of the day so it's definitely stat Eva time so go ahead and give it a try got a couple different batteries here cuz sometimes cards don't like to work on the push-button ones or inhale time so we'll see what this is about it looks pretty nice golden color it's a full gram see that faint looks pretty pretty thick it looks like a thick liquid that's a good sign let's see my try it on this regular pure vapor pull type battery it doesn't have a button I'm gonna see if it works on this first it's lighting up but I'm not getting anything out of it let's try one of these and it was good okay so I turned this all the way up the red push-button one and it does seem to work I guess these regular 3.5 hole types was they were it just wasn't strong enough or something maybe it'll start working you know once the fluid starts going through here but these amsterdam batteries just the regular push-button kind of generic type seem to work a lot better so let me see here it's got a real weedy taste to it you know it's not sweet no beating around the bush with this one it definitely tastes weedy it doesn't taste super high quality but it doesn't taste like there's any chemicals or anything in there which is a good sign [Music] it just really tasted the garbed weed I can really taste you know the D card process you know it tastes kind of like burnt weed I'm gonna try and turn this lower see ya it tastes a little better yeah I guess the medium settings where it's supposed to be but yeah there's no frills no you know through fruit flavor and this or anything just straight-up blue dream you know I'm hoping this blue dream you know I'm hoping it's not just some generic sativa they're calling blue dream and just putting you know trying to put blue dream terpenes in there or something yeah they don't taste like you know man-made terpenes it tastes like legit like this is the actual flavor of it so I'm gonna smoke on this for a little bit my tolerance isn't exactly what it used to be so I'll probably take about you know five or six hits on this really quick and I'm gonna come back and let you guys know what's up all right all right so I'm just finishing up my stash here with this I took maybe about seven hits or so and I gotta say I'm already feeling it feels really good it's definitely a sativa you know it's a it's a strong sativa you do get that like racy and feely and you know just sitting here so you definitely want to be out and do like doing something I'm gonna get up here and you know get to work but uh yeah it feels really really strong I'm actually pretty impressed I was expecting you know this would be a total lie obvious like honestly and I'm actually pretty high it feels really good it's leaps and bounds better than the h1 was and it's even cheaper so you know definitely get something like this over h1 I'm super high right now definitely give this a thumbs up I would definitely get more if you can find these for $30 go for it for sure I would even pay 45 for this I'm definitely gonna order more at 30 bucks pleasantly surprised fresh good brand definitely a thumbs up I would say it's even better than the pure vape ones as you can see this is really nice and thick again it doesn't really like to work on these whole type batteries the variable you know wattage push-button ones seems to work pretty good on so you know keep that in mind yeah thumbs up thumbs up on this go ahead go ahead and buy them you won't be disappointed definitely worth it try and look for this brand", "QMH1pOMCS4k": "[Music] hey everyone jay ping here checking in live respect my region.com super excited today back with another west coast weed tour review 2020 edition today the steezy disposable vape pen i got it at the steezy store downtown la this is the disposable thc pen blue dream check it out i'm pretty excited i've never actually hit one of their products before i've tried their dabs i've tried some of their flower but never any other oils so you know i am a big vaper you got those of you who know me know my background know that i'm definitely a vapor it's been that way for a few years uh steezy a super popular brand here in california lots of influencers that part of only the coolest events um on their packaging let's let's go ahead and dive in shall we delta 9 thc is listed 443.57 milligrams total thc 88.71 total cbd this is cool 2.87 milligrams uh manufactured date july 25th packaging date july 25th so relatively fresh still super exciting batch number is listed uid numbers listed manufactured by ironworks collective incorporated that's steezy's license super cool it's got the warnings it says on the ingredients it does just say thc distillate and terpenes it doesn't differentiate which type of terpenes cannabis botanicals live resin who knows um on the back though this is pretty cool uh for many people don't know that i believe this desi has their own technology when it comes to their vaporizing device introducing the new generation of modern thc delivery systems steezy is revolutionizing the cannabis industry by creating a product that offers a discrete experience built for portability and convenience our premium quality concentrates uphold a high level of potency and purity steezy is setting the industry standard to influence and inspire through our innovative methods let's dive in no more [ __ ] here we go oh pull it out ripped it a little bit my bad we got the portable vape oh this is cool check this out it's got its own little battery we've got this beautiful gold oil in there for distillate traditionally a lot of people hate on decilit because it's not the highest quality of concentrates but it is the og of vaping so i'm pretty excited to check that out the stizzy etching and then the california etching there pretty sick all right y'all one hit i'm going to talk about it two hits we'll dive right into the rating system hundred points you guys know the rules west coast we toured let's get it honestly i feel like this little guy here is like the equivalent to the men in black noisy cricket that little battery here rips i was not expecting it to be ripping so uh intensely uh there's definitely an abundance of terpenes it was honestly got a little too hot for me to be able to fully fully like taste them right off the bat but after i blew out all the vape uh or out of you know all the ah it's working it's got me tongue tied i definitely feel like that hit got the job done two hits talk about the ratings here we go all right so this one has me thinking because this is tough you know traditionally i want to be a little bit tougher on distillate because it is not again the best like vaporizing type of concentrate like it it's good for that activity don't get me wrong but it's just not the highest quality so i'm trying to be fair in this keep it real let's go the scores i do like it presentation presentation super cool um well-branded it stands out on the shelf steezy lots of information on this i give them a 10 out of 10 on the presentation they definitely stand out stand out at most stores appeal they do the most to appeal and influence and inspire to the point where it's like you know some people find like what they do annoying myself i think they do set the standard for the proper way to go about it i wish they would diverse their influencers a little bit i would love to see more black brown uh you know varieties of asian people and and other native americans and things like that be utilized but that'll happen when the time comes color we've got a nice golden color there i don't know if you guys can fully see it but there's definitely some good gold color this is some nice looking distillate uh smell yeah you when you can smell the terps through the mouthpiece i think that's a good sign for the vapes for the vape category blue dream i can definitely smell this lemony blueberry there um gosh this is this is good presentation you know 10 out of 10 appeal 10 out of 10 color it definitely looks golden i don't know how this would look better than this 10 out of 10. the smell on this is there 10 out of 10 taste it just says terpenes so again i don't know if these are cannabis terpenes i don't know if these are all natural i don't know if these came from freaking blueberries or candy or whatever um the taste i'm gonna give it a nine just because that uncertainty has to where that tastes come from it does impact me uh potency i was already tongue-tied earlier potency for this it's an 88.71 thc it kind of hit me like a 90-plus got to give them that credit for that potency is there 10 out of 10. experience i'm honestly surprised at how well this hit it smacked me you already saw me [ __ ] up my talking i think it's undeniable that the experience with this is you know around the 9.5 9.25 but it's not because of the actual product here again it comes with the uncertainty i want to know what my ingredients are i want to know what it's actually made with and i want to know how long i'm supposed to hit it for it i could have hit it too long burned it at the beginning and then been too intoxicated initially right and at some point i like to just vape it and go casually and you know potentially be told hit it for five seconds seven seconds etc uh it's being picky but these are real things to think about lots of consumers care about this stuff experience i'm going to give them a 9.25 more information plenty of information available on this would still like some more given that 9.25 again that's kind of the issues i've wanted to be told more would you recommend absolutely 10 out of 10 i would absolutely recommend just because there is some stuff that i have questions about doesn't mean that i wouldn't recommend it perhaps i can find it on instagram send them a dm not sure um they have a large internet presence i would assume they would respond to people overall i feel like i've got to give them for a bit i don't know again if this is canvas terpenes but if this is a botanical terpene device i would give this a 9.5 i might even bump it up to a 9.75 if i find out that this is cannabis terps this gets a 10 out of 10 for bluedream this is incredible steezy has done a great job 100 see why this is such a respected brand and why people like this one of the top sellers um overall like i said you know 9.75 for me i appreciate you guys for all the love check out more

down hi this is lawrence and young helen hello aka who's the mouse well we're coming live today from my talking shop so please forgive me it will be because a customer's coming so today what we're doing is we've got two new pod kits in to review and we're gonna we're gonna review them both at the same time and compare them against each other one is called the voopoo argus air and hells you've got the infix by smok now the reason we're doing them both is because they're both uh they're both a 25 watt pod kit right they're both the same price they're both of them around that 25 pound mark yes they're both new boys on the block yes okay um and then what we'll do is obviously they've got differences between them yes there are a few similarities but we want to see and the idea is to see which one comes out the best out of the two because they both have the same price so which one which one would be more beneficial to you for your money what's going to be more up your street um so i'm going to have both of these sales for her to go through right which one should we start with i'm going to just start with this from the outside of the box with this one it's got a scratch me thing on the back which will have a code on it you have the verifying code on that on the inside of the box it says the color on the back which says red and black you've got the name you've got all the the name all over the top and then you've got the contents on the back and of course it says 25 watts direct line or mouth along on it because it's got an airflow control can you believe it hills airflow control shocking what have you got in your hands house um okay so mine has got details on the front hologram and scratch and sniff on the bottom there you go details details so that's the 700 so yep 700 miles is the 900 bar type c they're both types of type c as well yes so which one do you want to start with do you want to start with that yeah okay okay so what did you get in the box house i know i know why you gave me this one because you couldn't open it earlier so i've pre-opened it so that she can actually open it now it's stitched up so you get the usual uh roller key stuff in yeah and the scratchy thing there type-c charging cable your device and two pods so what are these pods so we've got uh two enfix dc naught point eight mouth to lung pods three mil in size right so these these we've got in special so they are the three mil the ones that you buy everywhere you'll have a silly little plastic thing in there so they i like the way they're quite see-through so you can see it's very very see-through this is good this is good so you're so you're going to see the juice right in the in the nips you gotta just turn the whole slice to one side in the top here you can see those dice now this one has a little screen on it so if you i wouldn't turn that on to your juice not that odd can i take the pot out then yeah and then you can explain the pod first so demanding right okay so peely thing off on the bottom gives you your magnets and what looks like a bit of airflow to be fair it's a nice it's quite a large hole and it's a fixed pod or you can change the poles this is the this is a fixed pod they are both fixed pods don't twist the bottom and the car comes up right if i twist the bottom of the coil comes out i'm going to be upset no it's wrong no no no good no no no it's fixed fixed pods okay fixed pods both the same so it's effective to giving you one pod and two coils i suppose with most kits you get so this here a little screen i tell you this thing's very very light so uh one two three four five doesn't it yeah okay now before you while you're doing that i'm going to put a nick salt in here yeah from a company called one and it's uh the ice mango from chemical one i'm going to pre-fill this so that it's all juiced and ready to go i'll do that bit before your house you do that yeah keeping you in work okay so you've got i don't know how you can see it's not the brightest thing in the world but you've got your wattage on there uh it will pick up the ohms you've got a battery indicator a voltage indicator and what looks to be a puff counter otherwise i don't know why it says opie in the corner so that's there so what do we do we did was it one two three we'll make your wattage flash and then you can change it by doing that and did we decide it round it oh one two three four five turned it off oh this is all going horribly wrong one two three okay so yeah it goes up if you keep your finger on it it will go to 25 it does not round robin and then if you leave it it will flash you flashy flash and then it will stop and that was it set so what power are you going to put this one on what is it supposed to be on does it tell us what is its best right there's nothing written on here have a look on the little pod box down there let's have a look you see there's a box with the new pods in it it's not telling point eight doesn't say information people oh 15 to 25 watts is what it says on there so you can take it up to the max 15 watts i've got it on there so okay let's one two three let's take it up to about 20. let it flash ping and 20 watts set right so that's ready to go this is a very very least and not very very very very similar interface to uh the nord two okay which works the same way one button one button it's very very light this device so you get your positive and negative down the bottom and you get a little tiny pin looking thing which is the draw activation because there's no buttons on it so what we're going to do is we're going to put it in a little click yeah the screen comes back on i noticed and we're going to leave that and we're going to go straight on to just notice the airflow hole there is there's a tiny little hole this side just about there and a tiny little hole there so we're going to assume then that it's going to draw in here and go up that hole in the bottom and how does it feel does it feel cheap well it is it is an ally it's very light now the dimensions on this are height what is the height uh 110.5 millimeters or 11 centimeters and the width is 21.5 21 or two just over two centimeters and the depth is 13 millimeters or just over a centimeter very very light right so we're going to leave that to soak and be ready now over to the voo poo so slightly slightly if anything falls out it's going to be terrible okay so you get two pods in this one one they give you uh a new coil for the pmp which funnily enough we can't find mentioned anywhere to be fair but it is this little baby with a blue ring around it the tm1 which runs at the top end capacity of this which is up to the 25 watts it's a bigger chunkier coil isn't it yes it's exactly the same as the vm1 in size looks incredibly similar if you can show them the hex sort of coil that's in there it's a hex mesh oh yes it does look very very well mesh it does look like a very well built coil you are never going to see your coiling plenty of cotton in a month or something plenty of airflow but yeah looks very nice interesting that's your pod that has the coil already fitted so the difference of these straight away is you can pop the coils in and pop the claws out yes that's a bonus this does both whereas that i mean this is an awfully large thing to throw away to be fair but not but you get both don't you get one you get one of it it's fixed yeah which is what homage on that one i think this is a through what does it say only tells me about the pod cartridge two mil doesn't tell me what homage is okay and then the other one is what you put the tm1 which is the 0.6 in okay so that's a bit interesting we've not got the foggiest idea what they've decided to put in 0.6 bubbly blood output is not 5 to 25 watts but i do believe this is going to be the more mouth to lung the wicking holes are a lot smaller it looks like a much smaller coil it would make sense than this and then the other one is your direct lung so you can do both with this so straight away it's better a little bit to start with okay so you've got a lot more alternatives on the coils so your device let's just put this little one in here that's got nothing in it for a minute so you can see fully what it looks like now dimensions on this are 95 millimeters high put it next to the other one else so that other one should be slightly taller yeah so 95 millimeters tall or not are nine and a half centimeters it's 31 millimeters wide and 30 and 19 millimeters thick okay so it's a little bit shorter but dampier yeah it's a bit chunkier so on the sides oh one minute so with the so basically with this one because you get the choice of different coils you can use either nyx salts or whatever in the pod so in our little interlude there this built-in one is actually a 0.8 ohm built-in coil it says that both pods work best with e-liquid of 50 vg or higher so both of them both okay according to that so really lovely it is a prettier looking mod you've got the uh leather e feel i mean it's clearly not leather but the leathery feel bit like you you get wraps wrapped around the drag with the embossed voopoo and the embossed argus one side so it's very very good where's the airflow so your airflow is here and here and is operated by spinning your pod either flat side round which will be more of a which is going to be tighter draw and then this one you can just see is like a little indent there you turn that round you're going to get more eye flow so it's it's the flip around bit uh like what you had on the vinci okay and that makes sense because that's good so they're sticking with what they know it would be nicer to have a slightly slide thing no easier yes i guess but you know not the end of the world you're probably going to decide that's the car we're using right so we're going to use that coil i'm going to use what flavour on this house candy razz candy razz it's brand new from skull labs it's came in today and it's very nice i know i've been vaping it very nice it's basically a cotton candy isn't it it's like a handy raspberry candy floss it's a blueberry raspberry candy floss yeah it's very nice right so this one one two people fave i had it turned on already and it's taken me into the thing right so let's power off a minute let's do this properly because i was out one thing i should point out hills this um candy res is a 70 30 juice it is yes being our skull abs it is a 70 30 jewels so one two three four five turns around so you get your voopoo it should tell you sort of what chip is in there and then we go to the screen so on the screen you've got your battery at the top you've got your wattage um then you've got your arms and then underneath is gonna be your puff counter now this one if we go one two three four five it will take us into our menu now in the menu is where you can lock the screen um by holding the button down for a couple of seconds and then it will come up with lock and it will lock it your power off your puff clear and then exit and so it's got a little bit more of a menu one click it will take you through so that's your exit so if i press and hold that down it will go back to there so to change the wattage on this one i believe is one two three right so one two three and your wattage will start flashing and then when you press it can go up and down so what we're setting this to what's this let's do the same twenty i suppose and we'll always take it up from there um i don't think it's your recommendation and it does round robin look at that i love it right so 15 so we're going to put it at 20. i think i'll read that the writing is too small i think it says 20 at 25 on them all right yes yeah so just leaving it then it will set the wattage at 20. so let's push fit it doesn't look like it matters where there's no particular way and just a little squish like that we'll put it there's your blue rays so where is this one you can see he's got a very clear doodad on the side this one has a black one but it's in exactly the same place so squishy isn't it weird i'm more excited to try this one the voo poo and he's got the gen chip again doesn't it yep jean chip in it standard seems to be in everything right this okay feels nice it's got a nice build quality to it compared to compared to the smok one it's different very different so you can see in the top of that the top of that pod is cloudy okay that's the big annoying massive great plastic bung that makes it two mils also before you you've got your positive and negative and you've got four magnets in there did you notice that yep i'm going to see that's going to click in there snap whatever okay there you go there you go my house one moment okay so we're all fully soaked in now i'm ready to go we're 20 watts and this is the pod that we put the coil in we're not doing the other one aren't we no and also it's been left in there both of these been left for about half an hour or so yes nicely soaked because we had a bit of a bit of a flurry of activity yeah right so we've put both these devices on 20 watts yep open 20 watts so this as well we discovered is puff activated and button yeah so you've got a little bit of both with this as well so who's going first right so show your one so that's at 20 watts and that one's at 20 watts right so um i'm going to puff this one you're going to puff that one and you've got it on the mat at the mouth to long side i have now so this one's just direct to lung uh mouth to lung puff operated good flavor but a little bit too airy for me i would prefer it a little bit tighter so it's very caliber nest this is quite airy i don't think it's going to be tight enough the flavor's okay and the 20 milligram mix salts give me a good throat here flavour's nice as well i can really taste our candy razz when's that candy razor on the system if you put it on next week yeah um then i'll order some from skull labs and get it delivered to um painting for the deliveries yeah okay right so that's on the mouth to lung one right yes that same draw right it feels like the same amount of restrictions which side does it have to be in then the back side so the with this then because it's got a little hole there and little hole there i got it the wrong way around because i thought you had to have it facing you but you don't you have to have it facing away whatever one you want so yeah the draw exactly is that the same right same restriction yeah and would you say the flavour was the same on the both of them uh brightness wise because i could really taste the the sweet blueberry on that yeah on the uh i think flavor oh i want to try where's the button as well on par see if there's a difference lift it up to be a little bit warmer yeah just a touch now the added bonus of this we can now turn this one around director yes whereas i can't do that i'm stuck flame is good i want to take the power up though right so one two three and then flashes breath is a nice bright flavor is it better higher i'm liking it like that i don't i don't think i could punch this up to twenty five i think i'm blowing it into 25 watts on the mouth to lung side okay without pushing the button remember this one has nyx salts in it so this one we're getting quite a whack off because and this has only got three milligrams yeah because it's got thick liquid in it all right so that's without the bun but i suggest it's about a little bit warmer because the drawer is as tight i think with an xl in it it's gonna it's gonna hit yeah so the winner by far is the voopoo air it does a lot more than the um fix same price between right now i mean around 25 pound the uh vucu air comes with more batteries at 900 where for the mpx is 700 the capacity in the pods is exactly the same these are fixed pods so you have to throw them on when they're burnt out with these ones they do both so they do the fixed pods but when that's burnt out you throw it away and that's more geared towards mouth to land and then you've got the also the other pods where you can take the coils out and throw them away and put different coils in there so it's got that as a bonus also it's got the buttons so you can either just draw activate it like the end fix or use the button on that as well so you've got the best of both worlds on there the finish on both of them the voopoo out is definitely far superior to the end fix on the finish it is a little bit smaller and fatter um so it would have to be whether you preferred that shape to whether or not you would go for the end fix over the voopoo out the voopoo as we got in yesterday we got this out to review it and while we were reviewing it we sold two and the simple reason we sold them was an easy answer there was a both of them were both were ladies and both of them vaped 70 30 juices now you can't re you could put a 70 30 juice in that but it's going to burn out quite fast it's not going to last long with the the um this one because this is takes up to the seven seventy thirty juices as well we put her their juices in that and worked just fine for them you're not gonna burn out the coils so you've got the best of both worlds you could use your nick salts your 50 50 juices and your 70 30s on that this one will be your you're not miserable you're not feeling all right sorry i know i was concentrating on looking at i was admiring it and were you really thinking it looked really cool [Laughter] i'm working at how maybe i upset it for a minute working out how i can have it without my husband noticing yes will it no right so so basically so you get the larger battery you've got interchangeable coils you've got two different types of pods on that you've got type c charging this one's type c charging 700 but a throwaway pod but not where you can replace the pods on this only draw activated both of them when using the mouth to lung give you the same draw same draw the difference with that one is you can flip it around and then you can direct along it and do your sub ohming and with your thicker finger juices but i tried it with the mouth to lung with the thick juicy works just as fine so the overall winner what do you want to give away oh by the way just in case i haven't messed it because i remember if i have i'll put the uh what color options you get for both of these um down below i think that's eight yes there's quite a few i can't remember how many there were with the end fix so that one i'll put those down there for you as well um so hell's what do you want to give away today you don't want to give that away because you want to keep it right we're giving that away sorry i'm giving that away now if she had mumbled too long i would have done my usual just giving it away like christina did like i did with her tank right so it's gonna be the end fix it's not that bad it's not bad at all it's because we're comparing it against something that's obviously a lot more superior to the end fix but it's not a bad vape all right so i'm going to give this away all you've got to do is give us a like on our facebook if you haven't subscribed subscribe give us a like on this page and all you've got to do is say i would like the end fix as simple as that in about two three weeks or so i'll choose the winner converse with you find

reviewing this schmuck novo oh no deviated septum another refillable pod system don't you worry the vapor guys have told me that this is a cloud chuckers so we are gonna find out for ourselves I've got the red version but it comes in a total of nine different colors this is the red Cobra green cobra rainbow Cobra pink Cobra the black Cobra royal blue Cobra white Cobra in prison blue Cobra there's also a purple Cobra but it's slithered its way out of here and we have no idea where it is I'm gonna be unboxing the red Cobra each box contains one Nova device a USB charging cable - not one but two paws which is awesome and a user manual let's get to it sounds like it's a box is sad it must be the silica pack that keeps everything dry inside the box Moisture is Electronics nemesis let's have a look inside here's the silica pact user manual very pretty yes two pods score very nice presentation here I'm really digging on the surface I like the Cobra look let's pull it out mmm it's got a nice little film protect the finish make sure it's nice and shiny it's a good little size looks like it fits perfectly in the palm ah this is where you charge it put the USB cable right in there and this is your indicator light when you are charging this or when you're hitting it you will see this light up right over here no other no other holes nothing else and this is where the pod goes in okay USB cable very long very long USB cable and two pods here's the pod up close this is how you fill it just by pulling this little tab back these are the elements right here and they just align with the elements inside the pod just fits right in there nice and snug stays in there it doesn't it doesn't fall out that's nice mm-hmm fancy red fancy red alright let's put some juice in there very important note this device is intended for juice that is 50/50 PG VG so for the majority part that's gonna be salt Knicks anything that's gonna be 50/50 PG VG you can go ahead and use with this device I'm gonna be putting in Red's apple juice which is a 50/50 PG VG salt nicotine based a juice apple watermelon so the idea here is to pull this little tab back to put the juice inside let me try to do that with my finger it's really hard to get in there I'm a solution mmm perfect a paperclip does just right the important thing here is to open it from this side out not from this side but from here from the side closer to the element it's gonna prop it open with a paperclip and then it just comes right out boom open when you fill the pot it's a good idea to kind of have it tilted to the side like this that way you maximize the amount of juice you can get in I'm just gonna put that right in and squeeze juice more please more oh yeah that looks pretty full as you can see there there's a little hole right here right between the elements and I can just see maybe the juice coming out when I install this into the pod there's no membrane protection there just a straight hole but I'm assuming that's for airflow this is the time when I kinda have to let it sit for about five minutes so the cotton is nice and saturated with the juice I'm gonna take it out let it sit right side up the battery Park is 400 milli amp battery some packages will say and on their website it's indicated it's 450 milliamp battery but that is actually not correct it is 400 million battery once it's dead it takes about one full hour for you to get it fully charged up all right it's been long enough let's try this out as always there's two ways to hit this there's the month to long hit which is very similar to a cigarette and then there's the direct to lung hit which I'm a fan of I'm gonna start the mouth to lung it's a draw activated device you don't have to press any buttons to hit it you just inhale it's surprising how easy it is to take a hit it's just really really smooth just barely barely drawn it and it starts working I like the size and the fact that it has no buttons means I can just slip it into a pocket without worrying another thing I see is there's absolutely no way to tell how much juice you have in the pod you literally have to take the thing out just to make sure you're still juiced up all right it's direct along hit time this is where it's supposed to believe it really shines holy clouds man the forecast is cloudy that's the way we like it whoo nicotine buzz this thing is awesome for flavor I'm really liking the juice profile here very tasty Apple watermelon there's really not a whole lot to go over here it's a really simple device and that is what makes it so good you just hit it when you need to and put it away the other thing I really like about this is it has passive charging which means that you can vape and charge at the same time the only thing is probably gonna be a little hard with the super long charging cable that's included and for the last proverbial hit and we're out all right I'm deviated septum and you've been watching clouds theorem pick this up and tell me your thoughts 10% off discount code in the description down below as always go ahead and take advantage we'll see you in the next one take it easy", "8gLu6aKZtmE": "[Music] damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel so this is another three chive delta eight vape cartridge review the last one that i did did so well that i just well i had to do another one if i release a video and it gets 800 hits or 800 views in a for like a week oh yeah i'm definitely doing another video so the one that i got is blue dream and it's a one milliliter container brand new sealed and that's how i like it and you can see right there it contains 95 percent eight delta eight th oil and then five percent of [ __ ] which you know whatever i guess you gotta i guess it can't be a hundred percent or it would probably just knock you on your ass and stuff uh the directions remove the silicone cover and screw into the battery do not over tighten take one puff and wait 20 minutes wow wait 20 minutes um usage is between one and two puffs let's see here i'm trying to focus it for you guys i can't focus it whatever uh says do not operate any machinery while using this product do not use if pregnant nursing or under the age of 21 this may cause a positive drug test well no [ __ ] oh my god uh let's see here if you need more typical usage it's one or two puffs do not operate wait a minute where's that one part at wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more oh okay 5 10 battery 100 percent hint driving contains 0.3 is that a 9 thc batch 6 out of 15 2021 batch id three chives fishery blah blah blah blah all right blue dream sweet so i have a couple other ones over here these are the fx these are delta eight fx cartridges um and i designed this little thing to keep them in the upright for me because sometimes i'll run out and these right here will be enough to get you by for a few days especially if you leave them in the upright these are this was like orange crush and like granddaddy purple if i remember correctly i didn't really care um for the granddaddy purple i do want to say one thing though there is a big difference between the ethics cartridge and the delta eight cartridges i feel like the delta eight cartridges these are put together better they just seem to be i don't know i don't have any leakage they hardly ever clog they just seem to be a better cartridge than the fx the fx are also a lot cheaper too these are like 30 something dollars and these are like 60 something dollars okay now the effects of this all right let's say you're sitting on the couch smoking a blunt there you go you're going to get high but this is great because you can be out public you could be in a mall walking around hitting this and people are just going to think that you're vaping and that's the beautiful part about it and it delivers i mean just one one good hit delivers like a serious bond grip i mean it's depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke it can get you really really really really really high um like for instance i got friends that do not smoke like me i consider myself to be a pothead meaning that i i blaze it up every day we smoke it down okay that's just me i've been like that for 20 years um but we're not talking about me this i hit it one time and i'm like whoo all right if i get somebody that doesn't smoke like me and they hit it they gotta sit down and sometimes they're out for the count like uh like i actually had one friend hit it and it ruined her whole night she felt like [ __ ] it just messed her up and then i had another buddy uh i mean it put his ass on the couch so i guess the effects is just different depending on who you are and how much you smoke but let me tell you what it's definitely worth it it's discreet nobody knows that you have it plus there's no smell like you blaze that [ __ ] up man you hit it pow pow pow you get a big old dragon's breath cloud and it don't smell like weed it's awesome you can take it to work that's the best part about it man is that there's no paraphernalia there's no weed nobody knows you have it on you the only way somebody's gonna know you have it is if they physically see it no smells man i i've been pulled over by the police and i had this on me he didn't even ask me not clean as a whistle goodbye give me my ticket leave awesome these things definitely have their benefits definitely and if you're going to have this you got to have a 510 battery okay this is an e-leaf very simple 510 battery plugs into the bottom i don't know an hour charge you're good to go all you do is you hold the button wait for it to get to about there and then you start hitting it hit it slow you're not trying to rip on it you're just trying to take a slow even deep breath and even that might be too much for you three child blue dream now one thing i did like about it was all they had so many selections for these and then they told you about what they did like this is a sativa brand um this is supposed to give you clarity um it's not supposed to make you foggy it's supposed to give you energy and make you awake and whatever whatever whatever like it claims what it is it's a um a sativa synthetic it's a blend of you know indica and this brand i mean like it tells you what they are and what they're mixed with their strands and everything so you really can't go wrong so it's not like you don't know what you're buying you know what i mean sorry if there's a little bit of an echo i'm trying to do this privately this is illegal in my state you know so you really don't want to be advertising what you're doing that's the other thing like a cop a cop knows what this is because this does not look like a typical vape that's the other thing that you need to be aware of this is very identifiable if they're a cop and they deal with this [ __ ] they've seen this before they will know exactly what you have in your hand so be aware of that uh your average person not so much you know i mean you go out for a cigarette break you hit it once or twice nobody's going to even say it or even notice it but be careful because police they they probably will know what the hell that is i mean because all vape cartridges come the same basically the same look you know all right we're actually starting to get to the meat and potatoes oh come on [ __ ] come on out now here's another thing i like is that they come with these uh get out damn it [ __ ] it's pressure treated uh is that they come with these plastic things right to keep them covered now when i transport mine for instance see like these these even have it on them when i transport them because sometimes i'll take this with me and then i'll take another flavor with me it's very important that you keep that cap on there all right because if you don't keep that cap on there lint and trash and garbage and other things that are in your pocket will get into these little holes and ports and you don't want that because that's going to mess everything up for you so it's very important that you keep these little plastic covers and if you want to even keep the mouthpiece because you know see like this mouthpiece see all the stuff that's in there that's from it being in my pocket like lint and trash and other things get up inside of that you know what i mean yeah you don't want that that's bad so definitely keep your plastic covers man you got to keep those and try to store it upright because if you laying it down you can take a good chance of it leaking and it'll this [ __ ] takes forever it's like molasses to go back in the upright um but let's let's plug it in and check it out not only that check out the quality this is the end cap that came off of the uh the new delta eight cartridge see it see how thick it is all right and then this is the end cap that comes now i ain't trying to knock the the fx vapes i'm just trying to justify the 30 something dollars more that they want for the vape you know [Music] all right and then here's theirs see what i'm saying see the difference look at the difference in the caps big difference this one's nice and meaty and this one's real thin and kind of cheesy looking but uh you know i guess that's part of the difference is that you get better coverage with it also when i bought these these just come in like kind of like this thing here uh but it doesn't have anything covering the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is wide open so but with these you get a mouthpiece covered which is nice because like i said i transport these in my pocket and stuff so yeah you know what that um this this right here it kind of it kind of sneaks up on you god damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high yeah one hit y'all one hit damn yeah see i can go in there right now smoke a few bowls that [ __ ] won't get me like how i am right now good god oh [ __ ] all right yes um forgot what i was saying yep don't remember now okay so back to what i don't remember i was talking about y'all need to get this i don't know what else to tell y'all three chive delta eight vapes leave me a comment subscribe to my channel check out my other videos i build computers and do all kinds of custom water cooling and technology stuff so you all need to come and check that out check out my channel i appreciate y'all for watching", "rlr2Yxg74h8": "okay so now we've filled up the point eight Miller a m'q rod with ceramic tib-fib cartridge we have it attached to one of our variable push-button vape pens that we sell off our website at cheapest vape supplies calm so we're gonna test this out right now and do a couple puffs and see how it works out mm good cloud vapor very clean I could definitely notice it's very clean tasting much cleaner than any metal rod cartridge out there obviously because ceramic is very clean I like this cartridge it's pretty good I'll have to do some will have to do some further tests on it too to see how it performs in the long run but overall I like the taste and I do like the cloud vapor very much so this is a good cartridge we're going to carry these on our website from here on out and cheap is very surprising I count thank you", "O0ZUeFUmM7E": "shut up and sit down [Applause] some of you for some reason actually like me which is weird well we thought nobody liked it that's what i thought was well that's why i sent me down here to film with so i've had to drive all the way here yeah to do a review that'd be worth it yeah probably should that'd be worth it yeah i'll try yeah that's right so what we're doing today is a review of the airmod 60 by one vape it's an aio yeah all in one gizmo knows more about this device than i because we only sent them down here to young gizmos and he's the one who's trialing them out in the shop to see how they are um so i said we must do a review of it and see what i think all right so these are humming around that 30 to 50 50-ish some of the prices are a little bit weird yeah so depending on where you get them from um i quite like the look of these things yeah but that's why i'm hoping it's quite good he already knows but he's gonna keep his mouth shut i'm gonna stay quiet for now yeah and they come in seven colors that i'm gonna put right down there for you so they've got seven different finishes on them uh how you been finding down there down here yeah it's lovely because we literally set him down here he's got an apartment just chucked me out they just chucked me out the toilet completely just just got rid of me just gave me the finger and told me to start off literally gave you the fingers literally with your finger and said go i don't want you anymore i don't know what can you do what can you do right so we're not going to do any of this go down below thing no we're going to do the opening up the box and showing you this that in the other right so i'm going to hand this out with young gizmo because you haven't heard from him for bloody ages so inside of the box you are first presented with the device itself is a little bit of a fingerprint magnet that is the one thing i will say about it already because it's very very short the finishes look like they're like that so you're first presented with the mod itself and the pod with a coil pre-installed there are three available coils for the pod for this one and they are dead easy to take in and out they are just a push and pull fit i am preferring this most of them are starting to go that way now with you with your drag x's and all the vaporizers that's not very small not a very small coil at all it's it is quite a hefty coil so you've got two ports that side you've got two ports that side one port right so this is the coil for the drag just to give you an idea on comparison all right so if you put that one next to that look it's chunky it is chunkier it's a lot thinner um plenty of cotton holes around there you know it's almost like you've taken that one you've put it in a press and just squished it down yeah so it's it's basically been squished in half and also notice it's got quite a lot of cotton around there it has got a lot of cotton there's also it's a double coil inside so this is a dual jewel mesh or i think they're just normal i think they're just normal coils it's a mesh is it yeah i'm not down there oh no yeah that wasn't it that is a mesh yeah so that's the measure that's the naught point so that's the 0.2 which is your uh your higher wattage ones that's they're saying 35 to 50 on the coil they are for some reason online saying between five and sixty um so i would stick between that 35 and 50 range more often not rather than whacking it all the way up to 60. so comfortable with your 70 30 juices and you're comfortable with nick's salt comfortable both it's it's it's part of this sort of wave of hybrid pod systems that can do both different types of juice so it's just joining that sort of crowd it's one vape which is good essentially it's good um and that was the key long as they don't turn into a leaking beast you're all right yeah exactly and most of those devices are brilliant i mean i use the drag x i use the boost because they're nice they're easy to see down there i don't know if this is going to play ball with me this zoom in at the moment i don't think it will we've got um gremlins in the house gremlins get it look it's in the house gizmo all right you can't i'm not going to sing because it's not going to let me zoom in no it's not going to do it so you can't really see that there's a mesh okay it's a white it's a wide field measure as well so it's got plenty of gaps in between it nice space in it as well it is a two mil pod as standard um i think they will be releasing more than likely they're not like a three point seven or a four or something like everyone else has done with these devices the device itself in fitting with the pod is really sort of a wide device but it's also very very thin so it's exactly 13 millimeters across or i think it was 12.9 yeah it's uh 53 millimeters wide and then 98 high and i think that includes the pod as well when they do that okay yes yep it does add a little bit of high when you do put the pod on that as well i would have liked that when i was used to wear suits yeah it's the sort of thing that can fit very well nicely in there or a shirt pocket or it's got a nice quality weight to it i mean if you've got a big enough wallet i suppose you could even go in your wallet it actually feels uh quality underneath it's got a nice good it's got a good weight too what size battery is that uh it's a 1500 so it's not any battery not gigantic but it's got enough and if you were vaping that 50 watts on a 1500 that'll do you most of the day if not all day probably not all of the day i wouldn't say depends on how heavy uh available for me for me and you it probably wouldn't do us all day no for me certainly it wouldn't do all day do they give you like the little lanyard thing with it as well they do yes um and it's a nightmare so they've given you one of these little the little notches right there yeah so you can put something in it's an actual nightmare to try and find it so once it's in it's in time the other day it was okay carry on my mom it was ten minutes of swearing at the device and swearing at the lanyard it was good fun um with this one the operation of it is fairly simple it's pretty much the same as every other device goes now it's one two three four five it will turn itself on you get your little welcome message and then it will turn on there on your display you've got your wattage you've got your uh voltage strangely enough for some reason that included a voltage okay on there not quite sure why and it doesn't swap over to voltage you know it never swaps over okay um so i don't know quite why they put volts on there and they've also got your own reader and your battery level as well again if it's going to focus you could just not get a photo just about to see it um your wattage i'll see how big that screen is it's oh it is definitely tiny but clear it's clear screen it's a very very clear it's a very bright screen as well but it is it is a diddy little screen um so i'd probably clash this as a more discreet device it's not like some other drag where you've got this quite sort of vibrant colorful screen it's it is a do you want to call it a gentleman's vape i suppose a gentleman or ladies and gentlemen ladies it comes over like a for it's funny thing is for its price um it's coming over like like um like a nice quality device like like an upper class kind of device yeah such right so just before you carry on you've got the positive and negative pin there and you've got that little black thing right there where my finger is inside is the sensor because it's puff operated and button operated right which links up to if you can just about make it out with my finger and thumb although there's a little hole that's where the sensor will go into the pod um so you can use the draw activated method as well nice as well no exactly um you have got a an airflow control now it's very very small and i don't know if it made much of a difference okay um for me personally it was a little bit weird um see if you can actually see where that actually activates so it actually physically makes a hole in the side of the device okay so if you look down the side of it it actually makes a hole in the bottom okay so that's it now like i said when i tried it i didn't notice that much of a difference um between the two all right so that's difficult to say um apart from that yeah it's relatively standard operation you want to drop them down just corresponds to these two buttons here and you can lock off your wattage by holding both down for it's about three seconds a little bit longer on this device so it's one two three yeah three seconds and then it locks and then it unlocks that way as well so that's what i would use because if it is it is obviously a pocket device right absolutely so you would want to lock that and yeah yeah and yeah the puff and the bat and the fiber is still going to work yeah you're just going to lock the watches so i like that makes it a lot easier definitely in the rest of the box you get your spare coil this is the 0.5 coil um now they've said with the coils you get the 0.2 and the 0.5 they're the direct along coils then you also got a naught point eight which isn't included in the box that's what they're saying is their mouth to long coil um so you've got the three and that's a quadruple isn't it quadratic that's a quadratic point five the naught point five and not point eight are quadruples and they're not point double did we get them in here did they we did get some of the coils i'm just wondering if we've got one just to see how tight the uh we've got how tight the hole is but from looking at the pictures it doesn't look to be that much different all right okay and the rest of them so that's it right this is pretty much it it doesn't make no difference if you push the up and fire back on anything like that doesn't know anything nothing there okay no other settings no part there that shiny silver bit is the magnet that holds it in i just want to see a stronger magnet that is not too bad a magnet it's not bad at all it's not the best one but not the worst but it's not the worst i mean it's doing the job yeah stay here ain't going nowhere no the pod is a dark tinted yeah i'm hating that so much so this part here where my thumb is this part here you can see you can me i can see through that right i don't know if you're going to be able yeah i don't think you can see through that at all so you're supposed to be able to see your juice level here um um people are starting to go down that road of a clearer pot aren't they because that's the whole point you don't want to pull it out to see what you've got yeah you're trying struggling to see what you've got in it exactly yeah there's a bang of some kind or fricking that is the bank i think that might be the bung in there so there's no no there's no way of getting that out of that so i would imagine the us version is the non-tpd version of this just has no that whole thing there is like a dead set uh lump plastic right there so i'd imagine the non-tbt version has got that out and therefore that would open this up to make this about a four mil pod i would have thought yeah about yeah i would imagine that that'll be about four and a half probably yeah okay right so rest of the box yep you've got your lanyard in there in the bottom there like i said it is a bit of a pain to get through um because you have to sort of push it in and then try and pull it out from the other side as well so it took me about 10 minutes and a lot of swearing um you've got your user manual in the bottom here there's not really too much in here it is quite a simplistic one so it's all pictures and that sort of thing because it's not like an in-depth menu or anything in there there's not really much there's not really much to go and it's pretty much a puff and go it pretty much is yeah it's more or less just a part of the garage does it select a when you put the coil in no it doesn't select a bit it doesn't auto select my knowledge no okay when i put it in i have to turn it on manually and then you've just got your usb type-c charging cable and this apparently takes one hour to fully charge yes so it must be like a 1.4 it must be at 1.5 yeah um but still always go for the one-end plug because it's always just worth it yeah right right so we must do a comparison so if you pull out the drag and vinci we've got the dragon give you an idea of size on these um obviously beats them on on the width yeah absolutely yeah deadly on the width obviously it's going to be a lot wider than the other ones but height wise gives you an idea it's about something like that it's not it's not too much far off with their pods on i think if we had the normal vinci it would probably be about the same size as a normal sort of vinci yeah how much i like it i mean so so far it's winning i think it's the right size um which may be a bit of a controversial statement but i think if it was any bigger it would be cumbersome so would you agree then that because you get two direct lung cause yes and not the mouth to lung one in the box which really if they were really gonna go all out they should have included all three they should have done um i'm assuming it's gonna be more tools direct to lung yeah i think it probably is going to be more of a direct to lung um device this one i think mouth to lung and i think you'll notice with the draw um when you have a draw you'll see what i mean but i think it is going to be more of a direct long kind of device you've pre-filled one right i've pre-filled a pod this is one i prepared earlier um we've got a six milligram vape simply apple and mango okay increasingly growing on me right i started off with the raspberry doughnut i was chugging that for about three weeks straight um and i started trying a few of the different ones and yeah a couple of mangoes used to be working for so what are you going to do this one i'm going to do it at 45. um just so it's sitting within the the parameters is what the coil says because i'm not too sure about them saying on the website it can go up to 60 i'd rather stick with what the coil says all right well i'm personally i'm ex i'm expecting a little whiff of a vape and it's always going to ask you a new coil it auto sets itself after a while anyways you don't want to press yes or no or anything like that um and like we said you can draw it normally or you can just press the button okay both oh you're getting some vapor out of it it's not a vapor it hits like a train that was the one thing i noticed with a six milligram and especially um which i use more often than not in the boots this one hits like an absolute trait um so if you're looking for a good throw over here this one will definitely deliver that all right i want to give it a go there right so that's with the airflow restricted at the moment wiping off your germs wiping off my germs right all my corn more germs racists guys he's discriminating against cornish people do you know what i was not expecting to hit that well no like i say it hits it hits like a freight train and loads of flavour yeah ridiculous amounts of flavor right so now i'm going to open it up see if that makes a difference maybe not so much on the airiness but it felt like it lifted the flavor up a tiny bit but the the airflow open or closed felt pretty much the same to me i'm impressed with that flavor yeah but the reason i think it's not going to be a mouthful one device and if you agree with this that that draw is very very too loose you can't i struggle to do them after long on that because of how loose that draws it's just too loose it's difficult now that's quite warm for me 45. i'm going to bring that just down to 40. do you know what that's not bad it's about what i thought it was going to be i i have to say when you when you sent them here um when did they get here it was like tuesday or something yeah i think and i i i took them out of the box i sat down at the end with it and i had a little play around with it for half an hour um i took the first drag out of it and it actually made me cough is how hard it hit me because i was not expecting the level of power i'm not never seen any given pushing the button or not it makes no difference neither am i so it's preference i think it is personal preference but i think like i said i think if you were true mouth to lunga you would struggle with that one you can't because it is it's very very way too now whether the 0.8 coil is makes any any difference with that whatsoever it might do it might not um it's impossible to say for us because we haven't got one here um so the 0.8 coil might be slightly more restricted on the inside of the actual coil itself so that might make a difference but it's impossible to say that is an enjoyable vape yeah it is it's nice i like it that is now to me the negative is it's a fingerprint magnet yeah massive massive i don't know if you're picking all these little marks up wherever there is it's very shiny it's fingerprinty right it's it's magnetic yeah even though this isn't even a chrome is it's a government it's a gunmetal around the outside but it is the same on all of them it's this nice sort of gun metally that is loads of floating loads of flavor so what what juice you put in there that's a 50 50 apple mango from vape template that is surprising yeah i didn't think you could get that much flavor it doesn't come through and all the other devices i've got in here with that with that exact same juicing exact same milligram it doesn't hit anywhere near as well as that doesn't have anywhere near as good flavor as that now um 70 30 juice have you tried a 70 30 i haven't tried one in here yet no okay but it is marketed you can 70 30. you can sort of see the juice flour just about yeah and it makes no difference whether that's in or out no so it looks like it fills up that bit there yeah and then if you're going to see that little bubble i don't know if you're going to pick up on that so you get it here you see the bubbles coming up so it gets juice in there and juice in here so it's obviously traveling and traveling along and then settling in here so it doesn't really make you so your juice flow well because of that you've got to let that settle down yeah you have so you're not going to get a true reading unless you're filling yeah the filling is a little bit of a downside on it that's not the best designed pod um in terms of its filling it would have been a lot better if they put the filling port much closer to the coil and that way you're wetting the coil then filling up the rest of the tank from there might be asking you if it's new coil no it's just going to check out moses for some reason by taking it out and looking at it yeah there you go it's fixing it what was it just not in there probably in there properly nope nope he's broken it come on i couldn't have damaged that car i just took it out and looked at it so the airflow you've got hitting the coil here you've got um in the plastic there you've got a hole here at the front and a hole here at the back and then when that's all enclosed here the only way the air can travel is through that via that sensor there and through it's traveling down there and through here so it's obviously got a little bit little gaps here yeah all right let's try that again it might be similar to the sort of v-stick where it actually comes through the usb port possibly it's working again that's where a lot of them seem to go these things actually go through the usb port there's usually a bit of a gap around that i quite like it yeah i liked it right um i'll be getting these into all my shops i'm actually quite impressed with that and it is a quality feeling device yes it's got a nice weight it's got a nice feel it's not too small where it's going to be very easy to lose it's not too big it's cumbersome it fits nicely in a jean pocket or a shirt pocket or anything like that jacket pocket blazer pocket

from demand vape we're gonna take a look at the Orion cue from Las Vegas is is a more affordable version of the DNA Orion the only difference is that it's not going to use the DNA chip now it's still going to have a stainless steel frame and it's still gonna have a 2 milliliter pod but the chip is different biggest difference that you're going to notice aesthetically from it is there's not going to be a function button on the front of it here and the USB port is exposed there is also a light on the cue and all that's gonna tell you is your battery so if it's below 17% that light will be red if it's in between 17 and 64 percent that way it'll be purple and if it's above 64 percent that way it'll be like a teal ish or a whitish blue type of color you have a firing button still five clicks will lock this device and five clicks will unlock this device and then everything else is basically the same as the DNA version you have the latch here that's how you get your pod out simply pull it down and your pod will snap out now you can't just simply push this pod back in you actually have to pull the latch down and then push it back in and now this pod isn't coming out you can drop it throw it across the room whatever you want to do with it this pod is not going to come out easily about the device 950 mAh battery and then about the pod it has top fill you don't have to take your pod out to fill it it does have adjustable airflow right below the drip tip here that you can put to half open three-quarters of the way closed however you like your airflow and this pod also is going to be new with the Orion Q it's a 1.0 ohm resistance pod which is going to give you longer battery life than the DNA version what you the 0.25 and the point 5 ohm pods the flavor is still excellent and the vapor production is still pretty big off of this device let me take a rip and show you and yes the QED still does come with the lanyard that the DNA version did come with so I don't actually have the colors for the QED to show you but it will come this this one here is actually a Q this is a stainless steel version of it and it does have this black carbon fiber now these ones here are DNA versions but the Q will still have this gold frame but this part here will be carbon fiber you're still gonna be able to get a blue frame with carbon fiber or a black frame with carbon fiber if you're

having a very good MLK Day I hope you guys are taking his lessons and taking Legend's work into account in your you're taking moments out of your day to think of the impact that he's had upon society so I just wanted to say that before we started the episode but like I've been saying a lot of I'm going to my free time is going to dwindle next to nothing you know starting this week and so I want to get a couple of great episodes out of the way before before that all happens you know I'm on borrowed time right now I mean I'm still going to be continuing to do episodes because I love doing this podcast but like I said there's going to be other you know adult priorities I'm gonna have to worry about you know money's tight so I'm gonna have to do some hustling you know it's there's gonna be a lot of different things that are gonna happen starting this week and you know the amount of episodes that I can do and the amount that you're used to getting in a month is going to go down until I knew what until I know how things are gonna shake out you know I'm not tapping out of canvas podcasting but I do know that you know I have other bills and other things to take care of and you know a game plan will be needed to take care of those things and you know that's gonna include me doing less episodes until I know that there was those higher priority things are taken care of but but yeah I mean so let's do this episode so again I can be fun on these various platforms such as iTunes pocket casts or pocket yeah I think pocket cast that's the thing a cashbox pod beam radio public stitcher tune in radio i heart radio and other platforms like it and podcast static which a lot of people seem to like listening to this podcast through that so i'll plug that podcast attic is another place you can check out but here's what we're gonna do we're going to talk about how to score hemp and CBD in the UK and in other European countries cuz but wanting to do a UK episode about CBD because I kind I'm somewhat familiar with the situation where you know the UK is one of the places is the place where the folks of GW Pharmaceuticals is located and they've created epidemics for epilepsy people but being as UK has their NHS their home office has approved it as a drug but it is my understanding that you know you have to hold your own nuts or that you're on your own and buying it compared to other medicines and the NHS that they don't cover it's all it's the only it was one of the only prescriptions that the NHS doesn't cover and it's upwards of thirty thousand dollars a month or thirty thousand pounds or whatever the conversion ring it is and average gains and average goes like this podcast is for can't afford that so thankfully there are a lot of hemp vendors that ship to the UK into a lot of Europe so for so to those European areas that don't have medical or whatever this could be a useful of episode but I'm gearing this a lot towards UK people because I know but I know a bit more about that situation and the hemp she has more seems to have a bit more stuff geared towards UK customers or whatever so I'm gonna just go through I'm just gonna once over some of these hemp sheet European and UK vendors so the first one is 420 light and they don't have lab reports and they don't have a terpene profile and this is the hem sheet there okay so let me go to the it would help if I actually went to the next screen so I'm gonna do that anywho all right so now we're at that screen so this is the hem sheet comm if you don't know who they are they're a lot they're their website were be talk about or their website were the a database some of the best hemp vendors they give you coupon codes discounts all sorts of stuff it's updated on a daily basis the you know these are vendors around the US and in Europe and UK they're a very good website they have a discourage server with a lot of helpful folks which I recommend you should follow them Twitter Instagram and Facebook so today we're gonna look at the hemp tree we're gonna look at UK and European then or EU vendors so the first one is 420 light 420 light as you could see through the spreadsheet and through the screen they don't have lab reports so I'm just again I'm just once overing these websites so you knew that they exist so you're not having to give the Home Office or whatever 30 thousand bucks a month of your cash your hard-earned cash you can make your own CBD so look at briefly what they've got this is the price is five five pounds sterling I don't I don't know I don't know if that's considered good in the UK or whatever normally CBD ounces in the states and our US vendors think it's like maybe seven in seven a gram or so and then you can get some ounces for forty to seventy dollars appending on when sales happen and you can get trim you can get trim ounces for even less than that I've gotten I've gotten to trim ounces for like 20 I think 25 dollars after shipping when would one sale from apical greens they're on they're on the hab sheet and then in the States but um again I don't know I again I'm not from the UK I'm not from the EU I don't know I don't know if five pound sterling is considered a good price so I get I'm not the person to ask but they have some tea if you're if that's kind if that's your thing never tried it but I've been wanting to you got the tinctures if you don't want to combust I'm guessing ravit carts know what this is CBD infusion what the sir so yeah it's just tea I guess so yeah they have lots of usuals I guess delivery see what were they deliver to okay we use Royal Mail so this is UK orders over 75 pound sterling I think I'd again I'm not from Europe I'm Shirin my ignorance here so orders over 75 pounds sterling or sent free of charge we have a flat rate of three dollars and ninety five pounds for all orders all right again so that's 420 light again they don't got lab works you might wanna keep you might want to keep that in mind this is the next website a chaat day CBD and Ling I think that's maybe French as dot F Aria French my ignorance is showing a good I'm not good at speaking a lot of languages I took I took Spanish from honest a sophomore year of high school so from 15 and then I had to take better take a couple semesters in college think I want to say yeah I take four semesters and I failed my last one I had to retake that but I had to take so let's say five semesters so from 20 from 15 years old about 22 and I still suck in my I still suck at Spanish you don't want to hear me speaking Spanish like I'm not gonna torture my Spanish I'm not gonna torture my Colombian and South American and Central American listeners by trying that like it's just not gonna put them through that all right but let's continue so this is I think this is maybe a French vendor whatever 22 us other place was just doing five per per five pound sterling per gram so seven yeah this place looks on the expensive side Sain looks mad expense this so it says France English of the displaced ships about I believe France and England its other language you I'm that RA so this is in Switzerland you the ship so they're out of Switzerland all right so we were done with that you okay so this is the next one CBD bud shop again no lab works no terpene profile Keef at CBD flowers so nine so this looks more expensive than the other place we look bad varieties do look good guessing this is like nine pound sterling per gram wheels you to vape odds yes so the UK base if you're if you're in the UK this is the place you can also check out x8 tenants sent 10% off your first order when you sign up the newsletter selves as a pop-up I just gotten dude CBD elites who my la-dee-da Great Britain pound Oh US dollars so I'm guessing they ship to u.s. Canada in in I am they are I don't know if that's like the mean like that AUD Australian okay so let's see where these ship cuz I know in Australia like they're very sort of like they have very strict laws and getting things getting CBD vendors to ship to you in Australia is a struggle and their medical marijuana is still very very expensive see let's see if they ship to Australia because they're putting AUD in their thing we they do awesome you shipping policy okay so this is their their UK vendor free free UK shipping in all the orders see what they've got edible and go to like the top top navigation you also praise you okay so they do have some lab lab report even free UK shipping and then you can contact them so you can check if these ship to the if they ship to Australia sick and tired of paying your dispensary prices like many of us are so let's go to the next one CBD hemp king these are just extracts you Poland you I knew that translate because like able to know what's going on otherwise op capsule automatic TBD in CVD a off your first I don't know what these prices are ZT again I'll know that's good or not sails you you either polish vendor handing either polish vendor who not these prices free shipping two products over 50 years okay you you so the major methods are accepted you are you sending your products abroad you can buy our products and from our shop wherever you are products are shipped to all countries of the world so again if you're in Australia I'm going to put this I'm gonna put this vendor in the show notes because I know people I know Australians are being priced gouge if they can get some CBD shipped to them instead of having to go to these dispensaries to buy the oil or to buy the flower I can go a long way so I'm going to I'm gonna put a hemp king in the shownotes you all right so this is the next place you would they have I'm and welcoming y'all and depth so trim so trim they're selling for eight bucks so one gram is about ten thirteen and this this kiss CVV alright and so this is a good this is a good vendor looks like looks like another UK vendor see shipping info okay all all I ate all items ordered within the UK are shipped through Royal Mail items order from Europe our descent okay so this can be shipped through a lot of Europe which is great you're gonna have to wait a lot longer and then from around the world it will ship to you I'll try to list this - we'll see the next one is CBD M shop online all right so this is CBT shop online this is out of UK they got lots of they got eliquid and he pens with those I seem to ran out Souls drinks topical real mail [Music] you that's why you need them they'll ship free 450 euros or 50 pounds or more I don't with the symbols here you bank transfer Bitcoin isolate hardware terpenes and if you need isolate because you get drug tested this know here you can get it get a mouth hearts desire CVT ISIL distillate or worse I'm guessing dab Riggs okay so vape pen so you can make your own okay terpenes site owner is a massive indica fan as am I take that delivery you all right shimmy over to this one CBD null UK vendor they have 10% off with signing on to their newsletter so we're Germany flags UK flags that's that's that's Italy right yeah and I think that's Italy that's Italy that's France Spain couple of countries that they'll ship to Europe I saw the ad flower oil see oh this is guessing these are okay five grams 420 all right okay so this one you can expect so five grams for 20 euros yeah that looks like euros 18 euros 14 euros this looks like a pretty good bender so 25 grams so almost e-excuse me almost a almost ounce for 18 18 euros that's pretty good and they'll give you 10% off just for signing on beep set big cards 15 years they got batteries but illiquid and you can make your own e-liquid pretty lever botanicals so I like CBD know a lot what I saw very very cheap I'm flower um we saw some we saw sort of like their sale batch 25 grams for just 20 euros so they're definitely a very very top-notch vendor looking for value you nice okay so they liver to the UK then for a small amount of EU countries they'll be the Royal Mail will ship than five to ten business days the rest of the world is six to fifteen and asks you have to ask ahead for details so my Australian people you gotta ask ahead you have to ask clever botanicals I had to see if they're going to ship to you guys you Bill's here usually it seems like they do a good amount of sales better sale 20 per cell 20 then they can may include the lab work they conclude lab with their flower like this you you grams ten bucks is 170 thanks from me I see you cover Hamsher Kanna you all right so this is the next place I'm sure Kanna you so they have a store as their stores and Portsmouth England think Carrie salves dreams there Ablett's you stories time to fear in Portsmouth and next one panics you you double-dip ash you tan exes you eight cards you you parts of terpenes you yes sir you Oh apollon F Bram guessing this 925 pound sterling that's purple Ram super sour space candy so five program [Music] i5i pound sterling program they've lifter we're gonna buy like a everybody like 28 grains and how much are they gonna charge 127 in pound sterling or this or this for 28 grams ounce give you my abort lab work isn't as comprehensive they're telling you what cannabinoids are there but unlike giving you my abort say Chuck other products and so they do have a quite a bit of half so if you really like hash like this looks really good like I'm from the States man and like I remember getting like pollen from my caregiver it was so awesome like putting like putting like a like I'm due to probably get some when bunny bunny or there's more money but like I like I like putting pollen or hash on my flower I really like the effect I get from it it's great that this place has it I don't know if the 725 is get a gram of this stuff okay all right any bad so so 7 pounds sterling and I know the pound is still worth more than you ask so it's like me me it's like what 12 13 bucks per gram and before shipping I mean those these are pretty good prices on the surface again I'm not getting off from the UK so I don't know I don't know what what's supposed to be good going rate that doesn't look too bad all right so the next place we're almost done you you you I love Comcast right so they have a helper routine you know you said I used to bodybuilding I used to lift weights a lot you know um admire like if I sir gave him a lifting I think I would go to hemp protein wrap you know you see I used to just usually use way most of the time um I would I begged I'd be open and checking out pea protein a lot of people say get stuff about that I don't know if it's gonna taste directly like pea or whatever like peas I mean it's but if that's if that's gonna be healthier and that's gonna put less strain in my body then like like cow bass and it's gonna be better for the environment and you know I'm um you know I don't have the most diverse edible plant palate but you put something new in front of me you know I'm not I'll try it I'll give it a college try that's that's the way I've always been you know I'm not one of those people that only eats chicken fingers but you know I don't need as much vegetables as I should but again you put forth and eat something new in front of me some new healthy vegan dish I'll try it oh I'll try it oh I'll give it a fair shake I'll give anything besides Lobster and shellfish a fair shake and that was an Italian dressing I don't like either but I'll give most stuff a fair shake you know I'm not gonna just only eat chicken fingers or whatever but um yeah I would try him protein available in my market so this place is selling that if you lift weights you know they'll probably even help with pain if there's if it's CBD protein - if it's not just you know hemp extract or hemp or hemp seed derived there they're putting actual CBD you know I would imagine that's helping was like when you lift weights like you like everyone knows that everyone knows about to lay it on say it's soreness and like you being sore the next day after you know lifting certain muscles that's because like your other muscles that you're trying to make stronger those muscles are in pain and they're breaking down and during the breakdown of those muscles the the newer ones are going to be built and then that's when that's when the spring comes and that's when you get stronger but you have to go through the delayed soreness and you know having some CBD and your protein I would imagine with CBDs anti-inflammatory but it would definitely help things so if you're in the UK and you lift weights like I would definitely check it out a heck even even by like your own hemp flour like I do you know make tinctures like I do and then put some CBD tincture in your hemp drink yeah I mean in your pro protein shaking of its whey protein you know probably help with recovery you know I mean I wish that I wish the the farm bill was as prolific in 2014 2015 2016 when I was still sort of well I just kind of stopped in 2016 because the sleep issue just got so out of hand but during forum yeah I mean from 2013 to 2015 when I was really all about that weightlifting in Quito life CBD protein or throwing CBD in a protein shake would be ingenious but again we didn't really have the farm bill as developed and flushed out you know CBD was still sort of hard to get yeah I mean dude if I had if I had cash I'd be all about this or hack I would just I would just buy the the hemp protein from from like the hemp protein without the CBD from like Amazon and then just put through like portion of the tincture in it anyway you know I'm sure I'm sure it being valuable with cover ease your bodybuilder this or your vapor this mmm Timm ball might be a better place to check out their nutrition Stolz pills ProTeam button so drug testing kits in case you get like pissed tested I mean I don't know how prolific pest testing is in the UK in Europe so again I can't really speak to that but so many so many companies that pay you a very good wage and that will provide you and your husband a good living they do tend to pee test you in in the States but again I don't know how prolific that is in the UK but if you wanted to check your if you're taking isolate or isolate crystals for example you want to make sure you were clean you can buy that source stuff here I see if they have any like bender no but what they do have lab reports on everything so that's good okay so next place is the ice hemp shop you so I'm more concerned about flour and I'm probably sure probably most of you care more about like the herbs so you can make it into what you want because even like what I noticed in the u.s. Kanda whatever like the vendors that sell you like the CBD tincture like the teachers are good and they work but the it's they up charge you so much for it you know what I mean like you be you would get more mileage buying an ounce of CBD or buying 28 grams of CBD flour you know picking up some vegetable glycerin from your local supermarket or your local food grade market or whatever or you know Amazon UK or whatever whatever vendors I would pick up a gallon of vegetable glycerin I would pick up some trim and I wouldn't just make your own tinctures and if you have a magic butter and they make it so easy even a caveman can do it but if not I mean there are ways you can fabricate this through the mason jar method or whatever just soaking it in in in like Everclear for some weeks in a dark area you could go that route you could go like the e what's the name the insta pot route people do that you could go the crock pot route your decarboxylation or your extracting I'm heard of people going going that direction so you're not limited to the magic butter machine but point is you can make way more with just some vegetable glycerin some hash and like a cheesecloth to strain it after the hours of extraction and just get way more of your buck but they're banking on you being too lazy or wanting convenience too much that you'll pay 60 pound sterling for a 1 ounce tincture they're banking you will do that okay so this this place is selling this strain Yolo and then there's some bulk discounts which is nice so this is nine nine nine pounds sterling a gram I don't how much twenty eight the twenty eight is gonna be two hundred twenty-three pounds sterling it's pretty steep pretty steep each side let's see what the coupons are so overs so orders over 50 pounds sterling are going to get 10% off and then orders over a hundred pound sterling are going to get 20% off right but the price is about all that and I want to waste too much of your time here so Jimmy green CBD so many of these mega episodes boiling y'all rotten oh man look at that that hash like oh my god like I'm seeing like I don't like the UK market like it just seems like Europe has our butts beat with hash like I've seen like I've gone from a lot of vendors and I've seen people make bubble hash or whatever but Shara's I have not I've not seen that in any of these vendors I've had so again if money were less of an object again you want if you want Dan scallion or mr. sativa to review these to reach hours we watched we watched strain hunters in a live stream I want to say last year or two years ago where we learned about you know how they make how they hand make fees how they like hand make um showers likely views I think you go to like parts of India where certain strains are growing you know near the mountains they have this episode where they went to India the strain hunter people you know they had to really respect the added they were as usual they were very respectful of the of the part of India and the Indian culture that they were experiencing so you know they took their cues from the the natives there you know and then you know some oh geez and some natives that knew their stuff about hash taught them how to make hand char's so you're basically like rubbing your hands on these like on these hash plants and you're able to get Shara's or whatever is again on that's just like my bastardize explanation forefront for it because I'm not a scientist but I haven't seen any US vendors sell charas but again the support links are above if you want me to review it I'm if you buy it for me if you buy it at me buy it for me if you contact me I mean you know my email you know my Twitter you know my Instagram if you want to want to buy it and ship it to me and have me review it I'm more than willing to review it and put it on my smile seaweedy flower that I do during the day but I'm amazed that they have charas CBD charas that's and they have amnesia jelly hash so again if money were no object I would be very very into this but let's look at their seals this looks like a very Jimmy Green's looks like a very good vendor so they're selling you one gram for or pound sterling and 28 grams is going to be 95 pound Sterling's pretty decent compared to the other ones we checked out so let's see if in black 10 so 10% off so you would you would get that for 80 something and these are smalls blue dreams blue dream woo dreams are very good like I've talked about our flower bomb bomb flower bomb farms um blue dream review it's one blue dream is one of the most common strains it's found and it's found genetically in in in marijuana strains that you wouldn't think and it's very good at going well with CBD it's very senator senator senator NIST stick with CBD in my opinion I'm glad that there is a Blue Dream CBD if and money were no object I'd try it and the hash and the charas again I haven't seen that in any I haven't seen that from any us vendors I can not gonna not gonna flip in lie here but yeah the those are their deals next folks we're almost there you see these oils fruit gummies on is softgel not seeing anything ills that are very compelling it redelivery on orders over 30 pounds sterling it's London you I'm really much on on with bender alizarin you you you kingdom of green right see what they've got to offer the oil bombs and more on sterling their base off K Absalom's coffee 30 or pounds sterling [Music] you and man like the UK has our butts beat with hash it does feel like the hash selection in the UK is just way more developed look look look at that amnesia haze ash like like it feels like it feels like the UK is eating our lunch with hash just seems like there's a better variety based off you mean in comparison to like the the stores that I've been to in the US or whatever but you know but we know the Crown has close ties to you know it still has close ties to this day to India and you know that's where a lot of that's where a lot of the good that's away a lot of the good talk now Asha is made so I mean it's not really surprising that UK has a very good hash game but man man man oh man I wish I can get a town with Easton with this hash this looks at the selection just looks way better than what I've seen in the States let's see how much hemp flowers are her being Austin so hem flour is legal in the UK as long as its low point to are in the clear if you have hem flour you you we got vape mods will you if you need a half their tincture can you get way more by just buying your own flower buying your own vegetable glycerin using the magic butter or using insta pod or using a crock pot from a thrift shop you can get way more out of just doing that then then then buying vape oil I'm not know buying CBD oil I'm not a fan of buying tinctures and from vendors cuz he just the up charge you for the privilege better off making your own you all right this is another vendor it'll call and see Spencer you don't have any special deals you you and I have a I'm gonna have a vape right now y'all y'all just gonna have to deal with it can i vape some CBD with hired a prior Terry blend of some CBG and some blueberry flour um as you know blue is my favorite color um whose never really failed me as a caller I love I love blueberry strains I love blue strains like I said earlier blue dream you pair that with CBG you're gonna get up you pair that with CBD or and I get a bunch done in a day you know you'll feel focus you know you'll feel a little bit more creative and you feel a bit more uplifted and willing to want to do the things you need to get done in a day I can upsell blue dream and CBD enough or like we went to that other vendor with blue dream CBD flower if you got the funds for it or than the deals worked out you know it's worth checking out you so yeah if you live outside UK or outside some of these EU countries Australia it's not money it's definitely worth asking if they're going to ship to you like the worst you can get or the worst that they will say is no but I mean it's at least worth asking in my estimation so they sold out of shake sold out a little audit me Oh smalls 40 40 40 40 euros names so prices and all that all's we're almost done this but after we're done we I'm gonna go to I'm gonna highlight what I felt was the best one before wrapping it up but they do have quite a selection not not the best deal but the selection is there that and TriMet a weed you some getting high during uh vaping up during a broadcast deal with it mofos you you deal with the mofos you you all right so let's help candy so this is guessing this 97 rama i don't know if that's going to be over this hand pick sort of bake or whatever looks like kilo you you you can get a lot of bargain-basement canvas from them this looks like you can get 50 grams premium buds you can get some 40 and get a kilo and get q one kilo on the stem you can get a lot of pride there are a lot of

you know definitely check in with them before doing it I guess that sort of wraps up this UK mega episode that I've been promising that I wanted to get done as always I can be found on these various platforms I can be found on I can be found on iTunes akut cast cast box pod bean pod cast attic radio public stitcher to an in radio i heart radio and other platforms like it if you like what i'm doing and you want to support the podcasts you can do that by becoming a patreon at the link above and you can follow me on my social zatt I see sativa pod you can support us to be a PayPal at PayPal me / I see sativa podcasts any cash that I get will get reinvested in back into the podcast and you know money that I've ready on from fans I highly and hugely appreciate shout out to those that have already contributed so far I've leveled that money towards business sources towards podcast expenses like buying a Skype phone number which we just bought and I mean I don't know how long I'll be able to keep it but I have loved I have leverage some of the funds I've gotten from fans and from you know advertising towards that towards um having a Skype number because when we're we're doing phone calls when I mean I get I have an app on my phone that I I that I pay per month that I pay for the premium version to record calls that works fine but what works even better is if I can use my computer and I can use my blue Yeti because the blue Yeti microphone is going to offer richer sound that might then the microphone of mine of my cell phone I mean let's just be blunt here and it's just just how it is excuse me but that's what I've been using the money for and you know hosting my hosting cost I've have to have I've gone up a bit because because of the fast clip we're putting out episodes and that's taking up storage so I've had to up our storage limits so the ad revenue is helping to go towards that again any money we get will be recycled towards good use and again I'd be remiss if I did not mention this but we do have a GoFundMe so I'm going to I'm going to conjure that up and if you're feeling extra generous you can look for that so bear with me one sec you of right so I'll show you this before we answer this is this is stand Scotland this is our GoFundMe um obviously more than 2010 and 70 episodes deep or at over 500 deep but the message is so similar that we need cash to continue doing this I am I use the money to buy equipment updates by hosting up updates I want to do more transcriptions most importantly we need the money most importantly if you don't get anything else out of this most importantly the biggest next project besides the blue Yeti that I got for Christmas for my older sister shout out to her you know I love I love my older sisters I love all of them a shout out to her for this blue Yeti equipment upgrade but the next upgrade we need isn't so much a technical upgrade or even a services upgrade but we need to my next goal is to make the I'm canvas ateva project at LLC because when you you have an LLC you have much more protection and you have much more ownership from what I understand over your intellectual property you know I'm starting to make me meow and I don't want I don't want thieves stealing it and if we expand towards making articles I don't want people plagiarizing my articles I don't want people plagiarizing my memes I don't want you know I want to protect my intellectual property and if I can't protect my intellectual property and other people are co-opting the I am cannabis sativa podcast and it makes doing our project difficult to impossible so you don't get anything out of that anything else out of that um we could definitely use the funds to to become an LLC to to protect this project that's our next cool so so again I hope you guys got a lot out of this I mean to do this episode um I got like I've mentioned my schedule is going to change a whole lot starting this this very week I'm going to be you know you're gonna see less episodes towards the ending of January February and until things get shakeshake tout and figure it out you know off podcasts but again I hope you guys got a lot out of this dance Kotlin here joining you from the eelgrass achoo sits and as always everyone stay medicated my friends peace out and shower", "ubVPLnKiXLU": "the new Xfire vape pen system what's up guys the vapor out here with a quick unboxing and review for the new Xfire this is a piece for someone who's looking for something that completely mimics or comes close to mimicking a cigarette as possible both in terms of the fuel in your hand as well as the mouth to lung inhalation as well as the throat feel the taste on these aren't necessarily exceptional it's not those super fruity flavors that you're gonna get with those you know bottled flavors or those sub-ohm beeps but this is definitely a good piece for someone who's looking to get rid of the nicotine addition if you're if you have a nicotine addiction and you want to just hit the nail on the head this one definitely does it for you it quenches your nicotine thirst so let's take a look at it when you open it up you'll you by the flavors and the pen separately they're sold separately the pen itself comes as so where you have the instruction manual and we'll go over that at a moment you have your pen and you have your charger the charger is fairly easy to use you plug that in and then as you see it has a connection over there let's take this out and at the bottom you would just plug that in like so and that's how you charge it very easy now how'd it get that going obviously you would need to buy the pods I have over here the four flavors that they offer which are currently mango mint tobacco and fruit punch they also are coming out with new colors believe is like a pink a black and some other colors so look out for those right now they only have the silver available so let's go ahead and fill that up we're gonna take our pod you may notice that I have one that's already open I'm gonna pull that off you'll pull off the bottom portion you pull off the top portion and you'll just plug that in like so see this connection right here and then it connects into there just push it in doesn't matter which way it'll indicate that it made a connection and you're ready to start vaping they do have each vape pod it's filled with 1.5 milliliters of liquid it will last you depending upon how often you're puffing it it will last you between like one to two days about a pack of cigarettes packed two packs of cigarettes depending upon how quickly your vaping and how ha how hot you're getting coil going how longer vapes are etc this does have an auto shutoff where if you're hitting the vape for more than eight seconds it's going to start blinking mix it's gonna blink at whatever color it's currently set on if the battery life is above 25% it'll be white so blink white five times if the battery is below 25% it's gonna be red it'll blink red five times other than that if there's a connection issue between the tank and the pen itself you'll see that it's gonna blink three times and it's a mixed color white and red let me know this connection issue just change the pot and you should be okay make sure to clean the bottom of it as well like the inside you know when you pull out the tank clean inside there make sure there's no juice that's leaking this is pretty good when it comes to leaking as opposed to the bow which leaks like a freakin sieve and I really upset about that other than that's really good I'm sure they're gonna change their pods soon Nagato but it has great air flow on this one and and it really mimics a cigarette it's as close to a cigarette and it's just overall great experience so other than that the last thing would be that if it does blink I believe it's if it blinks eight times then you just go ahead and that's letting you know they need to charge it plug it into the charger and it'll charge or when it's charging it'll go from red to white once the charge is complete you just unplug that and you're good to go as you'll notice I've been vaping on it throughout the video just to show you guys what kind of cloud size you're gonna get from it if you guys have any questions about this definitely let me know I did attempt to refill the pod with you know either the soulless liquids as you see over here or the film iPod both very good flavors both very good nicotine soles this one has actually different options we're going 45 mg 35 mg etc however I cut myself when attempting to do that and this one is really difficult to to refill maybe it will do it I haven't really cracked this portion open I didn't want to because I figured I'd break it before and being to reuse it and anyways if you're looking for a refillable pod you want to save on that and be able to customize your own flavors be able to choose your nicotine levels etc you don't want to get some like this the pulse I've been using this for a little while now it's a great piece it does have a button how inhale activated the button is just used to eat to turn it off or to change the color of the vape and has like a bunch of different colors that activates when you inhale you guys have any questions definitely let me know I recommend the Xfire for someone who's looking for a no-hassle vape something that is easy to use it gives you that nicotine hit the mouth along inhalation which cigarette smokers are used to and people don't have to deal with the mods and the batteries of this and the that this is just a simple fix it's getting you the nicotine which is what you want you guys any questions let me know there's been a vapor out of review take care guys [Music]", "cILNkDnfyZY": "[Music] [Applause] diamond cbd is the premier innovator in the cbd industry we've been one of the industry leaders at the forefront when it all began and we've developed and continued to develop more and better products that are delivered to our consumers cbd is a byproduct it's really a composite a very complex molecule but it's a composite of the essential health benefits of the plant without thc so it's basically a marijuana plant without the hallucinogenic portion of the plant we're still discovering what cbd does to the body the receptors the different organ systems basically uh people have a need for these various products that have come out of cbd and to this day people are not aware of the benefits of cbd and i think that part of my goal is to make them aware consumers love diamond cbd products and prefer to purchase diamond cbd products because we are one of the first companies in the cbd industry besides that we control our supply chain better source our products from us grown hemp as well as third-party lab tests all of the products to ensure that the best premium cbd product is delivered to that consumer diamond cbd's main goals

but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "rNE8BbB9rKU": "[Music] p2pt [Music] what's up y'all the sky high on georgia pie car just came in and here's my first impressions the smell is weird you know not weird in a like you know bad way but like i didn't expect it to smell so vibrant [Music] like it smells like a candy guys like it smells like a real sweet kind of peachy kind of candy cheers no way that tasted so much better than roper for labs hold on guys [Music] wow guys this is so much better than the rogue river carts but this georgia pie cart is amazing man what's up guys boy p2 peeps today we're going to be checking out sky hiyo's georgia pie delta 8 thc cart with the cannabis derived terpenes here's the cart itself you know not the packaging or anything like that we do have point three percent of delta nine and thc contained in this i will be putting the uh percentage of delta eight thc on the screen on the screen sorry uh but yeah let's go ahead and take a hit and uh let's talk about it guys i know you guys might have seen the first impression a little clip i had so you guys already know i'm a big fan of this flavor cheers y'all thank you for joining me on yet another video review cheers [Music] you know we got to do a blinker for the first hit that's customary so yeah delta a is kind of more known as the more harsh cannabinoid comparatively to cbd and delta 9. but this is pretty smooth and i'd say it's still much smoother than the rogue river labs car i take a blinker from a rogue river labs cart and i am dead the flavor here is great i think they got a good mix of terpenes in here now i'm not sure um if all the delta eight thc cards from sky high are gonna taste the same i'm going to assume as of this point in time no but that is you know a common theme with some brands guys you know raw garden sublime smokeland certain delta eight brands they they all kind of sometimes use a similar tert blend so that kind of makes all their strains kind of taste the same to me this doesn't i don't think it is like that but yeah going on to the taste it's very very sweet kind of almost like a peach sweet you know like a picnic when you have a cup of peaches in syrup you know like the you know the to-go things uh to go fruit bowl things that you can get in a snack container or a lunchables or something so i'm kind of getting that level of sweetness from this not too much else maybe a little bit of pineness but that's about it there the potency on this thing is pretty nice just you know going off my previous experience of having some of it yesterday and a little bit of it today you know i i like the hot we're getting a nice head high there which kind of normally goes standard i think for delta 8 thc it normally starts with a little head high that kind of pulls you back in a sense like it feels like the back your head is is is is going backwards in a sense like you know like i said like look a little pullback i couldn't find any straight uh strain info you know about the cross of georgia pie but the strain itself is a seed junkie genetics cross so you know if you guys know seed junkie genetics that guy's making some of the best fire around you know the homie freddy has some of his genetics as well that is you know growing up so this is really good stuff um strain wise strain why so i'm probably going to go ahead and look into uh seed junkie and see if i could figure out the georgia pi uh cross yeah i'm enjoying the dirt profile on this you know like i said really peachy kind of flavor almost like that syrupy kind of pizza a little fruit bowl thing so i'm going to take another hit here see if we can get this high a lot more potent see what else i might be feeling off this thing cheers y'all [Music] i gotta say guys this is really one of the most impressive d8 cards i've had honest i am super impressed with this thing like the flavor is done very well nice and smooth and it's almost to the point where um you know if it weren't for the color i would barely able be able to tell that the difference between this and a delta nine thc car you know potency wise of course you can always tell the difference you know but if you're someone who doesn't smoke that much this is going to be great for you honestly like if if you can't handle any delta 9 thca all that stuff delta 8 and cbd is most likely going to be the route for you and if you want the closest thing to that psychoactive high of delta nine go ahead i definitely recommend delta eight let's take one more hit here guys uh but potency wise pretty good setting in a little bit more um the head high is not getting as intense as i thought it would um after hitting it again it's actually kind of not flowing a little bit more downwards um i'm feeling my back is feeling actually really good now now that i think about it um not now i was gonna say this i'm gonna preface this was saying this this is it's not stronger than delta nine to me to me you know if i took a dab of uh let's let's say these bear labs guava fake diamonds right if i took a dab of this is it's completely gonna overwrite whatever this is you know if i take a blinker of my sublime ceramic cart you know this this is probably gonna overwrite this you know i'm gonna take two blinkers of this this is gonna get me probably a little bit more higher than this will but that's okay guys you know this is not supposed to be beating delta nine you know it's supposed to be an alternative to that so let's take another hit yo but yeah this is uh one of the best ones i've had so far i can't wait to try the other uh sky hill carts i have here you know we got cereal milk and white runs to go so very very very excited for those strains and you know these strains aside from the georgia pie actually are strains i've had in real life so i could probably make a better uh distinction between them or something hopefully hopefully thank you guys for watching up to this point you know and if you have not drop a like for the homie drop a little comment let me know what you are smoking on and which of these three strains sounds more appealing to you man the georgia pie the cereal milk the white ones man which one would you get and if you have been enjoying and not been subscribed please hit that subscribe button it's for the free skis man and the nerdy bill is too so you know you hit both of those you're going to know when i'm i upload when i live stream all that stuff you know i want to have a more ironed out concrete schedule again i mean i feel like a lot of people just kind of forget the schedule sometimes so i'll probably talk about it a lot more and try to make a more considerate effort to push it out there cheers everybody thanks for coming through with them good vibes as always [Music] so [Music] three blinkers in like less than five minutes that's about less than ten minutes is that definitely gonna hit you but that's about it for this review guys taste wise right this is completely peachy you know i'm not really getting much of anything else just a really nice deep sweetness the terps here are fantastic man great job to sky ohio you know really good mix of terp and oil and potency-wise not too bad at all for a delta eight cartridge i honestly think that this is gonna be one of my favorites so far especially because of the flavor um but yeah if you guys are wondering how it stacks up to the ruger for labs potency-wise i do think that the wedding cake and black lime were just a tad bit stronger than this but we'll see how that cereal milk and white runs do and all that but so far very very satisfied with sky ohio and another thing guys is you should try to order all your delta eight before the march 27th ban um uh they're going to be banning delta eight being shipped in you know in packages through the usps and all that stuff um pretty soon the usps is though kind of reconsidering it so if you guys do want to buy delta 8 for the future or do want to help the people who are trying to keep this thing legal in you know the mail then please go google that the usps is uh like i think i think there's a form or an org you can join i i believe but yeah just go ahead and google that up and you know fight the good fight if that's what you want to do but thank you guys for tuning in and watching i hope you guys come back for another video or a live stream or something like that i do enjoy it when i see all these familiar faces and new faces in the streams and comment sections and all that so thank you guys for joining me take one last little puff here yeah go with good vibes everybody and have a great day night afternoon whatever time it may be yeah pizza out peace you", "vPbO2jz-QSQ": "yeah alrighty we're back again with another heavy hitters this one's blue drain and it has got to be my least favorite a sativa from them maybe the least favorite overall I just don't think I'm a fan of the strain I mean there's nothing wrong with it the flavors on point I mean why is he gonna see the tape see is higher than some of the other ones so if it's your thing if you like Glee dream I mean I'm sure you like this yeah you just not fond of that strain it's more of a it's perfect for someone who's new to cannabis in my opinion cuz it's not it's not anything overwhelming in any sense it's just like a great for a beginner basically really not gonna get too high on this it's real mellow I don't know I get I get a little bit of a body high not just a little bit like so much so you call this a hybrid oh boy but they don't they call it a sativa so as you can see it's got the batch number and everything in the website you can look up the testing some steep hill back to all those older style cartridges I think I didn't like the new style cartridge better I wasn't sure at first but I definitely liked that anyone better it actually does a better job of waking up all the concentrate instead of leaving the blue dream this has a slight lemony flavor nice a slight because it's just not like punching in the face like some of the other ones or but it's still along with wine the kind of lemon flavor you get from Tila and not much else there's not much else there a little bit of fruity and like fruit flavor in the background or sweetness see ya nothing that like overall really stands out about this one don't get me wrong they did it right I mean it's really good still I'm just not a fan on the particular strain I'm sure someone will comment below talking about how it's their favorite because you know you just never know it's so personal that I mean for one person that can be the best their favorite and another person just not enjoy it so there you go that's a look at the Blue Dream from heavy hitters they effects a real wild so it's perfect for somebody who's new to they these are new to cannabis in general there you go thanks for watching", "EizVVCYxlHM": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] hello and welcome back welcome back to the church today we are going to be talking about the spire nautilus prime now this is an aio pod system that uses the same coils as the original nautilus you can use those you can use uh newer nautilus coils mesh all that stuff good stuff right here tiny coils real small real skinny kind of tall but that's compared to their width and it's a decent coil it gives excellent flavor and i'm sure a lot of you out there have already tried the nautilus not the nautilus but the original nautilus so yeah e-cig mafia sent this to me so i'm doing this little box opening for you we're gonna check it out so uh let's take it down here and let's look inside the box and see what this thing can do all right so here we go they sent me the garnet red one i really like this it really reminds me of this old uh davpo uh squonker that i have and very similar with the the redness to it i mean yeah that's that's the only similarity so let's open up the box let's check out what we have inside all right so of course if you look here we have a 2 000 milliamp battery we have a couple coils blah blah blah pods 3.4 we have nautilus bvc coil that's all 1.8 and we have a mesh coil that is 0.7 now in here is the bbc coil on one that i already had because i did not want to open this up all right we have some instructions right here very simple stuff very simple but i'm going to show you everything that you need to know and we have we have this little thing right here warning for operating in manual mode okay it's an opera basically a warning because you know they think hey it's going to be kind of like a mech mod when you put it in manual mode not it's not so we have a type c charger we have a couple of coils right here not a whole lot in here and see what i mean that it's tall and skinny tiny little coils you wouldn't really think that something like this would do that much ah this one is the mesh this one is the coil so yeah not too bad right okay so what you're gonna do is you're gonna take this out no magnets in this one it actually has these two little things on the sides where they click right in you just kind of drop it in and click all right it's clicked in it's not going anywhere it is pretty secure so that's that here is your airflow control so i usually have it all the way open or i could just close it all the way and uh do some mouth to lunging so basically you take the coil you pop it right in there you just push it in uh of course after priming and you fill it up here is the little door for that filling it up and that's simple uh i don't think you can actually no yeah you can you can remove that um drip tip and you can put any other 510 drip tip on here that you want or you can just drop it on the floor all right there we go so yeah you can always do that but there's nothing wrong with this one sometimes let's see something like this is more preferred because especially if you're doing like mouth to lung but i'm definitely going to be just using this one so let's let's see how that works out yeah that's absolutely more appropriate for mel to long it brings that flavor all in and just just just gives it to you all at once but that's that's just one little part about this so here we go you want to black out the screen you want to save some battery power one two three shuts it off but it still works it's still on one two three turns it back on if you want to turn this off you got to go one two three four five put it in lock mode and then you hold this down for three seconds and it turns it off okay so that's neat right uh one two three four five turns it back on you got the aspire logo and there we go we're more like this aspire font and it says it's at a point six nine so i'm not actually is that the right coil i don't know who cares okay so you can go up and down i don't usually use volts mode but that's what it's in right now and that's the only way i was able to get it this high so i'm going to show you what we do we press both at once warning and then do it again voltage now the warning means that oh god you're going into a really crazy mode right now bypass mode all right bypass see what that does it basically uses all the battery uh similar to what a mech mod would do but this is not a mech mod and it's not going to have that type of danger as like a hybrid mac nothing like that so we hold it down another three seconds do it again all right let's take it out of bypass mode i had it in voltage and ahead of watts let's go to auto mode okay what exactly is auto mode gonna do it's maxed at 25 and it's not supposed to be there i believe it's supposed to go up to 40 watts so yeah decent flavor but if you want to take it over 25 watts which check it out all right that's going to be 4.1 all right get out of there go to voltage mode oops that voltage mode and go up whoops go above all right let's take it up to 4.9 and you are good to go now that's not really a preferred type of heightened voltage for this type of coil this coil is built to take about 25 and that's why it brings you to 25 so when you're going to want to use bolt bolts mode and go a little higher ah because as we can see it go all the way up to jesus eight volts so if you want to go to eight volts you better be throwing that rba in and it better be built as to something that can take eight volts otherwise just you're just gonna get something burned and it's gonna suck maybe that's what the warning was about but i don't really feel like there's any like mech mod style danger to this thing so let's just let's just take this up to four and that's good so it's a very simple device uh it was very easy to learn and uh i like it i do like it it's pretty neat i believe i will like it a little bit more once i have that rba because you know what makes a aio system great something you can build with it all right and this goes basically the same for any tank any rda of course rdas are all like that um rtas this and that but yeah there we go that is the nautilus prime what do you think not too bad right now it would be a lot cooler if they had an external battery of course but this is what we have and it just does what it does now you can always throw it in mouth mouth to lung mode just just close that airflow not too bad still has flavor or you could just do a restricted direct long hair and it gives you some nice nice flavor either way it's a nice little side piece keep in your pocket you know hey your dual battery mod runs out and you're out doing stuff you don't have any extra batteries with batteries with you take this along with you you know it's definitely nice to have by your side all right so that's that i hope you decided whether or not you want to pick this thing up e-sig mafia has this they are the ones that sent this to me and i'm pretty happy with it so i'm going to be vaping a little bit for the next few days and then once i get that rba i'll be doing that video for you and i'll probably bake this all right so don't hit don't forget to hit that like button share subscribe i'll see you next time all right i do have more things to come can't wait to share them with you so remember if you build it [Music] vape will come [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's [Music] is", "_GXrNZZnloI": "what is up YouTube family boy vaska's here gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my videos if you got someone watch the video I posted before this one go ahead and check it out we'd really appreciate that but other than that it's Sunday more Sunday morning actually you know I'm just chillin kicking back bout it hit my dispensary maybe a cup and eight this something you know it's it's about that time you know I really want to smoke it it's kind of different when you have a when you smoke out of a cartridge and you smoke a bloody nut I mean it's way different so but before I go ahead head out you know I want to get this out of the way so here we have this lemon haze from bloom farms you know I've never had a blue farm before actually I have but it was more uh it was one of these darts I'm know if you guys had seen these before these are pretty good so I don't know if they taste exactly like the card just because at the time I didn't see no cartridges I just seen these so I don't know whether they just like I said they just came out with cartridges or whatnot but you guys let me know on that this was like it was like 38 bucks you know I couldn't pass these up they had a lot they had all kinds of flavors you know what I mean so there's those people say there's a lot of fakes and there's real [ __ ] but you know this one's definitely real I got it from the dispensary but I don't know what would be the difference between a fake or real so I cannot tell you like you know on the packaging is [ __ ] so let me know in a comment section what are you guys smoking on I'm about to pop this [ __ ] open you know I have a smoked all day so it's about that time we get the wake-and-bake going so let's go ahead and pop this [ __ ] open so the THC on this is 83 no 88 actually total cannabinoids I got to see on the back and it's pretty cool pretty cool simple packaging so we're just gonna go and take this little alright guys so we finally got the sticker open and I kind of [ __ ] it up you know kind of [ __ ] the box up a little tab ripped out so here it goes hey they got the here you got the the packaging and it looks pretty dope you not never had a bloom cartridge before and here it says today was a good day it's pretty dope packaging I'm starting to really like this we're gonna get that and all you get is like this little I'm hotter burnin like what what not to do you know what your cartridge which I'm pretty sure are you cartridge smokers know what and what not to do what your cartridge is right keep it out of the keep out of the Sun you know what that should amount and [ __ ] so here you have it cool little cab a little oh [ __ ] alright guys so we finally you have to push this and you turn it at the same time so it's kind of where you know you you gotta know what the [ __ ] you're doing with these things because it's not gonna have a hard time trying to open this [ __ ] so BAM guys this looks pretty nice you know the oil looks really really clear nice yellow gold and first of all we're just gonna go ahead and do the bubble test on it this one's a super Lemon Haze I were really big the team fan and the super Lemon Haze is like a really old school strain so I really caught my attention so that's why I kind of wanted to get it the oil is really really thick guys she does not move at all so it's it's not life resin it says triple distillate so it must be some pretty you know clean clean distillate some people say dis list not to move now you know a lot of resins a new wave well it kind of is you know there's a lot of companies coming out with live resin so I don't know I mean this still is still good you know don't get me wrong it's still good just depends what kind of distillate you guys get from so we're gonna try hit this and we're gonna see what it tastes like all right off the bat you can taste those lemons man it is really good wow that's just fire I didn't just let me give you guys a little close-up again before I smoked a [ __ ] out of this cartridge it says bloom on there and this is the SL H for super Lemon Haze on the side and you got your California sticker there which is pretty dub so we headed up connected the little magnet right here for the yoke and battery you guys need to get one of these joke cows and other monsters had it for like almost two years already you know it's still hits like if I just pull it out the Box you know so we're just gonna throw it in there and cheers guys if you got smoke along with me go ahead and do so man we're about a good fake right now Wow I'm gonna be honest with you guys this cartridge does not taste like distillate it tastes more like a it tastes like really cleaned lemons no fresh like it's just fire its [ __ ] guys I didn't really expect it to be that good you know for some distillate bloom bloom Farms are pretty far man I'm going to hit her again I'm see if I can get a bigger bigger cloud oh yeah definitely you get lemons you know Wow so if you guys you guys let me know like what's the price on these bloom cartridges some people told me to have fakes you know so I don't know whether what to tell the difference like I said but you guys have these around where you guys from what's the price on these I got him prepared for like $38 with tax so it's not as bad so you guys don't pass this up man I'm at the [ __ ] again she's pretty good you know it tastes like actual lemons like it'll taste fake or nothing like that tastes like some actual terpene and definitely one of my favorite cartridges so far from bloom farm I haven't tried I haven't tried any other ones besides this one and the GDP one the GDP one was really good as well you know it tastes like actual granddaddy but but this was pretty far guys and if you guys ever see this super Lemon Haze you guys gotta try them out you know for the price $38 well it depends on where you guys from but here where I'm from it's pretty cheating but this is California but yeah guys I'm uh gonna head out good like I said I'm go to my dispensary and picked up some weed and tied to a hot box video or something let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges and what kind of videos you guys like to see that I mean cuz I do what you guys want to see but you guys just gotta let me know in the comment section and really appreciate you guys watching my videos and don't forget to add the snapchat and just hit me up you know you guys have any questions and you guys have a really good day and you guys stay safe my peace", "4AvISpz3z_E": "hey welcome to cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on using your 510 cartridges with your vaporizer batteries if you'd like to learn more about their

[Music]", "qGjvbtb-XO0": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel I'm so excited to have all you cannabis connoisseurs and enthusiasts with me today I have a classic strain in vape cartridge form for you today pineapple express baby coming at you from the good people a good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it

smoking", "3ZgJBoZwj-A": "hey guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "A5ggvX1JM_0": "section 2 of folklore and legends English this is a librivox recording all librivox recordings are in the public domain for more information or to

not having in length half a thumb they are clothed with rags patched together and if anything should be to be carried on in the house for any kind of laborious work to be done they join themselves to

ambiguous shades of night the English occasionally ride alone the poor tune sometimes unseen couples himself to the rider and when he has accompanied him going on a very long time at length the bridle

about to be a fire in that city or town when therefore in the following day or night the danger is urgent in the streets running to and fro it provokes the dogs to bark and while it pretends flight invites them following to pursue in the vain hope of overtaking it this kind of illusion provokes caution to the Watchmen who have the custody of fire and sold the officious race of demons while they

to wait a long time however and to walk very far and his boots were almost worn out before he found another one day however he came to a field in the middle of which he saw a pair of trousers standing up being held up sticks a man was running about them and jumping over and over them hello cried John what are you about why said the man what need is there to ask don't you see I want to get the trousers on so saying he took two or three more runs and jumps but always jumped a Thor to this side or that of the trousers why don't you take the trousers and draw the man asked John good said the

visit librivox.org folklore and legends English by Charles John Tibbetts the tulip fairies near a pixie field in the neighborhood of Dartmoor there lived on a time an old woman who possessed a cottage in a very pretty garden wherein she cultivated a most beautiful bed of tulips The Pixies it is traditionally a veered so delighted in the spot that they would carry their elfin babies thither and sing them to rest often at the dead hour of the night a sweet lullaby was heard and strains of the most melodious music would float in the air that seemed oh their origin to no other musicians than the beautiful tulips themselves and whilst these delicate flowers wave their heads to the evening breeze it sometimes seemed as if they were marking time to their own singing as soon as the elfin babies were lulled asleep by such maladies The Pixies would return to the neighboring field and there commenced dancing making those rings on the green which showed even to mortal eyes what sort of Gamble's had occupied them during the night season at the first dawn of light the watchful Pixies once more sought the tulips and though is still invisible they could be heard kissing and caressing their babies the tulips thus favored by a race of Jenna retained their beauty much longer than any other flowers in the garden whilst though contrary to their nature as the Pixies breathed over them they became as fragrant as roses and so delighted at all was the old woman who kept the garden that she never suffered a single tulip to be plucked from its stem at length however she died and they're here who succeeded her destroyed the entire dead flowers and converted the spot into a parsley bed a circumstance which so disappointed and offended the Pixies that they caused all the parsley to wither away and indeed for many years nothing would grow in the beds of the whole garden these sprites however though eager and resenting an injury were like most warm spirits equally capable of returning a benefit and if they destroyed the product of the good old woman's garden when it had fallen into unworthy hands they tended the bed that wrapped her clay with affectionate solicitude there were heard lamenting and seemed sweet dirges around her grave nor did they neglect to pay this mournful tribute to her memory every night before the moon was at the fall for then their highest Lemna tea of dancing singing and rejoicing took place to hail the queen of the night on completing her circle in the heavens no human hand ever tended the grave of the poor old woman who had nurtured the tulip bed but the delight of these elfin creatures but no rank weed was ever seen to grow upon it the sod was evergreen and the prettiest flowers would spring up without selling or planting and so they continued to do until it was supposed that the mortal body was reduced to its original dust end of section 7", "oovH1YDaw40": "welcome back welcome back welcome back to our [ __ ] hey [Music] hmm all

i've never tried texas pound cake anything but you know it's crazy hold on though they cake starts with a c but the disposables got a k on it see okay let me see the box that's a little weird maybe they got the disposables made by somebody else just didn't have their logo on it well when you look up cake we tried to find that actual like company and get in contact with them to see if they wanted to work with us it was hard to even find anything about them everybody that sell these are like third-party sellers they're not coming from a direct site so when we look down there that was a thing you can see on the metal of gas stations yeah a lot of gas stations that's mainly we're already off back okay disposables i have some other disposables you pull it out it's literally just a plastic container like a little plastic square and some wires connected to it that's it this [ __ ] is like a real cart if you look on the inside you see the same filter and [ __ ] as a cart yeah you do so

"ivRTpxFMtmE": "so what's going on guys we are back with another review today's review is gonna be on another kart the venom X this one is the pomegranate paradise sativa so with uh with that intro already done let's go ahead and let you guys know that this channel is a smoking cannabis channel only so if you're not 21 and older 18 and 21 depending on your state you can't watch this video it's age restricted or some some some I don't know I don't know YouTube doing me dirty with this but sorry so well now we can start the review like I said so it's the pomegranate paradise it's the venom X this is the first venom X we've reviewed on the channel I did like a week or two ago have two venom X's they were actually the same exact one they were supposed to be different but the girl gave me the same ones for some reason so that was whatever but I just didn't make a video and I explained why in another video so go watch that one um but this one I don't think it says anything about like what percent it is oh no it does this is meeting with 100% all-natural terpenes C cell technology but bought 85% - you see right there in the middle marade there we got it on the doctor's odx battery here it's pretty well charged when I was when I got this it was supposed to be like really fruity that was supposed to be the flavor like a fruity kind of earthy taste but after hitting it for like the last few hours like a day like I've had for a day I notice that it's very very cush it's just straight clutch taste so if you like those go for it but the high on this thing is probably the happiest ha I think I've ever gotten out of any car especially or out of any sativa especially any card this thing just smacked me like in a good way and I was like fully chilling the whole time but I just felt really good I was in some good vibes you know I'm saying so I got like hair they're mangroves if you guys like sativas um and you really want to get like a really good happy high like feel great moment I highly recommend this car venom X pomegranate paradise it is solid for that I haven't felt that that like great high in a long time and this one definitely did it so let's go ahead and take one one good couch off this bad boy and yeah let me know if you guys are smoking anything down in the comments melesa interested to know so twos guys yeah I mean it I I will say there is like a little bit of a fruity taste maybe like pomegranate maybe a small hint of it but it's very cushy maybe a small hint of erythema like that that like weird you know the taste I don't want to say it's earthy but that's how everybody describes it but y'all know what the taste is but it has a little bit of those too but it's mainly cush to me that's at least my personal taste you guys might taste a little something different right sorry to me here like little noises in the back I just got a puppy I'm fostering and he's a little Brad so it makes a lot of noise I mean when yeah this thing's I'm already feeling a little little hot and body I already for sure head high a little a little bit I'm gonna feeling chill you don't here's the wax it's a really nice golden color beautiful background huh 10 out of 10 it is pretty solid they're pretty thick pretty damn thick no there was a deal it was a to 440 the homie uh-uh he the big the big homie got ice play with me so we went 20 20 and he got a cart shoutouts to him you got the same cart and I don't know how to say let's just shoot you another one guys cuz that's all I can say Oh yo so real quick so it's October right Oh in September Jesus Christ but it's September so it's almost Halloween to you that means that Halloween serials in season Nash it's the best so let me know which one's your favorite there's like Count Dracula or whatever the chocolate one a cocoa dragon track you cannot what it's called there's Franken berry and then Boo Berry let me know which one's your favorite I'm personally a Franken berry I think Don's left I think I was like tops for sure and then boo Berryman choco vampire [ __ ] whatever told mm-hmm but that's just me that's just me those are some bomb-ass cereals oh for sure for sure well well [ __ ] there is a little bubble right there and one thing I have noticed after hitting it when you do create a bubble like that inside the card it kind of hits off that bubble again so you kind of get like the weird battery like fume taste so it's kind of ideal if you can let the bubble move a bit that would be I that would be a bad deal but if not you know you can still get a pretty decent draw off it for sure for sure well let's take another one you choose yeah you know what I want to do for you guys I want to do a for one of the strings Saturdays or screen Sundays or whatever it is his move his battery's getting all my little one well for one of the streets after it is do like a Keith pre-roll or something like that like a full like Granberry Keith line or like a 3.5 grant that would be dope the I I'm not really ever smoked a chief joint at all I don't even know if Keith blunts it really made it often but I'm more of a joint kind of guy anyway but definitely man wow my lungs right there I definitely really want to smoke occasionally they look so fired or a moon rock a Zodiac moonwalk one of those those pre-rolls are expensive but I'm definitely found if you guys lend me one and see one of those I gotta find a dispro that hassle near me but I'm sure that'll be pretty damn easy I think that was three is that three yeah well I think yeah here she I'll kind of show you there's the bubble right it's just it got bigger it didn't like Oh to any other one I don't really know if he can do that maybe if I switch switch it a little bit if I open it a little bit more like not so tight no I'm saying it might be blocking a little bit of airflow let's see well I wasn't I feel like a lot more smoke and normal for sure Richard Oh ma'am that was interesting I don't know if I that was a good good idea or what I just I've always had it pretty tight so I just kind of loosened it so there's like a little bit more air fall but enough connection to get a hit yeah definitely hearing more air flow going through for sure well what interesting I'm gonna mess around with that a little more see how that works and see what happens there but I think that's a wrap for this video guys I hope you guys had a Wow Jesus Christ I am stupid I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did go ahead and give me a like or subscribe that would be awesome comments are always dope I always reply to all of them you guys are super dope on all the last ones you guys pretty much left comments on every single one except for like one which is totally chill for me but yeah I love to love the feedback so it's always good to hear with all that done and like for kids there's on them feeling feeling a real nice here real nice so I'm probably gonna put on some music by about some games or you know YouTube whatever maybe but yeah I'll see you guys in the next one deuces have go", "XSFrzkVRPNY": "[Music] what's up guys simplisec here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another reaction video but this one's going to be on the clean cards not the fake carts you guys have been asking for a part four for a few months now you know and uh now that um for tuesdays i'm mainly gonna be doing reaction videos till i can stream again i wanted to do a clean cart one because one of the videos is actually picking up steam right now and if it's picking up steam might as well add another one because that that tells me that people are watching that and i know you guys have wanted this one as well and uh before i start this for any further the clean cards moderators i do not know any of them i don't give a [ __ ] about any of them uh because most of you guys say that they're mostly douche bags and stuff and like self-righteous in some ways but i would like to say that i am in no way affiliated with them it's just me reacting to their subreddit and uh just seeing what the legal cards are in the whole country you know what i'm saying i do have a card for this video you know i've been slacking with cards in terms of you know i'm making a fake cartridge video i don't even i'm not even smoking out of a cart this is actually the moonwalker brand uh video will be out in a few days but you know with these reaction videos i try to get these out the day that i record them that way you can follow along you know while i'm watching the video i guess but cheers for those of you who don't know this is delta eight it's called moonwalker the strain is called grape runts and honestly it's one of the better distillate cartridges that i've tried d8 or d9 it's just really flavorful now you do get a strong taste of grape if you guys are interested in this it will be in the comments below you can actually buy these in 38 states so shout out to moonwalker like i said videos on this product will be out in a few days but let's take another hit oh you can see the clearness in it that was bad so as usual with these reaction videos i like to post the comments from the previous video at least the best ones so here we go right now [Music] all right now that we're here let's just see what the clean card subreddit's been doing since uh since the last video right tnt extra expo in new york is this legit or did i waste 40 bucks [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] let's just let's just take a look at what people say use your account to rebound or another thing [Music] well if it last time made you sick and you bought another one come on come on well let's be honest washington state bans iso isomerized tse and recreational marijuana system what is isomerized oregon to limit use of delta eight tac and other artificially derived cannabinoids really this week's lineups from com can in millis massachusetts we get the pax error okay okay friendly farms terp hogs so this is clean cards guys so don't be expecting any like fake ass bougie cards just appearing i know there's probably going to be some because people are you know still going to be questioning what card they have if it's legit or not and uh most mostly on here you're gonna see legit [ __ ] and i'm interested to see what's legit in oregon washington colorado all that stuff so i feel like these videos they uh show shed light into that you know ever more dark safety but recently learned about reagents and leeches during isomerization and when i understand the only d8 that steak will be extracted from real cannabis to avoid these leftover cans and crusts however these are sold in dispensers possibly because of height delta 9. what method which method to make delta 8 is used to get a real clean stuff and not bathroom chems or is it all blue also i don't care about your favorite brand coa unless you got tests for reagents and bleaches i like you you get it from what i understand the only thing this is the case which method to make d8 it could be clean but they did a lot of lots of cleanup work after the synthesis but not real rn no one test enough for us consumers to know and worse every time so far that brand has been independently tested it variably turns out to be low potency and contaminated to be considered clean synthesized or hemp derived d8 must have safety tests for each and every of the following solvents metals pesticides microbes mycotoxins and reagents and bleaches block to prevent the chills from the dirty pizza from telling you to smoke their dirty deed so disturb spark or whatever i think i mentioned him in the last video he's one of the guys that a lot of people are saying is a douche bag in some sort of way and um he brought up some really good valid points you know obviously d8 has to be safe when it comes out from what i've tried from delta it seems like pretty good you know this is just some stuff maybe that they write to scare people honestly i don't know but uh it is some good stuff that they brought up because obviously you would want your delta eight stuff tested as much as your delta knight and i do see that um but speaking for myself the delta eight brands that i've tried delta eight hemp moon walker serene tree all pretty good i didn't taste any you know chemically ass taste or anything it was just you know some good old distillate and stuff um but then again distillate can be you know iffy as well you know you really can't tell um but just be safe you know just be aware of certain brands and just look out for your own health at the end of the day um like i said this this guy right here that brought up the d8 very good questions but uh i'm gonna have to say that the guy that responded is a moderator of this and he's been known to be like questionable you know what i'm saying like i don't know garlic cookies life hazard ross or live hash rosin cartridge clean pleasant trees that's a [ __ ] nice name liquid trite okay yeah this is only a half gram too it's probably worth so much we're selling for so much real or fake there's the flare right there it says fake and y'all i need help bought this from the weed man and i can't tell if it's there's no lighting and it came in a plastic bag came in a plastic bag come on can i post a picture of a few raw ground cards to help try and verify authenticity and see the community's minions 99.5 percent sure they are real from this message just am super skeptical about cards given my poor health but lemonade lemon pepper from cookies in there not bad yeah i don't [ __ ] with i don't [ __ ] with half gram cartridges or i mean i do but i don't [ __ ] with companies that only sell half gram questions i think that is some [ __ ] [ __ ] and i think that that's their way of saying hey i want your money and i want you to pay for less or get less from it so to be honest anything any company that's still to this day only half grams and are selling it for 60 to 70 for a half gram [ __ ] you washington dispensary anyone tried 30 a gram put in a card in the skittles tastes like grape soda with the hint of wine that's crazy this doesn't taste like great so this is delta eight as well and honestly this is one of the smoothest hitting cartridges that i've tried are none like for distillate usually i'm coughing well most of the time when i'm hitting this is plug play and those those pods and that battery they'd be hitting of course you'll be coughing but this is very a smooth this is a very smooth experience i believe moonwalker is also featured in high times too so i don't know if that brings you some sort of uh clarity but i mean it's it's high time right cheers all right where can i get this tested i know it's fake but i'm curious just about how just i'm just curious to how bad found it on my sister come on bro what the [ __ ] is this 1.1 like what stop solvent free 97 tac like what solvent free or solvent lists and there's a difference right i believe solvent free is no solvents in it at the end product solvent list is extracting without solvents so what that's at best is going to be distillate uh making my own cards terps plus delta e can i mix tears in delhi i want to buy from natural extractions so i've read something about we don't really know how much terpenes we're supposed to be in taking so it's not really good to mix terps homemade you know you don't know the right amount you're not a scientist you know what i'm saying and most of these guys on here aren't scientists as well they ain't going to be able to tell you how much terps and all that stuff to mix delta 8 with so just be careful with that do your research uh i recently just saw that article so it could be like some brand new study or something but it says something about not taking too much or too much terpenes might be a bad thing if uh paraphrase it oil forms around oils from local dispensary here in miami truly i think i've seen truly videos and they're from florida so that should be good i don't know uh the cartridge scene in florida so if if true leaves are fake then just be careful you know what i'm saying you eat raw garlic let's see peanut butter bread sauce never seen this [Music] looks okay that looks so lame with their instagram handle right there on that packaging it looks so crafty looks good west coast cars real or fake no comment i do have some west coast wax though actually no more but did i have some very popular in my state i mean you know a couple people with them obviously improvement there's no branding and everything do you think it's fine because they're getting high i'm not sure i'm just going to pass that anyone recognize this brand as a fake oh sorry it's fake live terpenes delta 9 thc distillate cartridge live terpenes huh not live rising terpenes just live terpenes how do you spot a fake delta eight disposable my buddy runs the smoke to tell me this but there's nothing but the paper and vaping inside come on bro getting from a smoke shop albeit there probably are some delta good delta 8 products and some smoke shops but are you willing to take that risk buying it no like when you can buy it online these people these are the type of people that want it right now they can't wait they can't wait to order online they want to go to a smoke shop and get it they want a little club and get it they want to go to their buddy and get it no patience on these guys really all i have access is to black market but dispensary or so can i put that rsl on but it's working possibly it was probably going to make your butt taste like [ __ ] i bought rso before and i thought it was just regular dab i thought hey you know in a syringe it it was black as [ __ ] i dabbed it it tasted like [ __ ] rso is for the medicinal side rso means rick simpson oil and i guess that's the guy who like popularized it or made it or so so uh you basically use it to to fix your ailments you know what you're smoking on tonight that is the yocan right i believe okay cleaner trash this brand from a local dealer there yet [Music] keep fake carts it's your plug okay i'm gonna end this like if you're getting it from the plug 99 of the chance it's fake you know there's maybe a one percent chance that plug can somehow get it from from the real [ __ ] but come on from the plug from snapchat like really that's gonna be end of this clean carts video hopefully you did enjoy this one i believe this is number four or so let me know in the comments if you did enjoy it let me know if you want a part five and uh like i said like when you comment and leave likes it it motivates me to do more of these and like i said i'm gonna try and get this out today today is tuesday tuesdays i usually go live but i'm thinking that since i'm not going live anymore maybe just do reaction videos on tuesday and maybe on friday as well but or rest it just depends on my mood i guess that day but hopefully you did enjoy this video uh like i said let me know if you want to part five and i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] so", "BL60ox4I_Kw": "[Music] ladies and gentlemen it is time it is time that you found out if the new cartridge brand that you purchased is a real company or just a package supplier [Music] so this information comes to us through DAP connection comm none of these are of my own investigation unfortunately so thanks to those guys who have no idea I'm doing this so forgive me and I thought it would have been a good idea it was too good of information and just kind of let go and doing my research on these guys that seems like it's pretty legit info but before we get started consider subscribing and punch that like button in the face if you end up staying or half of the video at least so that a deal deal okay so I'm not sure exactly how to do this [Music] you know what I'm just gonna the bran heads roll well I do a little ranting stay hydrated look I'll tell you right now that I've tried spotting faked packaging and it's always like the Mandela effect sometimes you're just like one comma away from being right and one comma is too big to risk a dead cart so I'm happy that these social medias are getting ahold of testing and sharing the information that we need plus a lot of companies are putting QR codes on packaging as well so you can see that they're legit also most legit dispensaries are posting QR codes of their license so you can check to see if those legit yourself as well the bottom line here is that anyone can make counterfeit carts anyone can make counterfeit packaging it's our moral compass that's the problem why are we gonna be lured in to buy something just because there's like a cute 4/20 nurse in front of us and we don't want to look poor there needs to be a change in the system to help professionals and everyday users identify and trust the brands no one seems to own these packaging companies like Mario karts or dank vapes the trail always seems to end somewhere in China it's too bad because there's a lot of great growers out there who make top-quality stuff if you want to feel safe and you want to be able to trust your purchase then I wouldn't buy from anywhere that isn't regulated I'm seeing way too many people unaware of information that's out there I seen the comes below that people just want to learn and grow and then comes another person it makes fun of them for how little they know this is a time for justice a time for parler everyone should be on the same level of information when it comes to legitimacy so as a bonus I'm gonna show you a few brands that pass testing now I'm not here to say that any of these are safe but they did pass phase 3 testing so do your research and what I mean by research is you know go to the brands website they should have authorized retailer on there and is that place that you got your cart from is it on their authorized retailer list and if not email them or message them on IG you know that's what I did with this cart you know this is a the Jade cart and you know I asked them if you know I got it from ie twin palms and the Inland Empire it's it's definitely a little cheap place to go but you know I mean I'm just that places license you know Jade Jade is licensed too so it's just like I mean everything's everything smells like like like a legit brand you know so plus these insights that display test results helps as well but what if research on your particular brand hasn't been posted yet just because it's a new brand doesn't mean that it's not legit you're gonna start seeing new brands popping up in the next few years a lot of older dealers are gonna start going legit with newly formulated newly tested and labeled content I want to make a video on what to look for when you visit these regulated dispensaries I'll have one coming soon but until then I hope this video was helpful things seem to be getting bitter and more ways for anti counterfeiting is on its way like share subscribe for more videos like this and as always stay safe do research and never babe underage peace", "ZQImEJ1zG9w": "[Music] yo yo what's up guys it's your boy savage back yet again with another review for you guys if you guys didn't know every Friday we try to come out with the banger card tree bu dropping is what is the hottest on the market right now what am i using you know what's poppin what's not and usually we try out some of the best stuff and sometimes we get really really unlucky and end up with some crappy cartridges but for today's video men this video has been a long awaited video I've had a lot of viewers telling me go try this you need to try them they're the best in the market and you know your boy after long time in the works we finally got it coming to you guys so tell you boys without further ado we are gonna be reviewing friendly farms true full spectrum live resin cartridges true full spectrum boys you guys heard that right so for those of you that don't know or have ever heard of friendly farms they're a company based out of them it's where is it somewhere somewhere in San Francisco I believe and they started off just I think they started off from what I believe when I first started following him they were making these sauces and they were popping off man you know that was big and then they switched over to UM cartridges they have dabba related applicators you know all that good stuff and they're just killing it man they're just killing it so after you know having my viewers tell me you guys a guy that I needed to try this I obviously went out hit him up and they were super super nice and generous meant to be like yes for sure ma'am you work together we kind of want you to try it out because they even themselves believe that this is some of the best stuff on the market so I was like kind of happy you know it's good working with the company that that is so friendly you know it's just in their name so what they did though this isn't just a normal you know here's our product give us a good review this guy was like here's our product men give give the gift that make the video and give the people a real review don't sugarcoat it know that stuffin you already know your boy ain't sugarcoating [ __ ] so we're gonna get into this man way to be reviewing some of the best stuff so before we get into this video though they dropped the one new product it's it's not new Prada just a different style and it is hold on hold on one of the worried is that we're gonna lose in truck so it is this one right here so this right here is their cured resin cartridges so basically going to offer their Instagram this is what this is what their cured car cured resident cartridges right so our fresh cured liquid is just like our liquid live except this oil is made from cured cannabis plants rather than freshly frozen as with all friendly forms product zero additives zero dis list so you guys know for sure you you're not you don't have to worry about vitamin E may you don't have to worry about all this fake BS stuff that can possibly get you harm and when when you guys are smoking distillate I just hope you guys know that that you you don't know what's going on because distillate they're adding they're adding additives or added preservatives all this stuff to try to make that oil you know vapor Bowl dude and these guys what they're doing is just straight-up squishing the plant just adding it to a cartridge and shipping it out to you guys and of course your lab testing and all that good stuff so you guys know that you guys are getting some of the top-notch quality like in the game right now that's for sure so without further ado man all that rambling I think it's time we get into the cartridge tasting right so busting out a new battery full unboxing for you guys man so these are their batteries right here the this battery right here has three different heat settings it has a low heat as a medium heat and as a high heat all right so taking it out boo you get your charger in there all that good stuff but I think this is my favorite part right so hopefully this is focused in for you guys and give it a little second but when you turn it on a little rainbow colors so badass right so like I said the three different color settings I'm not really going to get in it's every every battery has has variable wattage at this point but this specific battery is you know prioritized for their own cartridges they give you the best temps and it actually it's actually pretty amazing dude because instead of just having one temperature like most [ __ ] cartridge batteries they switch it up with three and every single eight all three of them is a super different here I'm not even joking you could get a very very subtle hit with the lowest one and then with the high hit you get like a massive dab so that's something that you know how is very very happy with and actually you know what this is the cured resin we're gonna hop I have not tried the cure guys and I have not tried the cured resident all and I have tried the liquid life but I think I'm gonna try a new flavor so this one right here is dude these guys are killing also with the collabs man they've been doing collabs with connecting cannabis and they'd have been doing cold eyes with alien lab so if you guys are fans of those companies already you guys should definitely try out these man because it's literally just the the connected and alien labs cannabis just squished up and put into these cartridges man like friendly farms is doing their thing bro killing the cartridge game so look at this look at this packing around me show you guys the packaging because I feel like not a lot of you know what it looks like so hopefully that's focused in and yeah dude so in the fact that got the lab test results all that good stuff on the on the top they got the manufacturing date all that goody-goody and let's go ahead pull this sucker and then all this way to grow I need to smoke so white to all that good stuff and boom the black tip cartridge so before I get into the actual cartridge I'm gonna show you guys what comes in the box so in the Box you get this little paper right here it pretty much tells you how to use it how to get started with using your cartridge all the good stuff of how it's made why does it my cartridge to look full because as you guys can see right here there's a little gap but it has a lot to do with these cartridges and you know the headspace that it gives you and so this is the most important thing this is the most important thing that's cotton atten before but I haven't really looked into it and I think I might tell you the truth man because this is something pretty amazing I haven't really seen a lot of companies do it it says for every gear for every grand purchase $1 goes to a homeless or youth program in your community and it says thank you thank you you know what man thank you for any farms for being so friendly miss you got to have more companies like them and people who care about the community other than just make it a quick buck and that's something that you know says a lot it says a lot from a company so enough with the BS talking does it get this get the chief and boys so this one right here is the animal style if you guys have ever had the animal style but from connected cannabis it actually looks pretty [ __ ] crazy slap it on there so it's on the green setting I didn't even use it on the green setting right so first look into the animal style friendly farms cartridge Braille collab so let's get it boys hopefully you guys are enjoying the content so far go ahead and leave a like comment subscribe all that good stuff man it helps you boy more than you think and if you guys haven't already man go check these go check this company out if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you already know that the oh man some of the best of the best in the game cheers boys don't fail not sure why they didn't work all right I don't know what was wrong with the other battery but I think it was dead so we put it on a new battery he got it fully charged all the good stuff still on the green setting so let's go ahead and boys first in first try of this animal style so I'm actually pretty excited tell you guys to choose so let's get into oh my goodness oh my goodness well that was like a dad boys oh we did a good thing I need to take a big hit because not that was gonna kill me right immediately immediately off the bat boys the reviews coming in hot get ready so me off the first hit I haven't smoked at all I haven't done anything so I'm already getting a head change in my eyes are getting low I already feel it that's something that you instantly want from the cartridge you don't want to be having to puff and puff until you actually feel something so off of the initial rip your boy is gone no I'm not going but I don't want to say so that taste of that taste was like a really really really like medium to low temp dab just really really tasty in the oil and not even I'm not even talking about like do you know how when you taste distillate you can taste like the oil like this is this is like a good oil man this is like something you really want to tell you so see it's fire dude all right all right let's take another hit and get a full flavor profile see what the effects are going on then what is this I think this is a hybrid right all right this is a hybrid I'm hoping that it's a little bit more indica dominant than any you know animal style seems more like a sativa by the name mmm all right boys Cheers oh man that thing just opens up the pathways bill that literally the lung expansion is immediate and it's smooth it's so smooth like it's smooth but it makes you want to coughs just because you know your lungs are so full your lungs are so full with the greatness oh man in the excel it's just like a relief of stress but when you're exhaling it just like exhale you guys ever heard the term of inhale the good [ __ ] exhale the [ __ ] someone probably was chief in this and made up that quote because this is what it's doing and oh my gosh I'm just in awe dude this is amazing an amazing feeling it went from straight-up head to a full body in full head and I'm just in straight-up chill mode man after a long day of work man this is definitely something enjoyable something I look forward to chiefing on you know with most other cartridges I'm not gonna lie it's like it's there you know you have it you could just have bought it the other day but do you want to hit it probably not what this literally as soon as you can you you're gonna hit it row as soon as you get that a single opportunity to hit this bad boy you will I'm in complete love man there's these days we're gonna have to taste another one so this is a hybrid let's move on to the I think we're gonna move on to another hybrid well no wrong with the sativa so tan G tan G is one of the og strains in the game if you guys don't know the hand she's been around for a while I think oh you remember when I started in here nothing but I'll see what the city was there about usually cities are a lot more like pungent a lot more flavorful I've never tried a sativa in you know in live resin form or true full spectrum light resin form some let's see how that how that tastes us this one's a little bit more full to the oil bro the oil is so crazy looking you guys a little close-up of the oil real quick hopefully that's focused in ya know and I know a lot of people are gonna be like oh I'm turned off by the oil the oil why does it look so dark to like do just understand the concept of what um you know marijuana is a whole man when it comes to making these products like people think people have this you know this natural we're not even natural it's probably just been a rumor that's been going around that people are like oh that clear it is the better when in reality that's not the case at all you know there's rosin and stuff like that that are like white and clear but that's a whole different thing room this is this is literally full spectrum light resin in a cartridge bro and this is what you want this is what you want I'm telling you 100% coming from cybg himself this is what you want in a cartridge you don't want distally you don't want oil man all the other stuff that people are cheating right now is it has it's nothing close compared to this if you guys are able to get your hands on this 18 and over 21 and over whatever it isn't yearly will say if you can even get these just try it just try it so we're going in on the tangi sativa see if it's any any different than the hybrid I feel I'm already fated you I'm showing them but we're gonna do this for the tube cheers boys Oh oh my goodness that was unexpected that is good bro oh my gosh I've never tasted @anjghie that tasted this good like I've tasted tangi before but this is [ __ ] phenomenal whoa in full spectrum mode it's literally like a whole different experience man I'm not gonna tell you guys like you literally can't go out and try anything like this is for this friendly farms cartridge is like something I've never tasted before it doesn't taste like plug and play doesn't taste like city it doesn't taste like wrong guard and this thing is so distinct and so good and my lungs are just so happy because it's like so smooth too and just like it hits the hits in every single aspect bro like the smell the taste the smoothness the from the from the inhale to the exhale everything about this cartridge is phenomenal definitely great so I'm gonna turn it up there you see or think it's premium as a preheat function to on it so this is purple setting I'm not too sure if this is lower hot but what's going on the purple side oh yeah the big boy setting boys that's that put you to sleep sending holy moley yeah that's that punch you right in your face whoo that was a dad with I was phenomenal oh this thing is kidding I'm not even a fan of [ __ ] sativas but this is a hit tangey killed it all right so I guess we're gonna end out the video with where the hell is that I'm tripping all right the blue dream right here so this is the cured resin right this is going to be their newest addition and their newest them yeah their newest addition to the lineup so this is um the cured resin instead of the librarian yeah the liquid live I mean right so right off the bat this is their that then this is their new um cartridge within you well it's the same tip and everything but it's just actually I think it is an encourage holy yeah definitely upgraded well I think it's the same one looks like the same one just a new tip they added a little I mean yeah let me show you guys let me get a little closer yeah so it has a new there this is our logo up here up on the top and the bottom if you I don't know if you guys can repo not because they're reflection but it says friendly farms and the oil and in terms of quality of the oil it honestly comparing your right right away it looks very very similar to their liquid life except this one the liquid live looks does look a little bit more thicker in terms yeah definitely their liquid live looks a little bit more thicker a little bit more um definitely something you would see from a squish plan this one this would like a fresh frozen pie if you guys I've ever seen different types of planets getting squished are like if you guys are into that stuff I know it's kind of weird for me to say this but you guys should definitely go google that in terms of how different types of libraries and suffer made and you guys would really get a really Indian detailed look of how how things look of how things can taste of their their flavor profiles you know their aspects of what what they bring to the charts in terms of TC percentage to body lock you know all that good stuff so I mean get right into it I'm gone I'm faded so cured resin coming in hot boys this is the blue green by the way that blue dream a blue dream when I saw that name it was kind of like you brought me back to like I don't know why Blue Dream has just been one of those things that you know one of those strains that have been around for a while even like I feel like I heard about that straight in like junior high so I'm gonna lie though this new cartridge with the logo on top is it definitely some swag hopefully that's what you're saying alright so cheers boys cured resin let's see if it tastes any different Yushu show you guys a whole difference right I always think that can be able to tell too much about the high I might save this cartridge after hitting this and make you maybe make a full review we'll see about that but cheers boys was gonna do it hmmm I honestly can't even tell the difference in terms of taste it tastes pretty good obviously I can tell the the flavor the length of strain flavor but in terms of like you know when you get a cartridge like even if it's different flavors you still get the same that same little taste like because it's the brand taste you know it's what makes the brand the brand so finally formants did a good job so if you guys want to know like pretty much the Cure they made the cured resin lion just in terms to appeal to more of the consumer base because people I guess were saying that it wasn't too budget-friendly their liquid live and honestly like you know and what I personally have to say if you're going to be doing you know consuming all these cartridges all these all these things you're gonna have to spend the bulk and if you're willing if you want to get some of the best stuff this is a right here man this is it like you you should go out and definitely get this because this is designer weight men you know this is that good stuff this is that good [ __ ] and they made this when the cured resin - like I said appeal to them to people with the lower budget you know people who only want to spend like I'm guessing like thirty thirty-five bucks on a cartridges instead of spending for like 45 so whatever the case is and honestly it's amazing like friendly farms is definitely doing their thing they're killing the game man if you guys are interested their Instagram is gonna be linked down below and you guys can go check out their product they've won multiple awards man definitely I can see why now I'm glad I got to test this out if you guys want to see some of their dab stuff you know these are their DAB sauces and we also got the the applicator we can definitely do something like that if you guys want to see some crazy ass challenge videos man like hitting for friendly farms at once or something like some something crazy man let me know in the comments below what you guys have as an idea and we'll probably do it so yeah get in the video I hear if you guys enjoyed it like I said leave a like comment and they", "T49_ZG_zc9I": "hello ladies and gentlemen i'm here coming with a thc delta eight vape pen review as you see i have it here i'll be doing an unpackaging tool just so you guys can get a real look at it and again this is thc delta 8 vape pen right here um if you guys are not aware yet uh delta 8 thc is actually legal federally you can get this at most smoke shops most gas stations a lot of corner stores um and you guys ask how is thc being legally sold so here's the deal there's delta 8 thc and there's delta 9 thc now delta 9 thc is the chassis that gets you extremely high and which is what is found in all of your marijuana and regular flour whatever you care to call it um so delta nine and thc a are the main psychoactive ingredients in marijuana and those ones are still illegal so you can't get any cartridges or vape pens that are just regular thc delta 9 or taca the main two active ingredients in marijuana that gets you high as [ __ ] basically excuse my french um so right here i have a delta eight one now the main difference is delta eight is missing a few atomic bonds is what they like to call it which makes it legal um it is a little bit less psychoactive but it still gives you a nice high and it's not cbd this is delta 8 thc this is not cbd but this does have some cbd in it and as you see here i have the treetop hem company it's a 700 milligram vape pen delta eight and one actually one of my favorite strains right there blue dream i love me some blue dream and that's cool part about these things it's just like your regular thc it comes in different strains um and again this became legal in 2018 it got approved by the agriculture improvement act here and the company i have here is a treetop hemp company that sells the delta eight thc pins and as you see i'll let you guys examine the packaging and i'll do an unpackaging so you guys can get a real look at it and again here's you must be over 21 to order this product um they as you see they have a suggestion date when they use it by so basically i got a year with this and they even have their website here this is shopyourthcbd.com so as you see this company sells cbd also um and also here too you see like i said um this product is in compliance with the section 10113 of the 2018 farm bill and it contains less than 0.3 percent d9 thc like i said d9 is the active the main active ingredient that gets you high in marijuana this is not d9 thc this is d8 thc and as you see where it says contains is hemp derived d8 thc it also has your cbd in it which is great cbn and contains like again less than 0.3 percent of d9 thc um i'm not sure exactly what cbn is i'm assuming it's similar to cbd but it also has that in it i'm sure it's just your regular hemp and the ingredients here as you see are contains canniboids delta eight and is flavored using terpenes and the great part of it is uh here it's domesticated i live in new york but as you see this was made in california so it's a domesticated product to see what's product i think these are pretty dope i already smoked um a couple of these before and it definitely gives you a high like i said it's less psychoactive the high might not last as long but it definitely does give you a high delta hthc right here we have um and i'll do it on packaging just give me one second so we have it here they put in a nice little concealed plastic packaging too again this is the blue dream strain as you see it says it right on it looks like it has it on the the pen itself too which is pretty cool tree top hem company shout out to the treetop him company let me go ahead and just open up this uh plastic packaging too all right here you go so it basically looks like your regular vape pen but um there's no tobacco or nicotine inside this ladies and gentlemen this is delta 8 thc like i said this is legal federally so you can get this at most smoke shops corner stores or even gas stations here in the united states [ __ ] i don't know if i can go ahead and just uh hopefully it's already working so i'm go ahead and hit it see what it does oh yeah that's a nice smoke oh that's like extremely nice smoke got me coughing so like i said guys next time you go to the smoke shop or gas station or corner store see if they have delta 8 thc there's a variety of different companies that are making them um the research i did on this company they're actually pretty good pretty good quality there's no nicotine in this no tobacco and all the [ __ ] this is actually a pretty good one right here 700 milligrams so i'm already i already feel it feels good too so again guys this is delta 8 thc vape pen um they're legal here in the united states this is not delta 9 thc that's the main the main active ingredient that gets you high in marijuana and um it is not thc a which is other main active ingredient in marijuana that gets you high this is delta 8 thc which is basically scientifically just different by a few atomic bonds if i want to get rick and morty on you guys and that's the main difference is just the main difference is really just how it's made what it's made out of and um the us technically has not uh made this illegal thc the thc that made it legal is like i said delta 9 thc and thc a and this is delta 8 thc and it still gets you high um and like i stated before it doesn't get you as high as your regular thc and when i say regular chc i just mean delta 9 thc and thc a but uh it definitely does get you high and um you can get a variety of strains i got this from a smoke shop a good smoke shop here in my neighborhood i live in new york state so um they had a variety of streams they had like i said as you see here i got blue dream they even had girl scout cookies they had wedding cake they had a sour diesel they had a bunch of them so you can even get your favorite strain out of this shout out to the treetop him company again that hit i took earlier definitely uh definitely did uh feel nice so again guys delta 8 thc is legal here um the main difference between the illegal thc is just a few atomic bonds so next time you go to your local gas station or corner store or smoke shop act if they got delta delta 8 thc and try it out yourself guys um these things are good i know they just don't have them in these vape looking things they also have them in cartridges cartridges excuse me um i actually have a cartridge myself and you look at the cartridge most of the the delta eight cartridges it's a clear liquid in size which is unusual um when you usually buy just the regular thc delta nine uh cartridges you're usually some type of color to them but every time you get a delta eight cartridges uh it's a clear liquid which i find uh i don't know i don't think about it to be honest with you i don't know if that if it being clear makes it a better quality or whatever you want to uh call it but this vape pin right here delta eight vape pen definitely hits nicely so hey guys that's my review shout out to the treetop hem company again and um as you see their website right there shop your thc cbd.com and now you must be over 21 to purchase this product ladies and gentlemen and that hit i took earlier i'm already feeling high so this thing definitely does its job it's more than cbd don't get don't get this confused with cbd guys this is not cbd this is thc it does have cbd in it but it's predominantly thc delta eight so yeah you guys have any questions or concerns leave your comments i've been smoking these for probably about over a month now so i can't complain too much and that's a wrap stay blessed ladies and gentlemen and stay high", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the

videos over to eric whatever guys shop.com or whatever guys shop at gmail.com or the whatever guy handyman at gmail.com all right so moving on from that as you guys know today's tuesday man and we're moving up on this ship man shipband's coming up march 27th um and like i said we're still not 100 sure other than the fact that we know that the end consumer is going to have an issue getting uh stuff shipped to them through usps fedex or the postal service however we do know that the one way to get around uh this shipman is to be a business have a business license and get wholesale accounts now for you folks out there that don't know you can easily apply for an ein with the irs which is totally free and get a business license or you know if you've got these convenience stores or these vape shops around your area and you'd like you know go ahead and combat this uh vape band from the get-go because really the vape band was designed to it was not designed to touch delphi really what it was designed to do was to touch these e-cigs and it was designed to put the onus on store owners to check um the ids of these guys coming in and getting these uh vape products but with way the way they wrote the law of and they stuck this in the pork of the stimulus bill the first year um but the way they wrote the law it actually extends out and touches everything bait and so as of march 27th um i've heard march 27th april first april 26th but on this channel we're going to talk about march 27th is the closest day uh you know uh you know prepare for the worst and hope for the best um but the the but the deal is that uh you guys can get those get those people to get wholesale accounts contact me at 334-830-8151.com let them get a wholesale account uh if they've never had deltae products in their store before they will not have created any bad habits by starting you know to get stuff that we've reviewed on this channel uh but if they have delta e products in their store um we'll send them out free samples man and they'll find out that what we're talking about on this channel is the real deal and they'll also find out that the prices are much better than what they're getting from those distributors off the truck you take that m a smoke shop or any of these uh just you know these local convenience stores around here they're all dealing with the same distributor and they all have basically the same stuff in their shop and that distributor doesn't know anything about delta a doesn't know anything about cbd he's just looking for a mass-produced product and that comes at a price of low quality and and you take uh you know her down there at the mma smoke shop she's got everything that she ever got off those watered-down delta a carts off that distributor truck for 35.99 and you got and she's got delta farms and blue moon in there for 34.99 personally it wouldn't matter to me if it was 45.99 because like i said before the purpose of this channel is to find the best lda products we can and um obviously you know my goal is to hope you know is the hope that you guys don't make the same mistakes i can if you see a you know you see me do a review on here it's a crappy product hopefully you guys will gravitate towards something that's a little bit better so moving on from that um uh talking about just letting you guys know i got a letter from a guy today or uh talking on youtube and he's over in the uk and we're talking back and forth and he's trying to get some stuff shipped over to him and he asked about this notice to law enforcement now there's a lot of companies out there that are putting this notice to law enforcement in their um in their packages when they send out usually it's a piece of paper as you can see blue moon is a little bit of cardboard box but basically this is just a letter to the law enforcement man letting them know uh that this is a hemp product that is you know it's totally legal totally illegal to buy over the counter to any at any business in the united states i think there's a couple states that actually do regulate it like three or four five i believe but either way uh the majority of the states this is this is legal all the way around and i think those states that that don't have it in theirs because they haven't figured out how to regulate it yet but the fact of the matter is the 2018 farm bill makes delta eight a hemp derived product totally 100 federally legal okay and that's what this card is and for you folks out there that are riding around and i'm guilty of this too i've been preaching this for quite a while you should have one of these in each one of your vehicles just throw in the glove box um you can throw in your centerpiece or whatever the case is uh the ones that are pieces of paper like i said you go to my my site which is whatever guy shop.com and you can go down into the blog and you can find notice law enforcement and download that okay and just keep a copy of that in your wallet man you know if you're walking around hanging out and then it's let's be honest man if i was to roll up on you and you were smoking you know you were vaping this or you were hitting on any of this stuff here i know for a fact you know i at least in my mind i think that you were smoking pot so let's be honest man in a cool way now and again this might not save you you know i understand this is a market employee but you know but why not try it you know what i mean it may save you some trouble at least at least add a little bit of uh uh you know genuine uh what you're telling is the truth when they pull you over and they get this we had a guy out in north carolina got pulled over for and i haven't still heard the end of this yet by the way but i got a message from a guy over north carolina he gets pulled over and because his delta farm stuff smelled like him and they thought it was uh and they thought it was weed they took it from him and they were going to test it for uh i guess stealth and i thc i'm assuming that he's okay because it obviously doesn't have any delta knight toc in it um but the fact of the matter is it smells like it it looks like it and you and it does the same effect some of the same effects as delta intc so why wouldn't it be that you know so if you're a cop you know i get it but if you're if you're the end consumer man it's just cool man to keep one of these in your car man unless you just be safe all the way around okay so as you guys know i'm in my location down here in pine hill alabama and we've been remodeling this place for a while uh running up on a deadline for myself you know basically and like i told you guys before i've been doing a lot of handyman work i've run hand-in-hand business and i had gotten away from that recently uh more or less you know doing stuff online but as i need the money to remodel this store here i've been doing um some handyman work and so the lady missed carol smith over in sweetwater alabama that i've been working for the last couple weeks and i've got some other work scattered around but she's she's my main focus of work i've been looking for some kitchen cabinets for a couple weeks and um i had went to meridian and bought some kitchen cabinets and they just weren't the right ones uh you know i ended up keeping them from my store but the fact that matters i ended up running over montgomery alabama um uh yesterday to pick up uh a drawer set and another kitchen cabinet for her and was at home depot over on east boulevard in montgomery alabama now when i left when i went in there i had a certain amount of money that i was going to spend and i ended up getting the drawer cabinet for like half off because it had this little damage on it that i could easily fix and so i was you know when i walked out i was kind of stoked i actually had extra money in my pocket the first thing i did was got on and started looking for vape shops so the first place i went to i ended up stopping at the only place i ended up stopping at because i got what i needed right there at haiti's apes uh this place is a heavy base in montgomery alabama so 505026 vaughan road uh the phone number is 334-398-8691 i went in there yesterday and i walked in and immediately somebody said hey welcome to heady vapes and so i got in there and i got to talking around and there was two guys in there one was a big round one was a skinnier guy i could tell that the bigger guy was really not happy with me asking questions that i was asking i was probably asking some questions uh that were probably more designed for the owner i just felt like you know with them being working in the store that they might have a little bit more knowledge on it i think the one question i asked him was if he had because they actually have their own brand of delta eight in that place and i was really interested in that because as i said before we're talking about this talking about this vape man and all that coming up you know i wanted to go in and see if they had some flowers and vapes and stuff like that and i actually ran across some good stuff um so i was asking you know what i asked you was i said if you had one product to put forward and you know you know for your brand what would it be and of course the guy was a little bit edgy about it now the other guy he was extremely knowledgeable um both of them were knowledgeable but one guy i think was a little bit uh you know and i recognize it because i get it myself had a little bit of anxiety about me asking me questions and stuff like that i get it man because i'm in the same boat that's why i do the uh delta eight in the first place and i apologize for that um but the other guy uh actually the first guy that i talked about that i thought maybe was getting a little anxious to be asking questions he introduced me uh to their flower they have they have their own flower at uh heady vapes in montgomery alabama uh this one is the kush and then one is the diesel they don't have it's not og kush it's just kush and diesel what i did was they had one gram uh cups like this for ten dollars a piece and i was able to pick each of those out because that's what he recommended and then the other guy apparently he might be the vapor out of the group he was the one that recommended this earthy now uh vape card lemon skunk vape card that i got so uh this is their brand and heady vapes now i don't know if they have any um wholesale accounts i don't know if they're doing any mail order i know they don't have a website um i i go into these stores and i wonder you know what they're thinking about you know it's almost like they're trying to hide a secret but the fact you know how you know secrets bro i mean here's the deal if you had the secret to cancer why would you hide it i mean my but i you know everybody thinks i got like corn on the market you know you could fill these up in your own backyard if that's what you wanted to do folks so you're not cornering a mark or anything like that um he's got this guy here man this earthy now is a really good product um there's a couple issues about it that i don't know i can tell obviously that he's not trying to ship these out he's probably not trying to get any further than what he's got going on that little corner market he's got going on um i i you know i think that's a a mistake you know by not branching out that's just my opinion um i'm gonna try to contact this guy later on and find out if he's got wholesale accounts any type of affiliate things going on like that because uh really what i found was between these two flowers um these are really good flowers that they've got infused with delta a okay and this car is a really good car before i even made it to the interstate i knew i had a good car uh as you can see it doesn't have any coas on it okay but um i'll read the back of it here and it says this is earthy now and it contains less than point three percent delta intc uh for ages 21 and over do not operate machine or vehicle while under the influence of this product consult a healthcare professional before using effects of hemp products may be delayed after two hours do not consume more than once every 12 hours this product may cause you to fail a drug test that's true all right and if you look on the side it's uh says lemon skunk and then the other side is from cannabinoid rich organic hemp but again we don't have any uh any milligrams of delta atc we don't have any coas on or anything like that um there's uh really nothing else on here it's just uh in a sense i mean other than the fact that this is a really [ __ ] good car this almost looks like a garbage like a like a gas station car like if i had walked into a gas station and saw this i wouldn't buy this at all um so the packaging is a little innocuous um i think that they could probably do something better with the packaging but that doesn't take away from what's inside this car man this is a really really good card the only down draw the cart that i saw um that i as you can see i've used i'll put my hand up behind it it's got a nice gold tint you can see there's quite a bit out of it because i've been vaping on it um you know all day yesterday or at least half a day yesterday and you know and some this morning um and i've baked on it pretty good uh it's a really viscous liquid as you can hold it over i'll hold it over where you guys can see um and obviously it's not moving hand behind it again this is a white ceramic tip with a metal core uh these look like viton seals um and this and let me tell you something the little skunk's got like a like a earthy lemon um almost like like a pine tree set next to a lemon tree like like if you could combine those smells that you know that that taste um that aftertaste that's what you get with this lemon scum but the effects man the effects are like way way up there um these are this is right up there with delta farms right after a blue moon um as a matter of fact um i would i would suggest to say that this is probably a little bit you know as far as like delta farms goes you know they got that totally they kind of lend towards more the the earthy flavors and then you got blue moon that kind of lends towards more the the discrete buyer this one sits slam in the middle because you got the earthy and the in the in the like fruity added together in in one cart and um this the effects are extremely good the only down draw that i saw this card is like after a while when i vape on it it did the tube in the middle did get a little bit restricted but it never got stopped up so and i'm going to continue to vape this and obviously when we do the weekly app on saturday maybe i'll have a little bit more information if i get down towards the end of the car that's had any issues or anything like that that's kind of what the weekly rap is designed for this is a really good car like i said you guys can contact teddy vapes over at 5026 vaughn road in montgomery alabama the phone number is 334-398-8691 you guys give him a call see what he's about and have that and tell that dude that you saw his uh reviews on the whatever channel on the whatever guy and that you want a code of whatever to get some percentage off when you walk in that store down there or possibly um get to the point like i said i've got this uh cush in this diesel and i will tell you this the kush is a really good because i've already had some of my pipe i'll do a review on it either tomorrow the next day these are really good delta eight infused uh hip flower i told you before um i this i probably rank this right up there with the moon rocks of uh hometown heroes so we'll talk about that later on i didn't open up the um the diesel yet but uh because i wanted to wait for the end but i couldn't wait to do the kush um so i'll talk to you guys about that probably tomorrow hey folks it's tuesday it's whatever guys signing off i told you guys to stick around the end i'll tell you how you can win yourself a brand new bottle of these nasa softgels from over at leafystock.com don't forget you can go to leafystock.com use code whatever to

this up and you can take whichever one you want and I'll just take the second in the same breath you want it yeah get a hot bag yeah hiking yeah this our DS looking a lot more buttery and sugary than the planetary og so um I mean it I understand why this would taste a lot more fruity because it's harder and it keeps a lot more of the flavor in but this is probably gonna smoke and get me higher yeah like yeah this this sour this our DS is super super buttery and I'm excited as hell there was a little glob stuck to the side that looked a little wetter than the rest of it and he kind of picked it off on one of the sides here and it looks really just kind of notes with the two either using oh that's that's the best okay oh yeah getting that titanium nice and red-hot I'm thinking I'm gonna dab you first okay sounds good and then you take the cold one yeah yeah Wow state [ __ ] I'm dead", "Z3QMe5rXwUU": "[Music] what's up club lives are here and today we're talking about fake cartridges there are so many cartridge friends out now carvanha flavor brands jetty extracts heavy hitters king penn exotic cards so many brands and manufacturers now it's very difficult to figure out whether or not the product that you got is a clean genuine cannabis cartridge so we have 5 ways for you to determine whether or not what you're puffin on is the real deal if you feel in this content and you want to see more videos like this hit that subscribe button down below the like button shoot me a little feedback in the comment section we're trying to build community here so let me know packaging on legitimate genuine cannabis cartridges are very distinct and there are a couple things that you should look for a genuine cartridge we're gonna use this carvanha here for example a genuine cartridge always has the potency information listed on a sticker as opposed to printed on the box so if you see here the carvanha the carvanha potency is on that little white label I could peel it off with my finger if I wanted to that's not necessarily true for this flavors brands which claims that it's 91% on the box I can't take this off the reason why this is an issue is because each batch of oil needs to be tested individually depending on what state you're from every state regulates the cannabis oils differently and a third party has to test these not and ready oh gee so there is no way that they can know that this is 91% if your package comes with the potency pre-printed on it it's probably fake [Music] next is the bubble test if you don't know the bubble test is check out my video on streets disease versus legit disease will be bubble test of streets is e and aced is e that I pick up from the clinic and the bubbles move at different rates high quality cannabis oil or distillate moves a little slower than whatever junk they're putting in these cartridges so I'll pull the bubble test for you guys for my example cartridges for you to see but this is a great way for you to tell if what you're getting is booth and homemade or the real deal if your bubble races to the top is probably fake so we're doing a classic bubble test to compare our raw garden cartridge to this flavors brand and andragogy cartridge compare how fast these bubbles are moving you can see for yourself which one has the thicker oil [Music] the next way to tell if your cartridge is fake is brand recognition packaged counterfeiters have gotten very good and there are certain brands that they are known to counterfeit repeatedly brands like kingpin Stiggy plug and play oh man I've seen stuff called pissing excellence there are certain brands that don't have the cachet as a lot of their legal counterparts if you live in a if you live in a illegal State this may be harder for you to ascertain but for the most part if you here in California or in Nevada most brands have a well distinguished brand identity you should be able to Google their name find their website find out information about them if your cartridge is lacking in any of those areas it's probably fake the next way to tell if your cartridge is boof is through the cartridge design itself most manufacturers who exist in the legal market try very hard to distinguish themselves from the pack there are so many cartridge brands out here but this is the hervana C cell you see the custom bottom here a unique great tip here is the raw garden C cell note the plastic on the tip and the bottom and then at the bottom there's also an embossing like a chrome embossment saying raw garden extra touches extra touches now if we're gonna if we're gonna compare that to our suspected Street cart this andretti OG it didn't come with a tip on the top not nearly the level of customization here not nearly the level of customization and personal touch that you would find on other brands so if your brand is lacking in some of these little accouterments might be booth last way you know whether or not your cartridge is legitimate genuine or fake is through the taste test sometimes you just know if you get an uncharacteristic burning in your new clean your mucous membranes like your nose or your mouth or the back of your throat it might be a boof cart get brands are known to add things like MCT or botanical terpenes that may add a certain harshness to your hit however trust your instinct on this one if it's burning too much if it feels really uncomfortable if you're finding a little bit of irritation in your throat or your nose after vaping one of these it's probably fate well that's it you guys thank you for watching be sure to

jazzy reviewing the flav rx or i'm sorry it's no longer a flavor rx just the flav one milliliter premium refined cannabis oil ultra slim disposable and rechargeable i said it disposable and rechargeable all all-in-one oil pod and battery so this is lemon hey sativa convenient yeah this is this is super cool it is basically a disposable pen that is a full gram and it is rechargeable so we are here i'm going to open it up you let them know what the what is the say on the like the strain the the lemon haze okay this classic packaging pretty dope and then we look and dropped it here we're looking at the uh the actual device you can see the color of the oil a little bit is gold outside see if we can get out there and there you go nice little gold paint it's beaut it's a beautiful little vape almost looks like a usb drive nice and slick you know it reminds me of jules it honestly does it just reminds me of jewels so one hit review i'm gonna talk about it two hits four out of ten full review available on respectmyregion.com slave doing it big coming in hot working too hard rip it too hard yeah it doesn't say it doesn't oh it does have ingredients uh it says ultra refined cannabis oil so ultra refined is going to be distillate uh just as terpenes and then it says instructions press your lips against the mouthpiece and begin vaporizing by taking a three second drop oops so too big of a draw there that was probably fine misusing it is a common thing in vapes so here we go so you get a fat rip it's definitely potent you can taste the fruity terpenes tastes botanical does not taste like weed yeah definitely tastes like fruits and whatever else natural terps it's a little harsh it's a little harsh i'm sure it was hard for you because you took a long one yeah um i think someone who likes flavored things would probably like those products it rips i mean manufactured 722 it's going to be good until next year 7 22. i'm high you're high off that first i mean 86.84 total cannabinoids is a potent product in regards to you know thc in the best of the world it's not in the 90s by any means but when you combine some good terpenes um it can really get the job done so yeah it's so light it's very it's very light i i like i like how it feels i like how it hits um i like how it's branded i like the flavor there on both sides i think it's super dope it's a little slick for me i would like it to be a little bit more coarse and it does light up here in green when you do hit it on the second hit it's still pretty harsh for botanical terpenes and a disposable vape i think yeah it's definitely harsh look at the quality product would i recommend it not to anybody that wants live resumes or someone that wants the best of the best i think this is great for someone who's on the go very discreet maybe a cbd distillate vapor someone who is really looking for that super lemon haze like if super lemon haze is your favorite this tastes really good doesn't taste like real weed but it does taste really good so i'd say it's worth checking out score out of 10 though a flat eight for me i'm at a 7.5 maybe even a seven it just comes down to the packaging doesn't say what kind of terpenes it is doesn't give you the terpene profile and then the harshness like it just leads into this slippery slope of if you would have just told us that it was botanical terps and i would know in fact what it is and why it's happening oh nothing too just rechargeable disposable on their instagram um price point wise it's not even that expensive either so i mean if your you know disposables are your thing and you want to recharge it and um i don't know why you don't want to i mean i don't think you can change out the pod on this so i'm keeping my eight because it's just like it's convenient it's a full gram so maybe it's gonna die before you rip through the full ram i guess it's rechargeable but it can still die you just have to recharge it that's what i'm saying i feel like 7.5 final score for me i think it is what it is shout out to flav dope product uh definitely go check it out you guys this is another west coast week two review mail we're just keeping it real jazzasaurus j

memorized this is the real deal i appreciate you guys for the love i'll see you on the road", "q7dowCeZCa8": "to follow down like what's up guys simplistic here back with another video it is another cartridge video and it's a it's a friend that I've tried like two three years ago when I like started getting into cartridges it is the Blum brand you know saying all that good stuff but it is their life resin yeah so like I said I'm not the first person to do this I've seen some videos online but I am gonna do my own rendition of a video you know I'm saying but as you can see it says live resin hundred percent cannabis no additives all that good good stuff and as you can see it is galactic check and I like to mention that this is the first time me blazing today so it is technically going to be a wake and bake so you know saying let's just continue on so we got Delta 9 THC I believe it's running at 71 point seven four percent and I believe there's also some THC a I think 13 percent yeah 13 percent just in case you guys can't see we're going in for a little bit any guys good [ __ ] alright and also this was tested by canna safe by us thicker so how you tell that most of the time when you get something legit they're gonna have a sticker separate from the packaging like it's another sticker that they put on that's the the testing sticker that they put on but as you can see tested by canna safe I actually could not go on I didn't go on there being I couldn't find the test results but I heard canna safe is a really really legitimate company testing company so we're just gonna take their word for it big oil also does the stuff for I believe Bear labs so that's pretty interesting but it says contains no additives PG VG or vitamin e acetate I mean it has a CBD and CBN but minuscule minuscule so let's open this get my trusty lighter bro you guys don't know what the light of bro is I'm excited whoo my breast this is only $40 I have the receipt guys so I have them see here see out the door so is 29 but then you add the tax so about 40 dollars total I would say positive s but I bought it last minute all that good stuff the bloom break it's a very raw garden esque look very light fairly light in here sorry about that guys so push this yes definitely this is library I'd be a lot darker no blue thumbnail here this is a raw garden part basically this new [ __ ] laughing jack I get freaky by the way this is the death bait retro if you guys haven't seen that video already very very dope battery cheese boys let's turn that up a bit so they recommend 3.5 voltage so let's just try that but very similar to raw cardoon Wow it's cheaper to buy like five books it's a very lemony taste as you would assume from galactic Jack right but very very raw garden esque I would say very very good I like it like if I took this hit and I looked at the cartridge I would have thought its raw garden to be honest that's crazy cheers boys damn it the taste is there it's like I'm just looking sucked on a lemon ooh not gonna lie I'm very impressed you know for something to be of quality of raw garden five dollars cheaper you really can't go wrong with it it's a different brand you know so I had to try it bloom form the other strains that they had were also sativa so I'm probably just gonna assume that they tasted very similar to each other but as far as this brand goes or this live resin cartridge both very very good it's a lot lighter than your typical live resins very reminiscent of raw garden so I mean if you like rock garden you're gonna love this but like if you're looking for that dark type of [ __ ] this isn't like if it doesn't matter to you you know the color of the the live resin or whatever and this is good you know 40 I believe I paid 40 exactly for this so it's definitely not bad you know there's buddies that cost 42 there's select that costs 45 raw garden that costs 45 this $5 cheaper in and the same quality of raw garden I believe so uh yeah pretty a pretty high in THC 280 three point six three you take one more hit for you and I will probably get an end the video I'm probably gonna blow it out there to see just to show you how much smoke we actually get so cheers boys all right there you have it yourself get out of your head out of your mind going flying don't forget what I said keeping a lot of shits are so good out of your head adding a mind-blowing I don't forget what I said I found all of you still having doubts now like how it the distance is so wait yo and the drone waiting for some booze back by my time [Music]",

so far I likey and I know I'm out [Music]", "76etd8Ye6BA": "[Laughter] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "3qqP7SXaAVE": "hi tim here i just wanted to talk about one of the new cartridge products that we got called core pods this is the core pod hawaiian haze is the flavor of this one these are a little different than all the other cartridges that we carry and that they're not actually a cartridge they're a pod system so it's going to use a different type of battery than the standard c cell that the rest of our our cartridges use but i really like these they hit really well they have really good strains this one is hawaiian haze it has like a really nice smooth coconutty flavor really smooth hits really strong and it's from the brand core which if you tried any of our tiara grow flower it's the same same company that's making these core pods really high quality i just really like them be sure to make sure you have the right battery to go with them if you do get them but it's definitely worth the investment to get the battery because they're great great price great effect i really like", "H-mgfusUK-4": "[Music] [Music] what it do youtube man welcome back to the garden we're gonna do a quick little update kind of busy today but so yeah some of our seeds sprouted white rhino one and two both of those super silver haze we did have a little disaster moment [Music] uh one of our blue spanners tragically met its end so we put another one in here another bruce banner and uh one of our gorilla skittles sadly medics in so i didn't have another one so i put gorilla glue and be our other bruce banner hopefully one of these will pop soon some big news these are our granddaddy purple and as you can see [Music] they're rooted so i'll let those get a little bigger and then we'll put them in the soil and that's all that's going on in this tent let's move on over to our 3x3 and yeah look at that we put up our trellis we got two granddaddy purples one two two strawberry cups one two we went ahead and put up our trellis net this is how i like to grow i like to just bend stuff down into the trellis helps me get that canopy you see today will be the first day of flower for these girls they'll be going off at six got him lollipop up to a certain point and really all we're doing in this one is just spreading them out as they go we'll probably keep doing that up until the third week of flower um yeah giving them nutrients letting them grow you see nice and healthy super healthy thing in here looks really good oh there you go on a new update we're exhausting these tents out each one's got their own fan pushing it it just flies off to go out of the inlet but so we got that helping us control the temperature in here a little bit and in our three by three flowering granddaddy purple and as you can see we're in flush mode right now we're flushing all the leaves are turning yellow there's some monster colas it's a big boy now that's a big boy and you can definitely ah so so good you can definitely see the difference in these two phenols this one has more pointy cone shaped buds and this one has these round fat colas when they see these are more pointed but we're starting to get color in these leaves are actually getting purple so we'll see what actually oh that's so sticky these will be coming out pretty give you soon little tour of all the goodness yeah so these will be coming out next week probably depending on our trichomes i looked at them they're partly cloudy still got some clear in there not really any amber yet but as soon as we start getting that amp it's time to put in our little veg stand here [Music] we have our blueberries still doing their thing and we're still running this experiment these are being tied down lst and these have been super cropped and you can see those bins are nice and strong now got two little blueberries here and a pheno one granddaddy purple which is that one and yeah really that's always going on it's just slow boogie at the moment nothing really too exciting just getting it going i'm excited for this tent by the time it gets up to you know this is just gonna be a monster tent yeah just a quick little update y'all have a blessed day", "cior4pVoKCA": "hi guys I'm Dan HOF chief operating officer of honey stick and today we're gonna give you guys from popular demand a little tutorial on 510 thread stick vape batteries now we've been getting a lot of questions on what the differences are between different types of stick batteries so this quick video is gonna give you guys a nice little tutorial about what the key differences are between stick batteries and a lot of these we actually do sell so the first question is what is 510 thread 510 thread is the actual thread adapter that is used by a majority of vape cartridges these are cartridges they're prefilled with CBD or different medical oils that you can pick up at your dispensary and what companies will do is they will pre-fill these so that you buy just a cartridge and then you go and purchase and attach it to your own battery in order for you to be able to vape so 99% of the cartridges sold in dispensaries and CBD shops use what is called a 5-10 thread which is actually just the threading of the cartridge now not only do prefilled cartridges use this but a lot of just vape products like even slim wax adapters like our silencer they also use a 5-10 thread so they can appeal for the dabbing crowd so once you've figured out what you want to vape then it comes down to picking your battery and what the differences are between your batteries and what i've done is i've narrowed them down to four main types of batteries the first one and one of our most popular ones is the twist style battery so it has a 5-10 thread which will allow you to screw in the cartridge like for example our performance cartridge to screw that into the battery so it has a 5-10 thread adapter there or an end right there it has a push button which means that you have to push hold the button throughout your inhale and because it's a twist battery it has a little twist knob here that allows you to adjust the intensity of your vape and this one goes between 2 volts and 4 volts 4 volts being higher giving you greater intensity now how do you turn this battery on once you have your vape Karcher attached you simply push this button 5 times to turn it on 1 2 3 4 5 and you see it's gonna flash and that means that you are ready to vape once your cartridge is on there now most of these twist batteries ours included does have a preheat function on it for when you're using a cartridge for the first time there's thick materials in there that need to be preheated before you can vape and that's achieved by pushing the button when it's on twice in succession so you push it twice rapidly one two and you see the LED is changing colors there that means there's going through a low voltage preheat to get your cartridge right of vaping at any time during the preheat you can push the button to exit so that is our twist battery it is very simple to use not a lot of clicking adjustable power there nice 510 battery these are a high capacity and they come in several colors I brought along the multicolor in the red and we actually even just launched a brand new carbon fiber version which it uses real carbon fiber so there's a real carbon fiber version right here the other battery is a 5-10 variable voltage non twist battery so you have your 510 adapter here that you can screw your cartridges into or of a products that you buy like for example your prefilled cartridge show you guys we're prefilled one looks like so here's a pretty little prefilled cartridge simply screw it on in there this one is a variable voltage but it's a non twist this is actually a pass-through as you can see a pass-through meaning that the charging port is here at the bottom so you can actually if you're vaping and it's running down or you're one of those people who works at your desk or in your car you can have it plugged into microUSB have the battery on in succession while you're charging the battery which means you don't have to take off the cartridge to screw in a charger so this one does not have a twist function on it this has just a button but you still have variable voltage and preheat the difference is is that you would change the voltage by clicking the buttons and Wogan that so to turn the unit on you click the button five times rapidly one two three four five as you see it blinks right there now it's on if you wanted to go in to preheat as we do it the other battery same thing push the button two times one two and you can see the LED again is going into the color change mode you can exit that at any time to get out of preheat mode and if you want to change the voltage what you do is you push the button three times quickly one two three and what you'll notice is that the LED changes different color now what that signifies there is that now you're on a different voltage level so your power intensity has been adjusted and this battery actually comes with three voltage settings three different intensity levels and you can cycle through them by just clicking the button three times one two three now you see the LED turn blue so blue red and green so that shows your variable voltage nan twist five ten stick battery for your reference the other battery that I've outlined is a 5-10 thread a lot of people refer to this as a stylus because it has a little stylus tip that people used to use for their Palm Pilots and you could use for your cell phones and touchscreen devices but as you will notice this battery is a standard it's a buttonless battery so it doesn't have a button on it so what you do is when you put your cartridge on there you don't have to turn it on or anything like that just make sure it's charged all you have to do is inhale so it's a different action you don't push and hold the button throughout the duration your vape as the other two batteries we showed you you just simply inhale and it will turn it on a couple of things to point out at this battery so a lot of companies do sell batteries like this we don't because for auto draws to fire ceramic cartridges they have to be much more powerful and we offer auto draw models like our elf concealers and elf twist but they provide a lot more power so they can fire ceramic cartridges that have thick heaters this little battery doesn't have much power to fire some of the more modern cartridges the other thing is it to be Auto draw it requires your cartridges to have an air hole at the bottom like this one let's see if we can zoom in to make sure people see that there's an air hole here so this cartridge has an air hole which means that when you inhale it lets the air travel through the cartridge which then reacts with a little sensor microphone in the battery that signals the battery to turn on into vaporize now if we take a look at these two cartridges we'll notice that they don't have air holes so you would technically not be able to use these two cartridges on this Auto draw battery stylus battery when you would be able to vape them just fine with the twist batteries I showed you before or the non twist variable voltage battery that I showed you just before that so that's just a little bit to keep in mind when you're selecting your 5/10 or your perfect 510 third stick battery now the last battery that's pretty popular is this ego style battery now this is a 510 and also stick battery and I see a lot of people carrying these with cartridges that ask however you'll see this is a little bit different than this because look at the the difference this this right here is flattened flush where you screw the cartridge in and this one kind of pokes out and you have this exposed piece that's because there's two different 510 threads is your standard 510 cartridge thread so it's your 510 C thread and this one is your 510 ego thread an ego thread means that there used to be cartridges for a liquid that would screw on to the exterior of this and make an interior connection so you can use it with the older style eliquid tanks as well as with prefilled cartridges well you'll notice is if you're really into just prefilled cartridges is when you screw it into this ego tank it this transition looks a little funky it'll still work and they work good but you'll see that this just doesn't look that nice it looks like I need like a transition piece of metal there like a skirt or something like that and you know this is a fatter battery so as you could see the widths don't exactly line up like other tanks like this you'll see it's a much smoother transition it looks like they're all one piece versus like this now there's lots of ego batteries on the market there's ones that have twist knobs there's ones that are longer the thing is that you can these are about 500 milliamp hour batteries for so that's a pretty good decent capacity for a battery these ones are usually between 350 and 650 they're this size you can get longer ones or all the way up to 1200 or 1100 milliamp hours so you can get ultra high-capacity powerful fat ego batteries like this but one of the trade-offs is if you do use a lot of cartridges they're not gonna line up they're not gonna look a hundred percent with these stick batteries they line up so you can use all different types of heating materials like ceramic cartridges standard a stainless steel or organic cotton coil cartridges you can use high performance ceramic like our performance tank you can even use wax tanks like our silencer with these little 510 thread batteries so we hope that today's video was useful in showing you guys the differences between the different 510 thread battery types and we familiarize you with some of the pros and cons are of each one so when you are on the market trying to pick up a 5-10 thread stick

it's beautiful it's a it's a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio and then on the right side here we've got our highlighter uncrate special edition we only made a few thousand of these things a nice matte soft touch finish it's also a one-to-one CBD THC ratio [Music] that's clean give me some pricing so these are right around $100 a piece well I guess the show is the most expensive it's right sighs I'll pull up here how many how many how many pumps in this thing uh well it depends on how big a puffy take yeah so this is the most expensive is tech break and this would actually be smart the great way to check", "QR28aT45Y8I": "what's going on out there youtubers mr. weed Lee with the joie de lis show gonna do a just a quick cart cartridge review some cheaper cartridges going around adding two weeks in a row now Keene cartridge got a lemon and a Bluegreen 1/2 gram and a 1 gram legally completely different cannabis oil me inside of these two different size cartridges I have no idea why I'm glad I tried the second one is it was night and day difference I have no idea why that is a half gram cartridges or I found this one little dispensary Nirvana not my favorite just been three but they just print three as well you know they they have good prices on car projects especially if you buy two i got the half gram king the lemon i don't think it's a lemon OG anything like that i think it's just dad living food terpene it was a really really dark oil pretty much empty you can kind of see how dark it is in the bottom there compared to that [Music] but the Blue Dream you know it's a cannabis strain terpene or carpet lease boy that I don't know lemon 1/2 gram OG get it out of here crap you only got 20 bucks both taxes what that was hey you get a buzz you know just a taste wasn't the best $20 can't can't beat cannot beat the one gram here get them at the same place there are a lot of other places I'm sure mr. 17 may be dropping some around may not I don't know if he's gonna even go that route maybe just better ones definitely try the one gram the last one I had was a wooden ship it was really good this was a black porcelain tip it actually says something signature on the it is some kind of a brand name cart if you can see when it does have on the stem their signature lol of something signature something I get over but it's been a good one [Music] I found this you can get these at that same shop I'm the cheapest I've seen him as 30 plus tax for the one gram and that's I take 40s a more normal price own but you know go to that one shop buy two you get them for that along tons are my one you can get them for that so it's definitely a budget budget cartridge but I am on a budget so that's good that's good I might actually probably be rolling with these quite a bit let's see if I can keep the people in they keep the quality up and the price of that same price but that one dispensary I might be on me [Music] you don't know about the damn care that's the white V to fix this king cartridge amazingly you get the v3 pretty soon probably when they hit town all right I'm gonna make this quick little download over 420 already though so everybody have a good one big shout out to the man here up and get great medicine all over this town so see you guys later take er easy keep it growing up twisty twisty OKC Thunder seed mmm I like that started to stretch I got it fixed she's doing great so twisty coming along and the other one didn't do so well but it was a random I got all my faith in these twisties everybody have a good one and take her easy again", "4YGrQaN6hBA": "[Music] what is going on you guys so truly just put out there new CEO to bait pin earlier this week and I stopped by and I grabbed one this is what we're used to seeing from truly right now usual truly packaging co2 bait pen says on top co2 this is what we usually see from truly for a co2 vape pen but now we have their new open vape reserve co2 distillate cartridge bait pen so in this video we're going to go over the difference between these two pins we're gonna say this is jacker rare right here I have jacker rare from the open bait so if I have two of these co2 pins that are the same strain what's the difference between the two so we'll go over that today but first we're gonna check out their Instagram right here you can see their Instagram and here's my Instagram as well in case you guys have never seen it this is a great page to follow as well I post on here all the time and I show you new stuff that's getting ready to come out and it's a great place to see sneak peeks for videos that are coming out you ever want to contact me this is the place to do it and I even put you guys in some of the videos to go check it out alright so here's their Instagram page as you can see here at the top they are High Times Cannabis Cup winner and they are in several different states Arizona California Colorado new New Mexico of that and Florida being their newest warm we got three strains for right now San Fernando Valley oh gee which is a hybrid Jack Herer which is a sativa and Master Kush which is a indica so the one thing that I saw on here that I wanted to show you guys was the cartridge that it comes in the Saran cartridge think this is supposed to be the newest version of a C cell which means it has a ceramic ceramic coil which will help burn the product better than a wit coil I know a lot of times with wit coils they can burn out real easy but with this ceramic oil you won't have that problem this is just the newest version of C cell truly uses C cells for most of their babes except for their cheapest distillate faith and their true pod so it says this cartridge is supposed to deliver up to 110 percent larger hits I'm not exactly sure what they're comparing this to but it seems to hit about the same as a regular C cell from B and you also have the open 2.0 battery which you can get if you like you don't have to get this battery this cartridge will screw on to any 510 thread battery alright so let's check out what all we get when we purchase the bait cartridge so we have that then it comes in a separate little two as you can see here open bait and right here it has the terpenes listed the dominant terpenes are turpino lean trans carry opaline and our lemony and the cartridge is coming in at 87% THC and 0.4% CBD total so to open you simply squeeze the sides and it will slide out just like that nice tip I like the tip on it it's a plastic hard plastic type tip that looks like glass but it is plastic on the bottom you have your little cap to keep it from leaking we won't need that anymore and this oil in here looks great too i mean it's some really good looking product inside of here so you can see it's really nice [Music] so as you guys can see right here this is as full as the cartridge is they say that that's headspace where it has go as gone into the coil but I remember the first time I got one of these I actually had to get it going before the oil was even in the coil that's the only thing that I see so far as it looks like they could fill the cartridges a little bit more and I have had this same problem with these cartridges they're just not quite as full as they could be that's the only thing that I don't like about these half Graham carts is it doesn't seem like I'm getting the full product for the price that I'm paying I mean if I'm buying a full gram of this stuff I'm paying you 110 dollars just make it full at least and I have seen them completely full so I mean that whole headspace thing to me just doesn't make sense so let's try it out I'm just gonna screw it on to my favorite battery as you can see here it's a 5-10 thread it will screw on to any 510 battery and you can also see it says jupiter-c cell that's how you can identify if you have a real C cell it will say Jupiter on it just like that alright you guys so everything you've seen so far has been recorded over the last couple of days and I've really had a good chance to try this product out now and I really like it it's a good product but I'm not quite sure I like it better than the co2 bait cartridge right here from truly do like how hard the new C cell hits it does rip really good check this out [Music] nice hit hmm so and then rips really good you can get really nice rips off of this especially with an adjustable battery which is what I have here it's an adjustable battery goes from 4.8 bolts down to 3.8 bolts in a 3.3 volt so that way you have a choice of what temperature you take your head out and how big of a hit you take and that's kind of similar to the 2.0 pin that they have as well I'm sure it's just a little bit more pricier than the one I have here so if this was a jack herer cartridge what would be the difference between these two cartridges since they're both co2 cartridges well this company right here open they have some award-winning strains that they have and they have the terpene profiles on them so that terpene profile is basically what the difference is between these two things right here you of course have different phenotypes of plants you may have jack or air and jack or air so they're gonna be two different phenotypes and they're gonna have two different types of terpenes in them this is just the terpene profile for their phenotype of Jack Herer so what is a phenotype well to make it easy basically not every plant is the same and every different plant is a phenotype and some are better than others and this is why sometimes you guys will see let's say blue dream and it will be really nice-looking and then other times you'll see blue dream and it won't be as nice-looking it's because it's two different plants and you have two different phenotypes we'll get into all that some other time but you guys did want to know one other question and there is one other difference on this product let's jump back on this screen real quick and check this out all right so I'm on true leaves Instagram here and in the comments of one of their pictures from this new product someone asked as anyone tried these what can we expect are there any cutting agents so truly the answers with cut with nothing but terpenes so everybody wants to know of course what these terpenes come from are they fruit food terpenes or the cannabis terpenes so we see right here that the answer they will be botanical or fruit terpenes basically and down here we see some people are not really excited that they are not cannabis Dr terpenes like the co2 pin the co2 pin from truly has cannabis derived terpenes and right here in this message they tell me one is botanical and their co2 pin is cannabis derived terpenes now true leaf also has to do this with any other things that are distilled that of course is a different process than the co2 distillate but regular distillate who has the terpenes added to it to recreate that strain the profile of that strain this is why they came out with the co2 true clear or distillate is because they are using food grade or botanical terpenes and the regular distillate and that is pretty common practice around the country but the co2 distillate has cannabis derived terpenes in it regular distillate does not have any terpenes in it until they are introduced back into it because it is cooked off during the distillation process and is basically just raw THC without any terpene profile to it at all and it is built from there you guys may have remembered a little while back when they came out with Gainesville green this actually is a strain from a long time ago long time Florida strain from way back when was supposedly lost about 30 years ago well this is how the strain was recreated they actually went to Naiya being godfather of gainesville green and had him approved the terpene profile for Gainesville green and that is where we got it from this is actually derived from gorilla grapes though and this is why you don't see any Gainesville green actual flower in the dispensary because only the terpene profile is available for it and only Rick nya supposedly knows it so that's enough for right now take that in and let me know down in the comments what you guys think would you rather have food grade terpenes or cannabis derived terpenes keep in mind both of these products are half grams and they both cost fifty five dollars I hope you guys liked the video give it a thumbs up if you did and subscribe below to learn some more we'll see you guys next time [Music] [Music] [Music]", "2ZZ6AzanByM": "what's up guys welcome to muncha's uh laboratory over here um so yeah i already ripped it a couple of times but i got a delta eight disposable oh and this shit's like it looks good i got blue dream bro i'm not even [ __ ] playing [ __ ] if you want to put down your [ __ ] delta 9 thc cards blood for a while to get a tolerance break just some good stuff anyway ingredients contains cannabinoids delta eight and is flavored with terpenes obviously all right so it contains hemp derived delta eight thc cbd cbn and less than point three percent of delta ninety hc unless i'm reading that wrong it's more than point three percent in other words delta a um i don't know is it a plant probably yeah what i do know about delta eight is it's mixed with it has cbd and some delta nine i'm not too [ __ ] i'm not listening no in common i'm not too keen on this but has them those two mixed into one or in the same plant as the delta a ah i don't know what i'm even [ __ ] trying to say but anyway also wait i'm gonna put the link down these guys [ __ ] sound [ __ ] starburst with it i'm not even making this [ __ ] up they sent out [ __ ] starbursts and it [ __ ] like tied it in here so [ __ ] hard to unwrap it like damn they were cracking the [ __ ] down oh and it came with all right let's just hit it no the fans on it couldn't do a trick damn i was wondering what my characters just [ __ ] all right yeah guys this is something there's some good [ __ ] y'all need to try", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked

with great counter crafts so today what I'm talking about is Delta eight THC so Delta a THC is one of the many cannabinoids found in the plant which there's over a hundred but the well-known the best well-known cannabinoids in the plant are the only two of them that are is THC which is Delta 9 THC tetrahydrocannabinol and CBD which is cannabidiol so THC is gonna give you that big psychoactive effect where what where CBD is gonna be more for inflammation non psychoactive but Delta 8 THC is so this cannabinoid was actually released in 2017 but was known about it since 1975 so Delta ATAC so the differences between Delta H and Delta 9 THC so Delta 9 THC it binds to your receptors so so cb1 receptor and cb2 receptors where Delta 8 th see only mainly binds to to your cb1 receptors so cb1 receptors are mainly in your central nervous system and central nervous system where cb2 receptors are in your immune system your organs throughout your body so what has been what so what what the difference is - with Delta 9 and Delta a THC so Delta 9 is gonna give you that big psychoactive effect and get you high where Delta a THC is gonna help more with anxiety so people that that smoke sometimes they get anxiety when they smoke this will not give you anxiety it'll just get you high but it won't give you that ah Guinness on in your head we're also the m''i THC is found so little in the plants that they actually I has to be done with it has to be through concentrates so you're going to do cartridges or any other concentrates that they do and it's really clear where Delta 9 THC about 25 percent is found in the plant Delta a THC there's only point zero one percent that is found in the plant so that's why they have to do it has to be in concentrates but yeah this is awesome for anybody that that doesn't that sometimes gets hot it gets hot but it gives them paranoia anxiety this is perfect for anybody to do anybody that wants to get uplifted but doesn't want to get that anxiety and I've heard a lot of people that get high and get anxiety so usually it's in cartridges but so I'm one of them that I've seen is about 80% Delta a THC and 5% Delta 9 THC so yeah the biggest difference is that the where it binds in your body and doesn't be it helps with so a Delta a THC it helps with nausea anxiety it said said to be helpful for Alzheimer's I've got this I've been reading about this so it's like I'm not getting it out but I'll put the I'll put the link of the article and down below so you check it out because it's it's a new cannabinoid and it's supposed to be really how go for like medicinal purposes so yeah check it out and we'll see you later Church", "JVvjqk9nMJI": "you know what is going on guys today [ __ ] you would think after [ __ ] years I would have a

lights you know the Northern Lights in Alaska went over the weed and weed before this was never a green it was always red grown by Mexicans but when this dude drew it in Alaska with the aurora lights it turned green for the first time so he called it the Northern Lights and the second ever strain was alaskan thunder [ __ ] from Alaska as well obviously BAM first two strains I actually really like this these flavors good as [ __ ] just don't know it but I've been sitting in this chair for like 15 minutes just on my phone [ __ ] hitting the dab pen I totally [ __ ] forgot about the video I was just getting stoned sitting here um anyways let's move on wait let me take another rip I'm gonna give this a score 1 out of 10 but I'm gonna I'm gonna give you that like a seven we are now having

it's Sunday so I'm gonna watch the football game Packers are on in three hours let's go I almost forgot to do one more red", "zXvIqpVzO7k": "[Music] thank you for watching ganja runner TV I'm Jake Gloria and today we have Lauren from heavy hitters here with us and she's gonna tell us all about their vapor cartridges yeah so heavy hitters is an awesome cartridge company it's all a distillate so these are distilled eight times total and on the 8th time they actually take the temperature almost to the point of freezing what that does is really just takes out all the plant fats and lipids that don't need to be in the product it just makes it a Lord clean and compact hit for you guys so would that be why is very clear yeah basically the clarity is a lot better it's also a little bit more fluid so you're gonna pull a larger hit a lot faster so how do I use this ah so we did just introduce the button battery just for a heavier hit we actually did invert the button so you're less likely to accidentally use it so how does one get a heavy hit what constitutes a heavy hit so to get the heaviest hit we actually do suggest holding down the button for five to eight seconds just to warm the cart just so when you pull it's immediately pulling the concentrate not warming up the cart the first one is Jack Herer this is our most uppity cart it's gonna keep you the most awake and kind of buzzing so it's actually five times to turn it on and then you would just hold down okay [Music] yeah so these don't automatically turn off say about that amount of time would be good the test actually you really taste like what yeah yeah so that's definitely a string specific one FARC we use all natural flavoring nothing artificial so the strain specific cards are going to be flavored with specific strains from the plant the plant champions and then our flavored ones will actually be using the fruit dripping Wow all right we can do a pineapple express this is on my favorites because it's fruity as well as string specific so I just feel like it's overall you have like it's a good hybrid good for any time of the day and it just strain I'll never get tired of [Music] and almost tastes like a like a little bit piney yeah so I just think it has a little bit of everything in there do you want to try it yeah okay this is one of my favorite self yeah it's kind of like excuse me oh man okay so we're back just a pineapple express and that was pretty heavy there's no 104 it's a button so just hold down in here [Music] Wow let me think very very sweet doesn't hurt my throat very smooth tastes great irritation this is Malibu og so it's super fruity fruit salad [Music] oh yeah let's taste like face like boysenberries it's all going to my head quite different I feel good Phil yeah definitely high but still like I can take on the day alright so now we're moving more towards the fruity into cos pink push I love this one just say like like pink lemonade or what is that fruit maybe game fish so diablo super strain-specific has a little kick to it like almost peppery yes button [Music] I think that would go great with like a burrito - no yeah really am diabla okay so meet at the end and I really enjoyed all of these vapes thank you for coming out and for telling us all about them I think it's I think that you guys are doing an amazing job of an amazing products tank it taste is amazing it's really potent so please come back in some other time let's try some more so yeah I'll be back with our new products okay guys thank you for watching we have heavy hitters available on at Cod return calm you can order that in California and have it shipped to your door so check us out [Music]", "qC9kjfAu2MU": "hey guys it's Nick with blue farms here just to show you a little tip to fix your pen if you're not getting any vapor off your draw so you can see here it was a nice slow steady draw the battery will light up but we're not getting any vapor trail so in order for your cartridge to work this little paddle on the battery has to come up and make contact with this little paddle on the cartridge alright so as you can see the little paddle on the cartridge side has been recessed so in order to get that paddle back up to the top of the threading we're going to use a little bit of arm spin take the sharp end of the bloom Farms pin to fit in this hole and just raise it up just a little bit very delicately so that it's even with the top of the threading alright so now that we've leveled the paddle off and it's nice and flush with the rings of the threading I'm gonna attach it back to the battery let's give it a shot", "EfGnRIjVzt8": "so I've been feeling these these are really nice not sure if I can zoom in on these but if you can see I see right there see how nice I like this one a lot it's connecting one is one of the real ones and if you can see over here see if I can zoom in you can see how clear these are right even this one that's like got overheated that one still looks still really crystal clear right you can even see it in this one very clear and then I get this this one's not clear at all and when you talk from these that aren't clear you can kind of see the difference right here like there's just a sheer difference and even in the same let's connect the one this one it's hard to duplicate so this was real but this one super-shady I mean I shady but ghostly and and this one kind of - but I open it but you should watch out for this man because this stuff you can talk for days and it actually won't get you anywhere this one does the job but these that I've opened up they'll have this kind of ghosting to the I've heard are the fake ones and they're really cheap they sell for probably like maybe twenty-five thirty-five at cost and then you know make sell these for like 65 80 whatever but this one's one of the fake ones actually they've been taking these and that's probably why brass knuckles if you find them for like anything less than 47 then it's probably fake it's gonna be like this and ghostly you'll put it next to all these and you're gonna see like whoa why is this so uh why is this so boasting compared to even this best friend over here when we put it it's just you can see that you like you can see the bars but this one there's no line no sharp line saying these right here don't talk too well you should avoid buying these if you see it make sure they're clear", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things

keep on toking my friends", "C0I-fw0LvPM": "what's up YouTube welcome back extinct 420 here with another medical marijuana review got my new uniform today that's what took me so long to put out this next video yo your school shirt it's gonna be my new uniform for all my videos I might get another one I'll put the link in the description just the case you guys want one today we're checking out some of the cheapest the best vape pens you could get on the market right now coming from Liberty Health Sciences that's gonna be the THC count on that and then on this one this is gonna be a jack hair it's pretty good stuff I'm smoking on this you spin here I've had these a couple days so this is gonna be the gelato mmm tastes it tastes delicious these are the reason I say these are the cheapest is because these are $35 for 400 milligrams of THC and a lot of people they are misconstrued about how they sell them and whatnot dispensaries usually sell them by the milligram counts and not like half gram or grams like you see all these street cartridges have in Liberty Health Sciences is selling these which have 400 milligrams THC for 35 compared to true leave that it would be 47 for 350 or cure leaf which is they get a hundred and fifty for 18 or even move which has 250 for 35 or sir Terra which has 250 for 35 but that has a disposable pen with it this you have to have your own little vape pen I got this is for free from a friend of mine Wow it's killer right there mm-hmm you could check out the app hmm the oil in that stuff nice golden color it doesn't move you can hold it upside down for as long as you want it'll move eventually but all these cart Street carts are ugly and brown all right we're gonna try this Jack Harry this one's unopened this is what a car looks like fresh out of the pack 400 milligrams THC like I said this one it's got like a fruity taste this gelato got that delicious oh man alright we gonna try this Jack hare I didn't even tried this yet I had the flower in my last video it was pretty good I actually still have a butt of that left I'm saving it you know special occasion not so special occasion just saving it alright I'm already ripped you off that [ __ ] gelato you know I'm tell y'all what this does cuz I'm ripped definitely not like uh that one's like a citrusy taste that gelato this one has more of a berry taste man I'm ripped y'all the first batch I got which is this gelato had 75% THC the second batch 87% THC so I mean they're both really good yeah so there you have it guys these are definitely the best bang for your buck if you're going for any kind of dispensary cartridges in Florida I mean you could pay I mean yeah these people on the streets and say that oh I could get a gram for 40 or 50 but that's like of like Eric Conn says some hot dog water or something I mean hot dog water probably be better for you but I mean it's not that expensive look you off y'all get invest in your in your card which cost two hundred and seventy eight dollars and then you can get the $78 discount earth no $75 discount on $150 so I got five of these cartridges for $100 so that's that's two and a half grams for 100 bucks compared to these fake-ass half grams y'all get big-ass grams y'all getting for full 50 or 40 or whatever and this is real legit delicious dispensary lab tested quality stuff that's just you know my opinion my channel is here for people who are curious about getting their card and don't want to get ripped off or waste their money and don't know what they're getting because like you would like to see what they get before they buy it and none of these dispensaries show you any flour or any any cartridges that you can't taste it at the dispensary so that's what I'm here for guys but I'm gonna get off here I'm gonna smoke this Luke's tendo right here that's coming up next I mean I'm ripped but I like to smoke so I mean we don't get it and here check out the shirt y'all want it I'm gonna leave a link in the description thanks guys catch y'all next time", "ayDrTOrTnu0": "Oh guys back to do another review here I'm going to be doing blue dream dang crepes um get your message on the back blue stream blue stream is a sativa dominant hybrid originating in California has achieved legendary status among the west coast range crossing a blueberry indica with a sativa haze blue tree and bounces full body relaxation with gentle cerebral invigoration novice and veteran smokers consumers alike enjoy the low-level effects of Blue Dream which easier jumped me into a clean euphoria I believe this is a sativa dominant hybrid from what I was reading there what it did say I believe I'm gonna be using my fists bhasu well right off the bat you get this great haze just a little blueberry but not haze is definitely more potent not really beeping much um little chemically hmm well that's kind of disappointing thankfully this isn't these aren't expensive I'll end up I'm Doug either selling this one more maybe maybe all right thank you guys for watching my review of Blue Dream I don't believe this one's real already me me thinking this fake there's no need for me to keep going and taste alright it put its excuse me um it just don't it tastes alright it just don't meet pardon and the side was to pull out my Girl Scout cookies which I can cram the open real quick so I've been using this because I don't got the nipple on it and cuz I've been going through um yeah I hit this [ __ ] you will see instantly damn girl scout cookies making me cough just like that yeah there was a [ __ ] rip this one I think you guys for watching like subscribe if you're interested in them more videos to come and every stop and flavors never stopping flavors um there is something new on the list I'm getting it and one weird thing I seen wedding cake and birthday cake and I thought maybe one or the other was fake but I don't believe so and I've also seen Diablo G around I think you not only have to get some of that OG which I'm guessing this I don't see the hablo around a lot because probably because OG - Shandi ah blue kush are probably just about the same so yeah it could be a phenotype of OG Kush so yes you know what I mean I'm gonna get out of here thank you guys for watching", "rJMjnifYgts": "hey guys what's up my name is Mary I look like [ __ ] right now so I'm not really going to show myself but hello I'm here anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "ALCpwJdza1U": "hi guys okay so today I'm gonna do an unboxing and never had one of these so super excited I've heard a lot of good things about it so I'm ready to try it you know so what I'm trying today are it's the new dizzy so I'm gonna open it in front of you guys with the first time ever because like I said I heard a lot of good stuff about it in the surprise it was I think that the battery weighs 25 yeah plus tax which was not sure I'm pretty sure it's like a 30% tax so like two dollars the sense in all it was 66 and the actual battery was 25 this is a new battery I wasn't sure which one we did but you know I just open they said they'd get better and I'm here with my team I got this out bubblicious it's like right next forward it's the dispenser nice and why not I drank it to measure honestly I mean this is an actual cartridge I can get this open I'm gonna get be doing this wrong though so oh I think I'm doing right I'm not sure looks about right so this is how it looks so small I hope it's worth a new toy um I didn't even read the instruction so I'm pretty sure I'm doing this oh I think you take the bottom off make sense make sense wait I I would have been all works this China see if it matters on what side you put it in but I don't think it does let me see Oh my girlfriend's gonna love this wick I'm excited I've been wanting to try this is so small - I didn't expect it to be this long so the the flavor that I got is blue dream because she said that was like highest one and sativa but it says it's blueberry flavor I kind of taste it I don't really like blueberry but it doesn't really bother me anymore I got really up of some was it blueberry cookies like a long time ago in high school like really up like I ended up throwing up I got sick I ended up going to the doctor a lot of  had been cuz I I was in foster care at the time if you know how that goes it's a whole ass to deal with anyways I don't know I feel about this before after I'm done dying okay I'm trying sweat that hit pretty good and I had pretty good so this is my first impression and I hope you guys liking it's a quick little video it wasn't too long I hope it wasn't too long I hope I'm not talking to you on cuz okay anyways this is the ste it just said anyways this is a new Susie model my gosh bro it really got to me now I feel II it it's worth the price that's what I got to say like it's really worth the price it gets you really very fast cuz I only took like two hits like barely half a one one and a half was a I only took like one and a half and he got me pretty high I think I like this I think it was a good investment good miss big guy so yay to me for this you should get this go ahead and get this um the cartridge for mine it was 31 I believe without tax and then about like 41 whipped text my phone just completely fell so okay so the the battery that I got is 23 and then 25 after time and the cartridge is 31 and about 40 after-tax I mean it's pretty good compared to when I lived in for tonight that she was so expensive like I don't know if you guys seen the Select batteries the cell like cartridges over there and they were like 60 bucks for just like the select one no it was like 70 like 70 bucks 65 it was 65 it was in between I know that okay it was 65 dollars and over here it's like $30 like I think it's after-tax to 65 yeah yeah they just tell you the tax straight up anyways that's a lot of money over here is so much cheaper I live in Modesto so that's why anyways go out and buy one today cuz why not alright peace", "5r7-z1DRz1o": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another fake cartridge video this was actually part 2 and I give a shout out to my boy Christian who actually requested this video you know I feel like when someone requests a part two of a video I'll try and do my best to provide that for him and also I'd like to shout out my 15 members you know I haven't shouted them out in the video lately so for all 15 of you thank you I'll post them right here and all that stuff but getting on to the main topic of this video is fake cartridges obviously you know there's many fake cartridges that have basically just faked from a real company you know we got raw guard and brass knuckles all that stuff and every now and then you get other companies that just come out nowhere that may have been legit kinda cleared I mentioned in my first part video and then another one where one of you guys mentioned that there's another card called Lions breath something popped up in my reddit and for another thing when it comes to fake cartridges and you're very unsure of if you have a real one or a fake one just look it up online and ready is a very very good source for basically anyone uploading their opinion on the cartridge so it's easy to find if these cartridges are faked or being faked QR codes are fake or whatever but the other car in question is called Lions breath and these look pretty legit too QR codes holographic stickers all that [ __ ] and it's very hard for people to tell if that's legit or fake and honestly in my opinion I haven't seen that it like near me I haven't heard of Lions breath until I made that other video on the fake cartridges so I feel like it's my duty and other cannabis content creators to make videos spreading awareness on you know all the fake cartridges that are possibly out there so we can say hopefully save someone's lungs from permanent damage you know I'm not saying they're all bad but when there's so many fakes out there is it really worth the risk you know and this is not this is like he's like counterfeits and fakes aren't like you know if Louie Vuitton or fake then you buy something it doesn't affect your health you know it doesn't even affect your bank account as much as a buying a real Louie Vuitton would you know that's why people buy fakes but when you talk about fake cartridges this is something that we consume that we ingest so it's a very real possibility that maybe you might get permanent damage smoking nice you know backyard cartridges you know and I want to spread awareness on this as much as I can you know I don't really but I like making these videos but I feel like it's my duty as a cannabis content creator to make videos like this so that the public is a lot more safe when it comes to purchasing just anything cannabis you know I feel like I want my channel to be where like people will go to to find legit products just have a good time in smoke you know and hopefully I'm getting close to that goal every day you know I try and you know every now and then I try to make these videos you know and like I said Christian Torres requested a part too so I'll do my best to do it this is not going to be the only video uploaded today this is going to be the first video uploaded today and then I have another UFC video from like a week or two ago that I want to upload so yeah definitely stay tuned for that this is not gonna be the only video you know as much as these videos are important I know that not everyone watches them you know they'd much rather prefer like a smoke session or a vlog so I got you two videos today but this one's gonna be the first one because I feel like this is very important I should really get it out there and yeah shout out to Christian be aware of Lions breath carts you know I'll post it right here this [ __ ] looks pretty legit holographic sticker all that stuff but in that reddit post that came up it said that it was probably the worst tasting cartridge that he's ever had so just you you know as much as packaging influences your opinion on the product you still gotta be careful you know even though the packaging looks so [ __ ] legit you know you gotta be careful and best way to avoid you know getting fakes is to buy from a reputable dispensary if you're in a legal state I mean you didn't have to wait until you know cartridges are in your area but you know just be safe out there guys because permanent lung damage does not sound good you know saying so please if you guys have fake cartridges I'm not saying they're bad I'm just saying that there's a chance they could be bad you know there's a [ __ ] chance you know and it'll be pretty ignorant of you to say that there isn't a chance you know so just be careful other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video like I said there will be another video out today 4:15 p.m. peace out [Music] you", "TOJR86ZbQXs": "you would yeah I just like this because it's oh hey everybody Britt Mason from humanity house CBD here aim on Indiana I've got Thaddeus with me hey we're just sitting here chatting a little bit and I was telling Thaddeus said one of the one of the questions a lot of people asked when they come in and I'm showing them products that you know they're becoming and they've asked about maybe a particular ailment that they're dealing with or whatever and will show them some of our products and some of our products listed list as an indica or sativa and so a lot of people are like well what what does that even mean I've heard that term you know in in the arena I've heard that term before over over the time what it what does that even mean so I was kind of asked at that what how do you how do you explain that to people when they come in so a lot of the times I think people think that has to do with the CBD levels so like people think maybe if it's an indica that means it has more CBD and if it's a sativa it has more THC and that's not really the case the hemp plant is more than just CBD or THC levels or cbn or all those cannabinoids there's also terpenes terpenes are actually what determine if it's going to be a sativa or indica so I got like a couple of our most popular ones The Incredible Hulk is probably our most popular sativa product and then the strawberry napalm of the Delta 8 by the way is polar most popular indica so say if you were trying out the strawberry Nathan for the first time how does read you the description do they have in the back of this and this is gonna be most generally like the best way to describe a an indica to put it a bomb to the senses this is the bodies of all of our Delta H strains it combines the heady motivated effects of Belt a THC with the same also relaxing terpene blend and we use for our comfortably numb' products so like they even set it there they use different terpenes to determine the indica side of and bran could read the description on the Incredible Hulk a cross between green crack and Jack hair strands so if anybody that those are two very common very traditional strands of cannabis out there and our people know the effects of those that are sativas so you get soothing happiness strapped to a rocket ship great for getting stuff done socializing and anything active this might not turn you green but you're gonna feel like the good monster yeah so again uplifting Zack you know maybe more of a daytime thing you know sateen yeah I mean another way I like to describe it to people is uh it's kind of a funny way to remember it is indica in the couch so it means you're more relaxed or chilled out you want to lay back watch a movie that kind of thing and then sativa I'd use that that s-sounds sativa stimulant now it's not a stimulant and the indica is not a depressant but that's the easiest way I like to explain to people in the most basic terms and there's so much more that goes into all this and we won't go into that embassy actually in a week or so we're gonna meet with one of our vendors here in Indiana up in Lafayette Indiana in northwest part of Indiana where all of our farm ground a lot of our farm ground is one of our vendors that grows our hemp goes the hemp that we buy has invited us to come up see their facility talk to them well there we'll get a chance really to talk to the guys that are growing this that can really tell us the the different even different terpene profiles on so and so forth that's that's not what we'll get into but anyway yeah that was that's kind of one of the great one of the one of the most common questions must come with so anyway I hope this helps a little bit you know if there's a lot going on out there come on in and see us will talk to us some more you can obviously reach us at humanity health CBD at gmail.com websites humanity health CBD calm for all our products subscribe to our channel I can subscribe like and subscribe below hit the bell bring the mill so anyway appreciate it we got to go take care of everybody each other take care of yourself and peace", "rm0Mnl5fC7c":

fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good [Music] alright guys back here for no [ __ ] video we out here got the bong ready to go your honor you know it is but today guys there's gonna be a short little vlog a little informative bug about fake [ __ ] carts guys because there's been a lot of fake ass carts going around and I don't want you guys to get cheated you feel me I want you guys to I want you guys to be able to smoke realize cars guys like I'm tired of people selling fake ass cars and it's just disrespectful guys so like today I found a guy who sells fake for all garden carts and I have a real raw garden this is a real rug or in the place that I got it from is verified I'll probably show you guys later that is verified just to prove you guys that it's [ __ ] verified and I don't know we don't get these fake cards off the street now we can't get the fake cars off the street but I can tell you guys how to tell the difference between a fake and a real [Music] as people have been selling fake cards for too long guys it started off with the brass knuckles and the dang cars and the mario cards like wind-up mario nigut if you smoke something called mario [ __ ] you stupid but um I hit him up this dumb just so dude that sells like treating cars on the street I hit him love and he's gonna come through real quick and when he gets here I'm going to show you guys what the [ __ ] the difference is but before that let me take a bong rip you guys already freaking know you know I'd be on my bong way of life all right I'm gonna get back to you guys in a few minutes I'm just waiting for him to pull up and we all will get these things all right before I um talk to him real quick he's about to come in in a few minutes I just want to show you that I got it from a place that's verified if it has the check mark and we maps that shit's verify so all these are verified and the one that I bought the other day I did a vlog on it you guys want to check it out with the link in the description it is a chocolate slurm alright guys I'm finally back and this is how you could tell the fake from the real pro so I got the dojo Kush I actually spend money on it and then I got the cherry slurm I couldn't find the chocolates learn that I had but I had cherries learn before and I know it's verified so I got that this is the rowan and this is the fake the first difference I'm gonna show you guys is you know the difference in the boxes the boxes are totally different I looked at that [ __ ] I knew was fake but I needed a box to get it so I said [ __ ] it take one for team but check yourself so this is Rowan and this is fake as you can see the font and the color are totally different see the fake one is more light green light green around while the real one is dark green start reading around and you can see the font is different too by the net weight and cartridge you can see that the font are way different see by the fonts on the date and of the other other information on here that's how you can see that's the first way you guys can tell a fake from a real so the other way is by actually looking at the cart actually I have to open it real quick give me a second guys so now the second difference is there's no see a caution on the card up see how the real one this is the real one you see how the real one has the CA on it that one didn't have it and then you can also tell by the color that's the third thing you could do is hell is by the color but honestly the color on these look super similar so I don't know but usually you can tell by the color guys and then you guys already know the last way is to like actually taste test the product but I already know it's fake but for you guys I'm gonna do it for the one time for you guys the wu-tang alright guys do not I'm just gonna tell you guys do not buy [ __ ] carts off the street like I already knew it was kind of bad when he told me that the cart was $45 that's a that's a signal that's a signal all in itself right there $45 boy that [ __ ] is 65 but I was just going with it I'm not I don't care I just needed a car either way you feel me but um it's 65 guys or more for these cars they're expensive and that's why they taste so good this [ __ ] tastes like a [ __ ] battery guys like it doesn't taste good at all it has no type of essence from the flower nothing like it might look similar this [ __ ] really gave me one with a fat bubble engine bro I just got screwed but um it's fake guys like I don't know let me taste this one [Music] see I wish you guys could taste this so you guys could tell this is that real raw garden [ __ ] like [ __ ] this fake [ __ ] but like those are the ways that you guys can tell guys I hope everyone's having a good day I just wanted to do a short little vlog for you guys because I just wanted to post more so I just decided to do something about karts because I don't know I feel like not too many people are doing the karts are they're not showing you the real fake ones like that are actually out there so I bought one I was like man let me show you guys like what the real fake ones look like let me just show you guys so I got one and I'm probably gonna throw it in the trash matter of fact just take this [ __ ] this is what you do with fake cards you take the fake cart and guys okay go to the trash can and you see the cigarette butts you throw it in with the cigarette butts so I hope everyone liked this vlog don't forget to Like comment subscribe and don't [ __ ] smoke fake cards make sure you go to a dispensary or get you got to get it from some reputable place make sure they're verified it's not worth your health you know what I mean so just get a verified one pretty much all you have to do is not buy off the street but [Music]", "dMgb3UnMx5I": "yo so this is Chris with G farmer TV and today I'm going to go ahead and break down different uses on liquid gold seal to syringes so the first you want to go ahead and do is take off your actual seal on the syringe remove that and I wouldn't want to go ahead and use this right away until I have my plastic needle point only because it actually helps manage the portion of your dab actually helps manage the portion of whatever cartridge you're actually using to refill and it helps you from preventing them making a mess because the last thing you want to do is spill your liquid gold all over the floor or all over your hand one messy situation so not only can you refill just the liquid gold cartridges just by putting the plastic insert along the sides I want to go ahead and recommend to let the wick soak I mean that's pretty much the component that actually keeps igniting so the more drenched your wicks are better taste you will actually consistently have on every plus that tends to be the number one part that drives up I didn't use my whole half randomized liquid ghost range so what I would do is pull back we tracked my oil back into the syringe take off my plastic needle point and put back my actual seal this is the number one part you do not want to throw this away you plan to reseal your liquid goats are in good to go how could you tell if you have a good quality co2 syringe well the lighter and the thicker the better more water down your oil is the more there is a possible chance that it's cut with poly glycol any vegetable glycerin and the artificial terpene that are turns your oil from quality to quantity now when it comes to strain-specific syringes or strain-specific concentrates it's kind of tricky to go ahead and commercialize those actual strains because you do need a lot of plant material to actually run on a consistent basis so if you have a major farm with that one string to go ahead and commercialize our power to you until then I'm yet to see that let me just go ahead and show you that not only can you refill most co2 510 cartridges with liquid gold vapor oil but you could definitely go ahead and use it on different things such as put it on your flower taking a dive out of it different alternatives that you actually medicate with and you just want to go ahead and intensify or increase the actual THC no matter what way helps you out to go ahead and medicate with liquid gold vape boy there's different alternatives I like to go ahead and choose a safe discreet way when I'm on the go so I keep my pen in handy go ahead and get liquid gold go to gene farmer labs calm and don't forget to subscribe to our G farmer TV YouTube channel", "d5BMGt1ac7I": "oxygen uh y'all boys ready to record this video yeah hey\u00a0\nwelcome back green fiends today uh we're going\u00a0\u00a0 to be doing a review for a delta 8 carts um as\u00a0\nyou can see here we just got our packet shipped\u00a0\u00a0 in from recreational eight and we're going to be\u00a0\ntalking a little bit about delta eight in general\u00a0\u00a0 and reviewing these cards specifically so yeah\u00a0\nlike uh jarrett said here we got this new package\u00a0\u00a0 from recreational eight with three little carts\u00a0\nfrom them um and you guys can make sure if you\u00a0\u00a0 like any products that you see in this video to\u00a0\ngo check out their uh their website it'll be down\u00a0\u00a0 in our description and you can also check out\u00a0\nour code it'll be code green fiends you can get\u00a0\u00a0 five percent off by using that code right there\u00a0\nuh and yeah go make sure you check them out um\u00a0\u00a0 so we're gonna go ahead and just rip right into\u00a0\nthis package y'all boys ready to do a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 of review all right yeah so we're gonna have rick\u00a0\nover here on the side doing a little b-roll of us\u00a0\u00a0 opening this up real quick for you guys so you can\u00a0\nget a little nice view of us opening this package\u00a0\u00a0 and while i'm opening this do you guys want to\u00a0\ntalk about a little bit what delta it is so the\u00a0\u00a0 viewers can get a little bit of knowledge about\u00a0\nwhat these products are that we're trying today\u00a0\u00a0 yeah uh the cool thing about delta 8 is it's\u00a0\nactually legal in all 50 states um it was recently\u00a0\u00a0 considered a schedule 1 substance but now it's not\u00a0\nanymore um it doesn't slow down your reaction time\u00a0\u00a0 as much as delta 9 your regular thc does and what\u00a0\ni noticed about it um when i was doing my research\u00a0\u00a0 on it is that it gives psychoactive effects\u00a0\nuh more than delta 9 thc in other words yes it\u00a0\u00a0 does still get you high yeah yeah it's it's it's\u00a0\njust as potent if not maybe a little less potent\u00a0\u00a0 it's a different height right it's definitely\u00a0\na different a different height it's more of a\u00a0\u00a0 spacey trippy height does look dope dude the great\u00a0\nthing about recreationally is that they do all\u00a0\u00a0 their testing on their products all that stuff's\u00a0\navailable um they send it in every package and\u00a0\u00a0 they're a registered llc in florida\u00a0\nthey have all their documents and\u00a0\u00a0 they're part of multiple organizations\u00a0\nrelating to hand flash hemp products like that before we start smoking on this a little bit um i\u00a0\nmean we did mention a lot of it already about what\u00a0\u00a0 delta eight is and everything um i just wanted\u00a0\nto go over a couple key points and just that\u00a0\u00a0 uh pretty much delta eight uh it's completely\u00a0\nsafe and as long as you're getting it from a\u00a0\u00a0 reliable vendor who you know is trusted and does\u00a0\nhis work does the test and make sure that they're\u00a0\u00a0 trying to provide a safe product for you and not\u00a0\njust a cheap product uh then it's completely safe\u00a0\u00a0 to use delta eight and has not many side effects\u00a0\nwhatsoever you can do your own research on that\u00a0\u00a0 on your own time obviously i don't recommend\u00a0\neverybody just go out and try this in the blue\u00a0\u00a0 but it is completely legal in all 50 states as\u00a0\nwe mentioned and this can help you with loads\u00a0\u00a0 of things from pain to eating disorders et cetera\u00a0\nand another great thing is it gets you [ __ ] high\u00a0\u00a0 i mean that that's great cbd or anything like\u00a0\nthat it still get you hot but delta here we go that's some clear oil yeah seriously i wonder\u00a0\nwhy delta 8 is a lot clearer while like regular\u00a0\u00a0 cards are like the dark oh bro that's a good\u00a0\nquestion bro that's fire dude good flavor yes\u00a0\u00a0 that's actual fire very like i swear to god dude\u00a0\nlike that tastes like a [ __ ] dispensary cart that was the pineapple express\u00a0\ncan i get was that like a good\u00a0\u00a0 pineapple flavor yes the terps taste natural as [\u00a0\n__ ] like that holy [ __ ] that is a fire ass cart dude that that surprised me honestly i thought\u00a0\nthat was gonna taste like a little turp down\u00a0\u00a0 you know not as gassy but dude that was a good\u00a0\u00a0 dude that's no joke that shouldn't be in the\u00a0\nface like i probably just hit a dab on this bro we are smoking on that pineapple express sativa\u00a0\nright right now that [ __ ] hit me in the face\u00a0\u00a0 that actually i feel like i hit it [ __ ] really a\u00a0\nhybrid sativa god damn right damn you can already\u00a0\u00a0 tell right yeah you can already tell even if you\u00a0\nlike were skeptical about delta eight getting you\u00a0\u00a0 high the first [ __ ] hit you can tell like right\u00a0\nabout like this [ __ ] has thc in it really well\u00a0\u00a0 i mean a lot of stuff that they sell most drops\u00a0\nnowadays they turp it down and that is not that is and i will like to say that that immediately\u00a0\ngave me a head high like i was okay we had\u00a0\u00a0 a like a delta eight cart that we got\u00a0\nin the past that we actually got from\u00a0\u00a0 a local smoke shop around here and i'll\u00a0\nsay that compared to that cart right there\u00a0\u00a0 was complete garbage like yeah yeah for real\u00a0\nlike that that we tasted that cart tasted like\u00a0\u00a0 burnt popcorn had no flavor to it and honestly\u00a0\nthe first couple times i tried it yeah for sure\u00a0\u00a0 the couple first times i tried it it didn't\u00a0\neven get me that high and like that part right\u00a0\u00a0 there one hit straight to the face all right\u00a0\nso we're about to try uh the gelato hybrid now\u00a0\u00a0 we had to switch out the batteries real quick\u00a0\nbecause other battery died but test this [ __ ] all right this is july right yeah dude that tastes\u00a0\nexactly like a bomb pop like um like immediately\u00a0\u00a0 like that was the first flavor i got like coming\u00a0\nin from a [ __ ] hot summer day to grab a bomb hop\u00a0\u00a0 out of the freezer like that's exactly what that\u00a0\n[ __ ] gelato tastes like i believe here oh my god that really it really [ __ ] just\u00a0\nlike a bomb pop right god damn\u00a0\u00a0 it does taste like a bomb pop\u00a0\nthat [ __ ] [ __ ] hits bro god that tastes good it does taste like a\u00a0\nbomb i'm telling you bro just like like i like i like i still like the pineapple express a little\u00a0\nbetter just because i like how the turks\u00a0\u00a0 taste a little more natural but that tastes\u00a0\nreally good smoking on this indica right here\u00a0\u00a0 skittles skittles skittles and i know you all mentioned this but\u00a0\nagain i really appreciate vincent for\u00a0\u00a0 sending us each strain so we can\u00a0\nget a [ __ ] test of a hybrid\u00a0\u00a0 in the cut and a sativa yeah i needed a sativa\u00a0\nunless they got me up express smack me yeah dude\u00a0\u00a0 that tastes just like skittles bro like\u00a0\nit initially tastes just very sweet\u00a0\u00a0 and gassy but then the aftertaste tastes just\u00a0\nlike skittles and i love the camera and added it yeah that's really that's just that's and you and\u00a0\nit's like the tint of weed in the back of it too\u00a0\u00a0 bro i was fire yeah dude that is amazing yeah all\u00a0\nof these carts i feel like i just did a [ __ ] dab\u00a0\u00a0 i've hit like five i've gone like four\u00a0\nor five hits now and this room is smoked\u00a0\u00a0 out i'm too fried right like i'm fried\u00a0\noff like four or five hits dude so yeah\u00a0\u00a0 you can't beat this right here dude i'm telling\u00a0\nyou right now that we just did a our last video\u00a0\u00a0 was a full-grain part and sitting and i honestly\u00a0\nwas like close to this height like after the end\u00a0\u00a0 of the video like and i've only hit this like\u00a0\nfour times all right guys so i mean after trying\u00a0\u00a0 all three of those strains i think we've got like\u00a0\na good you know comparison of the carts and we've\u00a0\u00a0 all got like a good try of and everything i mean\u00a0\ni'm pretty geeked right now um so what we're going\u00a0\u00a0 to do now is we're going to toke on this a little\u00a0\nbit more and we're going to be talking a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit about what we thought of not only the delta\u00a0\n8 cart but specifically the recreational eight\u00a0\u00a0 delta cart and also um our favorite strand as\u00a0\nwell so we start with jared jared what did you\u00a0\u00a0 think of the cart and the company and also what\u00a0\nwas your favorite strand out of it well first off\u00a0\u00a0 the favorite strain was probably the gelato\u00a0\njust because it i think it had the most\u00a0\u00a0 taste compared to like the other two and like the\u00a0\nterms of the sweetness and it actually tasted like\u00a0\u00a0 a blue rasp on top more than i think the\u00a0\npineapple express tastes like pineapple\u00a0\u00a0 but i i think the skittles was the one that got me\u00a0\nthe highest i think that one was the most it felt\u00a0\u00a0 like the most potent out of the three definitely\u00a0\nthat indica hit hardcore recreational eight in\u00a0\u00a0 general i feel like they really know what they're\u00a0\ndoing whenever they're taking these cards and\u00a0\u00a0 i i know that they know they're testing and\u00a0\nsomething but this this like actually made\u00a0\u00a0 me feel like i was getting geeked on a real car\u00a0\nyeah for sure oh yeah i'm gonna take another hit\u00a0\u00a0 off this you're gonna straighten out all right\u00a0\ndrew all right um the strand my favorite strand\u00a0\u00a0 would definitely be the uh pineapple express i\u00a0\njust feel like that tasted the closest to a dab as\u00a0\u00a0 you can get it just tasted natural like like just\u00a0\nstraight weed i mean the turps tasted like weed\u00a0\u00a0 and everything and that's what i look for i mean\u00a0\ni just i love that we taste man um so yeah they\u00a0\u00a0 all had a nice gassy taste to them the pineapple\u00a0\nexpress especially did like that one just tastes\u00a0\u00a0 like a straight down and um the company\u00a0\nrecreational a i think that they're [ __ ] awesome\u00a0\u00a0 on quality uh you know they got quality products\u00a0\nthat if you looked at the um carts when we got\u00a0\u00a0 them they all had the same amount of uh discipline\u00a0\nin them that you know it wasn't like they were\u00a0\u00a0 jugging on you know what what they put and what\u00a0\num it's pretty cool packaging it's sealed up\u00a0\u00a0 you know um the tips are really cool they're\u00a0\nlike this this uh chrome kind of deal\u00a0\u00a0 i like that i mean i've never seen anything like\u00a0\nthat so they're very different from everybody\u00a0\u00a0 and yeah i mean it's just overall quality that's\u00a0\nwhat i look for and i mean it's nice yeah you can\u00a0\u00a0 go ahead and talk about what you want to say\u00a0\nabout them all right yeah so i mean for me the\u00a0\u00a0 pineapple express definitely that's like my\u00a0\nfavorite strand of all time anyways but like i\u00a0\u00a0 mean that one in particular not only did it get me\u00a0\nthe highest but uh i mean it tasted you know the\u00a0\u00a0 best at all just like drew said it had like some\u00a0\nreal good like pineapple aftertones to it which is\u00a0\u00a0 what you look for when you're smoking pineapple\u00a0\nexpress but it did taste like weed still too\u00a0\u00a0 and mainly that [ __ ] felt like i hit a dab\u00a0\nwhen i hit that like it really [ __ ] very good\u00a0\u00a0 so and recreationally dude like i've had some\u00a0\nother delta egg carts and they were they were\u00a0\u00a0 pretty good but i've never had delta eight parts\u00a0\nlike that like this is the most official built-in\u00a0\u00a0 carts i've ever seen i mean i can't say nothing\u00a0\nbut good things about this company so shout out to\u00a0\u00a0 vincent for sending this appreciate it yes sir um\u00a0\nand all i gotta say is uh my favorite strain was\u00a0\u00a0 just like gelato was for the flavor hands down i\u00a0\nreally love blue or bomb pops those are like some\u00a0\u00a0 of my favorite popsicles so that just hit home and\u00a0\nhad a very like reminiscent taste uh but for the\u00a0\u00a0 high definitely again i agree with jared on that\u00a0\nskittles that indica hit me straight to the face\u00a0\u00a0 some none of them punched me like that indica did\u00a0\num but it was amazing all around love the carts uh\u00a0\u00a0 i did try one of their connected uh what was it\u00a0\ni don't know what brand they had off the top of\u00a0\u00a0 my head but i did try one of their delta eight\u00a0\ncarts in the past and wasn't near the quality\u00a0\u00a0 from these carts this actually got me seriously\u00a0\nfried i can definitely feel it was potent and had\u00a0\u00a0 a great taste um another thing i will say is uh\u00a0\nrecreational light they're a very safe company to\u00a0\u00a0 go through they've been doing this for a long time\u00a0\nuh all of their things have all of their carts\u00a0\u00a0 have batch numbers on them everything is certified\u00a0\nthey have all their licenses and registration to\u00a0\u00a0 be doing what they're doing so if you want to try\u00a0\nthese delta eight carts for yourself for the first\u00a0\u00a0 time i recommend going through their company to\u00a0\ndo it also all their team members are amazing\u00a0\u00a0 great

we're doing this uh and stay\u00a0\ntuned for the next video big thanks peace", "f-DP35X6LaY": "so I'm curious how long does the oil within your cartridge actually last well for our 500 milligram cartridges we'd like to think of it as around 4 to 5 grams of cannabis okay for me it'll last a little less than a week but for my wife it can go a couple weeks okay and for some others it might last a month or two correct right right and - what's the shelf-life of an oil cartridge if I if I happen not to use it right away how long will it last work well with the oil there's not really a shelf-life but sometimes the cannabinoids will degrade over time whether it's with light or heat THC can turn to CBN a CBC can turn to CDL through too much light and that's not harmful but that's not exactly what people might want to have happen correct right so if you have a sativa oil that is high in CBN the CBN is going to make you sleepy which kind of goes against the sativa right and how long would that degradation take to occur it takes a good while at least a year okay so you've got you've got some time yeah it's gonna be gone before that happens and so tell me if I have a oil cartridge and/or it's on the pan or in the package how should I store it storage is probably best at room temperature and you don't want to leave it in your car you don't want to put it in the freezer or the refrigerator just a normal room temperature would be fine and if you live in a hot climate about that if you live in a hot climate it's good to be in air-conditioning if I wouldn't leave it in a car sometimes if if it's too hot in a car the oil will get so thin you're risking possibilities of it leaking got it okay well thank you so much for that answer", "WHW25c58sh8": "[Music] alright guys so I haven't made a video in the minute um that runs video was pretty filmed I'm like a month ago this is like November so that was just something I had that I was able to upload you know does it mean time but I'd be kind of slowing down my videos lately cuz uh not just some [ __ ] has been going on but today I got the [ __ ] kingpin review what did you pack it so let's get into this [ __ ] guys alright so to start off this is a picture of the old packaging and this is how the new packaging is going to look like so doesn't it come in the a tin box like this right you're gonna have this in the front and say kingpin the strain named hybrid in the cursor to go and on the back is where you're gonna have all your information so they put it all in the back instead of like on the sides and stuff the sides are all planned and here actually you're gonna have right when you first open you're gonna have an office authentication sticker there's gonna be like some green sticker with like a key around it type thing and it's gonna have a serial number and I need to look it up or something and I'm pretty sure you can find the authenticity like I'll keep this page or something I don't know but to open it you just simply take that sticker off and lift up and this we can be presented with you're gonna be presented with a black kingpin type of thing a to you just moved from there and this is like plastic to just all tuned and you just pop it open like a Pierrot boom comes out and these are gonna be kingpins new cartridges they're gonna be the regular Cecil cartridges they're not using the metal cards anymore and that kingpin a branding earth there's of stickers not even though printed on the undercard anything it just goes along with the California sticker and this is what the new car is in the B because of the black tube the distillate on this cart is does not taste like gum the disability from when they had the metal cartridges like those I don't know there's something different about it and it looks way different now I've never got to meet him I never got to make a video on keeping but they used to be like pretty clear you know what used to be like this has it it's clear you know it's [ __ ] clear but no how it has like a really gold tint to it it was like clear that before I had like a clear tint to it hello and it tastes I mean it tastes cool now this is my first time getting gelato and this flavor is really strong idyllic flavor got stronger you know there's a lot not in a bad way but you know if the flavor got stronger you could taste the flavor a lot more that's a good taste but it just doesn't hug it doesn't hit as hard I don't know and I feel like with these cartridges the last ones by way quicker just because you have like what four different openings for the wax to go to the clothes so just goes about way quicker I mean you might get a bigger hit but it just makes it go by way quicker and I rather I just have the old school Kaitlyn styled Christchurch my gosh it was perfect to be honest like it was it was you know one of a kind like you know if you seen that car those could be detecting you know because nobody had a long type of car like Dan tips for like a flat and short whoo I like those cars on you [ __ ] with these did everybody else is this like this is like this coming for the review you guys haven't seen it go check it out book I would almost compare this to a skunk for the now like before kingpin was honestly like number one like I always say regarding there's number one our city is like number two or three like right next to LA cuz you know so this kind of sucks that they had to change to this cartridge in I mean from what I could tell it just it was different tastes different looks different but other than that just kidding take some history mister you see the clouds it still throws amazing clouds taste is on point I mean there is nothing wrong I've said it in videos before and that reviewed cartridges I said this was like a 10 out of 10 so this thing was perfect got you high every single hit but now I feel like I need like two hits just to get it like a cool buzz no but we're gonna screw it onto the battery right here that the began battery the smoke shop honeydew but uh take a little blink no I won't say I was about to take a big see from that swallow to hit a cool colleague No - days in Chicago first time getting to shake the cards auto stasis in from the cartridge y'all [ __ ] tasty same for some reason yeah guys this is a new packaging for keeping like a little thumbnail weather yeah handy packaging man not much to it cool packaging is the point takes away your point is a [ __ ] new style of a cart so kind of just even in our heart just stick to the cartridge and buried this to it then to get a [ __ ] a better packaging they probably did this just because um just to catch people's eye you know get some new customers or something but man you didn't have to [ __ ] change [ __ ] car I wasn't expecting for the card to be Delta like cars gonna be the same I told him just the package man change I was surprised but as I'm here for the video guys who VI spied you guys to go baby here around two and nine make sure good I mean yeah you know what I'm a [ __ ] stick to my my roots PCF and phenols man and flavors even though I haven't been the flavors go to those man never had a bad experience one time bro I have [ __ ] bought a $25 grandma sauce and I got home and I realized that lady charged me fifty five dollars for the [ __ ] grandma sauce I like what the foot and because I bought other stuff we're doing you know siding notice they came up like 150 okay then guesses make sense and I get home check the receipt on my wall with the foot saw a column I'm like bread I'm not from Modesto I'm a little bit a little bit of ways you know I was like I could take it back but I was like back you know and don't worry they're like you come in time we've assigned credits to your account blah blah my damn bow they did this Auto phone you know like ultra phone we call them daily or have any waiting like keep me waiting they called me back you know like they're like we'll call you back we're gonna fix anything for you bro I spent at least an hour and a half least the least an hour at the [ __ ] the spiritually trying to I bought accidental God extra cart I miss you by three cards I'm Adam it's like to bloom cards and a kingpin and I got three boon cards in one keeping and I went back to try to return it and they're like oh we lost have returns and I'm right back then okay I don't know they're awful it's just made of the policy of [ __ ] returning cartridges so [ __ ] stupid bro like you're not losing money the [ __ ] company keeping itself is losing money you're not the one that you get a replacement for free at least have seen those kids they said like oh that's cool because I literally take our shoes half ways fools like when because I like stop working like that [ __ ] rod or anyone that's halfway through not hitting [ __ ] this I have to go return this year like halfway school maybe a court before and they took it man that's proper all that that's what keeps customers that's why when you walk in there usually for most of the time you mean ones fool goes by like that bunch of quick so shouts out a pcfg mister flavors and blue fire that's a new location out there and we're safe so you guys aren't there so make sure to go check them out is I haven't even told the guys a [ __ ] name of the [ __ ] I'm not even a [ __ ] it mention the [ __ ] name of the [ __ ] dispatcher I went to for this [ __ ] but yeah guys I just went around bullying pocket cut that up a lot but some of you for the video and take a bleeder to end it and you guys [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music]", "SXMTTO5fcQs": "hey there everyone welcome to my channel and if this is your first time here welcome my name is Courtney Crosby I currently live in Portland Oregon working in the cannabis industry and I want to share my love of the cannabis with you all but before we get started got a little Bowl packed here if you want to join alone that be awesome [Music] your best resource for smoking without the smell is going to be cartridges there are a few different types and styles of cartridges I mean with a prequel Tabar battery this is going to be my favorite battery that I have and it comes with the battery itself a charger a micro USB charger which I love about this battery two different bottom pieces for your cartridges that you had attached to the bottom of your cartridge to make it a magnet connection to the battery itself a few different cartridges to this battery and show you how well it works and everything screw this little bottom on the metal bottom piece on here making it a magnet connection to the battery and see so it doesn't fall out which is really nice look at the button five times to turn the battery on and off you can also double click the button here and it will do a pre heat setting which is really nice if you've ever had your battery laying on the side and all the oil has run to one side of the cartridge or it's just really cold and your cartridge and the oil inside is really cold you can put that pre heat setting on and it'll preheat the cartridge in together ready for use which is really awesome also has a temperature gauge up here at the top which is really important three cartridges to burn at different temperatures also when you set your cartridge down on the lowest temperature you're gonna go through your cartridge a lot slower it's also gonna taste a lot better so if you have your cartridge turn all the way up on high which is good for some cartridges to work or to lay other cartridges it'll just taste really burn you'll actually burn your cartridge and sometimes it can actually pop through the top of your cartridge and burn you which what you don't want on our cartridge oh just turn it down I can help with things like that so I'm gonna hit this bad boy and show you what it can do [Music] so taking this metal piece off and transferring it to you let's try out this buddy's cartridge these specific cartridges you can tell there's a little bit different we got two different mouthpieces here also the different types of oil on the inside which is really important just depending on what kind of cartridge you want I'll specifically really like the flat tips because you can hit it from any direction where is these tips you can only get it from the front or the back you have a specific battery with a button on it you have to hit a specific direction that can be difficult if your cartridge is in at a funny angle I just transferred the metal piece on to this cartridge here so it is now a magnet connection to this battery here so it doesn't fall out and you try it with this cartridge [Music] moving on to evolve I have their living resin cartridge and their battery to go open up this battery check it out another micro USB charger which is really great just plugs in down here on the bottom which is really awesome it says evolve across the battery with a nice button [Music] a button for your battery is also really important because some cartridges actually require a button it kind of just sends the signal to the cartridge saying okay it's time to warm up and activate the cartridge so some cartridges actually require a button on them some batteries are just a pull-through battery some cartridges work with those but not all cartridges do the last battery that we got here this is going to be a disposable battery so the battery comes with the cartridge you don't have to buy them separately just really great but once you're finished with that you would actually recycle the whole bad boy together so let this one it will be one of those pull through batteries it doesn't have a button on it or anything this is the Nano here there's also this type of a battery here that also has the button but also has a screw on USB charger on the top really great if you're looking for just an easy accessible battery on the go most of time these bad boys had lifetime warranties on them but unfortunately most the time if you lose this charger please piece in is irreplaceable that is why I like the micro USB chargers it a lot of these bad boys gone here

you all have a great day", "GDgj4zVNub0": "so we are going to be doing a uh cbd versus thc delta 9 versus thc delta 8 blind test we're gonna have my friends try out these drugs and see if they can tell the difference between them uh this is purely for entertainment uh so let's get right into it by the way if you don't know who i am i'm chris with cbd extract and if you haven't tried our hemp flour before do me a favor and hit the link down below and you can grab an eighth of our hemp flour completely for free it doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link down below to claim the offer let's get right into it we're not going to tell you what's what okay oh we're going to we're going to tell you at the end but for now let me ask a couple questions okay uh how long have you been smoking like a year and a half year and a half okay about six years six years quite a while yeah that's quite a while how experienced would you say you are with weed but i am not good at knowing types quite a lot of experience so i'm a big dabber so like um i get a lot of different profiles like i tried to switch up my strains and stuff and switch up like in because of a hybrid so okay i like to get a lot of different like experiences so i'm pretty well versed and he's from the uk by the way wheat is not legal there at all so he has [ __ ] weed [ __ ] weed in [ __ ] england they don't even have cbd weed there if they do they have to label it as tea because they they don't even allow cbd weed there so this is the first cartridge uh you're going to have to guess if it's delta 8 delta 9 or cbd and also you know just feel what you think about it tastes like ginger um it's interesting like it tastes like a flounder tastes like actual planters i could do your own i feel nothing it just tastes very like not strong but you can tell the flavor no but that just tastes like the ground it tastes like the ground yeah what cannabinoid would you say this is um it tastes a little bit different from like most cards i almost want to guess that's delta nine i really don't know i don't know cbd i'll i'll say this is cbd for now but i might change my mind so okay i don't know i get like a certain like throw hit off of the actual thc and i felt like slightly different but i almost can kind of notice some effects i could just be liking a placebo so this is the next card [ __ ] tastes a lot more like what i would expect a cart to taste like oh there we go right off the bat i noticed it's super clear i'm just looking at it it looks pretty concentrated and i can i feel like i can almost kind of feel it off of that suit and by the way on these parts we're doing a curveball because not only are some some of them delta 8 or delta 9 or cbd we're also some of them are botanical terpenes and some are going to be cannabis derived terpenes so we're going to talk not super vibrant flavor like if there's any terps in this i would guess it's you know minimal what do you think about the taste this is um this is delta eight would you say it's an indica or sativa i'm never gonna tell you that all right yeah whatever i get in the currency but it's just for like the flavor differential not really the effects i never noticed anything different [ __ ] does it hit strong though like i smoked delta 8 before but this is kind of different this is like that tastes very strong in the back of my throat i can feel that [ __ ] just yeah it's definitely there um this is delta a that's delta a i think the last one might have been delta nine because starting to fill that a little bit i'm gonna guess delta h [ __ ] i don't like that one like nothing like i can't taste anything really just tastes like is there a throat hit to it nope no throwhead okay it's fruity yeah i don't know and it hits good like very smooth it just tastes like him like i'm chewing grass taste reminds me a lot of like actual distillate like um delta nine still i like this one it seems to look a little bit like it unless it's just like terps although it does look really thick i don't know it's good though i like that one so would you say cbd delta 8 or delta 9 on this one um i'm pretty stuck in between delta no no no this is delta a not cbd i don't know that was delta nine which one the one that i just did was delta nine the first one cbd because this is way weaker than the last one right i'm not tripping like this has to be delta a i don't know you tell me man i think there might be like some cd in there too you think there might be cbd yeah yeah i think like the last one is more like pure delta eight if i had to guess and then like this one there's like some other additives i don't know it could be completely wrong but i don't know how you know the difference between [Music] [Music] okay hmm is that one clogged too they're all i feel like all cars wow that one hits more it's in the bathroom oh that one is like peaceful this is like taking him right before getting to bed i don't know whether it's thc cbd abc this is like not the strongest thing it's not the strongest like the second weakest in terms of like first impressions right but this is like i could smoke this like a lot you know like i could wake up a lot of bed and take a hit you know i have to prepare myself for this i don't need a big breakfast [Music] this is very casual this is delta r that's delta all right uh yeah or delta yeah delta nine here okay i always get it mixed up then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah interesting i don't know i don't know what this is but it's not dealt to mine not about the man no okay so final verdict finally uh which one would you say was the strongest out of all strong ones one two three or four probably two two three two two no i lied three was this one yeah three okay interesting and so and out of the one two three four which one is cbd which one is delta eight which one's delta nine [Music] cbd was the one with the little white cartridge uh delta nine was the second one and the first one was whatever okay cool am i right nope you're completely wrong so out of the four which one do you think had like the best flavor to the worst flavor um i would say the first one had like the most diverse flavor like i could just like pick up like those things going on in it and i think that one would be the seemingly one the very first one i had um and then the second one there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but uh it seemed like there was a high concentration of thc in it whether it's delta eight or delta card and then uh the third one you gave me it was a lot like the first one but it just had like a little bit more flavor okay cool and then what about the and then the fourth one we just talked about that yeah yeah yeah that obviously tastes like almost any card up there interesting all right well hey that's you were actually spot on that everything was right oh okay then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah and then this the third the middle one was dr eight and then the last one was the first one yeah okay we got that right i did she got everything right yeah oh my god yes so there you have it hope

snapchat at VAR k uy 2 9 before we get into this video real quick just go right down there and subscribe because you might as well like it you can like and subscribe so just do both I have what do we have here we have this TZ starter kit and I have a 1 gram sativa blue dream steezy pod so I've never hit this TZ before but I've heard some good things about it I heard it similar to the plug in place so we're gonna put that to the test the battery capacity is 210 mAh that is not good compared to the plug-in ploy because the plug-in plays battery was 500 mAh but it's okay this is smaller this is a little bit more sleep hopefully still get a good room steezy is revolutionising the cannabis industry by creating a product that offers a discreet experience both for portability and convenience all right well this is very small it's smaller than the size of my hand so yeah let's get to it let's put it together open this box up take some rips and see what the [ __ ] [Music] all right so this is thousand milligrams point zero four of an ounce comes in at eighty point twenty four percent THC 12 milligrams of CBD and this was packaged on 434 2019 so what does that April 30th 2019 yeah April 30 alright so I just up in the box he comes with three things instructions the battery and a USB charger so I mean it's really simple there's really nothing to it battery charger and some instructions that's really on the [ __ ] now we're gonna go ahead and check out this really dream pod alright so this one has like a legit seal like a childproof seal has the sticker on the bottom you know it's official so let's see it says on the side continue holding tab pull the flap open first finger through the server so I'm gonna pull this I think we pull it off the top and over here there's a push button right here oh I just pushed it alright there's a push button right here and it says to push it up continue holding tab pull and flat to open push finger through the circle then push and hold the inner tab firmly [ __ ] is this the enter tab first finally got it so this is our full grams DZ pod looks very very very nice good night nice and clear let's fold up alright so before we start I think we should throw this on the charger just to get some full battery charging time is 30 minutes max for full charge so there this one really quick get it charged up alright so the light has went from red to like a white cousin kind of light so I'm gonna assume it that means it's done it's been about 30 minutes that's [ __ ] River alright so I'm back easy is fully charged very very beautiful alright so this is the blue dreamcourt a blue dream pod whatever whatever they call it yeah pods this is the blue dream pod and [ __ ] cheer is just first time trying this easy let's see and before I start there is no button I didn't go I didn't really go into detail about this so literally is very easy literally slides right in with a magnet clip and pulls it and the USB charger goes right on the bottom no buttons no anything goes off to worry about it going off in your pocket straight pull the air pulls it alright so let's see [Music] how do you feel I feel like I got a slice of butter that was a deficit that was definitely a straight hit to the lungs that hit me but it didn't hit me as much as the plug and play did and that could just be and that could just be because the battery the battery power is not as strong as the plug implant but my first impression was I it's a nice hey it's a very solid hit and you don't feel it as you're inhaling so that's like you know how like after a certain while like your throat starts like it doesn't feel like you're hitting it and then you're like oh oh [ __ ] and then it's just like you blow it out and then that's when it hits you deaf like the plug and play that [ __ ] like set me down for a little bit this I'm still could also be because it's a sativa but I do try that anytime for the plug and play but this isn't sativa I feel great honestly I feel like hey great oh great I'm [ __ ] dropping steezy already um not gonna lie I'm sweating a little bit from that I did get hot but solid for this review first of all just because the size is perfect fits right in your hand right in your pocket even like if you try and keep it low you don't even have to keep it low because nobody really is gonna be all up on it to say oh oh [ __ ] you got a steezy like it looks like a jewel or something so this is perfect size smell it doesn't smell at all no weed smell anything that's coming from it it smells like a nice blueberry kind of smell so yeah you you can use this anywhere and you can use it throughout the day it feels good it feels great and that's just this pod alone the Blue Dream I'm gonna leave the lab results right [Music] these are the clarity of the pods they're great good jobs easy I really like this definitely say that this is more of like a good feeling like I'm feeling it now and it's a good deal and that's just off of one hit so cheers I'm gonna take take some more reps get stoned then Cheers [Music] I do like the blue color tip you don't even have to put a sticker on it and the blue looks great it's like a nice matte blue um oh so I like that I liked it a lot [Music] I think I'm gonna give this pod a 6 out of 10 this is the blue dream its sativa so it's more of just a head high it's not more of that body feeling so kind of lose that as a factor but do you think this is a great cart to have if you're on the go you need something to smoke on I mean it still gets you high it's a great feeling it's just a very quick onset and it's a very quick offset so I think that makes sense definitely would recommend buying the steezy I am going to try the big steezy with a bunch of different pods so stay tuned for those videos I'm getting that soon I hope you guys enjoyed I hope this makes you want to go grab these because this [ __ ] is tough [Music]", "qhSRUwzR3Ko": "[Music] smoking what's good guys stony rob here back for another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day in today's video i have a reddit can ready cartridge this is uh a cannabis extract this goes on my good supply vape and we're gonna be trying this out [Music] it's a og kush cannabis train today i've tried out the og kush i've reviewed it on this channel you can check it out i'll put a link in the description down below but today we're going to be checking out the ready cartridge by the company ready can og kush so without further ado let's get started so like i said here we have the ready can and the ready cartridge 510 uh thread it's it has a net weight of 0.5 kilograms the net volume of the contents inside of it is .45 milliliters it has 790 milligrams of thc and has a total of 79 percent thc 0.03 cbd ingredients cannabis extract terpenes this is what i guess gives it the og kush flavor and yeah here we have the og kush and i can give you the back specifications here we have the warning symbol uh it says warning the smoke from cannabis is harmful toxic and carcinogenic chemicals found in tobacco smoke such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons aromatic ammons and an air tube and n heterocyclics are also found in cannabis smoke i don't know what the hell that means but yeah this is the warning sign there you have it uh so without further ado let's open it up um like this bang and here we have the cartridge the og kush cartridge and yeah let's pop it out yeah here it is with the cartridge let's pop out the seal bang wow and let's whip on cartridge and here we have it oh yeah perfect great success here we are thc logo the r logo i'm gonna be trying it out i'm not gonna be doing a blinker that's obvious ha ha [ __ ] a blinker and i'm turning this on and yeah cheers guys i'm gonna take a nice fat rip off this dab pan and yeah i'm gonna see if it tastes good doesn't taste good i don't know does it taste like og kush i'm gonna find out in like a few seconds so let's get it cheers i'ma let it preheat first my bad let's get it not bad not bad at all hold up yep get a little sip of my timmy here i'm not even gonna lie this actually tastes good i can kind of feel the taste of the og cushion it that og kush taste but yeah cheers let's take another hit yeah this is hitting pretty well i'm enjoying it as for now i'ma let the the high settle in oh no it's making me feel good good og kush i honestly i'm just curious to see if it's gonna give me that nice ogeekush mellow high yeah it's settling in what i like about wax the distillate that goes in this is that it's almost the insta buzz it doesn't take some time for it to settle in so yeah do you guys enjoy dab pens i don't know i'm smoking this right now because i just did my wisdom teeth and i'm trying to find the alternative as to like smoking harsh tobacco backwood smoke and yeah i'm trying out distillate for now well i guess wax dabs that pen and yeah it's doing the job right it's not hurting me too much i have a little bit of pain right now but yeah whatever i'm uh medicating myself with this you know what i mean yeah but it it tastes pretty good it's not too harsh um i mean i guess it has that og kush taste but like it's not as strong or prominent as smoking the bud itself like obviously there's some sort of difference in the taste of the distillate like i'm pretty sure if you'd give me like og kush distill it and like i don't know another strain and i'd be like yeah i mix them up right yeah but like if you give me og kush bud and you'd give me like rock star bud and compare the two i'd be like this one's oj kush this one's rockstar kush you know like i'd be able to taste it smell it and feel that this one's oj kush this one's a rock star you know i mean and this nah i can't really taste the difference mostly it tastes like distillate wax you know it tastes like concentrate um i'm gonna take another hit yeah i want to give you guys a close-up yeah so i'd recommend this pretty good i give it like a seven out of ten i'm no way shape or form also encouraging buying this product i'm not encouraging the consumption just saying it is a good distillate good taste in it's by itself is very good you know i mean the product itself is good um not gonna hate it too much i'll probably finish this like fairly quickly because my other 0.5 pod like finish in like a day or a day or two right i'm not complaining too much it tastes good it's just fun to puff it's smooth it goes in quickly it gets the job done it gets me high has thick smoke thick enough smoke for me right now because i can barely puff i'm not supposed to like suck in air you know but it's getting the job done that wax high you know i'm out here i'm elevated i'm stoned feeling good i hope you guys are feeling good too so yeah this was the og kush by reddit can here's the box oj kush recommend it if you have the time to go get a car or whatever try it out oj kush 18 plus never go wrong with og kush the high's mellow it's kicking in right and i kind of feel the same way kind of sedated that nice indica uh sensation but anyways this

Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future make sure you follow me on snapchat and Instagram and everywhere else to see everything I'm doing I'm only supposed to on snapchat whatever new stuff I get first so especially if you live in PA and you want to see like what new

hit that took I've been cheeping on this all day too I'm gonna be going up to Colorado next week so I'm gonna see how the lab present cartridges are out there pronounced you got a bunch of videos lined up around them out there let me know if there's anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't really look cool enough that just feel like a little nerd out there blowing little starfish or whatever they do thank you so much for watching click like if you enjoyed make sure you subscribe my name is Jeff peace [Music]", "zZt4m-I8gZo": "if you want a canvas patient or of age please back off with this video yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be smoking this crescendo true leaf cart that they sent me so i forgot the exact type of cartridge that it is but i'm gonna have a picture of it and you guys will know what it is but is it open and i'm pretty sure it's a cured uh resin that's what it is so it's gonna have more of like a greeny taste is what they say so it's gonna taste more like the actual flour so since it's gonna be more like a resin i'm going to change the temperature oh it's actually on the coldest temperature right now so we're going to head on this on this toki 510 thread battery so here is the cartridge itself um the battery i guess and let me show you the cartridge this isn't the box it came in but this is the tube it came in because they have new boxes now so there was no point of me taking out the old box but yeah the cartridges are pretty much the same so let's go ahead and take a hit and let's see we could do as you guys can see i did change the background or i changed you know where i usually record my videos just because i want to change it up a little bit so you guys aren't always getting the same type of content and same area so let's go ahead and try something different [Music] so as you guys can see i've been getting a lot better at my ghosts and they're a lot easier in the car because there's no wind or anything moving but yeah the flavor's good it does have a green taste like they say i already smoked a lot of it so i already know how it tastes but it is true to what they say it does taste like it should let's go ahead and take another so this is a half gram see i'm just going to take a look around the cartridge so you guys can go ahead and look at the oil if you want i don't know if i'm too close so i'm gonna move back just a tad it's hopefully everything does look good that was a baby head and it still looked pretty nice i feel like you guys may want me to hit a blinker i usually don't hit blinkers on live resins or live yeah i guess cured live resins just because they're a little bit harsher on the throat and it's more of like it's hard to handle i guess pretty much i'll try i'll try to do it [Music] to be honest i didn't do it but i know this thing has like a seven second counter i was about one second away but there's no point in [ __ ] myself up for that i would have just coughed it all out and i wouldn't even have you know a decent head it would have just been a waste so i would rather just use that or stopped it there instead of wasting the hat because this stuff isn't cheap but uh thank you guys so much for watching

do this video man delta eight delta eight my guy this is the delta eight card from black tie this is cbd delta ape vape banana vape banana you know what i love about black time one not only do they take their products very seriously they have great products but they take their packaging seriously seriously this is noise this is noise packaging this is nice packaging and this little button see on this you got to push this little button down and you push it down far enough it should fly right up it's child proof [ __ ] you know that's what you're supposed to do [ __ ] it can be a bit difficult you know what it's teeth time oh [ __ ] i'm gonna [ __ ] my two [ __ ] then i know i don't like them [ __ ] there's gotta be a better way am i doing this wrong let me get some help push the button push the button okay push the button with this pull down but anyway besides the difficulty of that look at this oh look at that delta eight cart oh i needed today too delta eight is for mondays delta eight is for mondays and it's a monday oh this is what i see everything is already ready with black tie everything is already 100 ready it you get the cartridge and you get the pen and i really do love the packaging i'm not gonna lie this is just this this is great packaging this is the 0.5 milliliter and it is the kit so that's what you need to make sure you get if you go to them if you don't already have a pen which i did not so i had to order the kit but let's get to it man because delta 8 is all the rave right now so they say um this makes the review super easy because i don't have to roll up i don't have to like there's nothing to do but get it and to say what i always say before i smoke which is salute to health wealth and self as you all know self love is the best love so look if you haven't heard the words i love you today then please get to the closest of me and tell yourself self i love yourself because you can't love anyone else or expect anyone else to love you if you don't love yourself you dig so let's see what it's talking about and yeah smoking in the hotel room [ __ ] the rules that banana flavor is delicious oh my god it's yummy yummy yummy some kind of song that banana is good this is definitely justin bieber this is definitely bieber in here black tie you got that yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yup set up work i'm gonna wait yeah babe okay okay okay this is about the delta egg first of all oh man i said banana i meant banana that banana flavor is kicking i can tell you this it does not take much it don't take much to fix their fix the effects kick in quick so um i would talk more about the banana flavor but if you don't know what a banana tastes like then where have you been but the flavor banana bananas amazing i love banana i like banana flavored nyls i just like that flavor so this was an excellent excellent choice for moi that's me [ __ ] smooth but yet strong though it is strong and the effects the effects are great it is a as the effects kick in it reminds you of a delta nine thc type feel if you're familiar with what i'm talking about um it it feels like it's close to that it's not that though this is definitely uh it's it's delicious the effects are the effects are calming uh that's my homeboy uh vic right there the effects are calming um it is a it's a you you you almost you're right there at getting an intoxicated type feel but really really good um i will say this excuse me i will say this if you guys are used to one if you do not fool with thc because it increases your anxiety rather than helps calm it down then be careful with this because it's gonna somewhat remind you of that type of feel um but if you guys are not worried about that at all then this is definitely a must-have uh and i'm just indulging right now because it really doesn't take that much for the effects to start kicking in but at the same time the the flavor makes you want to keep hitting it the flavor alone will make you just keep coming back more coming back for more but the effects kick in really quick and it it it's a it's a it's a sense of it's a sense of euphoria uh it gives you a happy feel i definitely feel like this is

"here is the joy Tech ego io a io stands for all-in-one basically you just need a Jew's for this because this has a battery in it it's a 1500 mAh battery which is pretty good should last you all day and it's real basic just one-button operation just click that and it works there's nothing else to learn nope no adjustments to be made on it really other than an adjustable airflow on the top but if you're looking for a simple sleek looking easy-to-use vape you might like that joy tech ego IO so we will take a look at this just open the box quick I'll bait one a little bit could be a few final thoughts show you a couple similar devices in size alright let's check it out here's the box that it comes in open er up there is USB right there to charge a fire button pretty simple verification let's get a manual here is the USB charger at one coil another coil driptip looks like there's little condensation in there see on the drip tip to the water from something I guess hadn't planned on washing it this soon but I ran a little water through and then just suck a paper towel down like this and twisted it same thing with this side it did go in when I first did it but then I just went in here and just twisted it around dry it out if you want to change the color it comes with a few different colors where it lights up hold the fire button down when it's off and you get this stitch is like a purple indigo if you can see that hold it again green holes again like blue turquoise a darker blue and green pretty cool so you can do that and then to turn it on just five quick clicks there it is so now it's going to be set at red cool to fill it this has the childproof cap so you need to just press the drip tip in and then twist it they'll come off like that then it comes with two coils so we'll prime the coil first and then fill it with juice just about five drops down the middle here these are pretty big drops because of the high VG's use that I'm going to use so stick with three let's just read this to the top the whole thing wants to spin if you hold it by the drip tip or like this it might be snug enough but I'll just give it one more little tighten by holding this middle if you hold it right here then it won't then the inside won't turn so it doesn't need to be too tight and then to fill it up you see the mark there that's the max fill line right there so you don't want to go over that and if you have a two colored one there will be a different color where they right there you'll see how the color goes up it stops right there and that's where you fill it up - here's the fill mark on the right when you have the two colored one here all the colors that it comes in just pour the easiest right down the middle nice and easy so almost there that's good just spread the cap back on and then twist this to tighten it all the way and it's good now the cap won't come back off like that it's ready to use so let it sit for a couple of minutes just so the e-juice gets soaked up into there you want to do that when you first fill the coil so it doesn't burn or fry the coil all right now she is ready to use she's sad for a few minutes to soak the juice in the only adjustable feature on this is an adjustable airflow if you can see those little knobs right there basically like that is full air flow when they line up and then either side when they're basically at nine o'clock looking at it this way or three o'clock it's as restrictive as possible and then anywhere in between is just slightly more restrictive until you get to the middle where it's fully open or rather this is a little bit more restrictive than this and then all the way to three and then if you turn it all the way then it starts to open back up again and then close off at nine o'clock pretty simple it doesn't make a huge difference this is just a little bit more open than this they're both pretty much for mouth to lung vaping hits when you take a drag on it like a cigarette in your mouth first you could sort of do a lung hit like this if you wanted to try but this really isn't that type of device although it does create some pretty good vapor so we'll try it out we'll do it at this yeah just a nice amount of vapor not too crazy they definitely refine this for the right coil just to have a simple easy to go set and forget it one-click operation nice and basic but definitely a little bit more vapor than your standard ego or Evod type thing definitely good for that let me just try a lung hit for the heck of it see how much beep I can get out of this little thing which once again it's not really made for that but so I'll just line the hole up like that try it out like this not bad it's a little restrictive for a long hit so I wouldn't recommend that really it creates some good vapor for a little little device like this real simple to use pretty cool with the colors and the price is great on this it's like 20 dollars maybe a little bit less nice little device if you like the looks of it or looking for something a little bit more powerful if you have like a miniature cigarette like the blue cig or you should try two views or the mark 10 green smoke v2 south beach smoke any of those and you want something to step it up just a little bit the only thing you'll need to know how to do which I showed you is fill the a liquid and otherwise 1500 mah battery should last you all day I think depends how much you vape on it at least a good part of the data so if you brought it with you to work and just use it on breaks or whatever nice and simple nice-looking couple features on this not many but it has a spiral mouthpiece you can see that it's a spiral so she can get any spit back from this so it produces a pretty good vapor one other thing you'll want to do is they say is to just vape on it with the power off a couple times after you let the EZ sit in it for a couple minutes to get that ease use through the atomizer coil soak it up so it doesn't burn when it charges the battery indicator light will be red and then when it is fully charged the light will go out the light will indicate the battery life when you press fire it'll stay lit when it's 60 to 100 percent what is 30 to 59 percent it'll still flash slowly might just flash there to the flash okay there's a slow flash so that's 30 to 59 percent then when it's 10 to 29% it'll flash moderately fast and then when it's 0 to 9 percent it will flash quickly so that will tell you where the battery is when you charge it and all that that's pretty much it for features on this the coils are stainless steel 316 they're 0.6 oh and I think I think I said point eight but there are point six own coils we do a quick size comparison to a couple of similar devices this is the I just start you can see it's a little bit bigger very similar one-click operation that's what they look like next to each other and then here's something with a few more features by kangertech which is the sub pod mega TC this basically has two settings and it does have direct lung hits if you wanted even more vapor if you're looking for something that produces some almost some decent clouds not like crazy but pretty good that's this thing and it has a 2300 mAh battery so quite a bit bigger but then again with the low resistance on this one it's going to go through the battery in a similar amount of time because it uses more power for the extra vapor yeah it kind of fits right in your hand not too big so the Joye 10 ego io nice little device for like $20 I'll put a link below where you can buy it and that's it", "DKOD64GSTvE": "I got blueberry strawberry lemonade and sweet melon shot - Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or have a medical marijuana card I don't know my personal information I know what's up guys running right back at you so this video I got another card review for you guys if you guys like these like car reviews and like weaved reviews uh videos like tell me down below in the comments so I know to keep doing them otherwise I won't make these videos anymore and I'll put more effort and content that you guys might put out content that you guys do enjoy watching so yeah let me know down below in the comments if you guys like these or not so I know what to do but this video I actually got a cart review like I said in the beginning a detective a few different strains from this brand ego lapse Evo lab I got blueberry strawberry lemonade and sweet melon so we got a sweet melon blueberry and strawberry lemonade this is the one that we're gonna review today in this video so uh yeah if you guys want to see a review for these two stumbled on ball I'm gonna do that the reason why I actually like got three of these is because they had like a fire eyes do they actually have it thrown off the next week's that's [ __ ] dope um we buy two of these for $29 each so I'm down to like 60 bucks they give you a free one it's like a free car and a free battery with it so this is the battery I had to open the battery to charge it when I made this video so a PI two cards you get a free car and a free battery so 60 bucks you end up getting three carts and a battery that's the [ __ ] CEO in my opinion um yeah that's the [ __ ] crazy deal so though they're only half gram cards obviously so but still 60 bucks for 1500 milligrams and a battery I mean you can't really beat that and this from a dispensary so you know it's like I leave some quality [ __ ] you know what I'm saying so the battery I had to open it up so it looks just like a simple stick battery it comes in here this was the box this is evil lab a battery that's pretty much all that says it's evil evil a battery that's what it says that's pretty much all the box that and then um inside there it came with obviously the little stick battery no little stick battery the charger for it I think it's just a regular Android charger the charges with and then it comes with a little instruction paper so it says uh to charge the voltage this fate battery has three temperature settings low is the green green light medium is a blue light and then the high temperature is a red light to change the voltage setting click the button three times quickly quickly preheating your batteries key to a quality burn to preheat the battery turn the battery on by clicking five times then press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds the user can stop reheat in my press in one time so so I guess I supposed to picked up the temperature you want low medium or high obviously and then a preheat it and then hit it I don't know that others like pain if you guys see my last couple reviews I didn't have to preheat it you literally there's no button or not and you just [ __ ] hit it so that's a little bit different oh I see myself with that in a second so the bag that I opened this up already um even like all I did is just slides up you see that's all I did I didn't really take it out of there but this is a really [ __ ] sick packaging I can look at this for how cheap this [ __ ] like how for how cheap they're giving this away like three cards for 60 bucks for the battery they look [ __ ] fired - like watch so this is the packaging obviously yeah let me show you the packaging yeah so this is the package in one more time for you guys evil lab strawberry lemonade down there contains marijuana keep away from children contains 500 milligrams and I believe these are called the Cuomo colors that's what the Spencer you're saying if you see you right there I hope that label doesn't have any of my personal information I'm not supposed to be showing you guys on it hopefully it doesn't and if it does please don't [ __ ] me over but yeah so 500 milligrams it's also a hybrid are you guys that are interested it's a hybrid cart so it's called a chroma colors by evil lab that's the name of them and actually I think these cards are extracted with co2 like in the house some companies a cracker or you know like there's a million different ways to do it now but I believe that these are these are co2 yeah I believe it you co2 come correct but don't quote me on that but I'm almost 90% sure basically everything thirty years ago so I guess it's tested at 80 percent THC yeah there's test results for you guys very interested all that [ __ ] and then I'm what school you just slide it out of here and I think this is though I haven't seen anything past this part I just let it out of here and I seen this oh yeah so right here I saw yeah you see this college car or co2 card you see what I'm saying so yeah I'm pretty sure it's me I co2 here's the little bum tube inside a box I don't know what the [ __ ] we want to call that so you pull that out nothing really inside there it's empty now evil laugh this contains marijuana keep away from children basic [ __ ] then again up their CEO - like I was saying before so yeah all you guys see this if you guys want you can pause this and read it I'm not gonna eat the whole thing it's just kind of going over the brand some of the other products they have and just some information if you guys want you can read that I don't feel like reading the whole thing right now do you guys yeah posit if you want today I came with that that was inside the tube and then besides for that use the cart so every they called what chromo colors or something like that I said every flavor cart so the strawberry lemonade is lemonade is obviously yellow no I'm saying blueberry is a blue the sweet melon is I got green I think and like just all the different flavors on the cartridge in the color so I think that's just like a little cool thing they do a little small detail that you guys really though the actual oil itself is really really really clear actually but you guys can see that tell me your opinion down below in the comments also there was the bubble so you can see I think it is the oil for like 10 bucks a car basically I mean I'm not complaining and I know it's my dispensary not I mean so I has to be safe so tell me what you guys think down below in the comments for sure definitely interested in knowing what you guys think but um let's just pop this [ __ ] off throw it on my new battery and see what happens sorry so we got those two yellow things a lot this is what it looks like without that yellow tips so I'm not gonna lie um this looks pretty badass like all black battery with a few labs and black card with like whatever color accent flavor you got and not I'm saying this [ __ ] is actually pretty doh so I guess we're gonna go medium so it's about to click it five times real fast one two three four five all right so it's on I don't know if you've seen it blank so let me wanna so click it three times one blue that's green ice oh I'm blue I don't know if you've seen it we're on medium set medium temperature so now I'm preheating your battery is a key to a quality burn to preheat turn the battery on my collecting five times and press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds all right so I'm supposed to preheat it before I hit it I'm supposed to I don't know I never had a car was supposed to preheat it before you hit it but no one to the red light came on that's a preheating it's bubbling up now I hit it I got you so it preheats and nothing you hold so obviously that strips I don't think I hit it all the way I don't know what the [ __ ] it felt like um I wasn't getting like at all like the curette airflow it wasn't hitting correctly that should hit smooth as [ __ ] um I definitely got the long expansion it did oh I did like hurt my chest a little bit like that just do you know I'm saying I have a high tolerance if you guys didn't know by now but this is a far as Cara I can taste the lemonade a little bit I don't really taste the strawberry lemon at least the regular lemonade really else I'll call it not a strawberry lemonade and they're gonna call it strawberry lemonade I really do they should have put like a pink color on it not [ __ ] yellow strawberry lemonade is pink not yellow but just my thoughts and opinions um I first said I mean I liked it it was dope $10 card pretty much I'm not complaining at all the battery into this [ __ ] looks sticky ribs I'm not 10 bucks I'd buy if these are in stock for 10 bucks for like every I would keep on buying these forever because you can't go wrong with this [ __ ] his fire was [ __ ] 500 milligrams I only hit it once but it's 10 bucks for this what the [ __ ] is definitely weird there yeah so 10 bucks for this [ __ ] is definitely [ __ ] worth it in my opinion um if you guys ever see that the owner area Duncan Copp lemon hey if you guys ever tried this brand and we don't belong the comments what you guys think of it let's hit it again real quick [Music] so that tasted like it was a little bit burnt I thought it off you seen that but I'll put it back on the low temperature heads up on the medium temperature I feel like that was I tasted a little burn so let me hit it real quick on the low temperature your sleep affects it taste or anything at all you know I mean you guys are smoked off I didn't say in the beginning in this video I always [ __ ] forget I should have edited it and don't watch this video Lester 1821 whatever the legal age is in your state or you have any medical merit or you have your medical marijuana card like I do myself um yeah just gotta say that [ __ ] to cover my ass I can't get this channel to lead it don't want a copyright strike you know how it goes so yeah long time that's it I was a lot Betty whoo all right so definitely got a lot more flavor on that um definitely got the lemonade tastes a little bit more tasted I think that I don't know if I did something wrong when I preheated it or well I don't know because my first time using this battery I have to give it a little bit more used to it but it does taste a little bit burnt um but I think I might that might be my fault I think I did something wrong but for 60 bucks for three cards 1500 milligrams and a battery I'm not complaining at all that was a hundred percent where is it the cart I'm gonna give the cart the oil I'm gonna give me like a 3.5 out of 5 it's not the best oil if you guys you guys seen my own select elite premium court views um those half gram carts are so [ __ ] fired but they're 40 bucks a half-round recipes right here these are [ __ ] fire this is actually pineapple Express I dropped the review on this I'll go watch that video if you want these are actually 40 bucks for a [ __ ] half gram that's [ __ ] expensive but these are so [ __ ] fired for the basically like a little bit more than the price of one of those cards you could get three carts of these with a battery you know what I mean so just personally my opinion I like saving money I like ballin on a budget you know what I mean so I would go with these but the oil is in the best I'm had better like I just said I said 3.5 on the oil quality but the looks like the aesthetic just like everything about it like just the way the battery looks the way they carved like looking complements the battery that [ __ ] gets a 5 out of 5 a [ __ ] it's sexy [ __ ] like you got a mitt but it's it's not the worst though so it's like I'll definitely wait rather I'd pay 40 bucks for one of these before I pay 40 bucks for a [ __ ] Mario Kart or an exotic card [ __ ] those so yeah that's that's one thing never smoked one of those so yeah overall reading the battery before I rate I mean first impressions on the battery I like the battery a lot I don't know if it's the car or if it's the battery that has that little burnt taste like I'm talking about so I need to try the battery on a couple other cards first before I can really give it a full rating you wanna mean but I really like it I like the way it looks like oh saying and I like how it has that pre he said and how it has three different temperatures that shit's all badass that little like burnt taste I don't know if that's coming from the car or the batteries I need to figure that out so I don't know right now I'm gonna give the battery a 4 out of 5 but that's really because I've only hit it 4 times maybe maybe once I hit it a couple more times might give it a better or worse rating I don't know yet the evil labs oil overall I'm gonna give it a 4 out of 5 - because the oil wasn't the best quality yeah I've had way better quality [ __ ] before in the past I've said but compared to some of other exotic all that [ __ ] this is some stupid fire compared to that [ __ ] for the price too though like at least I got a for 60 bucks for three cards and a half I mean for 60 bucks for three cards and a battery that's a [ __ ] stupid steal like you can probably find that [ __ ] unless you are you're getting some fake [ __ ] you know I mean like at the dispensary you're not really fun and you always like that of us it's recreationally legal in your state but that's the reason why I'm [ __ ] with it I like the price point on it some people it's like for people that are ball on a budget that don't wanna I don't have 40 bucks you spend that I have you know I'm saying so I think that should Stoke and they just look sick you know what I mean how everyone's a different color and the pack you know they just for and for how cheap they are to all the small little details they have that shit's crazy but if you guys ever tried the brand like I said time we don't blow in the comments what you guys think if you guys haven't just putting a video I guess tell you how many of your opinions and if you guys actually like like these reviews I might not blow in the comments like I said so I know to keep doing them not I won't okay so if you guys want me to all review these other stream cards the blue baby and a sweet melon so I'll get these out of five um I guess massage for that if you guys like this video big thumbs up comment like

yesterday its indica Skywalker the eureka cart these ones are really high in potency and this is coming in that THC level eighty-seven point fifty-two percent THC mg at 875 points to mg CBD point twenty six and more CBD mg coming in at a whopping two point six feet before this vapor cartridge now we're gonna be unboxing it so it is but put some close-ups on the screen for you guys I love the box here because it actually is a really nice box I don't think you just will end up to the camera really does it justice so exactly a sense of what you hope you guys enjoy this for other people we just had you orgasm you I really do you don't really digging this packaging Buddhist oh my god its packaging you don't really get that you must get them in a vial or something this is how they normally are open so foggy we are going to a he's faking his reviews these things come like this artisan so this is the cartridge here it is a clear oil as you guys can see it clearly obviously explained the title of the video yeah it's real cart we're gonna try to get on this booze penny at really trying it at three point three votes if you guys can see that they're hittin this bad boy alright alright its baby boy hopefully you guys were big along with me and it's can to hit in this car [Music] [Music] first impression all right first impressions of this really good this is a really nice strong pool I like it it's a it's a really nice pool body's pretty thick I like that adds a really pungent and same taste to it this guy Walker by the way but now already mentioned that already but um yeah okay well after those two shitty ghosts um I like said this oil is pretty freakin dank it is pretty freakin fired I have really big dread medicated the Abbas's uriga high potency this thing is really hitting me right now and it's it's more of like um it's like it's like when you're smoking your Jordan or something it's not like an instant high like how you get with these fake cards out here that just have other stuff in it unknown stuff by the way I would just like to mention that just makes the effect of the hike um so much quicker than when it's actually supposed to you know but this one feels like I'm smoking like a blunt and it just comes steady and steady and steady and then it just hits me in the face when I'm just too baked and I'm really baked right now so hopefully you guys did enjoy this video leave a like comment and tell me how you guys are doing on this quarantine and yeah it's been your boy visa", "4prSaPMylLQ": "high design is cannabis parade with more reviews for you today and today I would like to talk about some vape pen products woohoo hey pen I've got these great products right here 1:1 ratio THC CBD I've got Durbin poison no that's the gelato so there we go again I've got gelato and I've got Durbin poison Durbin poison is the sativa the gelato is the indica I have what do I have in here oh oh do I really oh okay well I guess I've got the gelato I've got the indica in here right now I'm surprised I thought I had the sativa see what happens and you don't pay attention anyway excuse me on piece canyon a month anyway so a little while ago I did a review on a vape n CBD cartridge and I was not happy with it at all and not only was I only happy that the CBD vape pen didn't work for me I really was hoping for that to not have the THC and to just use something that would help alleviate my pain but apparently I'm one of those people that I do need the THC in the vape pen along with the CBD which I've discovered from these I got these on 4/20 and this is what I purchased they had a buy one get one so I thought I might as well take advantage of it and it's this one to one ratio I was really hoping for because again I want I want that pain killing effects from the CBD so anyway again going back to what I was saying I'm so distracted there's people playing acai and I keep looking at them so I should probably stop doing that okay they all have no distraction um okay so I was really looking forward to doing another review of a product cuz they pen was kind enough to give me this battery when I saw them when they were doing some biomass their stuff they were there at the Phoenix dispensary and I mentioned I was looking for some CVD babes and they gave me the battery and so I came back gonna try that product and it was really kind of crappy that I didn't like it it was like oh thanks for the gift oh yes garbage I don't like it so I'm happy to review something of the vape pen for the vape pen battery that I actually do enjoy and both of these are great for different reasons of course I use the gelato in the evening time I'm pretty active person mentally very active and I have a hard time shutting down at night and sometimes again there's children in the home here and sometimes I don't want to go outside and smoke and when I'm really having a hard time sleeping if I'm not using and edible I definitely need to smoke it in to kind of go to bed so these are really convenient I really like using them before I go to the gym especially the sativa this Durban poison was great at the gym because I never felt that the yucky illness you know how you get a little heavy sometimes when you smoke this did not do that at all I was able to make it through my workouts even through yoga and then just some weight training and I had no problems at all so really convenient the smoke is nice I will say though the the gelato the indica is a lot smoother than the Durban poison the Durban there's a bag stuck to a tree and I thought it was a squirrel okay see how easily distracted I haven't hold on a minute I need to bring myself back to what I'm doing hold on get some of this indica gone okay the bag blew away that's good I love blowing smoke at you I just want to say no it would be cool if you sent me videos of you receiving this that would be great anyway okay so even though baby lungs do-do-do-do-do so even though excuse me while I wipe away my cry baby tears okay so even though gelato is smoother again it's a vape pen they do kind of cause me to cough it's a lot smoother than some that I've tried I have had some some big products but I've tried of other people's know something I'm gonna try that and see if I like it they made me cough a lot more so this is definitely smoother maybe it's the battery maybe it's the way it burns it I am looking to try some other one that you can set the temperature and because this one does get hot and I'm wondering if maybe one my oil my my cartridge will last longer if it doesn't burn so hot but also maybe I won't get that burning sensation that I get in the back of my throat mainly from the Durbin poison a little bit here umm so keep that in mind when you're getting them certain ones do burn a little hotter than others I'm noticing so some you might have a little more discomfort and I think it also depends on the way you hit it if you hit it really hard it's been gonna burn a little hotter maybe it's cuz I'm searching sit up straight sit up straight head up and beat into work I know I'm not even funny I'm just gonna smoke this okay see today's a day that I need the in the cup when that stuff to do that requires me sitting down which is pretty much what I've been doing the last few days and it helps curb the I need to get up and do something else thing so big help for those kinds of situations again these were I believe 300 milligrams I'll correct that on there if I'm wrong I don't believe I am though whereas a 500-mile against Amador I knew this before I started anyone it was $30 for one of these 0.5 grams anyway $38 I got a buy one get one free so you know what is that $19 I guess piece and in that sense from the Phoenix dispensary I'm just gonna end up cutting all this stuff out because I'm [ __ ] all right so so these cost me $20 so these cost 38 dollars each except there was a buy one get one so you know game II and the DL they lasted a while I mean you could see how much I have left and I've been smoking on this all week I've been trading off with the sativa but the Durban poison and that's how much of that I have left um so it's been again since since April 20th so since 4/20 I've been smoking on these and I have flowers so I've been smoking my flower to again I'm not real thrilled with how long these cartridges last for as expensive as they are but they are convenient and so I guess you are paying for convenience again if I found the battery that maybe control the temperature there by controlling how much of the oil I was using per puff maybe it would help better I don't know maybe you guys know again you know this is not one-sided I'd love to hear some info from you maybe you've had different experiences or you know certain tricks of using these things that I don't know because I really don't I'm really new to vaping if you have favourites let me know so also if you like my videos hit subscribe this is a rambling one I hope I'm able to edit this together to make it somewhat entertaining because I really like this so that's that's how I'm gonna summarize I really like this of a pen cartridge I really appreciate both of these for different reasons so gelato the turbine the gelato and the Durbin poison they both work different different times a day it's like oh this is the morning and this is the night time if you can do a buy one get one I definitely suggest it as the way to go for trying them out because you can try different products I can't wait to try other ones not just buy a pen but definitely I want to try the other ones like a pen yeah like my videos subscribe say hi talk to me every now and then I'm so long", "lZ-vfMIuGco": "[Music] welcome to truebuds tv it's your buddy jack talking distillate vapes versus live resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live resin and the distillate vapes like i said the tons of people were asking like yo bro like what's the difference man and i'm like i'm gonna make a video so here it is thank you for hanging out i'm gonna go enjoy this and if you're liking this pack or you want to grab any of the other true buzz merch you know i'll be truly grateful and i got some really cool stuff just dropped the free smoke edition the stone bald eagle i got a whole video coming about

enjoyed a weekend if you guys quote my live you will see i was turned up to a honey rather in fact a hundred thousand so i did enjoy this weekend and i got two products that also helped me enjoy this weekend guys you guys might want to check them out they're at another super store these i only shop at two superstores guys only deal with two superstars all right dr ganja and my other guy y'all guys already know who that is so dr ganja they have a bigger variety of the d8 cards right now guys right so i got two of them right now just to show you guys i and y'all guys know how i am about these d8s i'm still dealing with them until i find out that they're um really really not good for you or something happens to me so i'm like uh a guinea pig for you guys all right so um i hope you guys appreciate that too so this is coming in from dr ganja those are my guys over there i love dr ganja guys so when you get your package you will receive a card with all of their information it's a thank you for your purchase and ways to contact them also and yes you do get dope stickers they come in different colors so i don't know which one you guys gonna get in the pack when you get them and i got two cards guys i got the mango kush that's this one here all right and i think um the company that made this is um herbal farmer rx and um this mango kush has 92 percent delta eight thc this is a foreground and it says here [Music] it has a whole bunch of warning labels as far as don't take this operate heavy machinery you know the usual and um it also lets you know that this product is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease they have a barcode that can be scanned right there i haven't opened this one yet so let's open this up and i know this one is very very turkey deprived i mean derived as far as they put a lot of flavoring in it i guess because this one has a darker color than i'm used to with delta eight i usually have them nice and clear like the canon eight i'm going to show you guys that too and uh this one has flavor so i want to see what it tastes like we're going to hook this one up right now and then we'll go over the candy aid as well but i just want to let you guys know how this one is and this is the mango cush guys that i'm hooking up i get that later not a big deal but just let me hook this up real quick and only take 30 seconds all you got to do is get the rubbers over there now i'm gonna put it on to my battery okay and i like this battery a lot i have a few of them but this is actually my favorite battery guys so if you see it a lot that's because it's my favorite so check this out guys it's all hooked up to the battery and this is what the mango kush is looking like i'm going to turn this on low i always start off low let me tell you guys um i made a mistake with one of my delta 8 carts and i was using them on high and um at the end when it got low i noticed that i was getting um it was getting stuck basically and i had to pull real real hard to get it and i figured if i just turned down the voltage on my battery it would help and it did okay so i haven't had that problem anymore so it's not getting clogged up so i have it on the lowest setting as you guys can see that's me just heating it up a little now i'm gonna let you guys know what the flavors like [Music] definitely got some mango up in there definitely got some mango up in here yes so you guys could get it just like this that has that natural flavor okay [Music] this one is the white widow guys okay this white widow is a cross between the brazilian sativa land race and uh resin heavy south indian indica wow sounds good but what i do like about that one the canon eight is that it makes you talk alive i had a few friends over this weekend and i had them try that out and nobody could shut up so that right there is definitely a sativa uplifting blah blah blah blah blah thing right there i like it very good for company guys and this one right now i'm just enjoying the taste and i haven't got the effects yet this one is 92 percent delta 8 thc so [Music] there's a little less than this one here which is the canon eight and this one has 95 percent guys all right but there's no delta nine tac detected so all of this is coming from cannabinoids from cbd hemp so i don't know how they did it but the minute they make the flower have these effects oh man it's gonna be a beautiful day so it takes a little getting used to with that mango flavor me personally i am not big on flavor flavor when it comes to any card whether it's cbd whether it's uh even the regular cards any card i'm not big on the flavor i take that natural taste [Music] but for everybody that loves flavor this thing is packed this is packed let me grab the wrapper okay so like i said this delta eight mango kush thc is a good taste to it me i'm just not a fan of flavors in my [ __ ] that's okay um it's nothing but added chirps so it's not like it's a bad thing it's just that me personally i don't know if it's just that i'm a type dude but um this flavor is really good you know i just prefer natural guys naturally but i can't get with it so i do feel the effects right now and this one has more of a calming effect if you ask me the uh canon 8 we're going to hook that up right now let me just take this off put this to the side now the canon has that natural flavor natural terps is the white widow strand and let me hook this up real quick guys see i tell you it's definitely doing its job because i'm starting to feel nice warm and fuzzy guys nice warm and fuzzy and it's kind of chilly in um atlanta today guys also so all right so we already got it hooked up so this is the canon eight white widow right here delta eight and if y'all guys could see i just preheated a little bit before i take a pull that's just the way i do it [Music] now this tastes great this really does and it's also a little stronger so gotta be careful gotta be careful [Music] but i tell you guys i've been loving it and a lot of other people they hit me up they're also loving the delta eight so we haven't tried it yet the prices are good here on dr ganja's website so y'all guys go ahead check them out for real not only that they got flour they have accessories they have you name it they got it basically all right apparel so whatever you guys need you probably will be able to get from this so this is another superstore smoke dr shops at guys this candy it's delicious [Music] man this thing is great i love this one this one i like effect wise but i'm just not big on flavor so anybody that loves flavoring and you know that's definitely the way to go this mango kush has a ton of flavor in it guys all right so it says um i already told you guys this is a full grain directions for use hit vape cartridge until desired results are achieved and that's where we are now guys so i think we're going to wrap this one up for now but let me tell you i'm going to continue my quest to find the best d8 out their canon eight is good i really really like that one and i also like this one but not as much as the canon eight all right that's just my preference y'all guys go try them out for y'all so i will put a link below the video there is a small discount if you use my link so there you go guys all right so smoke doctor is signing out for now and i'll be back with another review soon guys all right peace [Music]", "kCsHV_UA4sU": "hey hey hey just got this new swag kid in from vapor s oh boy she looks good done she feels good in the old hand I'll tell you it's reminiscent of the AL 85 from smock but it feels a little bit better a little bit lighter and it performs great but we've been use the same for one day by the way but I could say right now I just think he's performing it the way it is whoo it's gonna be a top not sure but I'm stoked to get this stoked to show you a quick view of it like I said it's just gonna be a quick glance well let's go ahead and get into it shall we here it is the packaging for this vapor s so swag kit and of course inside the packaging you're gonna receive your swag mine comes with this kick-ass USB cable comes with this NRG 22 sub ohm tank you get an extra core head and last but not least a swag kit user manual alright eSAB only seen four different color options personally for this kit stainless steel and orange or silver and orange you got blue and black gunmetal and black and then you got gunmetal black and stainless alrighty it's the first things first let's go over this NRG 22 I'm calling it the 22 because she's 22 millimeter in width and 44 millimeter in length this is the 3.5 million the US version they've got an EU verse that holds two mil but just letting you know this is the American version at the bottom she's got dual bottom adjustable airflow you grab ahold of the ring it stops with one direction stops on the other whatever you just on this side is the same all across the board perfect amount of restriction Asst in my opinion at the base she's got a non protruding well a slightly protruding 510 pin don't use this on her hybrid topcat devices guys she's got smooth 510 threads also the basis says in our GSE tank mega I don't know why they're calling this the mega because it's only 22 millimeter width but that is what it is they must have a smaller version out there it also says designed and manufactured by vapor wrestle oh yeah and by the way she is primarily made of stainless steel at the top it comes to this Delrin 510 driptip sleeve that Stucker comes off and as you guys can see it kind of indents in that's the reason why I call it a driptip sleeve and it is 510 driptip compatible but she has she fits on there like so looks the tits and again you can use your preferred 510 drip tips if you please here's a regular Diller 510 drip tip that does not come with this kit it looks kind of funky but it is what it is and it doesn't sit down all the way you kind of have to twist it and it is a little bit probably just to point that out but you can use your other 510 drip tips if you want it just looks it looks weird just like the original NRG tank this sucker also has swivel for top fill you just pop that sucker open like so and you could fill her up again this thing holds 3.5 mils of juice in the American version once you're done filling her up you just loop pop it back and locks into place and you're good to go oh yeah by the way here is the drip tip catch cup here's the inside of the base section everything is nice and clean so the coil head that comes pre-installed into this tank is the point 4 ohm 40 to 80 Watts recommended they say a vape said it's best between 55 and 65 Watts you got your feed slots uses organic Japanese cotton nice big old coil in there and the extra coal that comes with this is the point to recommend of a 40 to 100 watts vape set its best between 70 and 90 watts you got your feed slot she uses organic cotton as well and this sucker has three coils and just letting you know all the NRG coil heads are compatible with the big baby and baby bees tanks big Pro in my opinion guys and also want to point this out the way these coil heads are rated the way they look on the inside and even a little bit on the outside they're very very very similar to the smart big baby in baby beast coil heads but again I think these things make better better vape quality longer-lasting gonna go ahead and use this point to them cool head up that I'm going to be using today [Music] now onto this tiny little swag maje he's 75 millimeter by 48 millimeter by 25 millimeter at the top she's got a stainless-steel 510 connection gold-plated spring-loaded 510 pin threads are nice and smooth and you know what I'm gonna mention this 24 25 millimeter devices are just not gonna fit for this this is for your 22 primarily 22 and smaller this device is a single 18 650 mod you get your battery cap right here very similar to the al 85 actually this whole kit is kind of reminiscent of the al 85 kit by Smok okay you get your battery cap your single 18 650 homework battery you probably can't see it but you've got your positive down negative up on one side at the top it says swag on the other at the top it says swag on this side of the device you got your fire button your mini screen and then your function button and then on this side you got your water gel waters down or temperature up temperature down button and if you guys can see that over here it says vapor resto with a vapor soo logo and then on this side as you guys can see it says vapor s so with the vapor iso logo and you've got these plastic checkered panels on each side on this side it's very clean and then on the bottom you got your holes for battery venting just a good-looking mod kind of reminiscent of the al 85 but a little bit wider and in my opinion I think this is lighter and more ergonomic than the al 85 but again all this is gonna be subjective I was gonna mention that so like I mentioned this is a single 18 650 mod and as far as specs goes this thing houses the omni 2.0 chip okay it's got to amp quick charge vapes up to 80 watts you got TCR you give a been temps Ramon nickel titanium stainless steel you got memory settings bypass mode curve mode I mean you could pretty much do it all with this device this little 80 watt device I mean except they've been at higher wattages of course so right now this device is off when we hit the fire button it's going to say system off but in order to turn this sucker on five clicks the fire button does it one two three four five and as you guys can see you get the main menu screen and get the resistance the second counter the battery gauge the wattage and MVA I believe that's normal preheat boost settings but I could be wrong again this is just a first look quick glance and when you hit the fire button and nothing's on here it's gonna say check atomizer go ahead and screw this device on to the mod oh it's gonna ask for new load old load new load oh we got this mode so it automatically adjust the wattage it thinks is the best for the resistance in the coil pretty cool just like the gene chip just like the older Omni chip so again this button right here at just the wattage up or the temperature up or the temperature down or the waters down you get the drift but we're gonna go ahead and scroll her up scrolls in point 1 increments hold it down and goes all in to 80 watts does not round robin goes all the way back down and she Scrolls fast only down to 5 watts again does not round robin now if we hold this function button right here we can scroll in a temperature bypass TCR order down stainless steel order down again nickel put her down again titanium again m1 m2 bypass system set and when we are in temperature mode you can use these buttons right here at this button to scroll the temperature and when we are in temperature mode if you tap this function button three times one two three we can adjust the variable temperature we can go in a curve mode or we can adjust the TCR it's going a curve mode oh yeah just like the revenger mod you got the same curve type mode and we can adjust the temperature up hit the function button goes over the next one up function button down you guys get the drift same as the revenger mod when we're done hold the function button down and it sets go to TCR hold that down we can adjust the TCR and that sets go back to variable temperature hold that down we can adjust temperature and it's the same for all other modes nickel titanium em1 and em2 and even in regular wattage yeah you got curved modes and regular wattage but I'm gonna go dig her back just variable wattage cuz that's what I prefer now it doesn't matter if we're in regular wattage mode or we're in temperature mode if you hold down the fire button the waters down button down the same time it's gonna take you into the more in depth menu system exit puff counter brightness screen time out smart on or off default variable temperature variable wattage and from there we can adjust normal soft hi I'm gonna keep it normal exit and we're back pretty simple menu system for the regulated mod user so the only constant I really noticed right off the bat one mine did not come with an extra glass tube it did not come with extra o rings that's a biggie another common I found for this this is gonna be nitpicky but the drip tip sleeve it comes with it does tend to rise up I've been using this for a day and I find that I have to just kind of twist it down and also like I said drift tip sleeve as you guys saw before I popped that regular 510 drip tip on there and just look funky that's gonna be a condo some of you guys I don't know why they had to make this a drip tip sleeve just making a regular 510 drip tip with a regular catch cup that just sits flush that's just my opinion though but is it a deal-breaker no not to me at least I mean this thing looks of tits it's freaking is comfortable the mod itself is great for a single 18 650 mod phenomenal so far love the options the variable wattage the variable temperature TCR bypass quick charge woo the quick charge like the function button in the water wash down button for an 80 watt single 8650 device it just gets the job done or it has so far from me the fire button is nice this is a light device held the tank is heavier in the freaking mod without the battery in it like I said very similar to a 85 it's like vapor I so knocked off the al 85 but made a little bit different and I will say in the one day that I've been using it it performs easily as good as the al 85 by smaug granted the screens not nearly as big as al 85 oh yeah the fact this has upgradeable firmware big pro love the color options I like the orange the best be honest with you but this blue is the tints - oh yeah these cool heads being compatible with all your big baby baby's tanks and vice versa big Pro and I've been vaping on these NRG Co heads for a while ever since I had the revenger kit and these cool heads are no joke you guys hear that draw this is three-quarters the way open oh man she is smooth I like this one better than a big one but again I've only been using this 22 millimeter NRG for one day I use the other NRG the wool visit this 25 no me or the big boy for weeks that damn thinking Chuck but I like the draw better off this smaller tank yeah these coil heads man babe rest oh they know how to do it now another kind I do want to point out that I did not point out in the close-up you can't pop your bigger delivery system devices on here okay 22 millimeter is pretty much them if the Mac's for sure you can t pop 23 22 millimeter and smaller is good for this 23 enlarger is a no-go that may be a context but I will tell you this you'll be able to pop that feral mini on here whoo I almost lost my grip there good god oh my trips that is my quick glance of this swag kid I liked the name swag got some swagger to it does man he looks at it it feels good just right out of the gate it all depends on what you're looking for if you're looking for something that's 80 watts max it holds an 18 650 that can hold up to twenty two millimeter devices and smaller that comes with kick-ass coeds I can tell you these coins are tried-and-true that are compatible with the big baby be some babies ten coeds it's got quick charge if you're looking for a device that's got variable temperature TCR nickel titanium stainless steel you got curve mode you want those options like I showed you in the close-ups well then this sucker may be for you but only time will tell for me because I got to play around this mother check her a little bit longer you did so I hope you guys enjoyed the video like it found entertaining and helpful if you did like this video with an like it down below if you want to see more of me subscribe for more this is ripped rippers and remember smoking is dead vaping is the future and the future is now [Music]", "40UPmwIpak0": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or medical marijuana my personal information alright yo what's up guys Ronnie right back at you so this video I got another car review for you guys I'm gonna be reviewing the same brand that I didn't like that the last to court review videos I think if you've seen him on Excel labs promo colors they just had a fire a steel so I picked up like I think six it yeah I picked up six cards in total so I still have two more flavors left of those to review so two flames I have left are tropical fruit and blueberry so I think in this video I'm gonna be smokin on the blueberry if you guys want to see a movie one in the tropical food and we're down below in the comments and I'll get that out yeah blueberry in this video so I'm not gonna spend I'm not gonna spend too much time going over a pathogen in this video I'll show you guys it a little bit better you guys want to see the packet more in like that detail go check out like I think it's my first or a second review on this company cuz I wanted like really in-depth detail on the packaging I'll give you a quick little look at it you'll break so the front evil labs blueberry contains cannabis so obviously um tested at 80% if you don't know how to use it it gives you instructions so and yeah so that's pretty much the package it's a half gram car the thing that I really like about these two um they're really really cheap I got doc they havethey oh I'm six cards you get six half gram cards and you get a battery like this battery right here eat more labs battery for sixty bucks so three cards and a battery for sixty bucks um I don't know if that's like ideal what they have like everywhere but at least that dispensary that I go to let the deal they have right now so oh yes I'm gonna take that off the battery so yeah this is battery right here this was just a regular stick battery evil laughs not I mean but uh it has them three different temperature settings low medium hot then it has a that preheating setting option where you gonna preheat your portal before you hit it to get like a full hit and yeah so I mean this it's pretty dope battery I mean you get it I'll be used for like the deal they have three cards and a battery for 60 bucks like 1500 milligrams that I mean like smoke shops usually sell these for like what 10 15 bucks so like I don't know how that's just like a fire SEO in my opinion let's just hop into this review with something aside this open this is something that I really like about this company really cheap it's like I was saying and they have all you small little details that are like fire like like I know this doesn't really like mean too much it's the quality of the oil that really matters the most but I I don't know I just always cool to have like some dope packaging make you know I mean so when you take a better uh yeah some once you slide it out it has this little part inside of that that has a evil labs this little white um container what do you call this so you open this up and the cards in here like I said to call the chroma colors yeah right chroma colors did I say that right I don't know but so every every every flavor comes with like a different color you've seen how this one is red so it has like a red tip blueberries blue I think this was sweet melon so that sweet melon was like a green that's just like another small little detail that they do that I think is like really really cool for especially at the price point that like I've been saying like they're so cheap and like it's all all those smaller details they do are like so dope and something else I forgot to mention it's actually a CEO to vaporize cartridge so yeah yeah blueberry cart here's little club close up of the oil said where's the public s so the bubbles right there this oil was like really really really big yes I'm down below in the comments what you guys think about the at least that looks to the oil I think it looks [ __ ] fire especially for being so cheap like I said uh you get three of these cards for 60 bucks with a battery like you really can't beat that the old my opinion and it's coming from the dispensary you're not getting it off the street so you know it's not like some fake [ __ ] like there's Mario karts or exotic you know it's not so [ __ ] like that it's actually from that's that's from like the dispensary so it like it has to be like umm Sayyaf II know what I'm saying so so yeah so just pop these a little blue blue little caps off of here we got the card screwed on to the battery I also really love like the aesthetic like the way this [ __ ] battery looks with the card on it like I mean like with this blue I mean like yeah that [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fire but with it any color it looks [ __ ] sick I don't know tell me what you guys think down below in the comments like I said um this video was saying this is like my review video but I'm also really interested to know what you guys think of the products - so beep like leave your guys's review go in the comments even even though you guys don't get to like actually smoke on it like I'm doing I get it like you review on like the look since [ __ ] you know I'm saying so tell me what you guys think down below if you have tried them like if you have tried this company in the past I tell me what you what you thought at the Brian you know what I'm saying but with that being said I'm gonna put this on the lowest temperature so I can like get the full at the full taste the full flavor and I'm saying so we're preheating it up right now so that way gets the it gets ready for me to hit it so it's ready for me to hit it so cheers if you're smoking along with me let's get it the thing that I am found out about these carts is like if you really want to get the full full flavor like their folk well it's kind of common sense but um like if you want like the full flavor like they taste so [ __ ] good if you put it on like the lowest temperature and like you barely rip it like you just for a couple seconds like he's like you see nothin I didn't take like the fattest trip I just kind of like hit it a little bit to get like the taste you should taste like a [ __ ] vapor oh it doesn't even taste like the wax like it tastes so good so flavor I'm already giving the flavor five out of five that [ __ ] was [ __ ] so far mmm what is that his like um it tastes so [ __ ] so familiarly I don't know what that [ __ ] flavor is but the flavor it tastes so I mean it tastes so like familiar like I've I've tasted this before somewhere like um it has like that artificial like blueberry flavor you know what I'm saying like that artificial taste but um like I don't I don't even know what the [ __ ] of your blueberry tastes like but like the article fit okay it's like the artificial flavor you're not I mean but it tastes like a really familiar like I don't know if it's like a gum or like a candy or something that that I had when I was a kid or what the [ __ ] it tastes like but I can't I can't think of it but I know it tastes like something that really really similar to something that I've had in the past but yeah like you know like the flavor on this though like five out of five like I said like it tastes like you're hitting a [ __ ] mod like oh my god I nicotine mug you know I mean like it tastes fire oh one of the best tasting [ __ ] wife spins I've had by far like a hundred percent um so I just put it on medium tempo I'm gonna take a couple fatter hits and get a little rating for the high the high I guess and the smoke so yeah Cheers [ __ ] I [ __ ] up on that one mmm that [ __ ] tastes so fire made that one more time so I mean you see it [ __ ] rip so like um the taste 5 out of 5 the way it smokes it gets 5 out of 5 the high they're not the [ __ ] best cards like I've had way better cards like if you seen in my last couple reviews I did a brand called select um select elite premium vapes um their cards are stupid [ __ ] fire but they're like 40 bucks for a half gram card which is like really really expensive but that [ __ ] is stupid fire um these are definitely not on that level but that for the price point [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire um if you ever see these in your area definitely pick them up tell me what you think of them or even if you don't have the chance to tell me what you think of them just [ __ ] pick them up because they're fire I'm not sure like but they have like their own store or what it is but I said that the price point on these were it was like 22 or 23 dollars yeah I'd definitely pick one of these up if you have a if you ever see these in your [ __ ] area definitely pick one of these up evil labs extracts are not just evil labs a cannabis and vault evolved that's what it's called that's that's the brand um yeah topaz packaging definitely picked one of them up you can't beat it for the price point in my opinion 1500 milligrams of THC a battery for 60 bucks that's that's a [ __ ] steal so the tastes on this is a 5 out of 5 but that's [ __ ] crazy I can't like it tastes [ __ ] insane the smoke do you see I'm getting like fat rips watch yeah so I don't think the camera really picked that up as well as like you could see it in person but this [ __ ] [ __ ] rips um this the way it smokes you get a 5 out of 5 to the price point 5 out of 5 quality of the cart like I said I've had way better cards in the past but for the price point I think in the past videos I gave him three and a half but after smoking on them for a couple days they're kind of growing on me and I come I'm kind of liking them a little bit more so I don't know just after smoking them for the last couple days I'm gonna I'm gonna raise my score up to a four so the so the high gets a 4 out of 5 and I guess I'll keep the quality of the oil at a 3.5 Obama raised too high though for so yeah I guess the overall score at the cart a 4 out of 5 that's like the overall score for the everything combined 4 out of 5 3 cards 500 milligrams each totaled 1500 milligrams and you get a battery sixty [ __ ] dollars that's how [ __ ] steal can't beat at my opinion definitely picked them up like I said definitely tried them out here's the brand I was talking about was select this is actually Paris oh gee yeah if you want to see a ever actually did a review on this course if you want to see that go check that out but like I was talking about they're [ __ ] a forty bucks for a half a gram but yeah those are stupid fire you can go check it out if you want the review but yeah like I said this card 4 out of 5 but I still have one more left to review so if you guys want to see a review on the strain or flavor of tropical fruit tumble down below in the comments and I'll get a review out for that and then they just got some new fire ass card set the dispensary right down the road for me someone pick a couple of those up if you guys want to see some more these videos um if you guys enjoyed these like car reviews or if you guys want to see some more like maybe like wax wax video is like actually like shatter or like need Davin instead of just cards or like some fire a spud like me rolling up loans and smoking either you have one of those up but you want to see more of those time with that down below in the comments and I'll get some of those look but just whatever you guys want to see time go down below in the comments and we're actually about the record some more ground more reacts right now so those should be up so uh those should be up soon um besides for that if you guys like this video get a big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] it's been around here a peace out", "8DVA8ZJaiVc": "[Music] what's up guys p2 peeps and continuing our uh you know fake cartridge exploration we're going to be taking a look at some real fake cartridges so um background on these i have tried these before i have tried uh two of them before and now when the time i tried them uh they were definitely a really cheap price and i was thinking to myself like yeah dude i trust my plug these you know looks great oil looks like a good color and um you know it hits okay and i'm getting i'm getting loaded so it's whatever you know 15 a gram it's cool but uh now that i'm older and wiser i know that's kind of dumb like sure you could trust your plug but dude if you're not actually getting the lab results or anything that's really scanned or verified or you don't or like you know if you know or you don't know i mean if you don't know uh what is inside of the cartridge like you didn't see the person fill it up um then don't trust it that's just the rule of thumb here guys like when it comes to concentrates and um cartridges and things like that you might be thinking no one's got time to fake any of that stuff or whatever whatever but honestly they do got the time people make a killing off of these cartridges off of killing people so just be careful what you put into your body and if you're buying cartridges off the street please make sure that is not any any dank vape stuff or any of those weird you know cartoon graphics on the the box just because someone's got a box that's got like a graphic on it doesn't mean anything so guys um i'll show you guys first the worst looking cartridge of them so this is the uh container they came in this is a clear kings i'm not sure if anyone's ever had a real clear kings or anything like that but if you guys have please let me know down know down below in the comments and you know let me know how that was for you so it says here on the front store at room temperature exposure to direct sunlight may cause cartridge to leak or oil to discolor that's something that i thought was going on with this guys this is the cartridge we're working with you see those black splotches and stuff all around it that's that's not supposed to be there you know we see that the black spot just here down there and um you know let's just take a look at a thickness test i'm just going to turn this to the side look how fast just look how fast that oil is traveling that's not that's not natural for your regular oils yeah grab my cart right here real bear lab stuff look at that nothing it's barely moving on this one but look at that it's already almost separated entirely to the bottom see nothing's moving still from this nothing yet and yet in only about 10 to 15 seconds this is already dripping to the bottom so that's another thing that threw me off about the cartridge you know the color and um how fast it was you know moving down and things like that but when i first got it guys it was not this color it was not this color it was like a golden color so let's read a little bit more here on the label and packaging i'm not sure guys if this brand is exactly like a fake brand or not you know i don't want to call them out because for all i know this could be a real brand that's just uh you know getting getting under fire um or getting copied but yeah see this whole thing has you know all these uh labels and websites and you know warnings and things like that but those are really easy to print on to just about anything nowadays so you can't always trust your plug stuff just because it's got a label like i was saying the ingredients here let's see it says distillate and fractionated coconut oil uh on the ingredients there so um yeah that kind of threw me off so when i was first hitting these their flavor was uh the thing that really stood out to me i definitely tasted that little coconutty flavor so that's why i when i first had these i was thinking these are all right you know these aren't too bad i wish they could have better dirt flavors but you know for a small cart brand this isn't that bad 20 15 a gram that's that's way too cheap you know at the time of course i didn't really think about that so yeah this is definitely not good oil definitely not you want your oil to be thick if your oil is moving around this fast it is not all oil this has definitely been cut with something else and that's why it is super liquidy you know another reason why a cartridge may be super liquidy and move around fast is because it's it might be you know surrounded by a lot of heat things like that but in this case it's about room temperature in here guys i've been keeping this in a drawer this is not this one specifically has not seen any sunlight at all so the fact that it has turned this color is definitely alarming so that was this cartridge this uh wedding cake one and so now we'll take a look at the next cartridge we have from the same brand and uh i'm sure same source this one is a runts cartridge so like i said before it's the same same brand and all that stuff so it should have the same ingredients etcetera etcetera but the surprising thing about this one is i've had these for just about the same time and this one still retains its golden color uh it still looks pretty decent you know um one thing i'll also say guys about uh fake cartridges is the rod size so uh here let's actually do another direct comparison between this one and the bear labs car so as you guys can see this cartridge on the left here is a lot thicker in the rod the middle portion than the cartridge on the right here see the rod on this cartridge right there it it's a lot thinner you know it gets thick to the bottom base here but for the most part your cartridges from the dispensary or legal sources are going to have that a lot skinnier rod and you can see here it's just thick all the way down through there it doesn't really get too big towards the bottom there uh when you see the bottom you know what i mean it gets a little bit wider but not by a bit like by too much where as if you look to here the size of it gets a lot bigger towards the bottom so yeah if you see um cartridges with just rods that are way too big down and you know the ones in the middle that's another sign that you could be dealing with a fake cartridge so these rods uh the thicker rods here allow for less product to be placed in so typically you see these on the street because uh street plugs can just short you easily they can just give you like .75 in a cartridge that's supposed to hold a gram and it'll still look full because uh you know the rod's bigger now one thing i'll say is that sometimes uh oil gets stuck in the wick so when you do buy from dispensaries if something looks like it's a little a little under it's definitely just some stuff that is stuck in the wick of the cartridge so yeah this is the same exact thing you know same exact cartridge except for the oil now let's do the liquidy test here and as you can as you guys can see it's a little bit thicker than the previous one but still that bubble is moving way too fast guys way too fast so if if you're if your oils are doing something like this in just the span of like five to ten seconds i highly suggest you put that [ __ ] down because you have just no idea what's going on with that anymore um so yeah look i know there's some people out there who uh your plug might be your only cartridge source or um you know you might be in a legal state so it's just a lot harder to get legit things but um i just have to encourage you guys to please be safe these could these can like you know fake cartridges can literally kill you or destroy your lungs if you don't want it you know if you don't care whether you smoke more or you know like every day pretty much for the next 20 years then go ahead and smoke more fake cartridges it's definitely gonna bust up your lungs like i said guys i tried two of these i thought it was okay but on my second one i knew something was fishy because my throat was getting scratchy i was coughing on hits like that were not supposed to make me cough you know i was taking small baby hits of a regular flower and that [ __ ] was making me cough my throat was itchy and scratchy for days i wasn't breathing right for a little bit and that was just off a few puffs of a second cartridge so you know i'm one you know wondering what would have happened if i had continued to smoke that cartridge all the way down to the to the end you know some people will smoke their fake carts and feel totally fine and just keep going with it and for those people i mean do you you know i'm just encouraging people to to smoke safe and be safe because at the end of the day when it comes to concentrates people can put whatever they want in it man i'm not saying stay off it's just like you know stop popping off your plug when it comes to you know your meds or whatever do whatever you want um you know flour can be overpriced at the dispensary but when it comes to cartridges and concentrates guys please please try to make sure you know what's getting put in it and you know what where it's being sourced from all that stuff you know you want to know as much as possible about these concentrates because pesticides can slip in there pines i've heard people slipping pine sole into cartridges you know actual cleaner that's like pledges and stuff like that like that's that's crazy that's you know like i said it's poison so once again guys let's take a a final look here the one on the left has all those little weird black splotches and things like that the one on the right still looks totally fine um but again guys the way those bubbles move way too fast so we can do let's do a quick little comparison of the bubbles here um obviously the one on the left is uh traveling a little bit faster because i think the bubble is bigger you know there's less product in there and um another thing is i hit it a bit so maybe it's been heated up a bit and whatever was liquefying uh or you know was liquefied in there is a lot like more uh i don't know the word i'm forgetting it but a lot more movable but yeah i'm definitely not going to be trying any of these guys i'm really only holding onto these for reference so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please leave a like comment subscribe and i'll be you know talking more about fake cartridges as time goes along answering questions uh dropping more knowledge that i know about them and things like that but uh yeah this was a good thing for i guess people who would want to know from an eye test how to tell if their cartridge is uh fake or at least how to know if i should be a little suspicious about it so yeah thanks everyone for watching if you enjoyed as always please leave a like comment and subscribe p2 out peace you", "vGcbZVyHwb4": "you guys I just received the sticky so here's the blue dream cartridge this is what it looks like and this is the starter kit so you have the actual pin and the charging kit that comes in this box here I'm gonna go ahead and put these two things together in a second and I'll let you know", "3_GUAHBcnmE": "what's happening everyone it's scary carrie here welcome to my channel today's episode i'm gonna give you guys a real delta eight thc review from the un packaging to the full experience we're gonna waste deep in the delta eight give you guys a nice vibe go to the beach this episode is actually being sponsored by a delta eight company they sent me some products so i gotta go pick it up right now and once i get those in hand i'll show you guys what's up with their products what's up with their brand and really see how this stuff hits let's check it out disclaimer the following video does not glorify the use of cannabis instead it attempts to be non-biased while delivering vital information disguised as entertainment all right you guys we just pulled up picked up the precious cargo right here check it out yes this company is called delta eight hemp they gave me this whole info sheet as well some great literature here so they're saying that this is actually hemp derived delta eight so that means they're doing some type of thing to where they're able to convert the cbd concentrate into a delta eight somehow that's pretty cool in any case today we're going to be reviewing their disposable vape i want to try out the disposable vape because i feel as though every single disposable is different this one's just a standard cart we've seen plenty of those so they have let's see it says uh ingredients hemp extract and terpenes just what i like i actually haven't smoked all day you guys i usually like to wake and bake i don't know about y'all but i thought i'd give you guys a very clear-headed start off sober go straight into the delta 8 review i don't want any other highs interfering with this here are the lab results they have the lab results on the packaging that is great let's see asan we're at a 89 delta eight and we have two other cannabinoids we have some cbda and cbd cool absolutely no thc in here apparently by taking delta eight you're giving yourself a tolerance break from delta nine i don't know if like a one day tolerance break is going to make much of a difference but we'll see how it goes what i don't like about these lab results is they don't tell you what terpenes are in there all these lab results are telling me is the base oil that they used before they added the terpenes oh well let's crack this thing open nice boom cool i like this uh little grip here that's that's kind of nice i don't know oh i guess it's right-handed i'm left-handed so um interesting interesting all right well this will take some getting used to i should have read the directions for this take one puff wow all right cool let's see how this goes cheers so the strain is apparently skywalker apparently it's a hybrid tastes good i don't know man whenever people put names of the strains on these things i always take it with a grain of salt you already know though but it is really tasty i'll give them that that's fun little logo right here that's cool all right well i do want to try to get some sunlight for you guys try to go to the beach get you guys some views try out this delta 8 a little more it's a really hot day i'm not trying to hotbox today i only took two puffs and i'm already sweating it's like i think it's like 88 degrees outside last time i checked so it's pretty hot for where i'm at does this thing even light up i don't know let's see it does not we can't do blinkers with this you guys in any case we're just gonna try to hit this for as long as possible and see if there is an end to it but before we do that let's get out of this car all right you guys we just pulled up to a wonderful spot out here it's a clear as hell day you can see all the islands out i mean like wow we gotta go out there but before we do that let's hit this let's try to get as fat of a rip as we can out of this cheers wow now some fat clouds oh my god no more of that [Music] it is so nice out i really enjoy this area because i feel as though you can just like drive along the coast and just pull over at any point and you'll find this like just really nice private walking areas i like to take advantage of the area come out here catch some vibes get myself straight on this d8 wow look at this look at this nice patch of grass right here there's a really nice spot to just post up i think this is not bad at all keeping me nice and mellow setting the vibes just right i just love listening to the waves feeling that nice ocean breeze getting away from all the people i feel as though if you go to the main beaches right now it'll be like pretty crowded because it's just so nice out in the middle of winter so for me i like to stay away from all that i hope you guys are staying warm staying safe out here in la it's pretty crazy that is nice look at that there's like a whole resort over there look at all these houses yeah which house would you guys want to live in that house that house i like that one if i had a big house like that i would have huge windows for sure just have nice big windows so you can see the ocean that would be that'll be it for sure so i want to give you guys a little rundown of what i'm trying to do with the channel scary carry through this channel just want to give you guys some solid reviews on some cannabis related products give you guys some tips and tricks to make your experience lifted that much more and also i just want to provide you guys a vibe if you want to join me smoke with me vape with me whatever it is you are more than welcome if you want to just come for the ride you're also welcome to do that too right now i'm feeling a little adventurous i kind of want to check out what's over there the architecture is crazy we definitely gotta check it out all right let's keep walking i want to go over there because it's nice and grassy over there lay out and it looks like a pretty good view so hopefully it's like a public area and i could just chill oh my god you guys there's a bunny just roaming around and a bunch of squirrels check it out this is the rabbit out here by the ocean are you doing here what what it's a freaking safari out here oh my god maybe i'll take another rip right now uh-oh i kind of scratched it up already my bad got some battle scars wow so we didn't make it to our magical spot across the way but this is a pretty cool spot nice and cozy right on this cliff right here how do people get down there i've been like looking for a way down i'm not convinced that there are safe ways or at least ways that i would take down no way none of that i might be slightly terrified of heights you guys you can see how far from the edge i am i just realized i'm like sitting at like the edge of this cliff but this cliff is like part of this nice little cove right here that's pretty cool i'd say this stuff is not bad kind of gives you a little tingle in your nose ah jeez not too slumped like with that purple punch definitely a hybrid feel hybrid type of high i think like delta eight definitely allows me to keep a clear head i think with delta 9 i feel like i can have like sometimes like short-term memory loss sometimes like maybe i'll just like get so high that my brain feels kind of foggy like i definitely feel more of like the body high effects from delta eight rather than the psychoactive effects i don't think it really impairs my judgment that much but like i'm not feeling like crazy or anything you know i'm not feeling like fearful i'm pretty chill pretty tame right now just catching some sun and looking at all these people doing their yard work at these houses that they don't live at i always wanted to get a house out here i mean if i could another thing that i really like about delta eight is it doesn't make me like lazy like delta nine i feel like when you're smoking regular thc it kind of like decreases my motivation i'll admit let me know in the comments if you relate does thc kill your motivation and if so does delta 8 also kill your motivation or does it help because for me i don't get any couch lock effects with this i feel like i could get up and go probably go on like a light jog if i was uh that type of person so let's see are my eyes red no delta eight i don't know does it get your eyes red i don't really get red eyes anymore i used to it's amazing i literally watch people drive by they'll look at the ocean and then they'll they'll pull over and stop the car and hop out for a sec this one motorcyclist did just that he just he was just like yo i gotta catch this view real quick hopped off his bike pulled up his visor stood right on the edge took it in all right time to carry on look at that that's nice i almost thought i was inhaling it from the wrong side all right let's get some food i'm hungry all right you guys so we just pulled up the fat burger i have been craving fat burger um my girlfriend's gonna hate me because she's been craving burgers too and i told her uh i'll get burgers with you but now i'm getting a burger right now so uh-oh i hope this isn't clogged there we go all right so don't take too fat of rips otherwise you might get some clogging another thing that i worry about with these the disposables especially if you're going to pack a whole gram in here is making sure the battery lasts as long as the oil napkins yes french fries look at these fat fries check this out boom this looks intense guys diligently let us dig in holy there's a lot of juices i think taking that d8 prior to this was the move that was so good but we cannot forget the prize ah are you guys i'm nice and full now that delta eight has got me on a very nice level i would say my judgment is not as impaired i don't feel myself fumbling around with what i have to say so i think those are all really good signs i'd recommend it there's not too much deviation amongst delta eight so really when you go into a certain brand a lot of it is based off of how it tastes so as long as it tastes really good and you like the high that you get based off of the terpene profile then it could be the one for you as for the skywalker very fantastic daytime high highly recommend it it's a great hybrid i'm not slumped at all there's points where it's like if i laid down i could probably fall asleep really easily but i'm not drowsy by any means i highly recommend this i have no idea when it's gonna die i hope it doesn't die soon i gotta go back home because i think there's a plumber working at my place and i feel like i should be there for that so i will catch you guys later if you want to see some more reviews and some tips and tricks for cannabis related products please be sure to hit that like and subscribe down below are you guys well i just got back home all right maybe one more for good luck it's been about two and a half hours since we started hitting this i'd say it is definitely a better daytime high than delta nine i said the opposite last time i take that back it's probably also contingent on the strain that you're using but the stuff is pretty nice i'm probably gonna listen to some music i don't know about you guys but i've been really into that new kid cudi album lately probably also listen to some juice world and get in my zone i hope that when you guys get nice and stoned you're able to jam out to some tunes too

products and we do not sell anything on this channel in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand video today yeah again we got actually a brand new brand that I've actually came across on ease before and I've actually you know I've wanted to review it for actually some time now again everybody this is an 18mm educational purpose podcast it's a review I don't condone the usage of these products nor I do not try to boost to sell these products and also we do not sell anything on this channel and again everything here is legal offer 18 and up at cannabis patients you guys are enormous good so today ladies and gentlemen we got a brand new brand to a review it's the old pal brand so I'm not promoting this product or anything like that this is just literally just a review I actually got this full gram $35 crazy huh we got some sativa check this out right here look there's actually some old pal this is actually from 510 which I believe is Oakland I think this is actually a local you know I think this company is actually in the bay keep that out and this is actually the cosmic sativa flavor it's a full sativa you know it has about eighty percent THC which is actually pretty [ __ ] good again everybody this is a $35 gram believe it or not I actually bought this and freaking off off ease and you guys already know man ease sometimes we kind of tax it check the [ __ ] out quick little test want to show you guys that this [ __ ] is look at that stuck for sure no hot water first hit now you lie you guys every time I take the first hit of this cartridge whoa I get laid man I feel this [ __ ] it's a sativa so usually before my morning my morning job you know I wake up take a couple puffs and I go go over to my morning driving [ __ ] you know and 9:00 I'll have one or two puffs literally just leaves me faint like I can already feel it right now I haven't even smoked today today I literally just skipped earlier today I don't really smoke just because I want to make sure I do these reviews with starting with sober but yeah look one thing I really do like about this product again I bought this off ease actually I got to 2 grams for the total price of $70 that includes taxes and delivery so I'm just like dude if this was a $35 full gram imagine if you actually go to like the legit old pal warehouse or whatever they're actually selling these and you buy you buy some stuff so I don't think I've ever seen these you know in the club but sometimes I'm like hmm that's very interesting it's a classic shareable cannabis oil cartridge this is shareable and it definitely is shareable because for the price and again a lot of people are gonna say oh it's fake it's just not no this is not fake this is I legit got this from the east service and they're for sure they're approved they're completely legal and it's not no neighborhood plug this ain't no neighborhood plug [ __ ] so it's crazy if a neighborhood plug [ __ ] is trying to sell you a [ __ ] for gram for like dirty dirty like $30 do that shit's fake as [ __ ] I smoked them before we actually reviewed up a car to do the super Lemon Haze one of my boys got with cool little fake cartridge or whatever and you got it for like pretty expensive but usually if you guys get this from like a a delivery service but it has to be legit though cuz I feel like some there are a couple like delivery services that are just not legit thought a homemade [ __ ] that could might not be healthy for you but please look I don't know if this is true or not I've heard this from a friend that's like a late punch tastes really good too um but I've heard that smoking like I guess fake cartridges or I don't even know if I even talked about but I'm pretty sure it's fake cartridges I guess there was like a youtuber like a weed youtuber some guy that made videos dude I'm pretty sure I don't know where the hell here is this drummer I don't know where it came from or I just don't I don't know but I believe in the obviously you know because it could have been fake cards but I guess like someone passed away from like smoking cartridges and I'm like dude I'm pretty sure it's not gonna be no [ __ ] cannabis you know like legal cartridges had to be some like fake [ __ ] you know I do know someone that bought like four cartridges for like the [ __ ] low and then with fake as [ __ ] dude like there was straight-up hot dog water personally me I know a lot of people that actually do like the old pal they like it because one so I don't think [ __ ] you know proof let's prove it right here look at that that should go it even has a little little sticker we are in California completely illegal dude and this [ __ ] gets you [ __ ] blasted i've only took like what like three four ribs and i'm ready list [ __ ] man but i really do i honestly everybody I appreciate everybody that our clinic everyone that's clicking on these videos man I appreciate you guys so much man because if you guys don't know I do have a main channel and I used to blog and like do pranks and all that [ __ ] back days ago days ago I used to do I gave me videos but that channel is just so mixed up with so much [ __ ] content random content that I got to the point where like I took a break and it just like dinah fell off I'm gonna try to revive it I've been trying for a while now you know but I was like you know what I'm gonna move on to something a little bit more different something a little bit you know like an educational type video if that makes sense so yeah but if you guys want to go check that [ __ ] out go down on my description it's my main channel 120 k subs you know and I actually reached 120 case subs like back like three oh [ __ ] it's gonna be almost four years ago back in like 2016 could've been I got a million right now [ __ ] up but hey [ __ ] have this for a reason right [Music] [Music] like I do appreciate everybody that's clicking on this cuz I know YouTube doesn't like cannabis videos and educational kind of this videos and [ __ ] but I do see that there's a [ __ ] large community there's a lot of people a lot of of age people that want to just watch you know like smoking videos educational cannabis videos type [ __ ] you know and I'm just like doing YouTube should just have its own little like section for that [ __ ] bro you know it's like I don't even wanna tie these videos if you guys see ads okay I'm telling guys this right now if you guys see ads on these videos it's literally [ __ ] YouTube putting videos and [ __ ] cuz first of all I'm not even [ __ ] partnered to me by the time you guys are watching this I don't think I'm ever gonna get this channel partnered honestly I'm definitely gonna be giving away a lot to like I can't really do like [ __ ] weed giveaway since I can't be like pack you know a shitty [ __ ] you know it's a places where like it might not even be like 100 it's legal but it's like you can't like [ __ ] receive it through the mail type [ __ ] you know like on some Canada [ __ ] it's like that legal [ __ ] hear in Caly it's not legal legal like it's get to the point where you just do it you could [ __ ] just smoke a blunt and a smoking area in some places you know people got bitched cuz let me smoke your cigarettes a bunch of tobacco products that [ __ ] [ __ ] kills you dude straight up it literally has a fat ID label that says this shit's gonna give you cancer and it [ __ ] stinks cuz you're [ __ ] smoking like cardboard a [ __ ] you know no offense to everybody that smokes cigarettes if you guys do your thing do what you got to do but I'm telling you right now that is a bad hat bad [ __ ] habit you know and if you guys switch over to vaping and all that vaping [ __ ] quit that [ __ ] brush it's also bad for you too bro and this cartridge probably bad for this too so I do not recommend any type of smoking but again this is for an educational purpose you know my personal review on this [ __ ] but a real [ __ ] though everybody that's watching this man you guys are first James 2nd Janet no matter man everybody like check this out we all got to go to a [ __ ] struggle like it doesn't matter if it's like the struggle is red if the struggle is blue of distress I don't even know I'm saying if the struggle is a triangle a square [ __ ] lid that made no sense that's the path you know that's for your life and [ __ ] but see if you're trying to grind you guys trying to come up be successful in all that [ __ ] I was gonna be a shitload of obstacles so when something's happening in your life that's part of it you know that's an obstacle you gotta face this [ __ ] to get to where you want to be in [ __ ] but damn it have like these crazy eyes like [ __ ] ideas and everything that I want to say on camera every time I say it I'm just look by the way follow me on Instagram I'm crunchy or go down in my description and go I don't check out all my social media I got Twitter snapchat all that stuff I'm gonna try to convince you guys to just chase your [ __ ] dreams take a jade tastes like it takes your passions like it chase your passion you know because in reality if you guys have a talent either if it's [ __ ] drawing you know [ __ ] writing us you're good at writing stories you're gonna like painting you could you're good at something Here I am not knowing how to [ __ ] explain myself but it's like if you guys have a passion or a talent or a hobby you guys are really [ __ ] good I meant pursue that [ __ ] right because I'm telling you guys right now bro you nowadays bro it's the new this is wearing mm about it be 2020 anything is [ __ ] possible that you could monetize absolutely everything bro [ __ ] what's that kid's name [ __ ] Ryan something to bear such the little kid that reviews [ __ ] toys for YouTube dude if he could do that and earn like [ __ ] close to 100 mice where he got like over 50 million dollars a year bro and income or more maybe like 40 to 50 million after taxes because if you got close to a hundred thousand then probably take like half that [ __ ] or even more um holy [ __ ] dude just from revealing choices so if this kid could review toys and become makers it's [ __ ] more more time like millions of dollars then you guys could [ __ ] monetize everything bro it's like you too bro YouTube is like the perfect way to just show off your personality show off you know your talents and [ __ ] there's a lot of people that could take pictures of cars they go they like you know fix cars or all that shade there's car channels shoes - actually I know David got kicks on in person and he has like he's like a sneaker head you know he [ __ ] he reviews sneakers he paints sneakers he customizes sneakers and [ __ ] like that and he's pretty funny he's a funny guy this dude [ __ ] made YouTube videos and then he [ __ ] all of a sudden from just showing off shoes at him making shoes and all this [ __ ] like customizing shoes and [ __ ] painting them all that [ __ ] he got into an eBay commercial true started by the way and I mean that [ __ ] just sounds like what the [ __ ] oven broke YouTube is like a [ __ ] stepping-stone to like this [ __ ] bro crazy like I'm trying to do that bro cuz I know everybody does not want to live that nine-to-five like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you know but if you guys do I'd beid obviously if you guys make like a couple you know small like six figures and [ __ ] and you guys have like a good job with like the benefits and all of the [ __ ] then I understand you know 9 to 5 is for you but exist you know you worked hard you got to where you wanted to be and [ __ ] and that's what's up you know respect honestly but then there's other people like me bro just [ __ ] hate I just don't like that nine-to-five [ __ ] and it's not that I'm lazy you know it's just that I really don't like I just find it so trying to upgrade myself trying to upgrade this this this brand you feel me so [ __ ] y'all shut the crazy-ass video don't even know how blood coughing oh [ __ ] we're reviewing this [ __ ] [ __ ] takes you great to give you guys a good taste it's kind of like piney honestly little piney

hey beautiful people can you believe that ridiculous song brian and dan put together for us so i don't know if i can pull that off that's just a little bit much so i was thinking you know that would be a great video you know intro but how do we pull this off and then it dawned on me we are going to have a new contest new contest it's not really a contest but an entry is a photo so you email me a photo and we're going to use viewer photos for the intro for the intro theme we're going to build it out of viewer photos so it's not about me it's about the community and we're going to make it out so we've got the song and now we're going to make the video and we're going to do it out of the community so you can send me video clips and you can send me anything you want we're going to do it use the it's dr bacon at gmail and every and if you give me an entry we'll put you in a drawing for a drawing we'll have in the month of april the 4 20 drawing it'll be our 420 drawing done so i'm up here just checking how dry things are and they're getting things are moving in the direction of needing some water but nothing is required today so we're just saying hello this is in my windowsill of my bedroom we'll move it once it sprouts but it's a warm place for now here we are up with the autos this thing's still not ready to bust but keep an eye we might pollinate all the plants in the background and this looks pretty good this is just known as pheno1 and vino2 and this is a super lemon haze we just popped some more of these not much flour activity on that looks pretty good to me though this one just looks fine avocado tree is looking better and it's lettuce for dinner again tonight and um this is looking good too i'm happy about that hibiscus sunrise really really looking great so those are in the shed for tonight our recoveries from the mites they're pretty they've been in flower for a while our very interesting jack lews i think are ready for repotting and maybe we'll repot our last baby jade and bring that outside and see if that flowers it's a small plant oh i forgot we're doing the uh we're gonna check that out we'll do that tomorrow when it's daylight at the end of the day see what's going on under this paper bag we threw over one of the branches to see if we could sex portion of the plant and it's been uh that was um the night it's been like coming up on two weeks so let's look under there we'll do that in the morning and we'll do something much better our autos are sticking their heads out we're on our way so here are our here are our sad triple x's still alive this jack glue which looks good but it should be a lot bigger for as old as it is and another lemon haze that's just stuck in time it hasn't died but it won't release the seed and we just had some release the seed literally like in two days or release the shell this seed i guess shell so it's definitely too cold in here i'm trying to decide what to do it's it's a little too cold to move those new autos outside they'll probably do a little better here because it's not quite as cold as this van which what's this what's done at these and killed some others plus rough handling so i'm the bacon is learning about seed handling so bear with me so i promised these jack glues a repot and this guy as well this is a rather slow look slower growing um our last baby jade let's see how this thing looks it definitely but everything needs kind of a pot okay this will be our first look under the under the bag there's some necrosis right here around the bag here we go nothing died nothing died these haven't seen zero light for about two weeks so are they flowering i don't know what they're doing but we'll put the bag back on okay bags back on these dead leaves this could probably use a little cleanup on the bottom side so we'll do that too our plants are dry do something about that let's check this guy he looks fine yeah he's good let us for dinner tonight so yeah we'll give these a quick water and feed uh uncovered the barbie house girls and i did not expect them to be dry and they are this one is marginal those two are very dry so let's just give this one one cup try and keep them on some kind of routine and this is unbelievably dry again that's another thing about using these it could go you know it could go another day so i'm just gonna water the back too properly we'll come back for these another day here's our cocktail we're gonna add half a cap of ph down which is specific to my water which has been filtered and had all the chlorine and heavy metals removed then half a cup of calamag the recommended amount of beasty bloom half a cap a sweet half a cap sm-90 and stir and then double check our ph again looks good okay we're good here for probably a day okay our repot going to be using roots organic and one of these bags is 10 gallons of potting material we're going from ones to twos and two to three so we're gonna need five gallons so that will probably shoot this bag up and using a one gallon pot as a scoop got all my soft ties off oops i missed these get these out of here this plant is super cropped these i just spread out a little bit share with you guys the level of root bound that's really not recommended to pick them up like that i will put it back down with two hands another one so these are just just ready just ripe for repotting and we based that on the fact that they were no longer making it three days between waterings this is our baby jade we're gonna um we're gonna wait a day to do any pruning and kind of spread out the stress on this thing not horribly root bound so that's fine but it's still going to get a little bigger pot because it's struggling to go that third day so i have a bunch more seedlings that have made it and i need to move some things around and make a decision here this is my male wonder cake we're just keeping him around and i need to do some homework on this hibiscus sunrise and figure out what plant i took it off of but i can go back i still need to do that so we have this and we have this pretty empty too because i killed most of my first round of seedlings it's still kind of cold in here but i'm tempted to bring everything inside and try again so and i'm tempted to move our um jack blues over here so i'm gonna start with that and go from there i think we're just gonna give up on this guy it's been in suspended animation for too long okay g5 tents both tents are on 18 hours and we're gonna actually turn the lights up and we will see what happens to these lemon haze they're nowhere near the surface of the lamps and we'll see what happens and these guys are going to be loving being closer to the lamps so we'll keep a close eye on everyone here these are pretty much stable and they just got a little more light these are just popping out all right this is looking sweet i put my temperature sensor in the soil in this um in this plant the seedling and um wonder cake i keep forgetting what wc is in this wonder cake so we see this guy's up this guy's up winning um so we're going to see how this works out they are just over 24 inches away from our mice martial marsh hydro i never turn this down i keep it on 11. um the newer ones have a nice little dial i need to give them a call and see if we can get another gift to uh give away um and same over here i got these lights on 11 as well and i think we're going to be just fine so stay tuned everyone's running on mats so there is a little warmth in our tent the temperature in here right now staring at with a light steering on us at 74. let's stick it down here and take a look at that later let's see we're on the weed map now um kurt robinson told me he's not in spain he's in trinidad i guess he was in both places so you're no longer in spain john stino is the only person well he's in portugal so he's not in spain either all right and we have two we have two new very uh gracious uh patreon supporters dab cat and dab cat two dab cat is a master um [Music] horticulturist um university uh he's out in nashville knoxville knoxville um at the university of tennessee and dab cat is in eastern dab cat two uh she is in in eastern tennessee so it's pretty crowded in the south so i'm gonna have to like use both hands to do this and i'll be back in a second okay i think that's about the best we're gonna do we got dab cat one and two in there in tennessee got z in north carolina red maple in alabama so i think everybody's pretty close geographically we're doing the best we can here first world problems baby gotta keep a nice close eye on these they are getting close to opening really close maybe i should move this for the moment we'll see hey guys i'm gonna um wrap up with that um i'm gonna end with that new song from brian and um danny and i want you guys to think about how we could make that into a great intro video and send some clips or pictures that we might use and everybody who sends something a video clip or a photograph um you're all entered we'll do a 420 drawing just for that we still have another patron drawing left for this month and i'm still looking for suggestions on that hey guys like and subscribe and have a super day tell your friends you love them bye now [Music] welcome to the community it's a good place for you and me give me those cookies that you're making it's the world famous", "YnSIbI75mm0": "[Music] hi it's Matt at roughhouse studios and welcome to canna basics today we're going to be making ecig juice out of some very high-quality rosin pressed wax the first a quick word from today's episode sponsored a uniform smelling like bugs and skunk ain't no smell from you vaporizer when u blaze concentrates with wax liquidizer wax liquidizer deca [Music] in order to do this tutorial today you're gonna need some cartridges to fill up you're gonna need some rosin pressed wax it we'll get into that a little bit more in a second you're also going to need a shot glass to mix your a solution in you're gonna need some sort of solution such as wax liquidizer or you could use propylene glycol essential oils and vegetable glycerin the rosin pressed wax that were using we bought this rosin press wax from TLC its backs that's pressed from a machine using heat and pressure rather than using chemical solvents it's very clean and a very potent nice way to get cannabis in a compressed form this is cookies-and-cream live rosin so it was pressed from green plant material and we're also using some rosin that we had pressed this was pressed from some purple punch this was grown by jungle boys really high-quality medical grade cannabis this purple punch is a purple it's a very very smelling we had it pressed at the TLC dispensary where we bought it it was pressed one day ago for making this you can see it's a nice creamy sort of waxy buttery wax it's great it's awesome this is one of the best waxes done I really enjoyed the flavor and smell of it so we're gonna start out with it so we're gonna this is our fresh pressed rosin wax and this is the berry punch and we're putting it into the shot glass we've got about a gram of the wax that we're going to use for this tutorial so we're going ahead and scrape up all of that off of our parchment paper that we're going to use and put in the gram of wax into our container and you could use a regular shot glass we're using the shot glass that actually comes with the wax liquidizer kit okay now here's what you could use propylene glycol for this like I said we do recommend wax liquidiser because it has several different weights of propylene glycol already included and it's more cost efficient but you could also buy propylene glycol and use that as the majority you could also put a couple of drops of essential oils if you want the flavors if you decide for the wax liquidizer it already has propylene glycol and three different weights included in it so it's gonna help it keep from separating back out and it's like the optimal solution for doing this and it also has the essential oils already added into some of the flavors there's grape pineapple there's about six different flavors but we're gonna use the original flavor for this tutorial because it's devoid of any other flavoring and the reason we're doing this is because we're using really high-quality wax and one of them is an even live rose and press wax the terpenes and all that are already in that wax that were using is what we're going to preserve the flavor of so for this case we're gonna use unflavored you could use whichever flavor that you want so for this ratio we're using two milliliters of our propylene glycol or our solution here of the wax liquidiser per one gram of the wax okay so I measured out just a little bit shy of two milliliters here because I was just a little bit shy of a gram because we had to dab a couple of dabs of that rosin wax it was amazing so I put the propylene glycol or the wax liquidiser in this case on top of the solution just give it a little bit of a mix to incorporate it together and now for the fun part we're gonna put it in the microwave now goes in there for about ten seconds but I found that it took a little bit longer for the rosin than it did for the the BHO maximum that so I had to put it in two times but after two times the wax set was made from the fresh pressed rosin was ready to go it incorporated together nice honey golden color and the flavor and terpenes of that as we find out later is going to be excellent okay so now we're gonna go ahead and do the even higher quality wax that we have here this again was jungle boys grown cannabis that we're using this rosin puck here it's a half a gram so we're using one milliliter of the solution and you could use less of a ratio we could have used a half a milliliter and it would have been thicker and probably not as clear but what we end up in the end is great but I think you could go to like a 1:1 ratio on this or the other two we could have probably gotten by with one milliliter with the one gram of the purple pot rosin me here we go we're gonna put that in the microwave now the one thing I noticed with the rosin pressed puck here is that it took about twice as long even as the rosin press the previous one did that was kind of broken apart and scattered but instead of putting it for a long period of time instead of increasing the time to 30 seconds or whatever it's I would recommend putting it in for 10 seconds repeatedly so you don't let it get too hot and just prolonging the heat a little bit so that it has time to dissolve in there and that's what I did and after about the fourth time of putting it in there it came out almost perfectly clear and when in just a couple of minutes those couple of little dots and specks had dissolved and gone away and it was like I said almost perfectly clear just slightly amber amazing-looking e-cig juice a little thinner than it could be like I said on this one I think I could have gotten away with probably a half a milliliter and been fine and had a little thicker juice but in the end it really turned out great and as I said that was a little a couple of specks that were left in there after an hour so we're completely gone it it was completely clear by the time we got ready to put it into our tank and so that's the next and pretty much the final step other than smoking this is gonna be to put it into your prefilled tanks her into your unfilled cartridges that are refillable and this was one that I actually bought that was purchased empty because I didn't want anything to taint to the flavor but you could also refill you know like heavy headers or brass knuckles or whatever you those things are usually refillable [Music] okay so here we go our first try of this really really great cookies-and-cream live rosin and hit was amazing really amazing you could get the slightest little hint of the propylene glycol so I wish I'd use a little as ratio and the end on that one but it was amazing some of the best ecig juice I've ever had ever for cannabis this stuff is really great so I highly recommend if you can make it press your own rosin buy some rosin get some propylene glycol or some wax liquidiser and do it you will not regret it if you'd like to get wax liquidiser please check out wax liquidizer calm i would like to thank wifes liquidizer for sponsoring this video I hope you've enjoyed this video on how to make ecig juice from rosin if you

wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery

a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now", "U3ZldGnlGvw": "what is going on guys it's your boy 7g back at it again with another review for us so for today's review guys we're just gonna hop straight into it man we know we haven't done a review and so long I've been kind of trying to like you know since its first of all it's the end of the year so there's not really too many other cartridges to try out and plus I am if you guys didn't know trying to evolve my content I'm not only doing cartridge reviews anymore because I kind of want it I want to do more you know I want to do more stuff so that's why I've been expanding so I've been doing a lot more collabs and more hablok sessions a lot of [ __ ] that normally wouldn't you do right but I do miss those reviews man I do definitely miss doing reviews because I don't know I feel like since that's my thing that's my thing there's there's so many people out there that tell me what like you're you're the originator of the car reviews brother like I've been watching you you're the first one to with your car because I was like I mean I didn't say the people said it man I'm kind of happy you know that people kind of know me for that because you know that's that is where I started technically some reviewing cartridges and I'm kind of I'm so happy that you know I built I built this platform from literally just reviewing cartridges but like this thing is pretty amazing he's pretty amazing so it's getting straight into the room you guys today we got a special call I have a special collab man I've been waiting to review this for the channel for so long and if I was able to go out and comp a couple of these because these are not easy to find man these are not easy to find anywhere if you're in California if you're over the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal state and you just have this make sure you guys try it man because honestly it's pretty crazy so happening - they're so friendly farms cool friendly farms X alien lab - Cola this is the area 41 hybrid and then I've I've already achieved if you guys haven't watched my top 5 cards of 2019 that video is up in that video will be down in the description below but yeah like I said I cut I copped a couple of these and I already like I literally just started chipping around this this is by far one of my favorite cartoons you know just because the taste is phenomenal everything about this cartoon is phenomenal and all right so like I said I'm gonna slap it on here when you guys get it you guys are gonna get the black tip with a little alien engraving in it and full spectrum you already know the oils gonna be a little bit darker no need to worry though full spectrum if you guys don't already know what it is pretty much you're getting every single spectrum of the cannabis plant from the taste to the feel to every pretty much everything row all inside of a pen so that's pretty amazing so I know a lot of you like to see the packaging and stuff so let me go ahead and give you guys a little closer the close-up look honestly dude friendly farms is doing some sick-ass things with with their packaging because mostly all their packaging looks like this but this alien labs co-op specifically is pretty damn sick dude I'm not gonna lie this alien labs co-op box is pretty unique dude honestly in in terms of artwork it's pretty sick it's pretty sick alright now that you guys saw the close-up of that man let's get to chief and boys I'm pretty much in this review we're gonna be media as the full taste test with a full body effects high head effects all that stuff what I like about it what I don't like about it what I wish they would have done all that good stuff you guys already know how we get down with the review guys so I'm excited man I'm excited like honestly this is this is so this is a whole different type of cartridge like honestly the taste in this is such unexplicable like insane it's insane like I've never tasted anything like this so give me you guys the full rundown on this review so area 41 alien labs ex-friend firms let's get it cheers guys and by the way if you guys do end up copying the proprietary battery from the feliforms I do recommend using a green setting anything higher than that which is I believe like the orange setting it's too hot it's too hot you're burning it too much you're wasting your oil it's always good to get such a little a little lower temp but obviously you're still going to get the clock so cheers guys if you guys are over the age of 18 21 whatever it is in your legal state I don't want any little underage kids in our that stuff in here you know we can't even enjoy it so choose [Music] so tasty bro all right so that my battery literally just died after that second hit back with that first hit so if you guys didn't see too much of clouds it was because that my the battery is dead so when also that brings up to another topic if when you use it as battery I do recommend charging all the way because it makes such a difference man that hits our way Milky Way flatter when it's fully charged compared to when it's obviously low and low and battery so let's go ahead and test hopefully this is fully charged simple choosers you could definitely tell when it's fully charged man the hit is just so much more strong I dude I'm telling you alright if I had it compared I know I said that the taste is not it's very very distinct you know I can't really compare it to anything but if I had to compare to something it has to be fall under like the lines of the cannabis drive terpenes from Suzy like those pods are so Turkey and so flavorful and when you hit them they're just so gassy and you honestly only taste like the straight-up but dude you just just trade it like straight bud no no preservatives no additives into that [ __ ] whoo shout to hydro hydro flaps if he has her oh geez on the challenge guys know I've been having this thing since day one right so uh for that first first two second initial hit you know right off the bat I feel my eyes getting heavy and that's that that has a lot to say dude because those two hits were very very very small in terms of the vapor products that you know yeah so for it to have that much packing so it's such a little hit it's pretty crazy so and the taste like I said super gassy super Turkey you don't taste no oil as it doesn't taste boilie and all I can like dis lids they usually do and it's something that you want to keep on hitting honestly and something's just so distinct that you're like hmm well you just want to keep tasting it because you've never tasted it before so cheers guys let's go in for another hit and then right away you want to enter your lungs they're like the longest benches instant dude it instantly guy I want to coughing so and on that exhale I'm getting like a little like some undertones of you know how like when you take like a pretty wanna temp tab you get those little it's taste like Turkey dude it tastes like turkey warm Turks in there you know and it just like fills up and lingers in your mouth and it's like cow like like like if you just baked some lie president you feel me like not not not cooked it bake it it you know when you bake something you get that aroma you get that full flavor taste that's kind of like what like you know baking out here boys I know I don't know if that makes any sense but you know making up new terms every day so when you go in on another one man because this thing is phenomenal I can't get off of it so even what I know I said let's not go to higher setting but I just want to see I just want to see how it compares on this cartridge so choose oh yeah that is what that is definitely way too hot like it tastes a little bit more burn so than anything not even burnt but a little bit too hot in my opinion like a hot attempt ugh I like those little lower temp ones and honestly man I know I keep saying dab and this is a pimp but this pen literally makes you feel like you're taking a DAB and the funny thing is I've tasted their full spectrum salt and it's literally it tastes exactly similarly super super similar like this taste that this taste that friendly firm produces is very very unlike be replicable and like it's kind of like like just just straight-up fire dude I don't know how to explain it like the taste like I keep trying to like bring out what the what the pinpoint tastes this but I just can't I just can't mmm so like I said the hi man I'm definitely feeling it more drawn my head than I am my body and then again it we've only been pinning in for like five to seven minutes so I'm pretty sure the longer I wait the more I'll feel their effects and it's a good smoke man it's a good smoke definitely you know and something's so exotic this isn't something gonna be picking up on the regular man definitely not getting picking up gonna be picking this up on a regular bed because the price there the price range is a little bit more up there you feel me compared to other cartridges that's why a lot of people don't really mess with with filming phones because they go into the shot they see the prices and then they're like the bounce I'll go to rock garden whatever whatever the lower end price is you know so but if you guys are in the market you know got a little bit extra money that you know is there the Christmas and maybe you guys got some extra Christmas money and you guys are in the looks for new cartridge alien laps X from the forums definitely check them out so we're gonna end this review out here guys I know it's it feels a little bit different reviewing this time I don't know what it is I just maybe I'm falling out of the reviews you know I feel like a lot of people have been coming out of cartridges so there's not there hasn't really been a lot of search for a new cartridge reason I feel like the time that I got into it was perfect because I was when cartridges were popping you know I got my I got my people and I got my viewers locked down you know things like that I think it's time to now

is dead it would die on our view huh so", "nPK-_hqhWA4": "let me sit down in my throne what's up you guys welcome back to my channel kawaii aka coco back it again with another [ __ ] video and today's video we are trying out something new i should tell by the title i am going to be trying out this delta a cartridge for the first time if you go back like two videos then you'll see that i did a goody kind unboxing and they sent me this delta a cartridge it's actually a new product on their line their store link will be pinned in the comments or in the description down below i didn't even have a battery for this and they went ahead and sent me a battery so i was like [ __ ] yes this company is so generous yeah i'm just so grateful that they sent me this and i get to try it but yeah um before we get into this i want to explain what delta a is because i actually just now started to hear about it so i'll try my best to explain what it is but basically delta 8 is a cannabinoid everybody's heard of delta 9 but if you don't know what delta 9 is it's like the main cannabinoid and thc that gives you that high effect but delta 8 is basically just like the reduced version of that you know it doesn't get you like high like delta 9 does it still gets you medicated you know but it's not going to get you like so medicated where you're just like i'm so strong bro no it's not going to be like that but yeah that's basically it when they sent me this i was like are they allowed to send me this but it turns out that delta a is actually federally legal and the reason that it's federally legal is because it is extracted from a hemp plant and that's super duper dope and i can't wait to try this i did smoke a bowl this morning but i waited until my high wore off so i could be completely sober for this to give you guys like a nice review on how i feel and things like that as you guys know i don't usually vape i bought a couple of thc cards in my lifetime before but they were never any good but this one's like legit it came it came in a whole [ __ ] box but i don't i don't mind vaping it's a discreet way to get even though this isn't like delta 9 thc it's a discreet way to get high to get stoney and you can't smell it maybe i should do like a video on how to be like a discreet stoner if you guys want to see that video comment down below let me know what you want to see from me but yeah um this is what the packaging looks like i don't know if it's pronounced goody kind or good kind but it is a delta eight thc vape card trick with 92 percent delta 8 thc organically grown pesticide free lead free co2 extracted no thickenings no flavorings third party test it and it gives like a warning on the package and tells you that it was tested and all that good stuff also they donate 1 8 to the navajo water project so go ahead and check them out they're very affordable focus beach they're very affordable and they're super duper nice company so please go check them out and i'm just very excited to get into this i'm gonna turn it on green there we go we got a flashing green and see if that does me well but um this is what it looks like you guys it's like almost clear i'ma go ahead and puff on this for you guys hold on it's flashing but i don't know what that means see i don't even know how to work i don't even know how to work vape pins y'all am i doing this right why is it flashing does it need to be charged oh my gosh y'all i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm doing i'm just trying to do a nice review but my ass does not know how to work vape pins it's like flashing and i don't think it's supposed to be flashing so i'm gonna charge it um brb okay so while this is charging what's up i apologize my ass was not prepared today you guys oh know man this pen didn't come with any instructions so i just don't have to figure it out myself okay so while we wait i'm gonna play some among us i wish we could smoke a bow i don't know how long this is gonna take [ __ ] yes this battery charged in like 15 minutes you guys that's [ __ ] dope but it finished charging right when i finished the round of a mangas we get to try this [ __ ] let's try this distill it out i'm do it on green we got it on free flashy flashy flashy i'm excited i'm excited [Music] oh whoa i'm in pain holy [ __ ] my ass was not expecting that this [ __ ] rips honey hold on do over do over do over cut take two my chest is a heaven then this [ __ ] knocked me out damn i should have started slow hold him a [ __ ] needs some h2o okay now we know that this pin rips well let's let's see how the [ __ ] delta eight tastes man i'm crying [Music] oh [ __ ] this actually does not have a taste it says no flavoring i said that from the beginning oh [ __ ] it says no flavoring but it hits so smooth you guys it's like airy you can't even feel it in your mouth that's how it took too big of a rip you can't even feel it in your mouth holy [ __ ] it smells like like a burnt coil to be honest like what you usually get from vapes that's also one thing that i didn't really like [ __ ] with with vapes is that like it gave like a a a metal taste and like a burnt smell but this one doesn't taste like metal it doesn't taste like anything it just smells like like a hot coil because that's what's happening right here you know this is nice uh this is nice what i read is that it gives you a head and and a body high so we'll see i don't know man i feel in a head rush right now but it's probably because i uh almost had a near-death experience this rips y'all and this is only on green how long maybe if i put it on blue it would have less of a smell unless you like sniff on it you can't smell it it still has like a slight smell but i just feel like that's just gonna come with any vape but enough about the the vape pen let's talk about the delta a i'm liking it so far you guys um it's very light it's not harsh on the throat unless you take too big of a hit like i did it's pretty most definitely it's so [ __ ] gorgeous it doesn't really have a smell just the pen has a smell it doesn't have a taste if you want something like really light and mellow like with like the effects and the taste and the the handling of it this will be perfect for you dude delta a is also said to help a lot with anxiety and i [ __ ] struggle with anxiety i've struggled with social anxiety most of my life and i know when i go outside i get all [ __ ] anxious and now i can have like something very discreet because i can't just like smoke like a cbd joint outside because people are going to be like the [ __ ] is that but nowadays people vape thc so they're probably gonna know what the [ __ ] this is especially if it's in a pen then they're gonna know something's up but you know no cop is gonna stop me like is it a vape pen and it has no smell you guys oh and plus it's federally legal even if the cop did stop me it is federally legal nice i'm actually starting to feel it in my arms and my feet i started working out lately you guys and my legs have been killing me my legs feel better oh wow this is nice i'm actually feeling a body high i don't know if i'm going to feel a head high i only feel like i feel like a head rush is because i cough so hard and you know once you when you cough so hard yeah your brain gets to like posting and [ __ ] like that but i'm definitely feeling like a body calm right now like i'm being medicated it definitely helped with my muscle pain that i was having earlier today in the past couple of days dude and i'm only taking a few puffs [Music] [Music] a lot of people like to use thc to help with like headaches and pains like that i have never felt those effects from thc i've had headaches and tried to just use thc without any ibuprofen but it never it never worked for me i feel that like cbd works a lot better for pain and things like that instead of thc but i heard that a lot of people use thc to help with pain but this has actually helped with pain it's weird it's so weird how this plant works dude it's like absolutely amazing and the fact that it's not accepted by most people that could probably benefit off of it is so mind-blowing to me i feel like this would be really good for somebody that has like a really low tolerance or somebody starting off like a newbie i feel like this would be really good for them i'm not talking way too much when i'm in a good mood i talk way too much this is nice y'all man i like this a lot i feel like my eyes got lower i don't know does like all cannabinoids do that or does like just delta nine make your eyes lower because delta a probably also make your eyes lower hold on we have a phone we have um wi-fi we can google it are my eyes red yes delta eight makes your eyes hella droopy and glazed over so if you do smoke delta eight then you will also have like the same effects in your eyes because i legit feel my eyes lower yeah i'm feeling good this is like literally just like a mild not even a mild high it's just like a little lower than that bro bro i don't know i feel like i feel like i'm feeling a high to be honest i feel like i'm feeling behind i think i took a lot of puffs and it's still it's still to the tippy top [Music] yeah i like this a lot goodie kind thank you i never knew my limit and i didn't know there was like a limit when i first started smoking cannabis and i would like green out i greened out like about two to three times before and i didn't know anything about cbd or delta eight and delta a is really good for nausea so if you're prone to green and out if you don't know what green and now means it's like basically overdosing on thc but you get sick like you your stomach feels sick you get nauseous i feel like if you were to smoke this like in between hits or just like smoke a few puffs before you smoke thc then it will help a lot with um that nausea feeling oh no i'm not trying to sound like a scientist but these are just conclusions theories conclusions and theories no i just had a [ __ ] idea do a science project while high how fun would that be how fun would that be but anyway yeah if you had if you struggle with anxiety or if you struggle with like the effects of thc or you just simply don't like the effects of thc then i would recommend this to you to be honest i do feel a little high and if you just do not like that high feeling then you it's probably best for you to just stick to cbd you know man i feel good my body feels good my shoulders feel relaxed this is so good and i'm so grateful that i was able to try this out and able to keep this product as my own thank you so much goody kind thank you everybody and thank you just like you know just thanks but um yeah i think that's it i feel a little stoned to be honest i'm not gonna lie i feel a little stoned but yeah i think that's all i gotta say i give this a whole freaking that gets a 13 out of 10. most definitely i love it i appreciate it so much thank

Pam you know I had a great time checking out this Partridge with you I hope you come back and join me next time until then have an awesome day [Music]", "tz6QveHJ4y4": "to smoke or to vape that is the question at least according to the state of New York hey guys Tara here for dnews and we've reached a turning point in our country where marijuana use is starting to become the norm whether it's medicinal or recreational andrew Cuomo the governor of New York State is expected to sign a bill soon that will legalize the drug but there are rumors that only certain methods of intake will be legalized specifically anything that does not involve the actual flower so edibles THC pills and vaporizing would all be okay now we've been hearing a lot of news lately about e-cigarettes and how those are supposedly better for your health than smoking actual cigarettes but how do we there stack up and are they better or worse for you than smoking say a joint let's go back to basics for a second now a raw cannabis plant contains over a hundred different cannabinoids which are chemical compounds that bind it to the cannabinoid receptors in your brain cells one of those cannabinoids is THC which is what's responsible for the psychotropic effects of smoking weight then there are others like CBD which gives you a body high but without all the mental fogginess now depending on where it's grown a cannabis plant will naturally contain anywhere from four to 65% THC and products with a high THC content like hash don't actually need heat in order to be activated you could still experience their effects just by ingesting them it's just that heating makes them even more potent now when you smoke a joint you're using an open flame which is very high heat and that combustion process activates the THC so when you inhale it the alveoli lining your lungs will deliver it straight into your bloodstream that's why you feel the effects of marijuana almost immediately after smoking vaporizers on the other hand use a process called conduction heating where either the raw plant or an extract of the plant has direct contact with a heat source but without an open flame so it uses a lower temperature and it heats it up just enough to be able to vaporize the THC that way you still feel the effects of it but without all the health problems that come along with smoking now much like a cigarette paper rising marijuana is still a relatively new thing so it's hard to say exactly what the long term effect but unlike ecigs you really don't have any outside chemicals to contend with so it's still widely agreed to be better for you than smoking burning marijuana produces carcinogens it can cause you to inhale soot and it can exacerbate problems like asthma shortness of breath and coughing basically it irritates the hell out of your lungs and there have been many studies showing that switching to cannabis vaporizers from smoking is effective for relieving those symptoms a 2007 study found that marijuana users inhaled fewer toxic compounds and less carbon monoxide when vaping compared with smoking it also tastes and smells better and from a medical standpoint it just kind of makes sense there's no medicine out there that you have to smoke in order to use so if the option to vaporize cannabis exists why wouldn't we use it well like anything there are a few caches for one paper izing can be way more potent than smoking and it's harder to actually determine how much THC you're getting many people say the effects of vaporizing lasts longer but also produce a more even high it also depends on your specific method if you're using dabs which are a super concentrated form of hash oil it can be really easy to overindulge dab users have also been shown to develop more tolerance to marijuana and have a greater risk of withdrawal which can lead to things like irritability and sleep problems even so it's hard to deny the relative benefits of vaping over

"YSjmQy42BWk": "[Music] what's up youtube this is shabazz and i'm back with another cbd hemp flower review what's up tomorrow can of sewers welcome back to another shabazz short today i'm reviewing something that i know a lot of y'all are going to be excited about it's another delta 8 product and specifically delta 8 vape cartridges by effects delta 8. now effects offers granddaddy perp strawberry cough and cali orange kush or calio they have one gram cartridges and guess what i have one of each cartridge so i'm gonna try each one let you know the flavor profile and by the end of taste testing all of them the effects should be kicking right in i do have a couple concerns right off the bat in the package i didn't get any paper test results and most importantly i didn't get a notice to law enforcement now when you're dealing with cannabis product and even especially with delta eight products because there's such a thin line between legality with delta eight there's such a thin line of legality with delta eight i feel like anything like this needs to have a letter to law enforcement what i did get in the package though is this absolutely massive effects sticker so here is the cartridges themselves one gram each says effects delta eight savage brand you got the granddaddy perp the cali oh and the strawberry cough they do have percentages on them so granddaddy perp has 82 percent d8 the cali o has 48 and the strawberry cough has 65.5 percent so let's start with uh the lightest and going up to the heaviest which works out for me too because of those terpenes so here goes the cali orange really nice packaging by the way i really like the packaging this packaging it's you know this is premium looking packaging it looks professional here we go pull the cartridge out the rubber caps on each no branding on this cartridge i don't know what brand it is i don't know where it comes from there has been a big issue in cannabis community lately with people using off-brand cheap carts that have lead and other things in them i don't know about this but it's always a plus when you're using good trusted name brand cartridges like c cell anyways so this is the calio i'm gonna get the screw right on here remember these carts fit on any 510 battery so any little battery like this if you're a stoner if you're in the cannabis life i'm sure you have a couple of these laying around [Music] i really like the terpenes on that really has that citrusy orange wow this is really citrusy and really orangey yeah 48 percent we'll take a couple hits of each one really smooth i mean it's a vapor it's it's it's it's a smooth i mean it's the smoothest vapor gas [Music] cali oh all right i like that one that was really cool and right here on the top i didn't even notice it says hybrid so this is going to be your hybrid smoke and i guess the hybrid terpene i probably should have started off with the sativa which i think is going to be the strawberry cough but that was cool now here goes the strawberry cough sativa terpene profile 65 d8 same packaging once again no really nice premium packaging okay now this one is a different cartridges this is one of the clear top cartridges i've had these before from a different vendor all right got that strawberry cough on there it tastes like strawberries [Music] very smooth the great thing about things they are super convenient they leave no smell you don't have to burn anything smoke anything pack anything clear anything out carry around a lighter go somewhere because the smell no vaporizers you could literally if you're at work you can literally go in the bathroom hit your vaporizer and walk back out no lingering smell nothing nobody will ever know so if you enjoy cannabis whether that be hemp or high thc flour and you are in the interest of being discreet definitely check out vape carts i think this is a good time to to warn everybody about delta eight delta h is very potent generally it doesn't come with the anxiety and the rush and the racy heartbeat and everything that delta nine thc does but that is only if you use it within reason do not overindulge on delta a because delta 8 is still thc and it will mess you up if you are thc sensitive and you cannot handle a thc high don't go crazy on the delta a it is far better than delta 9 far less anxiety but still it can get you there i got overzealous one day i was doing tiny little droplets of delta 8 distillate you know every 30 40 minutes and i was like uh you know this is nothing so i took a bowl of hemp flour squeezed a big old glob of d8 on there smoked the whole thing 10 minutes later i felt like i was dying if you've ever had cannabis induced panic attack you know what that feeling is you feel like you're gonna have a heart attack you can't stop breathing fast because if you breathe normal you just feel like you're not breathing enough racy thoughts you're worried you're paranoid that whole terrible thing that happened to me granted i did take a huge amount a very potent delta ate this to it but still don't go crazy with the delta eight take baby steps and just be cautious with it delta eight can be a very great time but if you overdo it it can also be a bad time all right let's move on over to the grand daddy perp which is the indica coming at 82 i'm gonna take a little bit more light on this one because i definitely feel the effects coming out from the other two same packaging this cart is actually branded so interestingly each cart for each different flavor is slightly different i actually like that because it's easy to tell them apart all right here goes the granddaddy perp and i'm gonna go easy on this because i'm already feeling crazy oh that's extremely creepy i think they might have overdid it with the terpenes on the granddaddy purp that tastes like purple kool-aid straight up it's good it's smooth but i'm gonna have to end that there all right vape cartridges d8 it's convenient no smell no odor no smoke i mean with this product i'm gonna definitely give it the shabazzle of approval good vape good terpenes my only concerns is no letter to law enforcement and they didn't appear to be name brand cartridges so i noticed while editing this video i got so faded i didn't even talk about the effects i don't know if you could notice if you go back and rewind my eyes got super duper red this is what i mean delta 8 is super strong a tiny bit goes a long way and it is extremely easy to overdo it needless to say the effects on these cartridges are very good they're very potent they're so good that i think i need to warn everybody that just because it's delta eight if you are prone to paranoia or anxiety intrusive thoughts you've got to take it easy but yes effects are very strong the terpenes definitely do make a difference whether it's a sativa hybrid or indica feeling afterwards a couple puffs go a long way so don't overdo it but within reason with the delta eight yeah i actually really like that that's a much more convenient way of getting the delta eight rather than smoking or dabbing distillate anyway so y'all that's the review make sure you go down in the description check out the merch hit me up on ig here here i appreciate everybody watching my videos if you liked the video hit like hit me up down in the comments subscribe to the channel and turn on post notifications so you can see when i upload new content i hope everybody has an amazing rest of your day or night and please stay tuned for the next video peace you", "BMSHUp-OMew": "what up guys it's my clear three back here in another cartridge review I know it's been a minute but hey better better late than never but never late is better alright so back today I got another cartridge so I hadn't been uploaded I just been busy you know but I was excited about this one I don't know why I never tried this brand I tried a lot but anyway let's get straight into it today I we're gonna come up at you with evil lab colors tropical fruit it looks bomb it smells bomb I haven't tried it but I smelled like the cartridge tasted it a little bit let's get into the details shoot its flavored tropical fruit I don't know how flavors in the taste in it but I'm more so I'm more of a strain specific dude but Abe I try whatever like as long as it's like some good stuff and evil lab out here in Colorado is known to make good cartridges all right let's get into the details you can see it says the total cannabinoids is 80% which is okay I mean it's pretty good actually THC seventy six point six seven percent and there's no CBDs in it and this is that it's called colors people lab has three different kinds one called alchemy a full spectrum 100% cannabis derived this is a hundred percent a hundred percent plant derived flavors so anyway let's just get into it man do the unboxing by the way I like I really like the packaging like so is that they really care about like their customers and they really promote their product comes in a little tube like this again all the back all the health information batch number you know all that legal stuff tech you got to do and she I mean screw this battery today I'm not the same as last video I'm still using this smoking dragon battery it rips well that's all I could say like I've tried different batteries like a Willie Nelson battery and anyway here we go here's the actual Clarke real looking nice cartridge says evil lab right at the top and like there's virtually no arable move like this is sealed all the way to the top just show you how it looks up it's a white background no runny oil so that's always a good sign if your oils runny surprise stop smoking that [ __ ] man I don't know what the hell you smoking but here we go without further ado shoot it's my first time trying it I'm excited screw this bad boy off if it has a nice little I don't know I just think it's I don't know I really like presentation go there they got me they got like a good presentation and it makes you want to buy this stuff actually thought further ado cheers guys it just hits man kind of thing it does taste food fruit punch but you also get that cannabinoid flavor I got a hot flash well it's real good man like take one more hit I really like the start I think I want to try the other three cards they have the bail range and like prices from $20 for a half gram they got $30 half grams they all range from big prices but otherwise I'm gonna get out of here I'm gonna keep I'm gonna keep poking you guys and do you guys want more reviews let me know and I'll keep I'll keep doing them yeah hi my friends", "Yoii0fLHIFA": "all right guys all right so we're back with the yeah another vape cartridge this time I got a brass knuckle it's the first time I've tried this company so yeah I got Girl Scout cookies because I've had that strain and promptly and almost every other bait parker's I've tried so I figured it'd be something good to compare so one thing that I like right off the bat with these can see this packaging you have to open this get it out oh it's so hard to open that's one thing I don't like I guess they're saying it's childproof which it is definitely but in this case one thing and it did like was this this tamper-evident seal you have to pull these back to open this case and once you do it tears them up so you can totally tell if this thing's been open which is a plus in my book because before these I don't think I've seen any other company that had some kind of tamper evident packaging so that's definitely good I don't I don't see any THC levels or anything on here or testing it just says that's been tested it's got the seen 510 threads and it says up to 8 watts and I'll tell you I had it on a normal battery to begin with which runs a three point seven walk I think I know that's volts I don't know how many watts those small ones run at but it felt like it was I felt like my battery was dead even though it wasn't what's this cartridge so I actually put it on my big battery which I can turn you know way down I think I had it at 7.1 or something so it's like seven watts and you know with it with it on this battery I can get I can get good rips off of it where does the other battery it was just really weak hit and I I don't know I might also just be this cartridge cuz I got another one and it seemed to work a little better even on the other batteries but anyways this is Girl Scout cookies is almost out actually another thing these these holes are really small that the concentrate gets whipped up into you I haven't seen that as an issue yet I just that's one thing that's different it says it's a quartz wick and it is I can definitely tell when it ran I got it to run dry you can tell it's a port Switek but here we go let's take a trip and they're calling this one a hybrid and it is it's like right in the middle it's a good I like it he's a kid oh gee with it right in the middle horse into cutters that even goes yeah and I bought these because I couldn't find heavy hitters so I don't know why those gone if you know you know comment below just rain notes real like it's just got that og taste with a a little more of a lemon coming through and then would normally so just got those earthy tones of OG that you expect with a little heavier on the lemon my strength is definitely there you can tell even if after I hit it a couple times it's not it's not runny it's really thick in there so I think these guys are on par with the heavy hitters I may even prefer them because of that port that quartz cartridge but you do need that a little bit beefier battery in my opinion so there you go there's Girl Scout cookies from brass knuckles thanks for watching see you next time", "nclj5B0c7UA": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another fake cartridge video but it's gonna be different from the other first three this is a part for don't get me wrong but this idea of this video I'm just gonna be reacting to what your opinions are on fake cartridges well not you guys specifically but the people of Reddit I'm going to go to the fake cartridge subreddit and we're just gonna read down the list from there I don't know how long it's gonna be but I'm just gonna you know read down the list and we're gonna have on my phone as well and on the screen we're gonna put it right here so you guys could you know follow along with me and yeah hopefully this makes a very very eye-opening video educational video because as much as I want to do videos on this I feel like if I dedicate a single video to a single cartridge I'm gonna be doing this for what a long-ass time you know and what better way than to just react to the fake cartridge subreddit and then see what kind of fake cartridges are in the streets from all over the country because like I said reddit is one of the best sources when it comes to fake cartridges and what you're actually you know ingesting or consuming so please just be aware of that I'll post the link in the bottom description below if you guys want to check out the subreddit but very very good information and you know with fake cartridges you know I've said it in the past three videos they can be good but they can also be bad and it's not worth the risk so if I can make these videos and spread awareness whenever I can then you know I'll do my best to do so so before we start this video let me take a hit this is a blooms farm cartridge so you can see it's pretty much about to be done a little bit of black stuff down there I was [Music] all right let's start this [ __ ] video so fake cartridge stop ready like I said it's gonna be on the side right here so you can go along with me this is actually gonna be a different video than I usually do but hopefully still enjoyable and hopefully still can keep people safe from smoking Fake cartridges yourself go right here we go it's recording all right fake cartridges will sit right here and we're gonna open it in to Reddit okay all right so we're just gonna go down the list okay first I see y'all sleeping on South cart okay I've done a video on south cart before generally most of the time I would say a hundred percent of the time actually if they're using copyrighted cartoon characters on their [ __ ] it's fake okay you cannot do that in a legal system where you can just take someone's likeness and put it on a cartridge just I seen the the Tiger king in a cartridge too so you know if you have if you have any questions on that it's no those are fake okay you know and obviously there could be some good ones because like I said they're fakes so that means if the good oil producers start selling them that means this is gonna be good or you know there's obviously there's a chance for it to be good there's a chance for it to be bad and it's really not worth the risk especially if you're in the legal state if you're in a legal state the only reason you'd probably buying legal hearts is because you're underage but like if you're getting a legal cart you might as well pay like someone that's older to get a real cart I mean it's hard to stop underage person from smoking so at least get him to be smoking some good [ __ ] you know like the real legit [ __ ] not some fake ass self corpse okay so let's go down Lions breath it says in reference my elbows he texts a lion's breath your carts have legalized results for why none our fate call the lab companies to verify ok glow or is this glow extract GE extracts not gonna lie looks like a really good cart like they even have it on the class I don't know but that looks like a legit cart the oil looks a little bit it looks dark and bubbly and runny so I don't know about that let's go down to white guys anyone heard of this company new to the page it's runny doesn't have a bad taste I'm still going to say it's fake I'm 101 percent its fake like what the hell two white guys come on like another thing is another red flag is if it has weird names you know two white guys come on like I'm not saying like legit companies can't have bad names you know but most of the time it's usually gonna be fake jetties jetties as though I've actually tried jetties before on my second channel it was alright it wasn't the best it wasn't that good but it wasn't bad I just remember the taste being like like a black licorice but that could be just because the stream that I chose was black licorice taste or something I don't know but I believe it was distillate so okay lemon oh she look like chapstick the one in the middle looks like chapstick like a chapstick container with a [ __ ] cartridge on top of it and that's dizzy I don't know if that's a live resident it's really dark Hey hell no Lily you just struck oil in the cart that's the oil red liquid and astiz e-card so with carts I don't know cuz mines legit too but you can definitely see some uh some darkness towards the outside of the hole so you know with carts sometimes like the oil darkens overuse I don't know about this one this is he kind of looks all [ __ ] up to be honest but yet sometimes the oil gets a little bit darker on the bottom most of time it's dis looks that do that that is big Chiefs may woods cookies aren't promoting them so my other video with Big Chief extracts apparently there are some legit ones and there are some fake ones you know I'm saying if you are a big Chiefs fan just know and be aware of the differences you know because the fakes do not look like the real ones but then again just be careful because sometimes fakes can look real legit as well so just be careful hey guys [Music] that's not even a carte Bleue Hogman or something another Muhammed I mean that looks pretty legit yeah I guess but then again who knows my friend asked me if you should buy that does not look like no raw barn this [ __ ] cap is about to be off [ __ ] that my homie makes these himself with supposed terms and wife so how does it look to you I suppose for you doesn't to me took off the cab it drops into a gaming hit weird almost like a big juice I mean pretty much answer this [ __ ] right there but like I said guys if you're taking off the cap and just drop some in there but that means you shits very liquidy and runny and that's not oil that you need it or want in a cart it's supposed to be like like a honey that's been in the freezer like the fridge where it's cold but barely moving you know that type of [ __ ] that's crazy Pier one [Music] so that's the thing that answers my question like you know you could be smoking on some fake [ __ ] and it could be good but even if it were bad the long-term effects or the effects might not show up instantly you know it might show up in a month in two months you know in a year you know who knows and it could be permanent so just be careful guys okay choices it comes with two what the [ __ ] is this she look back I mean that's a really cool idea you know two cartridges in one different strains but that straight back looking I should look like it was made in the 90s KRT another some of you guys mentioned KRT cartridges I actually haven't seen it till now from what I've seen it looks pretty legit but then again it looks like the same box type of date baits just a little bit smaller and I don't know I really don't know let's just see their thoughts on it have Quixote's have a shitty reputation as a black-market breadwinners if there was good to hide in the last long and it was a card that I would never buy again definitely not a legit brand I mean pretty much says it right there KRT like with fake cartridges you know they could be KRT they could be diamond boys they could be muhammad's there are gonna be good ones you know I'm saying and it's up to people in the legal states or the people that are actually buying it using them to be able to tell the difference okay you know I can make these videos and tell you it's fake but at the end of the day I really can't stop you from doing what you want you know I can only tell you and if you decide to listen you decide to listen but you know you're your own man just be smarter with your choices you know I'm saying cuz buying anything on the streets is no bueno you know people don't buy street freaking you know you're gonna buy us like a homemade camera from some guy you know no you're gonna buy a camera from Best Buy because it's a legit company you know I'm saying like you're gonna go by Canon instead of Fanning from this guy's garage you know that's just the facts you know if you buy but this is just an example obviously no invite you know you know homemade cameras or whatever but it's cut it's the same thing you know obviously a fake camera won't affect your health in any way oh just affect your bank but you know when you're buying this fake camera isn't there gonna be something along the in your head thinking like this is gonna break within a week you know it's the same concept here you know just be careful you know okay Lions breath is it okay for me to is it normal for our Lions breath to be clear I mean Kelly by the way another like I don't underst like obviously maybe he's probably underage you know but when you're underage everyone knows someone of age you know saying and if you're buying a fake cartridges you - and you're underage you might as well be underage and smoking real cartridges so get someone to buy your real cartridge if you're in Cali because Cali is like there's dispensaries everywhere you can look left you could look right there's a dispensary I think we're gonna end the video here I think it's long enough and I've proven my point with fake cartridges just be aware you know I'm saying and it's if I can make these videos and help and save someone from buying some of this [ __ ] then my job here is done hopefully you guys enjoyed the video like it if you enjoyed it or something subscribe [Music] [Music] [Music]", "OkiLenpSPl0": "but i mean come on bro these are pretty sexy like just objectively even if you got all four you were just ripping it it'd be pretty hot what's up everybody youtube's been really busting my balls about their community guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks hey what up before we start this cart video usually the cart videos just don't have a lot of smoke in the air there's not a lot of you know big smoke so we got to fix that with this cheers everybody [Music] oh my god i'm doing exactly what i needed all righty man i think that's exactly the type of hit that we needed to start out a video you know when you get a hit like that the video is just going to start out good man but this video is not about the dab so i guess in a way it kind of is man we're talking about some cards today some really [ __ ] expensive cards it's the whole reason why you clicked on this video so listen you've probably if you're especially in a medicinal state medicinal only state you've probably gone to a dispensary and seen some absolute [ __ ] cart prices like forty dollars for a half gram of distilling which is like mind blowing like 80 gram of [ __ ] [ __ ] like get out of here bro then you get the live resin carts which can be around the exact same [ __ ] prices like 40 on the half gram it really depends on where you live because california i mean i've seen live resin carts go for 35 on the full gram i've seen some [ __ ] dislike for 40 i've seen dislike for like 10 15 so it's just it's just really depending on where you live but these bad boys right here these pod tones made straight in la are 55 wait for it not for a half gram they're 55 for a 0.3 i don't know if you can see it right there on the bottom net weight 300 milligrams so usually it's a thousand milligrams for a gram cart and uh if you were to buy three of these which i only bought two because i'm not a [ __ ] maniac if you were to buy three of these bad boys it would be 160 dollars and you still wouldn't get a full grand you'd get point one off it's like someone skimped you on a full gram cart now of course if we're gonna buy all this [ __ ] we gotta have a sponsor for the video you guys know who the sponsor is i absolutely [ __ ] love them they've been with us every single month for over a year now adam and eve just the wonderful people over there listen man this this [ __ ] and sex kind of go right hand in hand i'm not gonna lie what's better than getting baked and getting late it's like my motto damn you can get 50 off any single item and free shipping if you use my code con and uh obviously you guys are using that [ __ ] because they're coming back so often so listen shout out to you guys that are using it maybe you guys even use it consistently i bet you i have several people that watch every month and get reminded and they're like oh yeah i need my monthly sex toy you [ __ ] freaks i like that [ __ ] shout out to you guys that's awesome like i said for guys girls anything in between just anything you know what i mean whatever you're into they have it i promise go check them out it's good stuff maybe a little birthday is coming up or something you know it's just surprising anyway these little bad boys right here these expensive ass [ __ ] i haven't even opened this one yet so i'm excited to try this one out these are made from rosin like i said so if you don't know if you need the breakdown explanation of live resin rosin difference and all that i made an in-depth video right here it's like 20 minutes pretty [ __ ] long but if you want like the one minute breakdown distillate which is probably like 80 or 90 of what you see on the market it's a majority of what you see is made from a process of just nasty like crude cannabis oil pretty much and it goes through a distillation process over and over like two three times and then you eventually get a very pure thc extract it's like upwards of 99 just thc but the only problem with that is just like distilled water there's nothing else that comes along with that like extracted thc it just gets you high there's no flavor behind it there's no profile there's no nothing it's just like distilled water it's it's like it's flat zero so if your distillate cart tastes like something it was most likely added terpenes after there's artificial terpenes are there's actual live resin terpenes but even if you add live resin terps to the distillate it's still a distillate cart a lot of brands will try to get away with that they'll have like on their packaging it'll be like live resin terpenes like a little small little thing it's like it's 90 distillate which is not awful i just personally don't like smoking it now live resin on the other hand is a lot different live resin comes from actual cannabis plants so as soon as the cannabis plant is grown instead of hanging in drying it gets frozen and then you extract it through a variety of like butane processes or gas processes whatever then you get an extract at the end of it which unlike distillate already has all the plant profile in it because you just got it from the full plant so you don't have to worry about adding any [ __ ] after any cutting agents or you have to worry about any of that because it's the it's the full cannabis profile plant and i love it because if you get like a gorilla glue live resin cart it is so much different than getting a gorilla glue distillate cart with like just some gorilla glue terpenes after it's just it doesn't taste the same it's not even close to the same and the feeling that's the main thing the feeling is way different because you don't get what is called the entourage effect entourage effect is pretty much all the cannabinoids working together to make you feel a certain way so you know you necessarily don't get higher off a bong rip but you get like feeling good off of a boundary but when you take a fat rip of a distillate cart like yeah you get higher but it's like not the same you don't feel like the body high it's just like a real like a it's like an unclean high you feel like you're just getting too much thc and not enough for something else which is exactly why i don't like it but this [ __ ] on the other hand rosin which i know i think specifically people in the northwest have known about rosin cars forever because when i was there for hemp fest i think 2019 i saw several people several people came up to me like homies and fans and [ __ ] and they're like yo bro like smoke this rosin card like it's all we smoke out here and i was like what i was like damn that's a lit like even cali's not even on the rosin card set heavy if they are they're taxed as [ __ ] as you can see ridiculous rosin is a whole other game than live resin because live resin you need a gas or some type of extraction kind of like butane propane whatever method to get it out rosin you use very simple heat and pressure you literally get a nug you put it between two plates you can even put it between a hair [ __ ] dresser a hair dryer or whatever i've seen a lot of people do that on youtube and [ __ ] crazy i don't know if i'd recommend that but you squeeze it out at a very specific temperature and a whole bunch of juices come out and those juices are what you're smoking so you don't need any sort of additive or any sort of extraction really like crazy method it's very like simple it's almost primitive in a way you just [ __ ] squeeze it juice come out monkey smoke you know that's really what it is it's [ __ ] dope you get the whole plant profile with it without needing any circus sometimes if you're not a very good extractor with live resin you know there's a lot of companies that are qualified a lot of individuals that are qualified but sometimes if you're doing black market shade there's a lot of live resin out there that like these are you know amateur extractors and the live resin isn't as tasty and there's too much butane in there there's too much like they didn't extract it right it's just there's a lot of [ __ ] that can go wrong obviously like i said this [ __ ] even an ape could do it's very primitive you get two hot rocks and just squish a [ __ ] nug in between and i'm pretty sure that's how they were making like juices and [ __ ] back in the day like it's the same method but we just smoke it this one that we're smoking right now it says notes of chocolate berries and citrus with a relaxing body high and a positive mood lift it's a little bit cap i'm not gonna lie i don't know about the chocolate but i do taste the berries and citrus i'm not gonna lie pod toads are made from full spectrum whole plant rosin extracted from premium flowers for a natural and delicious entourage effect like i was saying entourage effect beautiful i like how they said that on there no added flavors whatsoever 100 cannabis rosin made in los angeles good [ __ ] right there so here's the craziest thing that i think is on this whole package right here it says it uses over 1 8 of buds for this i listen dude i'm not a professional i'm not trying to like tell any brand what they should and shouldn't do but like damn that's crazy dude i feel like i got two rosin presses right over there i can show you i'm literally just whipping around real quick those two bad boys right there i can get like a grandma rosin off of an eighth probably but then again i have to like extract it once more to be able to put it in the cart so maybe that's about right maybe they are using some real gas in these bad boys it better be for 55 a goddamn point three they better be man technically if there's an eighth of buds in here you're paying for like a 55 eighth which is very in line i guess with other la prices indoor prices top shelf prices whatever you want to call it this one that i'm opening right now oh [ __ ] there's some uh try them all it says up fun chill and dream see that's another thing that i'm not exactly too sure about i i'm not too big of a fan of when carts say that stuff for like because it's very it's marketed towards like the karen that just walks into the dispensary for the first time and she's like i just want something to have me chill and it's like they sell these to them in the beverly hills or like west [ __ ] hollywood and then they're like all right yeah like i'll pay that amount but i feel like to a connoisseur that really enjoys rosin that enjoys like because i feel like they're not getting appreciated they're the type to be like well why would i spend 55 or 50 or whatever the price is on 300 milligrams when i could spend like 20 on this a thousand milligrams this one over here they don't understand the difference so it's like it's a very weird marketing i'd say it's a weird grab right here i will say that pod tones i think you should uh put some strains on here i think it'll be a lot more desirable to the people that love rosin you know i mean that are very interested in the extraction game in the actual cannabis profile and trying to get a specific flavor specific you know terpene profile so i mean i don't know hey i'm not trying to tell anyone how to run their uh their little shming skis right here but hey this one's called the dream i will say that these are [ __ ] these are it when it comes to just the profile of them this is one of my favorite looking disposables maybe ever it probably is the shape the feel and i'm not sure if it's plastic it might be a little bit metal like maybe metal coated or something aluminum coated it's fire though it feels good in the hand it's like cold to the touch you know what i mean you know sometimes you get the plastic ones and it's like whatever it i'm a big fan of build quality sex appeal i'll call it a lot of people call it box of peel or look a peel but i mean come on bro these are pretty sexy like just objectively even if you got all four you were just ripping it it'd be pretty hot [Music] i will say that after a couple days though they do get they do expect you to finish in a couple days which i respect they're expecting you to chief on these because they do get clogged if you're not chiefing them like very consistently that was very nice let's get a little dream rip in and let's read the description i like if you can read the description and then taste it at the same time i feel like it just enhances some things maybe it's a little bit of a placebo but who knows let's see a perfumey floral bouquet that okay did i say that right like a bouquet of flowers i might be tweaking that delivers full body tension release perfect for letting it all go at the end of the day so it's a indica i imagine some sort of strain very heavy maybe a little og i will say that the airflow off a fresh pod is [ __ ] way better than this man like i said they expect you to [ __ ] go through these very fast dope it tastes good i like it i mean [ __ ] i don't know if i'd spend another 55 on the other one i feel like at this point if i already have half of them might as well go for the other half some point right i don't know they're expensive as [ __ ] though are they worth it probably not i don't know i feel like the common theme on my channel is just like i'm a [ __ ] cheap bastard man that's that's the whole point of the channel damn near if you were to just watch every video you'd be like damn this [ __ ] doesn't like spending money at all like dude i don't know i just feel like 55 for a point three like come on like they're dope and everything but like i said you guys in the northwest you guys been smoking rosin for a fat minute man a hot minute you guys have been smoking rosin cars you can probably get a gram i think even in the northeast i've seen some people in boston a little massachusetts gang where are you at man i have seen some people with rosin cars over there you're probably getting full grams of rosin what 50 or 60. come on a third of rosin a third of a gram for 55. i said a third of a rosin what the [ __ ] does that mean it has been the whole video we haven't taken a blinker which i think is pretty [ __ ] up so without further ado let's do a little blinky action man cheers everybody oh yeah wow that was a very short blinker but i feel like that was an appropriate amount of smoke like that was that was a solid blinker bro i've definitely taken 10 second blinkers that didn't have that much vapor i would have to rate them if i had to give them out of 10 including the price including everything within the packaging the feel the the high that you give with it the flavors taste but mainly the price with mind i'd have to give these a solid seven and a half like uh as the price gets cheaper i feel like the stars would go up you know i'm just that much of a [ __ ] cheap bastard whatever that's my final review on these bad boys listen you guys are [ __ ] crazy i appreciate you oh they're just knocked over no i knocked over my torch we're all right shout out to um i don't know you guys i don't know i was gonna say shout out to adam and eve there you go for the sponsor i was like i didn't get sent these but these are pretty cool cool little somethings man i just always like pointing out making videos on expensive ass things when i see them out in the cannabis world i got a 120 gram of rosin that i'm about to make a video on like in a few days that shit's [ __ ] like like what why is it so expensive like it doesn't even make sense dude so thank you guys for watching so much i appreciate you make sure to check out adam and eve make sure to check out the code you know use the code get sent off check out these if you're a big baller if you like some rosin carts if you're in the northwest just laugh at people on the california coast that are smoking [ __ ] these for a ridiculous price you know the crazy thing is i always go to a certain dyspo in west hollywood that has these and they [ __ ] are sold out of them all the time so that means they're hot on the shelves people are buying them i wonder what the market is man i'd be very interested anyone at pod tones watch this video check them out i kind of i didn't [ __ ] on it i gave it a seven and a half it's a good score right there be very interested in knowing more about the company like just your demographics and stuff if you had a breakdown of this i wonder if it's rosin enthusiasts or like karen's and moms that are just trying to get high and [ __ ] i don't know i love you guys thanks for being here thanks for chilling i'll see you very very soon on the next video and uh i'll stop slacking i promise i love you see you soon you", "SBiNwQibNzQ": "we're outside of dispenser here in illinois and we're actually going to be approaching people to let them try delta 8 thc so they can see what they think about it

it out see what your thoughts are here you got a nice one it does have a lemony flavor that's just pretty good i'll be honest i like that [ __ ] really yeah hell yeah yeah as far as like what you're feeling like what would you say like the effects are i feel loose um energized and i'd say a little bit rambunctious rambunctious all right i like that first time me avid car user which is everybody

often do you use them uh like cut backs it's like once a day now but it used to be like oh that's cutting back used to be like five times oh [ __ ] so if you were to buy that car or just let's say if you were to sell that car how much would you say it's worth from like zero to 100 like in terms of dollars that's the currency okay if i were to sell it i could sell it for 69. what do you think about the taste crisp clear crisp and clear it's piney you know what like yeah if you got a taste for it you know exactly what you want if you don't smoke tsc very much excuse me i mean taste and flavor-wise yeah that's worth the money that's why it's worth any dollar amount you assigned to right up to i'd say 60 70 bucks i could pick me worth it it would be low it would be well worth it batman flavor is high quality i like that i like that i do i like it what do you know about delta a thc nothing nothing nothing okay let's try it and see how you like it yeah alright yeah cool [Applause] so i know it's a big battery don't be too intimidated i gotta just press the button tastes like lemons yeah for sure and this flavor right here i believe is grape so we'll see what her thoughts are on the taste and effects oh it tastes really good actually this easy to taste easy flavor and yeah it gives you relaxedness it tastes like a legitimate car like a legitimate card yeah like an actual cart the terms of stuff that makes it smell yes yes terps give it the smell and taste okay i know that tastes really good okay tastes good smooth for sure smooth yeah so it hit smooth i mean i didn't didn't tickle my throat at all how much is it smacking you right right now i'd say at least 99 percent nine i feel like chill just very like relaxed okay ready to take on the day ready to take on the day well what would you say on a scale like of one to ten how what do you think about the cart taste nine smoothies that's pretty good nice i don't know pretty i mean they're up there if you were to buy that at let's say that dispensary right there how much you think they charge you for it they charge like 80 bucks for stuff like this yeah so if you go to the dispensary there for a point five card it's like a hundred dollars after tax yeah definitely so they're you're definitely getting taxed so with this stuff because it's hemp there's no like marijuana attacks on it so it's a lot cheaper definitely it's nice i would buy it cool right now i want to buy a cart from there you do i don't oh you don't i don't because i want to keep hitting this one right here like i'm good oh [

__ ] video for you guys man for today's video man I just got out of school your boy is ready to smoke man last night I did end up copying one of my favorite cars hold up I not probably showed it already but I I've copped one of my favorite cartridges of all time right or what used to be my favorite cartridge of all time I it's been a while since I smoked it so I said why not cop it again and let's go ahead and smoke it on for the boys one time and see if I still like it man see if it's still there see if they still got it so if you guys know me you guys know my love for this part right here boys raw garden yes sir one of my favorite cartridges of all time if not my favorite cartridge of all time and you guys know I've I think raw garden has to be one of the one of the brands that I've done several several videos on like I'm talking about probably for the first half of my youtube career I did nothing but carb like cartridges on raw Gardens sauces and things like that man it was [ __ ] phenomenal so hold on I don't even tell you guys what we were smoking on so right here they feel if that book hopefully that's focused in but we got some gorilla gas berry and this is an indica sitting at 84 point 86 THC men and to pair that up though we got that Relaxo m9 battery right here that's this divot this giveaway for this battery is actually still going on it was gonna be a full month's worth of them it was gonna be a full um a full month that I was gonna be doing it it's a little bit over a month so I don't know if you guys are even still aware that's going on but all you have to be doing is following my Instagram page which I'm gonna be playing down description below man and be subscribed to my page so yeah cheers guys get it crack this sucker open you guys know what a raw garden looks like right you got the little yellowish tint little clearish go ahead and smack this on here oh quick one time and man what saddens me is that I cannot find my green ooze battery I don't know if you guys remember my green ooze battery that um that was the my daily driver for a while yeah that was my daily driver for a while I mean I am ended up finding up about this battery and this battery honestly Chuck's so this has been my daily driver since then I've been using on almost all of my cartridges if you guys want to check this one out I'll make sure to put their info down in description below relax om9 thank you for this battery and it's on the red setting let's go ahead and take a Cheers I mean my cheers hey cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over man we back at it with the raw garden videos baby cheers guys I think that might have been a little bit too hot yeah the wrong guy always makes me called you off of that little hit I'm telling you this battery dude the water use on this patty are insane it makes that makes your hits and extremely freakin huge so we're gonna go in on a green I think Green is lowest setting for this so cheers goes whoo oh my goodness that was the perfect hit yo Wow Wow Oh holy [ __ ] you're on e open on my window or something's kind of I'm not gonna lie I'm pretty [ __ ] hot in here so hold on this way for the beep Ian stop all right cool so like I was saying man's been a while since I smoked the raw garden I decided to call a cop went in oh my gosh all for those two to three hits man ah it is phenomenal though that was pretty freakin lame man I finished recording like 12 minutes a 12-minute was supposed to be 12 minutes total of the video and then um it just stopped recording man I was talking about all right so I finished when I checked back the recording it ended off at I was a 2 to 3 hits in and then after that I ended up taking like another three hits and I ended up talking a lot more talking about the battery talking about the giveaway talking about all that stuff so I guess I'm just gonna have to I don't even remember what I said I'm gonna be honest with you guys I don't remember not a damn word that I said B is what I shoot most of these um cartridge videos it's off the top of my head because it's a review video and things like that so it's nothing as planned out nothing is planned out now you guys know that so [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] get into this thing man alright guys so like I was saying two to three hits and deep I mean now we're like 6 or 7 i'm high [ __ ] right now guys we're gonna try to brainstorm so you see where i left off alright so this rock garden cartridge right here that i'm gonna show you guys this is this is the setup that i've been running as of late and honestly this setup is honestly pretty fired like it's it's the m9 Relaxo battery with whatever cartridges but this this battery right here honestly has the best voltages for any cartridges from low temps to high temps it hits all the spots you know and the raw guard you can never go wrong with raw garden man you can never ever ever go wrong with raw garden i think the only thing that i have an issue with with raw garden like i said is like i have an issue with how many times they cross the same strains over and over and over again and i know they're just trying to be like you know creative and trying to find new strains are gonna smack and things like that but honestly do have it's like if you see if you see things not progressing you see them digressing and being the same thing over and over i it maybe you should just try something else you know you're not gonna get better results doing the same thing that's facts this thing gives the fattest hits like oh my gosh that one got me dude I forgot how hard these raw garden cartridges met I honestly I remember I used to freaking get like baked off of like like two to three hits and right now I'm like ten hits deep now I'm obviously frickin blown I'm probably gonna have to just sit here and just be on my phone and chill with the a/c on for a little bit before I do anything but your voice is baked as heck so like I was saying man the my overall experience with raw Gardens I love it there there indica smack all the times for me I feel like the sativas and the hybrids are a no-go I feel like that's not only with rock and I feel that's with all all weed or anything in general men are actually not even but I think with bud and dabs I'm cool with but when it comes to cartridges the hybrids don't do anything for me it has to be a straight-up indicator and that's why I like indicas a lot more than anything oh man this that hate got me bro like I said I'm super baked right now let's give you guys a full rundown so the flavor profile on this [ __ ] already forgot bro [Music] so it has like a little fruitiness at the end when you Excel but a gas the earthy taste when you when you inhale it's pretty smooth it's smoother than most of the raw gardens that I've tried definitely it has a little bit more of a yellowish tint to it also and man it is this is an indica dominant I definitely feel the indica hitting me I'm lumped right now like I said my eyes are actually turning a little bit red so that's actually quite crazy I need a damn very good and then um yeah but like the Tate like I said the taste is phenomenal like every other raw garden that I've ever tried nothing too special but at the same time you know it's better than most of the cartridges that I've tried so raw garden you get you get you get another 8 out of 10 from you man you guys need to make something that's I don't know man you guys need to do something you guys need to do something different for the community I feel like you guys have done a weed thank you for everything that you've done that Bo we kind of want something different man at least from from me man I want something different from you guys so yeah guys I think I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here hopefully we at least reach to 10 minutes so you guys can have a good video to watch man let me know in the comments below what you guys what is your guys's experience with raw garden you know what do you guys like about it what don't you like about it what are your what are your favorite strains above them you know because I know they have some of this like I said they were they have some of the same strains that they cross with multiple times so let me know what you guys is favored right now in them in March 2020 man let me know which one's the best one you saw I think that's for me the best one that I have ever smoked from them I think was a the summer Bubba I think this summer Bubba for me was freaking phenomenal or that one or the LG Chem one of those two so yeah like I said I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it man hopefully you guys have a positive blessed day after seeing this video man stay motivated like always and we'll catch you guys in the next word", "P0-MXzLxg5Q": "welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be doing a standing episode just trying out a couple different things and i just picked up about four new products so i've got quite a few videos to make so um first i want to start with dark star extract cartridge it's cured resin strain is blueberry wreck so i'll show you the packaging and then let's get into it [Music] hello alrighty so i should have cut the videos together so you got a good look at the packaging um let's get into it let's open it up standing right in front of the window and the lighting looks pretty decent making my eyes look beautiful all right so let's open this up this is dark star which is a line i believe by the producer northwest kind here's the cartridge itself they come in these little like cardstock containers that holds it in the container and pull that out you can pop that back on or let's take it off because i'm getting into the cartridge so here's the actual cartridge um this thing is looking very nice these cured resins always look really nice not too dark they have a couple dark ones but i don't buy them but most of the strains looking really good um this i believe let's see when this was made if i can figure that out um made 601 20. so yeah this is from the same batch they've had for a while but it's not looking too bad so um let's see yeah i think i can peel off the sticker i always do that just so you get a better look at the oil inside nice check that out has some really really nice looking cured resin bho so i'm going to pop it in my vessel that i got from the giveaway i'm going to take off the shield real quick so you can get a better look at what i'll be hitting i always have trouble when i take the shield the trouble when i take the shield off putting the cartridge in there we go so this ran me without tax because of medical 2250 um out the door program so let's try it out i have been doing a lot of distillate cards lately so kind of hyped to get into something a little more terpy it's very good i started doing this a lot more just well first because it's cheaper but also because i remember cured resonance stuff being harder to hit but this thing is so clear and clean like no resist well a little resistance like perfect amount though let me see if i can get some notes on the flavor blueberry wreck and by the way it's made by um the grow the grower was midnight fruitco um it's definitely a complex flavor that's always something right off the bat that i noticed with uh cured resin is it's a lot more complex than even live resins but especially obviously distillates i'm not getting a ton of like blueberry taste from it and try this again yeah i'm not getting a lot of blueberry i would say this is mostly just like mirror scene and cardiophiline um tasting something else i can't i think farnacin might be the other one that i'm tasting in there yeah i'm mostly getting i want to say pharmacy and mirror scene in there foreign to be like kind of fruity it's found in apples but it's also it makes up a lot of like blueberry strains and stuff so i'd say generally fruity and then a lot a lot more mirror scene i think the farnestine is kind of lower in there so um all in all though it's really really tasty of course you always hear me talking about like oh it's got a mirror scene or something like that and i talk down it sounds like i talk down on it but i really it's great stuff it's just that i kind of get bored because i'm so into hunting turks that that's the most common i think miracin's the most common terp out of any um so it kind of gets boring after a while so i look for more fruity ones or more i guess like rare terps um i learned an interesting thing that there is a terp called hashishin which is only found in hashish and it's generally used as a biomarker to detect if it's something came from hash and it's made from degradation of mirror scene through photo and or i believe photo oxidation a combination of light and oxygen but that's something that i don't know if i'd be able to find because it kind of comes from like badly treating the weed but i'd love to figure that one out i'd like to find some some hashishing extract around here or something that's where my beard looks white with this slate yeah i definitely got a lot of farnesing off that um i'm just thinking about it now actually blueberry wreck it might be like a blueberry strain which there's many i think there is one just called blueberry mixed with trainwreck because it does taste like train wrecks in my opinion um so i'd be in i'm gonna look that up after this uh video i'll find out i'll do like one more hit because there's not too much more left to say and i do want to try and get on some other videos because i got some interesting stuff i got two grams of buddies live resin got apricot glue and blueberry muffin as a matter of fact and then i got some full spectrum edible cannabis oil um the strain on that is mango kush crossed with strawberry guava but i've been getting into eating like concentrates de-carbing them and eating them in capsules and stuff like that and i used to not like edibles but that has really taken me by storm in the past week or so so i'll try out a proper edible experience hopefully i will get that whole video for you tonight and show you how i get it together and then also just what the effects i feel from it are give you a little more visual all right yeah so thanks for watching tune in to my um next videos i'm going to have out this i say this like every time but i know the video is a little less in production today but i'm going to try at least getting into the editing and figuring that out again with this video and then hopefully i'll have some more tonight so um all in all for the price these cards are solid i mean they're cheaper than most distillate cards they're like one of cheaper resin of any kind cards and really they blow me away every time so there's a reason i got into buying these for somewhat or so much first for a good month or two but probably gonna do that again especially now that i'm making videos for every strain i got i'll show you the package once more um simple packaging just paper and cardboard really but they include the grower info and stuff so that's really cool so thanks for watching like and subscribe and i hope you all have a great day", "7jTt35Eu8cE": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another Ursa cartridge you know I'm very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "oyIHEzJi088": "how's it going everyone i just wanted to do a quick little review on the treetop delta eight cherry pie disposable um i'm in a legal state and i was kind of hesitant to try him at first but i actually gave it a shot and they're pretty good um they have 700 milligrams of delta 8 in them it's legal in all 50 states here's what the what the actual disposable looks like i had the cherry pie flavor at the bottom you can charge it so that's nice sometimes the it doesn't use all of the the oil before it it dies so you have to charge it up mine lasted the whole time last time i had one i tried the purple punch first mine lasted pretty much until the oil was out um it gives a pretty good buzz the delta eights always to me anyway seem to favor the indica side but yeah it was well worth the money where i'm from they're 39.99 for one of them or if you get two well actually they're 39 apiece regardless in my opinion when i when i vaped it it worked a lot better than when i ate the gummies so and it worked obviously a lot faster with the gummies it took over an hour to kick in just like with delta 9 thc but yeah i really enjoy it so when you hit it this light comes on obviously just like any other disposable but and it also has a window on the side mine's almost empty you can see how much you have left also so that's convenient [Music] another thing is it tastes really well i get a lot of people coming in they'll ask if it's cherry pie flavor obviously no it's not it's going to be after the strain name cherry pie which is an indica dominant hybrid and i definitely get the the effects similar to an indica thc 9 so yeah it's pretty good worth the money i haven't tried the carts yet but i plan on doing so very soon and i'll have some more reviews of some nick vapes and uh maybe some more delta 8 reviews coming up too thanks", "0dGf5pK_PAA": "you know guys what is up we are back but we are in my car because I have to go to [ __ ] school on a Friday which is my second day which makes no sense because I started yesterday on a Thursday I don't know it's my 2nd year my final year of my trade school [ __ ] I don't know I'm excited to be done but the reason I'm doing this review right that voice crack I'm 12 uh the reason I'm doing this review is because this morning I broke my toe in the shower like a dumbass so that hurts like a [ __ ] and like I said I don't want to go to school cuz it's my second day on a Friday so [ __ ] that you know so today we're reviewing z skittles um I was gonna do like the whole gram challenge but I don't know I feel like that'll be a lot and I should wait till like 100 subs or something like that if that happens I'm whenever but maybe we'll do like a half gram challenge or something like that but this right here is a full spectrum distill it it's a full gram it's the same distributor the so like the dispensary doctor Rosa dispensary way out shits build Deer Valley and then it's not that far so the last one definitely [ __ ] my ass cheeks up so I think this one will to that select cart by the ways I have it in my pocket actually I really hope nobody drives by cuz this will be weird I'm just kind of out in the parking lot little Chipotle because I wanted to get Chipotle but I don't think I'll have time after this video unfortunately you guys always come first up the nice elect cart that shits got a little bit of wax but you know that that stuff does not ever get hit ever I don't know why but it says nom we were hitting battery juice before we didn't that stuff so this card is completely dead I threw it on the anodized battery because this one died and I had to charge it and I didn't want to wait so good as Carter went really fast I did feel like but you know it's a half gram and I'm a little [ __ ] so I probably complain a lot it so we're gonna just jump right into the review yuuji strobe I kind of looked at me a little bit anyway like I said for probably the 15 millionth time z skittles blah blah batch you don't need the badge number y'all don't want that crap let's go ahead and rip this bad boy open boom there she is mmm not even open yet there's still Ziploc thinking I was just smelling bag hold on mmm I don't know what that that smells like a very like fruity maybe of fruity cushion kind of taste yeah not bad I'm a I'm a fruity kind of guy you know what I mean let's do this anyway I can't twist off the battery today we're rockin lean doctor zodiacs razzle dazzle moon rock Barry battery to take this bag don't get people don't live they can't seat you if you don't move go ahead and pop off this sexy ass rubber cap shit's girthy rubber cap on this one oh no they parked over there oh no they're gonna come join my review surprise review guests the Civic driver we're gonna pop that cap back on this old cart here just because I like to have all my cards but the cash back on kind of works out that way here you guys go here's the oil I don't really have a white background per se I mean I kinda have to book this thing but it's the wax it moves it does move but not tremendously fast so that's good as it gets hotter obviously don't move quicker and quicker but you know no dang fades no PG no VG none that [ __ ] so we are chillin hard with this stuff and well without further ado wait it's important important hydration time boys go ahead and move up the throat here hydration drink of hydration drink of choice yeah hydration drink of choice is some Aquafina it's what they had at the circle-k it's on the way here [ __ ] I don't know okay anyway boys oh let me just say real quick this is for 18 to 21 years old depending on your state and adult smoking cannabis shits I can't make the rules I just got to tell you them you already know how it is if you're if you're still here let me know what you're smoking on in the chat the chat the comments the comments let me know in the comments huh otherwise I have nothing more to say except for that's a big-ass list a truck cheers guys oh [ __ ] that brings me that taste brings me back to like when I first started smoking didn't like carts like when I first started getting some real gas not from the dispensary but some real gas from a whole meet up that's ooh hell yeah that tastes real good guys I'm not gonna lie that gives me some good good good good flashbacks hydration break you know honestly out of all the carts I've had oh no we have another car dude I spilled water on my old bro this car out of all the other ones I think so far this is honestly like the smoothest hitting I mean it don't get me wrong this [ __ ] like hurts you know it hurts inside right but it feels good I don't know what else hurts inside usually there's so many people around here it's like everybody's just staring at me like I don't really mind I don't really care I just think it's weird then again there's only two people and they're like 100 feet away that way and then there's like one more person wait that way and they're like 300 feet away I know cheers let's do another one I hope you guys haven't been able to hear my a/c going probably coulda heard it more so in the Jesus Christ you probably conquered it more so in the beginning of the video I turned it down like a couple minutes ago you might have noticed a difference in white noise I hope not but maybe me bring it up you probably do notice it now a [ __ ] terrible person I'm sorry what kind of cars you guys in doing I'm just looking at like these cars around here so many kids at my school like have these lifted trucks bro I don't know I don't know where their parents get this money like I had to buy my own car I have to pay my own rent you know like these kids are showing up in like $35,000 lifted trucks and there's 17 I'm like what the [ __ ] you know I'm 18 driving a Mazda 3 hatchback shoutout to you if you like the hatchbacks you know I like to call her the panty-dropper the panties drop because they're so wet you know why they're so wet cuz me just kidding cuz my car just kidding it's not has this has not got me one car anyway I like this card a lot so far guys um I tried telling you to taste it's kind of like a fruity plunging almost taste it and you definitely taste a lot of cushion there as well it is honestly I don't know if I'd call it fruity actually it's it's got some taste in there of fruit but it's not like super strong it's more of like a pungent cush kind of taste over anything and I'm usually like a fan of fruity flavors I guess when it comes to courts but but this one is definitely a great contender for what I'm gonna top tasting karts I've ever had if you like that the less of the terpenes but more of like the cush the pungent like wax taste I guess if that's what you're looking for then what strain was this jungle last one was jungle juice this is the skittles I guess this is the one to go for it I don't know how closest this will be to like other ones you know obviously but if you're going to dr. roses and you want one that tastes just like I described go for Zee skittles for sure and like I said you do get that you get a free half gram select cart which was my last video if you haven't checked that one out go back and look at that for being a first move a first time patient there and then I think if you refer somebody you also get another half gram cart as well for free and then they get that first time one and then if they refer blah blah blah keeps going which is actually stupid cool I don't really know a lot of homies I have their medical cards but you know if I did I'd be getting a lot of select cards you know I'm saying say I say we take one more one more good one right and we call it there right is that three I think that'll be three I'm feeling pretty good I got still got school guys I can't be going like the last video all like inbred looking [ __ ] you know I was that should have me [ __ ] up you know like [ __ ] up but I kind of want to go to school like that cuz that'd be fun ah I don't know let's do one more for sure one more and we'll see how we're feeling we'll see cheers guys mmm yup there it is there she blows hydration break you know that one video I think it was the kind sweet cart speech one I had that really good um piece T the peach one I think it was peach or was mango one of those too but I'm pretty sure it was piece the piece team Pete that [ __ ] was so good bro I've never seen it at another establishment since then I saw a quick trip that one time they saw all the other three flavors of peace tea but not peach am I the only one in the world that likes peach or what I don't know what I got to do but I'll do it I don't know if I gotta slide him a 20 under the table and put that [ __ ] back on the shelves or if I got a light not gonna dance for somebody maybe you know it's not not up to my morals but that tea have teas worth a dancer till you know I'm saying but pretty I hear guys I'm I'm pretty hungry too Oh guys bro I just parked outside Chipotle when I say something that was why I party bro bro that's some great news since I just got some great news I'm gonna give you awesome green news we're gonna do number four might as well write Cheers oh no Jason brake [ __ ] send help I'm dying all right guys my conclusion with this cart for this quick little sesh this for hit sesh right before school right it's a [ __ ] Cenac or there's no other way to put it I'm on four hits and I'm I'm pretty high I'm I'm not like slow like to level right but [ __ ] I'm in like I don't even know what kind of hide this is well guys I'm gonna end the video there this will probably be up on Saturday so you

know because I like the cop now I'll let you from unless you walk up", "Iu_RwFwgIJ0": "hey guys Dustin here from my freedom smokes calm do a quick video today on probably one of the most popular products that we sell here at my freedom smokes that is the ego with ce4 650 mah blister pack starter kit and it's easy to see why this is so popular basically you know it's a blister pack so it's in a retail package we have actually have a lot of wholesale customers that buy this from us and resell it in their stores so it's because it's got a really nice packaging to it it does come with one 650 ml battery you have a CF or clearomizer and a USB charger so it has everything that you need to get rolling in terms of vaping right away and it's relatively cheap we sell it at 14.95 for the booster pack starter kit at my freedom smokes calm you can find it in the electronic cigarette starter kits category there and that makes it a really great deal because these batteries alone I mean these these are actually variable voltage batteries but a similar 650 mah battery just by itself is normally you know 1595 just that piece so then you're you're basically buying a battery getting the clearomizer and a charger for free whenever you get this little kit so and it works really really well it is not a name-brand it is kind of a store brand that we sale it's not Joyetech it's not smoke tech it's not vision anything like that it's just a generic brand but we've gotten absolutely outstanding reviews about it it works really well the batteries are holding up for extended periods of time the Chargers are doing great the c4s are even doing great so really good starter kit I'm going to kind of go through some of the features of it here real quick kind of show you how to use it how to fill it up and what you need to know to get rolling so if you take a look here just took it out of the package it is just your standard 650 mah battery but the clearomizer on it and unscrew the clearomizer own screws right off the end there and you see right now it's off 1 2 3 4 5 out of 6 times and that's the 5 click function to turn it on so now you see it's on and is actually lighting up red might look a little orange on the camera there but it's actually lighting up red which is the highest voltage setting like I said this is a variable voltage battery to cycle through the voltage settings really simple 1 2 3 and it goes to the next setting green is actually the lowest setting so it goes from red which is the highest down to green and now you start from the lowest setting I think is 3.2 volts then 1 to 3 changes to blue that's the mid setting middle setting that's 3 point 6 volts and then 1 2 3 and we're back at red which is I think it's 3.8 folds you have to check the the product description on that one let's take it back down to green since we're just getting started with it here and then here's the charger you know just a simple basic short wire charger plug it into any USB outlet or get an adapter you get a wall adapter with a USB outlet on it if you want to plug it into the wall to charge it it just simply screws right on the end here it's not plugged in right now but normally that would blink or light up this will turn its normally green it'll turn red when you put the battery on it whenever it turns green again then that means it's fully charged and you can take it off but it's that's the charger fairly simple fairly easy to use now the the clearomizer this bench that we got actually came with flat tips a lot of people out there prefer the flat tip some prefer the round this batch came with flat tips we do sell round onde tips for the c4 clearomizers if you prefer a round tip you do have to purchase that separately from if you get one from this batch now a lot of times whenever we get new batches they may come in with round tips our flat tip we don't usually specify because we have a ton of customers that like each one so either way they they send it to us we're okay with it and we do have the replacements for those so just your general c4 clearomizer here you can see the the gauge on the side there goes up to one point six milliliters it's got a long wick in it actually several long wicks that's like four of them in there the hang down and just soak up that juice and bring it up to the heating coil right there in the center go ahead and take this mouthpiece off just unscrews from the top just like so so you can set the mouthpiece down and then if you take a look inside it's a nice open I've been setting with the tube right there in the center whenever you fill this up you want to try to keep the juice from getting in that tube that tube is actually the airflow pathway so any juice that gets into that center tube is actually just going to run straight through out the bottom or if you're unlucky enough if you will suck it straight into your mouth which if you've done that before you know it tastes horrible so just be careful whenever you're filling it up not to get any juice in that tube the best way to do it have seduced right here I'm going to fill this one up best way to do it fill up with some ry4 juice here just kind of lean it to the side here and then just drip the the liquid in and it will cascade right down the side of that chamber and fill it up try to go too fast here and some in there keep going and you really want to fill it up right to where those wicks come out of that center post if you go much above that and I went a little above it if you go too far above that it'll actually cause it to flood the clearomizer a little bit so you want to want to stick with filling it up right to where those wicks come out of that center post it'll be okay for this lunch of them just just testing it out here and then just screw the mouthpiece back on and that's it you're done it's full it's ready to use so now let's screw it back on the battery and we're ready to give it a vape all right let's let's try it out here after you see that I mean it got got a good bit of vapor out of it let's turn it up to this middle setting and give it another try Wow yeah that put out a ton of vapor uh yeah and then scope this high setting it might be a little too high but let's try it anyway whoo yeah that's that's a ton of vapor yes I mean you can see this is a really an outstanding performer for the money I mean it can't be beat and you're talking if you were to buy all of these pieces separately you're looking at you know 15 bucks for for the battery alone plus another four dollars for the clearomizer and about four and a half dollars for the for the charger so you're saving a lot of money by by getting this separately you're saving about eight and a half bucks there so or about getting this all in this blister pack starter kit so then an outstanding deal and it's just we call it the blister pack starter kit I think the actual product name is ego with ce4 650 mah blister pack starter kit it's it I believe it's the last product in the electronic cigarette starter kits section of our site so go there check it out this WWF freedom smokes calm and hope you guys

gonna buy real ones and fake one every question you ever had today guys is going to be answered how to spot fake cards let's get this [ __ ] started all right here's peter right here hello here oh oh i see the car you know we had to make it official oh my god thank you brother get this side real quick just real quick you're rolling around in this to drop drop off orders and [ __ ] yeah it's a moving billboard all right guys here we are this is peter from plug play i'm sure you guys have seen them online what's up everybody so please do me a favor just tell everybody what plug play is about would you guys start and just the whole get down of it so we're a group of homies started the company three years ago came from the streets hustled our way became compliant became legal and now we're trying to build this as big as we can possibly do it but most importantly have fun with what we do you guys know this is the most asked for thing on my channel of all time for um for of all time the second i ever did a vape video people just asked all day like yo these are the best ones you guys gotta [ __ ] try it out i'm glad i'm sorry that it's uh that the first time i ever showed you guys on my channel it was a [ __ ] fake ass car i'm sorry about it i saw that [ __ ] man i saw that and i was like wait a minute to school me on what the [ __ ] happening bro it's a headache for not only us but everybody in this industry right now we're all battling it and most importantly it's up to our community to make sure that everybody stays aware of you know what the [ __ ] is happening they see your car however much they cost and then they see the ones i get two for 20. yeah but it's poisonous you don't know what it is and people are choosing like i want the brand name but i don't want the brand name as far as legalization and and the point that we're in right now it's just a very crazy difficult challenging time for the industry itself because this wasn't legal before and now it is with that change there also comes this area where we have to learn how to adapt to what's about to happen there was a time where nobody was compliant three years ago because there were no licenses there was none of that so it was like literally the wild wild [ __ ] out right it was just trapped but there was a code during those yeah it's bad because now it's the everyone jumped in because they saw money here to me so the people that really cared are getting pushed aside because they don't got money like that i feel like right now it it's eventually gonna find this perfect median to where everyone's happy the taxes are cool um i hope things are just different the black market that it's all trash products because there are some there's some bran there there are some good ones that have really clean products true are trying to make a name for themselves because everybody started off as a trash product and got legal yeah it doesn't mean that this was bad before it was legal they're entrepreneurs and they want to get into this space they want to do it right but the the industry is holding them back to to do it the right way never really thought about it that way because i mean i'm already in this [ __ ] i never thought about what it'd be like i'm trying to get it as a legal company as a compliant company that sells safe products we're very big on quality and making sure that there is absolutely nothing that gets through for everyone that that does [ __ ] with plug play this [ __ ] smacks right and smacks for a reason we focus on quality we focus on opponents he put that into our device i'm gonna be honest bro i do those blinkers i just don't wanna ding ready go [ __ ] i gotta take it again yo shout out to the plug play fam because everybody's been doing an amazing [ __ ] job with like banging on like unlicensed retailers right what we've come to find out is like we started calling around and a lot of these spots that that had been reported they no longer had them so it was actually it was actually pretty challenging for us to find a spot that had the fake ones all this [ __ ] that's getting sent out of state right where nobody's really informed they just see one what they want to see here busy brand here but this video today is going to show you how to never get it again i sent david in go go check it out and sure enough you know like they were fake he ended up buying a bunch of different products just so we can kind of [ __ ] around and look at it and yeah see uh what you can see what it is this is the bag that they give it to give you a paper bag it's a paper bag this is my wig at least staples this paper bag for me this is a shop this is a shop oh my god that's not good that's not a good look all right oh no that's trim look look what fell out that's trim automatic i'm gonna tell i'm gonna tell everybody why when i look at this it like freaks me the [ __ ] out what is it yo it says springfield cards that has bart literally guys do you think the simpsons licensed this no that's why you could tell it's automatically [ __ ] fake this this can fool some people so how can you tell that these are fake because this is the same looking one that i got but they've even made copies of these with the compliance package and the stippling and the sticker they can knock the sticker off yeah they knocked everything off the only way you can tell really is the way that the letters are printed so the difference for like the the fake ones that i've seen they don't have these plastic tabs on the side the ones that i've seen they have older batch numbers we sell out a product pretty quickly so if it's two months old you know it's probably fake let me talk about this specific one if you look at the difference in the actual sticker that's on here this is a completely different sticker i want you to compare it you see him oh [ __ ] it's not even that it says one gram on here and this doesn't have a shine watch so yeah point them out yeah look at it apple slushy looks identical dude except there's yours is outlined there's isn't yeah like such small details if you look at it even the color of the blue it's different yeah it's a little bit it's just different and then right there look at the exotics is a different color yeah and there's knockoff says but look at this this is the scary part look at their oil it's like clear just like yours clearer than ours oh [ __ ] but that doesn't mean there's this actual oil exactly it could be something else it could be something else all right which one's fake what do you [ __ ] learn so far there one gram automatic fake basically look on your instagram and see what the updated logos are too this is scary show us what is that this is tangy bang we don't even have a tangy bang flavor how can this can somebody go to like a website and see that what flavors you have your ig huh yeah just follow their ig guys so you can stay up on what flavors for sure it says packaged last month yeah this one this is this is ten this one's real that's the one you brought also this is scary this is scary too this oil might not be oil and say it is say it's [ __ ] great say it's [ __ ] bomb oil it's not tested well if these guys are doing such a great job at making this type of quality if it is good quality i'm not gonna chance it if they're doing that type of quality like go compliant right that or stop knocking off my brand and make your own [ __ ] brand for that damn good we have a responsibility to make sure that like we take care of our community so if anybody sends us a dm about a fake car or a concern about a fake car we gotta look at it that's your [ __ ] if someone were to get hurt i did i didn't answer dm and then that person had gotten hurt that's not like i don't want that it really is on you though that's the worst part about it i never really thought about it it's the stress yeah yeah it's so stressful the water building up i have like a body high now you're right oh yeah oh man i'm pretty big you're gonna get high as [ __ ] at the end oh my god no no i'm doing that i'll put my sunglasses back on have you ever seen the [ __ ] on the news where these [ __ ] vape pen batteries explode yeah and basically it's shrapnel to your eyes yeah i don't want that did you know people knock off plug play batteries everyone's batteries i didn't know that these can explode i got one right here he brought a fake battery they're knocking off these the batteries and it looks the [ __ ] it looks better than ours what you smoke a lot i do but not this extreme real plug plays real ones will [ __ ] you up apparently he's definitely not hitting the fake ones hell yeah yeah he's getting he's gonna be good jesus jesus christ just wait till the end we're about to get oh my goodness thumbnail right there i gotta go lay down your time oh my god my video came out try and hold on there as long as possible [Music] i had a pause for a moment because it got way too lit and needed to take a quick nap on this table they bought a fake plug plate uh battery also remember if they could blow up in your [ __ ] face how can you tell that they're fake well the thing is though with the box you couldn't even tell right i couldn't tell where the box was out of the box it's like boom like just look at the print so right off the bat the fake ones have white is this plays in white right yeah plays in white for the fake ones two months from now they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna catch on to this they'll catch up when you guys update your [ __ ] so it makes you guys on your toes all the time huh that packaging's dead on the same oh guys when you see the packaging look look at the [ __ ] barcodes they got it down they wouldn't bought a real one copied your barcode that's crazy right peter yeah almost there why is the big deal buying a fake uh battery there's a protection chip in there so when it's being charged and it's like fully charged it stops pushing energy into it yours yeah what's the big deal those could they could burn your house down they could blow up in your face anything they blow up right there because the chip they don't have a chip so it keeps pumping energy into it so it like overloads it too much basically the fake ones don't have the protection chip because that costs extra money exactly they're trying to pay pitch everyone's trying to get into the market right now corners like i said cutting corners man [ __ ] people up you back to life slowly that's because you're dope as yola bro i smoke a lot of weed i'm pretty much an alien when it comes to weed tolerances oh it's like a box all they don't hit they don't do [ __ ] to me that's what we does i'm high but i mean i'm here it just goes to show and proves you smoke he smokes these every day every day he took a couple blinkers and he's done that's how strong these are so i'm going to let peter get out of here so you can go take a damn nap peter thank you so much for stopping by i'll see you soon so thank you so much peter for stopping by these are right in front of me and i could still not tell they had the same barcodes so like peter said they can get this packed this is the knock-off box this is the real box they can knock it off they can make the same sticker everything guys they're getting so good with it how can you tell you're not going to get some fake stuff that could poison it could poison you so make sure you pay attention to this stuff this doesn't say one gram this does say one gram is outlined apple slushy on the fake one is not outlined those little things matter you literally have to be like antique roadshow [ __ ] to be able to go well you see this is here that's how you have to be right now those counterfeiters are following me too they're going to watch it they're going to watch us go damn all right we got to switch it up guys plug play you everybody all big companies they update their packaging often for counterfeiters this is the reason why counterfeiters are they're good they make fake gucci they make fake nikes and you couldn't even tell i'm sure somebody one of you has bought fake jordans once you guys can get dupes so don't get duped on shoes that's cool don't get duped on things you put in your lungs you guys heard it earlier i talked to that [ __ ] on the phone that means he's packaging these making them for probably five dollars five dollars there's no way that's thc real fake if you have any questions come back refer to this video and make sure you have the real ones real quick guys before we get out of here these right here they said they got for free for coming to the dispensary can we get a close-up i want to rip this open they gave him six free joints for coming in no no what is that why is it brown and yellow you see it there's yellow chunks in here why oh it's dead leaves oh it's trim oh this is true so guys this past month has been pretty wild we did exposing fake cards which led us to this because you guys asked so much how to spot fake cards how do you know if your cards fake how to spot fake packaging i'm so sorry i got you so high man but that's just that's what happens sometimes over here peter thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to first off go to the trap spot and get all these fake ones and then bring some real ones just to show us it was super informational dude even like i said even i got played i had no idea how to spot these because they look so [ __ ] real this has been how to spot fake carts with plug play thank you so much guys for watching pass this information along thank you guys so much for watching i'm dobaziola have a dope ass day oh [ __ ] damn i", "v7eQ8UTo-Ug": "howdy y'all Dan Scott lean here joining you from legal grass that she sits the heartland of America so for today's episode I'm going to be reviewing this Delta 8 cartridge yes Delta 8 not not the Delta 9 that you commonly associate with THC but there's another form of THC there's Delta 8 that comes before 9 and there's also Delta 10 but I haven't heard of any vendors creating Delta 10 carts at this moment in time right now so I'm just gonna be reviewing what I do have in my hands which is a Delta 9 THC cartridge from 3qi and I've plugged them before on this podcast but I've actually given this actual vape cart the the light of day I've given it a chance and Delta 8 I got it quacks very much like the same duck of cannabis they did it's it feels if you told me that this was a different form of THC I wouldn't I would have I would I would would think it's the same wing of the of the same bird and but yeah so I bought their purple punch Delta Delta eight cartridge that the particular cartridge has about 900 milligrams of Delta 850 milligrams of CBN and CBC and 50 milligrams of terpenes alright so I got this purple punch vape cart from from the folks of 3qi and so do this all right this is what this looks like 3qi this is the cart so you're gonna vape it right now in front of you guys if you look in the video version of this excuse me all right so I vaped it it's like any other vape card if you vape a little too much and you put a little too much we're taking a little too much vapor we are gonna get the coughs and that's what happened I mess with the rooster and got and got the beak but but now with that hefty sort of vape poll that I got you could you could taste the purple purple grape II sort of sweetness to it and it's very apparent in that and in this cart so does it does for taste and flavor it tastes like purple punch concentrates I've had in the past so it does hold up I feel high I don't feel the same debilitating high that a good edible would make me feel or even just like a job two bowls of a 2 2 full cannabis bowls smoking before bed that kid it packs a punch and does the the what I find with Delta Aid is that it feels I still feel the same body it effects of a that I would feel from a good indica I sort of I still feel the same sort of Medicaid medicated that I would with with regular teeth see um what I do notice is that the Delta eight by itself I just vape it by itself like it tends to fade very quickly or in my experience it like you feel the high but then it just it fades and I feel like it fades quicker than if you had had a regular THC count cart so I I do feel that the sticking power with the high in the duration of the highs is shorter with this Delta aid cart and with this Delta eight that I'm trying but I'm what I do notice when I combine it with my THC and CBD I do notice that my sleep is a lot better because I'm getting the anuradha fact and I do feel that Delta eight with Delta nine by itself I feel like it's a lethal combo for for my sleep like it's you take it and it's like oh man it's like I'm hitting the snooze alarm again like I feel that my suppli supplementation of Delta aid with that my Delta nine in my CBD I feel like that's done a world of good and for for treating my illnesses that works actually better than just typical Delta nine I've a fried CBN concentrated like I've like I've mentioned again didn't see the big ruckus in it but I put a gram on my flour I put no I put a little bit on my own flour I put a little bit when I would vape and I again I didn't really feel that much kick from cbn I didn't really feel that oh I'm so gosh darn tired I feel like I get more of a kick from a delta eight and then Delta nine and having that together I feel like I get way more doing that than just getting cbn pills or cbn concentrate which I've gone before and didn't really didn't really live up to the hype but this Delta 8 stuff like if you want a good sort of if you want to replicate that body high and you know you move to a new city or state and don't really have your connects like this is as close as you'll get to the actual THC without having it without having to take spice or anything like that you still all the hallmarks of a traditional high are still there it's just just a bit less intense and it just fades quicker like that's what I've noticed from taking this powerful punch and what I've evaluated over the course of a few days but what I do feel that we're gonna learn and what what people a lot smarter than me are gonna find out is that Delta eight and nine and when you combine it can work very very well when when when taken without Delta eight so Delta eight and nine complement each other very well I definitely feel the hallmarks of a traditional high without you know the without the sort of oh my god this is out of control Ness about it like you you feel high but it's a very sort of controlled high you know it's not it's not like a sound like a sativa edible or whatever that oh my god I'm high I'm high and I don't want to be high anymore pleases no I don't I don't know I don't feel that with Delta eight it's a very it's a very controlled sort of high doesn't feel too much different than a one I would say a one to one sort of strain might offer you a comparable experience my opinion where you feel both he feels M you feel sort you feel impaired but you still you still don't feel like it's out of control boy so I feel like that's what I feel like these are going to be like the new one to ones or maybe you'll have one part Delta a one part Delta nine I feel like that's gonna be the way of the future I do feel that you know for sleep having supplementing with Delta Aid and my THC I feel that the sleep I get is deeper when I sleep when I wake up I'm hidden snooze a little bit more often because the claudius lead that I'm used to getting under Delta aid definitely improves when I paired with Delta nine flower but yeah we've gone into what Delta eight is in previous episodes I would I would recommend you check out these cards they're the one milliliter card was honest aid after shipping was $65 or something like that so if you live in a state where the met both medical or adult use are still very new and still very expensive you may be able to come out ahead buying Delta eight cards as they continue as more continue to go in the market there's another vendor I just ordered four cards from that that's selling their cards for ten bucks apiece which is a lot cheaper than than what I got with three tree but um but again that's it's it's that's still in the mail now so when we get those cards were gonna review we're gonna review that vendor there are new vendor to so we're gonna be what among the first people reviewing it hopefully but yeah I'm if you want something that's gonna complement the medical reasons why you use canvas I guess let's say you use it for anxiety use it for whatever I mean we're all different you know CBD affects me different than it affects UTC affects me differently Delta eight will affect me differently or affect you differently but I do notice that it amplifies the qualities that I find so medicinal about about indicas and it complements that body hi that I need and I need to treat my illnesses and my symptoms in compliments that perfectly it doesn't make the hi out of control it's it's a good enhancer you know and and I find that I don't get like I mean I don't get as paranoid anymore with with with cannabis but I do find that with this Delta eight like it's it's it's kind of like CBD but not you know you know in a sense that it it's able to neutralize it but you are still gonna feel impaired compared to not taking Delta eight or Delta nine you like you're still gonna feel something it is it is gonna so pack a punch and you should understand how your body can handle it before handling heavy machinery but yeah I would highly recommend checking out Delta eight cards if you have the ability to do so again the entourage effect you know all these cannabinoids work better in concert as opposed to just in isolation so again if you have the cash you have the funds and have the ability to get Delta eight cards and you're looking for something that might enhance or amplify your body high from cannabis that you use to treat various different illnesses like if you're sewing in which the body high is needed or the effects that are granted from a body highs needed then Delta eight is gonna be your friend in my opinion I I will say that before letting you all go but yeah I would highly recommend you check out three tree & shaki to live in a state check to see if you live in a state where Delta eight can be shipped to you first make sure you do that before anything else and yeah um if you have the funds and you have the ability to do it and I would check it out so as always everyone I'm their humble and gracious hosts dance Scotland I can be found anywhere you find podcasts tune in google play store I heard radio radio public spotify stitcher tune in and the Google and an iHeartRadio and I can be found at I am cannabis sativa on Instagram and I see sativa pod on the Twitter's peace out Chow and see medicated my friends", "2iCtA3bgrSU": "one two three hello fellow vapers and welcome to the devil vapor vape reviews time for another hardware review and today we are looking at the desire design more Pro pod system so this has a 1000 milliamp hour internal battery a two milliliter pod and a 1.2 ohm stainless steel calling it there we go there we go so it isn't drawer activated it is button activated on the front bit there so let's take it for a quick to a quite satisfying mouth for too long at vape going on there and it is also available in three different colors you've got black red and blue obviously I've got it in the beautiful blue color today so what we're going to do in a review today is take this down to the table have an unboxing show you what you get inside the kit get it all set up for you then bring it up top and give my overall thoughts and opinions on it and watch to hear please do not forget to click that subscribe button as well as that bill notification button to be kept up to date my latest news and reviews so without further ado I'm gonna grab the box and I'll see down at a table with the desired designs more Pro so here is the box for the more pro so you've got more Pro up there and an image of the device on there on the side there you've got a little bit of information about desired design some warnings on the side there on the back you've got the specs and what the package includes a bit barcode scratching check information about the lovely people at desire design lovely job EC being RoHS recycle FCC made in China on the side de you've got a little bit of a search bar there with desire designer comm absolutely wonderful on the bottom there I think that must be like just a batch number or like a batch day or when it was made etc says open this up remember at the top here you do have a little security seal up there that you do have to cut beforehand otherwise you will rip your box we'll take this away from came quickly basa open this up and inside there you get two little packages so you get your package with your mod USB and two lovely pods in here and then this little package here you open that up and you've got all your information at leaflets and stuff like that in there as well so please read through before using if this is your first time using the device let's get down to the nitty gritty bits the bits you off here to see which is the mod and the little pods with it as well so this is the little pod mod here if we compare the size of that to a an 18 650 battery is only ever so slightly bigger than one of those so you can kind of get a size comparison going on there so you've got your fire button little desire design at logo down there this does have an LED stays indicate around the outside edge as well for your information you've got desired design on the back there micro USB charge port down there and then if you look down the center there you've got two magnets and two contacts now if you go onto the pods if I slip one out like that you've got your two contacts on there and a large round magnet so this can go either way you've got two little cutouts on the pod there so you can round that way like that or that way like that it makes no difference either way but when you do put it in you get a nice little flash from the actual fire button down there just to show you that you've put it in correctly now if we work out a fresh pot here just so I can show you how these work when you get these these do have a little wear little peel off thingy so remember to peel that off before you use it so you peel it off like so and then that reveals the contacts you may need to wipe off the sticky residue on there and when you are done you've also got a bung in the top there please remove that beforehand otherwise you won't be getting any vape from this at all now to fill this up you've got a little bung on the side there that's all you do is peel off one side like so forget there peel that open whack your bottle in there and you are good to bloomin go and this has got a 1.2 ohm stainless steel coil in there just for your love and the whole could be a little bit bigger that's one of my main gripe through this is the hole is a little bit small for your big kind of like unicorn bottles but other than that it's not too bad not too bad at all so there we go let's slide this all back together again and show it in its full form so this is the desired design more Pro will show you the comparison with the 18 650 battery with the pod on there's not much difference at all you know it's more or less the same diameter as that so I presume this has got a thousand milliamp hour 18 650 battery in there but yeah absolutely blooming beautiful so what we're gonna do is take this back up to face time and give out over Fortson opinions on it so right we are back up top with the desired design more Pro pod kit let's take it for a few tubes let's go so let's get down to the nitty-gritty straightaway and I'm gonna sit up in my chair ever so slightly so let's go through what I think about this we'll start with flavor and clouds will start with flavor the flavor isn't absolutely amazing but the flavor is good you know I'd say it's around about a six six point five out of ten around about that it's around about average it's not mind-blowing but it's not absolutely crap clouds cloud production is okay it's around about average as well but you're not looking for clouds in a little device like this yeah so we're going to construction next construction is constructed very very well indeed I really like this kind of like anodized aluminium body here it looks really really nice it feels good in the hand the size of it as well it's only a little bit bigger than an 18 650 battery which is good and it's more or less the same at diameter so I think they've actually got a little a in 650 in here and all the gubbins are up top as for charging and battery life as well I'm charging it doesn't take a very long at all I can't remember how long it takes by remember that it doesn't take very long and the battery life this last me at least a day without charging ran about day day and a quarter by would advise charging this every day before you go out if you are using it as an all-day device if you are using it with nicotine salts in there and you know you've got your free milligram in one hand and Nick sorts in the other this for when you need you know a quick tutor up your nicotine then you know this is gonna last you a good few days if you're not vaping it constantly now we've construction we have a brand new test on the channel of the devil vapor which is this channel here today we are going to try and dislodge this pod by flinging it like so now you might have seen on my kangertech video and I flung it towards the back there now today with this I'm gonna try I've opened the door there I'm gonna fling it out the side and we're gonna give it some good flings you know and and see if it falls off and we are testing how strong those magnets are so the door is open I hope see look there there's the door open that is the outside world out there so we're gonna fling this we're gonna fling it hard we're gonna fling it yeah we're gonna fling it pretty hard and and see if the pod falls off and if the pod flies off the magnets are not strong enough at all so I'm holding it here like this and we're gonna we're gonna fling it to the outside world so let's go one two free it flow off now in all realness you're not gonna fling things off that hard at all but you know that shows you the test that was a pretty hard fling I've got good wrist action here and most of you might know that about my wrist and how good they are and going in crevices and stuff like that but yeah the pot flew off it's now over there under the the dining room table because I have a dining room and but yeah what I think to this desire design more Pro pod system - the pod at the top overall I think the construction is very very good the flavor is pretty good as well it's not amazing it's not crap but it's pretty damn good let's close that door hide the pot of shame out there yeah the construction is really good - the magnets they could be a little bit stronger to stand the test of time of flinging wrists like mine and but that wasn't really a control test not a control test at all but I'm going to do it with pod systems because they need to be tested to the absolute maximum and I think reviewers should be doing it world of bloody wired with these pod systems just fling that pod and see how it goes and yeah overall what I think - it pretty damn good flavors good vapor production is alright and construction is very good as well let's get into price now price over here in the UK let's click UK because we're not in Europe over here in the UK is priced at 18 pounds and 4 pence on the desire designer dot-com website a pretty damn bloody good price for what you are getting if you want to convert that into US dollars if you're over there in the Americas that's 22 pounds and 90 pence if you have some euros knocking around in your back pocket 20 euros and 16 cents overall a really really good price for a pretty damn decent pod kit I think it looks good it feels good it performs pretty damn well and the flavour ain't too bad either so I'd like to thank the lovely people at desire design for sending this through for the purpose of review I've been the devil vapor and you've been watching dev vapors vapor views", "6V1gPRAQ_IE": "oh that's good joe i am hot sweaty already ain't nothing i could do but i've been forgetting i'll do all of my cannabis products and uh why not do the timeless battery attached to it is you know say most people know the brand pacific stone but here they are uh pretty sure i'm smoking on pretty sure it's 805 sour it could be forbidden fruit it's funny that something so distinct i guess i'm not a hundred percent sure on because they do taste very differently hey maybe if this battery rips clean and uh allows me to enjoy some terpenes then maybe i can actually know the strain and then i just let y'all know hey this battery is great for like distinguishing like for a person that has multiple cards you know i want to come a little bit to the shade so you can see that it lights up a little bit and so i could maybe stop sweating so much um oh this absolutely rips higher than 3.5 volts if you're looking for like a low uh low temp part this this as well as most automatics in my knowledge aren't actually great for that you'll want like a variable voltage or just maybe like a lower voltage button press battery for that type of experience but yeah i'm pretty sure that's forbidden fruit the my issue now with it is actually the heart not even the battery so i can even maybe try to change the cart so i can review this battery for a little longer have more content and have more feedback for you because i don't really feel like if i don't get enough you know like a satisfactory hit i can't really review it that well and that cart was just uh the oil wasn't lining up with the wick it was tasting burns but i know that has nothing to do with the battery so i'm gonna go back to this shady spot it also helps me to see good this thing i actually can't see the recording at all it's too bright but yeah we're back here okay yeah it's a little puff rock garden usually clog so i guess i kind of have to for a video like this show you what a blinker would be like am i ready though i believe that was a standard 10 seconds oh yeah it's ripping this raw garden beautifully oh oh wow show y'all the view or whatever so you don't need to see my face when i'm suffering i might need some water but i'm i'm crawling it's just it's just a blinker actually i took back-to-back blinkers very very nice i'd raise some pictures right there probably going to use that for the thumbnail if i can wow i'm now i'm just sloppy um i'm i will check just for the [ __ ] sake of this video or should i just think excuse my head right quick yeah yeah all right i got it okay and i hope oh no no it won't work it won't work never mind okay i thought i had a different type of cart so i could show y'all maybe three three different types but that one it actually requires you to be a below like three volts and a taste burn when i use it with this battery well i think none of these damn um battery reviews ends up being one of my longer videos because i'm just out here vibing oh and i guess it's rare that i have this much runtime i'm always low on storage now a little more nature oh i guess my flash is on too i don't think that's really done much but yeah i really like this battery it's held small definitely should have showed y'all what it like came with honestly i think i have in a different video oh my god my hand but yeah my hands have all this like you know just sidewalk concrete take a nice deep breath in okay oh my god well yeah realizing that taylor these blinkers contributing to me sweating too i love this [ __ ] battery um it is a small battery doesn't last the longest but i don't feel like it dies hella quick either so he won like a nice auto draw with some swag it did come with a carrying case that i might actually just add on to the video or not and um you really just like can't go wrong with him like this unless you have specific cartridge that says you cannot exceed like three volts or you know you gotta be on it you gotta rip this live resident cartridge at a lower temperature otherwise this is crazy", "kc7qVeHJIHA": "hi everybody he'll be doing great today I'll be reviewing the light 40 bucks my starter kit by jumbo tech the jumbo tech light 40 bucks mod kit contains a micro USB charging cable a 0.5 ohm coil head the light 40 tank and the light 40 box mod the light 40 is a lightweight and simple to use 40 watt box mod it can be charged via the microUSB port located on the bottom it features pass-through charging as well as an adjustable 510 pin it is roughly 1 and 1/2 inches in width by 2 and 7/8 inches in height 5 clicks the power button turns it on it has four blue indicator lights to monitor battery life the light 40 tank is an adjustable airflow 510 threaded Pyrex glass tank with a three milliliter eliquid capacity to fill the e-liquid unscrew the base and fill avoiding passing the center post reattach the base attached to the light 40 and you're ready to vape for its eyes a light 40 packs a punch the mod feels empty but the enclosed battery got me through 2 tanks before needing a charge a pro and a con is that there is no screen or adjustments just a constant 40 Watts a very simple yet easy to use box mod the light 40 tank also performed great with excellent vapor production if you like more info on the light 40 starter kit just click on the info link in the description box below this video as always thanks for watching please subscribe and connect with me on my social sites have an excellent day and may the bait be with you [Music] you [Music]", "GlDSPn19xc8": "it's gone on YouTube so the other day I grabbed this vape and I want to let you know what I think about it if if I like it if I don't if it's okay so we're gonna talk about it so it's the swarn air and this thing what I like about it the most is it fits in my wallet so the fact that it fits in my wallet is extremely stealthy and you know it's not super visible and it's not weighing down your pocket now the fact about that it's not a big huge device obviously it's not as technical and it's not gonna have all the bells and whistles there's other ones but you know I don't need all that all I need is something that's gonna consistently smoke right not burn and you know basically when I want to smoke I want to smoke if I want just whatever now to start off yes it's very small I love it it really does fit directly in my wallet like a credit card and that's really my favorite part about it now when I got it he gave me a rundown and when I fill this up you gotta let it sit it says on a box for fit let it sit for like five minutes but he told me to let it sit for about 15 to 25 minutes so it really soaks up the the juice because if you don't it's gonna burn and now I have this little syringe what you can do is go inside and to the other way get really far down there and if you get right down to the cotton you could directly eject right into the cotton so that really helps keep it from burning but still even what's been doing that I'm fighting and burning out and it's a shame because this thing is really cool but it definitely burns out and it definitely burns up pretty easily but that aside if you're keeping watch of your cotton and just constantly making sure the top layer is is coated you're going to get a pretty long life out of your pod what I really like about this is the fact that there's no atomizers the fact that everything is just your pot you fill this five times and you're done there's no check your atomizer all the time every you know and the fact that it's interchangeable I could have one flavor of one one thing one of another and you know it really makes it a lot better experience so you can switch out your nicotine to your THC whatever whatever whatever you're doing but I really like that and so you buy them in these little cheap little pods that are very inexpensive and you know I got it everything I got here I got a blue dream bait loans in Voorhees New Jersey and you know these dudes really were really cool they really helped me get something that I wanted not something that they wanted me to get this is like I'm not somebody who's gonna be you know blowing big huge clouds I just want something that's gonna consistently smoke right and this really does do it but the burning yeah it's kind of downside but and I will say my first my first vape was defective so I had to go back and they swapped it out and you know it's so worn you know watch your products but you know my only downside is really the burning of the pod and the fact that there's so many steps to take when you change it your pilot you have to let it sit you have to go to the other side soak the other side let the other side soak it's too much but in the end it's really small it's really stealthy and it really does do the job like I'll tell you it really works so let's take a take a poll let's see what looks like you can really taste whatever flavor you have in there it tastes pretty good but it does burn so something you really got to take in mind but it has an on/off switch so you're not going to be burning out your battery it holds like 2 milliliters of liquid so it's a decent amount but it definitely it definitely feels durable it doesn't feel like it's gonna be breaking anytime soon and you know shout out to Donnie smokes on YouTube because thanks to him I was able to really really figure out the defined tuning of this so if you if you buy a sworn heir look at Donnie smokes because he gives you a full walkthrough of what you should be doing so this thing doesn't burn out kid definitely knows what he's talking about but yeah I like it I just wish it in a burn out so easily but that aside you know it's a really nice product that it fits it fits in your wallet oh you can't beat being able to pull something out your wallet smoke up real fast and go about your business so let me know you guys think leave a like to subscribe and as always smoke on", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "WLD7kW_uVEY": "- I don't know how any\nof this works at all. So, where do you put the fluid, why do you need power? I know nothing about this. - Yup, that's exactly what I thought. What the heck is a Juul? - What is a Juul? A Juul is a closed-loop vape system. It consists of a battery\nand a pre-filled pod. Pre-filled pod is filled with e-liquid with a high nicotine volume. A Juul is very easy to use, all you do is put the\npod in and vape away. - Lots of high school kids\nwould never think of smoking. They've grown up with anti-tobacco ads. - [Girl] With this contract, I relinquish part of my freedom, to you. - [Kavitha] The scary thing\nis they don't think of vaping as smoking a cigarette or as smoking. - [Boy] Vaping can deliver\nnicotine to your brain. - It is true that Juuls don't have a lot of the toxic chemicals\nthat say a cigarette has, but a tiny Juul pod has the\nequivalent amount of nicotine that's contained in an\nentire pack of cigarettes. So, why would kids Juul? - They love the flavors. - I've heard a lot of kids say like, just gives them a quick buzz. They feel good after they do it. - You see the younger celebrities, they're holding a Juul in their hand and everyone on Snapchat\nwill like post videos of them juuling. They just find it as a way to be cool. - If you have money, you\ncan get it super easy. Just ask anyone. - One of the things that makes\nit really hard for educators is that Juuls are really easy to hide. - So, if I'm a student\nand not dressed like this, but if I have a pocket or if I, I put it right here. - Juuls look so similar to\nsay thumb drives, right? It's really easy to get confused and of course, kids\ntake advantage of this. So, a lot of students told me about a game they play in class, where a student can go up to a teacher, who has no idea what a Juul is, and say hey, I've got my\npresentation on this thumb drive, can I charge it on your computer, please? Because, I really need to have it. And then, they go ahead\nand charge their Juul on the teacher's computer\nand teachers have no idea. - It's very tricky, it's\nmade to be very tricky, to trick us, so it's therefore\ndifficult as teachers to know if they're actually vaping. - So, what's a teacher to do? Here is some of the things you can look for in your classroom. - So, your typical high\nschool bathroom, right? - Frequent or long bathroom breaks. A lot of kids go to the bathroom and then they hang out juuling. In fact, it's become so common, that schools across\nthe country have either cut down on the number of\nbathrooms that are open, teachers may monitor the bathroom, sometimes even principals. - You might have five or six kids hanging out in here with\nthe door closed and vaping. - Watch out for kids who cover\ntheir face with their hands, who sometimes have sleeves\nnext to their nose, who put their head down often, and maybe they just hide,\nthey're teenagers, right? But it could be that\nthey're vaping in class. A principal I spoke to said one of the most\neffective methods he used was really involving parents. So, for example, he didn't just talk to\nkids about the problem, he had after school seminars\nwhere he would invite parents and then it grew even bigger, it wasn't just parents, he actually invited the entire community, so that there were lots of\nsets of eyes on his students. And parents are still really influential in their teen's life, I mean just listen to what this one kid, Zane, said to me. - My momma don't play that. (kids laughing) It's that simple. - [Kavitha] Your mom is a very smart one. - Yeah, my mom would kill me too.", "8EyQuIhFzfw": "[Music] oh hi are we on we're on we're on hot mike all right hey thank you for being here what a beautiful day we have it is a beautiful day yeah thank you for noticing that's very good look at it outside i know it's nice we got a whole bank of windows behind james and april yeah so sometimes they catch shadows on us well yes they cast big shadows hey welcome thank you for being here today is going to be a great day uh those of you who are looking for delta dawn i mean delta eight um i was singing delta dawn earlier we were if we were singing together we were i didn't know if you wanted to admit having some no i thought we did what's the flower you have on i know it kind of ages us just brings me back to the the truck the ford truck you know as a kid what do you mean with the little radio on there it's right out there not that far forget it okay okay welcome thank you for being here lots of resources today we've got questions all over the place we've got an r d lab set up you can see it right over my shoulder here and so we'll be migrating over there hopefully without any technical difficulties i think we'll do it it'll be good it'll be great great great hey by the way samuel gorton from ennisburg falls vermont vermont best bourbon yeah oh i re not to diss kentucky bourbons but vermont bourbons are really good samuel he won um uh what did he win t-shirt and some other goodies jared is saying here he won by doing one of our quizzes on linkedin so apparently we have quizzes on linkedin okay all right i wonder what we quizzed i don't know interesting i'll have to find that yeah hey congratulations samuel so check out the quizzes let me know how those are uh we do have live tours cbd jam sessions advanced extraction guides distillate guides calculators mini courses we've got all kinds of resources thank you for being here if this is the first time you're here there's a little red button on the top that will allow you to refresh the screen if for any reason you get frozen just hit refresh it doesn't take you out you don't have to relog in or anything that's really good uh this is a fun and safe place uh there are poll questions so i'm just going back to this bourbon question i think you know we should do a kentucky versus vermont bourbon smackdown oh that would be fun blind taste test i like get to it i do like that now i know you know vermont has some really good rye bourbons that's my preference i like rye bourbon so we'd have to kind of do wheat and rye okay all right that's fine and then do kind of two different flights yeah well that's gonna be a fun afternoon you know we were talking uh before about doing uh like a scotch tasting online yeah and it'd be kind of fun to fun to do that we should also do a scotch bourbon smackdown oh yeah well there's no there's no comparison i thought bourbon would obviously win we just noticed canadian whiskey didn't even make the but see a lot of the vermont rye comes from canadian rye no i like that that whiskers that you have wisers yeah wisers jp wisers uh is really good but that's a canadian whiskey it it is it but it is a bourbon but it comes via vermont it is really good but it is it is a canadian right anyway the more you drink the wiser you get all right we should probably not digress too much i guess what yeah we got a lot of ground recovery this is delta okay questions please introduce yourself um also ask questions no holds barred questions everything is going simple tough join the chat invite your friends there will be a replay there will be a replay there will be a replay all right um today's topic is everything delta eight yeah delta eight delta eight thc you know then you know we've all heard of you know what has happened with delta 9 delta 9 thc dhca we've got all that cbd a those are all kinds of things going pure thc so we've got a lot of things that we're going into on delta eight the questions are here and i'm guessing you have a presentation i do you have any tables i do he's got tables yes shocking i do i have a table and and okay so this is gonna be uh it's gonna be a lot of fun can we get going i think i think we have started okay you have it i thought we lost you there okay here's here's what happened okay so we went into like okay we're gonna make delta eight so we actually made our first delta eight this week kind of cool there's been a lot of buzz about it and uh so i spent monday in the laboratory and bam we got it with a little help from my friend uh shout out to jagger so thanks a lot for that he basically helped me along and i'm like oh do this do this okay whatever and so we're just going to kind of show you our results what we got how we did it it's pretty simple uh i was pretty shocked at how simple it was so i've got these like jager yeah all right not the mick oh that's the mc version different jagger okay let's uh so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go into just a little bit of the presentation and then uh we have a lab little lab set up rather than moving you know into the facility and having a gown up and everything it'd probably take five minutes to get it all done so i just brought the lab here into our studio and uh we'll just kind of i'll show you how i did it so i love that this is a picture uh whenever you say lab just so you know i always get a little worried because i i have this feeling that i'm going to be tasting something oh yes we okay i get a little nervous it just happened it's the anticipation yeah okay sorry go no no no i think we should okay everybody who thinks that we should have my friend randy here um to try out some of this beautiful oh delta eight do we have this that'll be fun because i've got meetings this afternoon do we have the puff bar where is the puff bar okay i i think jared had the puff part can we get that here just make sure i got it okay all right okay all right i don't even know what a puff oh okay okay oh shoot it said it was broke oh okay so okay whatever we we're we're probably not going to try on there maybe you dodged the bullet okay or whatever so look at this beautiful beautiful stuff usually it's it's like crystal white clear but jagger told me hey look uh it doesn't it people don't like to have it like super clear because it it like colorless okay because it doesn't look like real stuff so um if you you know if you process it it like gives you a nice yellow color and we got similar colors it was just a little darker because we didn't have time to distill it all so i'll but i'll show you what we got right over there awesome um so how do i advance this and while you're advancing bowden we agree nice bowden and jeff oh there we go nice okay so here's the outline i'm going to help you guys out because we've got a little bit of material to cover um tell you you know basically show you what delta 8 is from a chemical uh structure purpose i like that you use the delta sign rather than spelling it out that's that's pretty rad yeah you're you must be an analytical chemist phd um is is delta a a newly discovered cannabinoid oh it might work hold the phone what uh no okay so i'll just answer that in one question i won't work no okay uh how do i make delta eight okay we're going to go over that it's going to be pretty simple uh what equipment do i need to make delta eight how do i scale it up and how does delta a to thc affect me and is delta h thc illegal so there's a lot of material here to cover and plus i got a demo so i want to make sure we go quick pretty quick are you going to answer those last two questions before i taste it no all right here we go so oh wow guys this is this is like getting into some true chemistry okay this is great okay this is the structure chemical structure of cbd you can notice there's a couple different things uh that differentiated from thc which is right here you can see there's this there's this fused ring oxygen here right there and um yeah i think that that's basically it that's that's the main difference wow they're probably making some delta eight that's t-rex can you guys hear that okay all right so and then here's delta eight the main difference is that the location of this double bond here you can see that the delta eight and uh is over here it's switched sides it's switched sides right so there's really hardly any difference except for the location of the double bond but it is chemically distinct obviously okay so that's what delta eight thc is pretty simple i'm gonna keep this all really high level uh guys so we're not gonna go into very many details but a lot of people wanna know how to convert their cbd into this molecule and they want to know how to convert their thc that they maybe get out of a remediation process and convert that over to delta h so we're going to kind of go over those two two steps here um look at this okay this is a chromatogram this looks awesome what a chromatogram is is it's a separation technique and this is a hplc separation technique look at this green one right here this is my standard okay so here's um this is t uh cbda this is cbd and then this is cbn this is thc and this is cbc okay so those are my standards look how nice and clean they are they're all nicely separated from each other okay now look this this pink line here is actually some of the delta eight we made yesterday you can see that uh we have some little tiny bit of the probably some of the cbd here or i'm sorry some of the thc here you can see that but you can see there's all kinds of other stuff in there but this big lump here uh basically that's that's delta eight delta eight comes out right here in the in the chromatogram it's not just post thc it's just right after thc yeah so we're going to kind of go in about how to do that and then also we're going to kind of talk a little bit about these other minor products that are um that are produced and what they may be and what you need to know about it so is is is delta new is delta 8 a new phenomenon well it may be a new market phenomenon but it's not really new from the standpoint of people trying to make it out of cbd um this is a paper going back all the way to 1966. well i thought it was from 1400s this goes back all the way to 1481. it was the tetrahedon era yes that's great i'm sorry ah that's good i like that um okay so yeah 1966 so i was six years people have been talking about this um you know this is the machulum paper and he has tons of literature on there so um he was starting to do the same exact thing that i'm going to show you how to do basically you see you take cbd you put it into a vessel you boil it up with some this case he's using ethanol and hdl which is an acid um and it's it's an isomerization reaction that occurs he says it's a catalysis reaction and he does actually use catalysis okay um but uh there's evidence in his other papers that you don't actually have to use the catalytic materials and i'll go through what that is in just a moment but you can see he's using you know just normal chemistry techniques he's got some ether solution and uh yeah and then um he's drying it with some sodium sulfate so that's very very clear so it's really not um you can see it's it's not it's not new at all it's been around for a very very long time and all of the side reactions and side products they're kind of listed at them all in there but they're not um you know each each condition that you have might produce different uh reaction products so you're gonna have to know what those reaction products are before you sell your stuff or make it uh yeah you make it and then you characterize it and then you can sell it you don't want to sell something for example with a bunch of unknowns in it right no so that's that we talk about that all the time we do talk about that all the time and that that's one of the you know kind of the um techie type of bucket chemistry you go on to youtube you watch a video like this one try to go do it and then you try to use it you're you're basically creating um you know you got to look out for residuals number one and then you also got to look out for for other those other side reaction products that you don't know what's in there sure so this is another example of another paper um here he's using p p toluene sulfonic acid okay if you go online and you you read the techie blogs and stuff they're always talking about this a toluene sulfonyl acid right exactly um and you can see in this case it's two hours rather than 18 hours right so so they're using this as a lewis acid kind of catalyst it's in there at a catalytic amount meaning it's it's a very small amount um there was in this paper it just makes it go faster yeah they even talk about yeah it goes faster they even talk about the mechanisms in there if you guys want to go look at that knock yourself out you know um also other different types of uh you know derivatives of thc he's got a lot of a lot of uh you know papers on that i'm not gonna go through this but i'm i'm basically highlighting the fact that this is very old very well known there's you can see here he's using ethanol he's using hydrogen chloride for two hours he's got a different he's again boiling so you can you can kind of just precursor and read the literature and get an idea how to do this well use an acid use a maybe a lewis acid and you boil it up while stirring um and make sure that it's done in the hood so that it's not you know evolving you know evolving acid out into the air and make sure you're wearing gloves and good good ppe with your eyes and stuff so how to make delta hthc this is this is quite simple you dissolve yourself how to make delta eight thc you notice i'm in it the delta the black i did i like that and i even superscripted i did see that that now that is that is actually the way it's supposed to be if you look into all the literature that's the correct nomenclature delta to the eighth power yes i guess so so if you if you don't want to be an ignorant um no i can't what are you saying uh no this is how you normally would uh this is how i normally am is that what you're saying my big stop sign just came up don't say it don't say it okay hot mic i see i do have a filter okay so um rarely okay this so your first step is you dissolve cbd in non-polar organic solvent you can use a lot of different kinds of solvents i'll kind of go over in my table i'll show you some of the different options that you have so a non-polar organic solvent for people like me yeah it just means it's not cold [Laughter] it could be cold or hot but polar uh generally refers thank you for that joke i like that uh it just refers to its polarity so ethanol would be considered a polar solvent uh water would be considered a polar solvent but non-polar would be something like pentane or hexane or something like that just checking yep okay i got your back guys all right and then add uh add the acid whether it's lewis or bronsted-acid which is your acid okay hcl in the case of michelin he's using hdl use p he used the sulfonic acid right lewis branstad yeah yeah thank you sorry um and then um and then you stir in it's pretty critical that you get up to this uh you know 100 degrees celsius and i noticed i didn't superscript that sorry guys and then one to eight feet hours it depends so do you take turns stirring um yeah you know you get no we got a little star bar the stir bar stirs it's an automatic yeah it's an automatic stirrer yeah okay so and then you have a temperature uh hot plate so you can use a stirring hot plate for this and you can do it right on the bench um you know um and then and then basically there's some post-processing steps we tried different types of acids we tried acidic acid formic acid nitric acid we tried um you know like a solid support for the acid using a lewis acid like illumina for example just boiling up the acid in the alumina these are some things that i'll show you in the options it's no problem you get conversion with all of them it's just the fat matter of how fast it is and um how how quickly it goes how fast it is and then what the side products are so that's that's the main thing once you have obviously you have this acidic uh stuff over here um you're gonna have to dry it or neutralize it typically use a sodium bicarbonate you'll get you get two phases and then sometimes people extract with another polar non-volatile or volatile solvent like ether or something like that okay it is not out it's not necessary um you can just it'll wash out some of the color some of the products and things like that if you use a little bit of carbon in here you can also take out some of the color that you see you know in the first slide and then you obviously do testing so you're you're taking this pot right here that that is the stir and you're testing it and then making sure that after you wash it you know you're testing it again and you're testing it you're always testing it now this this final product is going to have delta 9 in it so you thought oh i'm going to use my isolate and go all the way to delta eight it'll be perfect well it's not really because you have to remediate it again right okay so now you're now you're back to thc remediation so and it's never you know it's not never so the conversion is not a hundred percent so you got to make sure that you realize that um actually i think i'm going to skip this this is my little video oh here i got a video here okay and this is my yesterday this is one of my reactions that i was doing this is 50 grams that looks like an automatic stirrer oh oh oh what in the heck okay i don't think it's working it's melting too much hcl and then something happened oh my gosh oh poor doug he's not with us anymore okay all right here i'm gonna i'm gonna go to the next one here and i'm gonna skip this one too because obviously our movies didn't work because i'll show you in real time that's better right yes okay so this is the sources of the raw materials you can use um a delta nine distillate um you know you want to make sure that it's not wind it's fully winterized distilled obviously um a lot of people like to use their isolate delta nine waist you know because you'll get delta nine uh out when you make your isolate cbd crystals okay and you'll have this delta nine and usually people just uh really get rid of it right um they can't sell it as a part of a hemp product obviously that's why they have they have that there so um that's the isolate way of using it um and probably what's gonna happen it's gonna be more complex because you're you know you'll have you'll be you'll be stirring with acid for basically everything right you're stirring it and then everything's reacting that's that's in that slough okay so it's kind of tough to identify what the products are the cleanest way to do it is just to use cbd isolate okay and that's something that you know a lot of people can do also this delta nine fraction would have essentially the same problems as this isolate delta nine waste but you can use this delta nine fraction convert it over to uh c are converted over to delta eight and then use the chromatography again to separate out the delta eight delta nine the stuff that hasn't converted over okay so it's it's pretty simple but again you would be using the same type of thing you'd use some sort of uh acid or lewis lewis acid along with a combination of an acid stirring in a non-polar solvent and you heat it up to 100 degrees to start that's it wow so it's pretty pretty simple um here's some examples of some acid washes and neutralizers that you guys now if you go look at the literature there's this boron trifluoride that's the um you know what mushulum calls a catalyst okay and it is a lewis acid catalyst and basically it's an electron vacuum cleaner it says okay i see electrons there i'm going to suck them up let's take out the electrons yeah that's right so that's all that's also the reason why alumina is is in this list here aluminum is also a lewis acid um and zirconia would work too um and then you have but you you typically would acid wash that so you can buy that all commercially you can acid wash alumina which is basically you're just you're just boiling alumina in in an acid drying it neutralizing the supernatant and then using it you know so that it's delivering the acid this is probably the easiest way to deal with um deal with the process because you're just dealing with a powder rather than a liquid and then you have this p toluene sulfonic acid alumina silicate washed acid and magnesium silicate washed acid uh these uh there's all of these reported in the literature and there's many more yeah like a lot so donald once donald that should answer your question if you've got more questions just let us right but i think that you know you can use um something as simple like we did we got conversion with just acetic acid yeah so we got conversion with hcl we form a gas so we got conversion it's just a matter of how long it took to get there so it's still still is converting gotcha um one thing about um acetic acid in formic acid is that they are soluble in your solvent uh in this case a heck uh alkane which would be heptane or pentane or whatever you guys are using there it would be soluble there so not all of these are soluble i don't know i don't think nitric acid is soluble in an alkane maybe someone can put that in there but i don't think it is but but certainly acetic acid is and you've got to use glacial by the way which is glacial acetic acid which is uh a very highly purified form of 100 and it'll go right into your hair sounds cold yes it's glacial into your polar solvent nonpolar solvent okay um okay so then you have your solvents obviously there have been reports i mean there's some solvents here that you just don't want to use or even have in your laboratory at all okay yeah don't don't don't bring benzene to your laboratory certainly they'll break toluene into your laboratory you know you can use some alkanes um the issue with the alkanes obviously just by the n alkanes which are the more purified form of alkanes you are going to have to worry about residuals okay yeah and because they will have them so when you um go to your laboratory to get your hplcs done to see how pure you are make sure you give a blank to them right any acid you use is going to have something that absorbs in the in the uv and it's going to show up there so i would also take and make sure that you're not just looking at one wavelength have them look at the entire spectrum meaning um have them do a scan from 220 nanometers all the way up into the visible like uh 300 and 350 nanometers okay what that's going to do is 20 to 350. yeah have them scan it they have a certain type of detector that they use for that and that'll allow you to identify if there's more issues associated with uh residuals and things like that so and we have we have several podcasts on you know just basically talking about residuals right we do and so you guys can go back we'll post them in the notes uh you guys can go back and take a look at that excellent um bronstead acids okay these are just acids and like i said we got conversion with just just a straight up acid we got conversion of combinations of acids i think you know in terms of the best one we just uh you know it was acetic acid um with this aluminum acid wash that's was the best one we just washed this uh aluminum acid in the acetic acid and then it worked out real good excellent so richard had a couple of good questions yeah this whole process that we're talking about is this an isomerization process isomerization isomerization yes yes that's that's correct that was close yes all right and then the other question he had a follow-up question is as we're using these does one methodology get a more consistent result than another um you know what i i can't say i have enough experience with it at the moment to really say okay hey this this is better than the other one we got like i said we got a conversion with any of these in it and if you just use these types of acids they're easy to remove um so when you scale up your process you need to think about a couple different things of course the cost of the process the cost of the consumables uh you're going to want to make sure that you have you know an easy way uh conversion wise so you don't have a lot of delta nine right because if you if you're just taking your cbd and you're converting it to delta eight but you have a bunch of delta nine there you're still not able to sell it right okay and that is unlawful that is exactly what happened in our case okay we had delta nine in there um which which then means you would have to um you would have to go and do some chromatography or thc remediation which should we have a another podcast on that you guys can go back and take a look we have a a whole podcast on separations and our pier 99 is a great way to do that absolutely so yeah so that's a couple different things there just so there's no real magic bullet you're always going to produce uh in a boiled acid reaction you're going to produce a whole bunch of different products there and you know you really should know what you're producing before you sell it and you should be my guest kind of have an idea what you're doing or it just sounds dangerous i already thought of that oh yeah look at that beware unknowns and residuals this would be the danger yeah it should be in red yeah okay so let's just kind of let's kind of talk this through guys okay if these are solid supports you you're gonna get residuals and leachables from those solid supports you need to make sure they're pure okay okay when you run your uh when you run your reaction you should run a blank reaction okay this this is just common knowledge you run a bank reaction you you work it up with not no active product and then you shoot it and see what you're you're producing see if you're extracting anything from those materials because not all the materials are equal okay i mean you you can go on to for example okay um a good example of that would be if i took the alkanes and i added you know like a luminol acid wash and i had some carbon in there and i boiled it up you would be extracting lots of benzopyrenes for example those are cancer-causing issues no who wouldn't know that that's what you do you would you would be doing that and the other problem with that obviously would be you if you didn't know what it was you wouldn't test for it you give your consumer i said say hell look at this it's all perfect it's good because you're not testing for it so yeah don't don't don't do that so don't don't be that guy don't be that guy okay same thing with yourself i'll come and bite you in the yeah you wanna you wanna okay i use distilled solvents or distill them you know and take all the water out of them and you can redistill them over like sodium metal is my favorite sodium metal yeah sodium metal i like that yeah with a little liquid nitrogen on the cool trap it sounds like that could be another music jam yeah we could sodium metal we got some sodium metal there okay um yeah it's a little sodium metal there yeah that's all right all right oh yeah yeah we got yeah that this is so this is this is just a little little break from the tables [Music] all right okay that was a little bumper music for the getting uh to the rest of the yes final one we do there will be a replay we have it recorded oh yeah fully fully fully no worries you think yeah okay whatever well eli almost beat me to it okay let's see here demand to see a chromatogram oh you know why i must have been a really good mood when i wrote this okay here's the deal like i can say look this stuff uh i can give you a chromatogram let me show you he's in a good mood right here look at this this is exactly what i'm talking about guys right here wow okay look at delta eight 95 percent oh wow what they didn't show you a chromatograph of all the other crap that was in there okay so you got five percent stuff that could kill you okay basically think about that and then you can see not tested for residual solvents how good is this stuff do you want to have this stuff i mean no way no you know what would be fun it would be fun to just do a show on reading coas yeah oh my gosh we could just do like 30 minutes of oh this is crap side commentary on coast everybody would hate me okay i gotta okay so then let me see here residuals may not be tested okay this is a good example demand to see a chromatogram number one what the heck is in there number two uh residuals may not be tested did they test for the unknowns did they test for the residuals and the leachables may be present those may be solid leachables okay in other words they may be ash content they may be they may be any number of cancer-causing you know residuals do not take a chance you guys got to know what you're doing okay so that's why i say we'll be smart we'll just some bucket chemistry here but just make sure be smart with it yeah and god i agree it's more sodium take a look at this so this is what i'm talking about you see all this stuff in here that we created so we took this beautiful beautiful uh standard it wasn't the standard it was just just beautiful pure cbd it was just this just this peak right here that was all you would see and then we made all that crap by by boiling it in acid okay and i was like wow well that's a lot of junk in there is like what is that oh well it's not even showing up you see it the times are not even showing up so we're not even identifying what the material is you see that so we just magically make it appear well through science yeah science and assets okay here we go this is what i'm talking about guys so so beware buyer beware number one consumer beware number two you got to know what you're doing number three uh it's not a magic bullet number four because you're going to be creating uh thc which is going to have another thc remediation process so this that's the realities of it but but but um uh this is the basic workflow for basically the conversion and once you come up with the right technique uh using the parameters that i've outlined for you and i told you what i thought worked best with the acetic acid and the alumina washed acid um here you have a reaction um this is this is basically just some timings when we did our work we did some timings to try to understand okay what would this look like in terms of you know is this a viable process from the standpoint of you know over uh overbearing amounts of of labor no the answer is no because most of it's machine time so you would just be you would put together a process where you do reaction neutralization solvent removal thc remediation and testing and of course you'd test at every one of these processes here but you want to put this together in a workflow where you didn't have inventory building up in between of course everybody's heard uh my to our talks on operational excellence you can go there's some stuff in the notes you should go take a look at it because it could save your business a lot of money absolutely just just spend an hour with me uh implement the value stream mapping tools understand where you know where your inventory is is falling and you can really save a lot of money and take money off your you know free up money from your balance sheet into cash absolutely that's converting yeah waste or inventory that's sitting there that you don't know what to do convert it into profit right we talk about that all the time yeah that's what we need to do exactly how do you remove cost and part of that is wasteful just sitting in inventory just an inventory you don't know what to do with right right and now convert that into something you can sell yes love it yes yes yes love it and i really appreciate you saying that we talked but it was it was your talk no we did we talked about it we did we did we did we did we did we did yes yes okay so here's the here's the uh workflow for cbd to delta a conversion and you know of course the the testing i would test at every one of these phases so here you of course you because i an analytical chemist of course i want a test tester is going to test the test is going to test yeah that's right we're going to do you got to say it right yeah here we got the reaction we're going to test that we're going to testify the neutralization in fact all the input materials have to be tested okay uh your cbd coming in your delta eight coming in whatever it is like you're gonna test you've got to test that you're gonna say everybody's contest okay you gotta test this me test you test okay we're all happy okay all right what equipment do i need you know a lot of people want to know that inquiring minds want to know oh yeah so um you need to have a stirred reactor with a heater condenser on it and i'll show you acquirer mines we want to have white film evaporator yes the way the only reason you need the white film evaporator is is to is to re reduce the color okay because if you really do it like at a really high temperature above 100 degrees okay you're going to get some really dark extracts i'll show you what that looks like did i bring some no i did not shoot what okay i didn't but i i got some really dark stuff yesterday and you know that might that might be good for a white film so if you have one of those laying around you should use it in this case um and then or you could do a short path too but i'm a known short path hater he is and that has come up several times yes short path later yeah i'm a hater on the short path but okay and then um preparative chromatography obviously um you know that's to get the delta eight delta nine out you know so um we're gonna do probably in a couple weeks maybe three four weeks among put that on our show list of doing a uh separation of delta eight delta nine um on with our p909 okay yeah i love it and then uh the uh hblc for analytical so just just let you know um this is what you the equipment that you pretty much have to have okay yes and heidi we're not trying to be testy what we're doing is we're trying to be a little bit quick so we can get to the lab he's so excited about getting to the lab i can't even tell it's like all this pent up energy okay he's just ready to go man and jason we'd love to do an article on oh yeah yeah we'll do an article how many articles do i i mean i feel like i haven't been writing you are quickly but you are quite prolific but but i haven't been writing a lot lately i know i have a slacker i have a big pile of papers april's got something that she's been working on tables oh jared's got that article you want okay here we go so how does the delta eight affect me okay look anybody can go on i need to study this hold on keep going anybody go online and find this information okay um there's i'm not telling you anything that's not readily available with just a simple google search um uh but um according to some of our actual uh user people that we have um okay uh lightly psychotropic lower potency than delta nine so it's going to have a lesser effect than delta nine um it does interact and metabolize in the same way so it goes it interacts with the same receptors in your body that delta 9 does which is really great so the kind of the mechanism of metabolism is known already and you know the quickest way to get the dose in is obviously an inhale inhalation it kind of bypasses the liver and all of that so um be very very careful obviously the same type of if you're taking it internally through the gut and um you know it'll eventually get to your brain but you in you know but you really need to um make sure you don't overdose okay so typically 10 milligrams per dose that's a that's a typical thc dose so um don't don't do any more than that yeah and we don't really talk about doses but that's about the range of what people yeah take yeah exactly so that's what you want to do there and then is it legal um there's been uh pretty cool we have let me see here oh yeah take a look this is a legal memo that just happened in wisconsin to this uh staff attorney to the yeah it's just a very month ago yeah recently and some people in the state wanted to know okay what the legality is um and this is from their representative and uh this this came from cush.com look at that that's funny but they they had reposted it um but you can see the short answer is that the substance meeting and definition of hemp is legal for purposes of state federal controlled substances laws regardless of its delta a thc concentration that is the beauty of it that's the official of it and that's pretty cool so um the same things you here's what you want to do if you're a hymn producer and you want to kind of get into this and take a look at it first of all avoid the states that are you know hemp is not you know uh looked on favorably or not legal okay oh idaho yes exactly i wasn't going to name the names but i wasn't either but i just was rooting for item that's all i love all their sports teams yes um and then avoid uh states where hemp derived oils are not accepted okay that's a good idea and then hemp drive oils oils are fit for commerce if they are derived from industrial hemp and have less than point three percent delta nine thc okay so um one of the things that i you know i was talking to our general counsel about this and we were just kind of going through some scenarios no we just kind of going through okay the scenario would be okay what if uh you know you have a you have a legally tethered product and then you put it out into the marketplace it has delta8 but it's derived from its derived and somehow you get busted yeah you're gonna have uh you you're gonna you know i don't know it it's gonna be a lot of money basically to uh you know to try to get out of that okay that it's legal yeah you're gonna have to especially with the chromatograms that i was showing you hang on let's go back up to that okay okay see this is so this thc if you have if you don't get a nice clear super separation right and uh you have a little bit of thc in there you don't really know how much it is okay that's something you need to think about so get all of your thc out if you're gonna do it just make sure you get all the thc up i don't know i'm the best thing i'm just cautioning people just don't bring your chromatograph with you whenever you use it well yeah just put it in the back of your car and then when you get stopped no no officer this is actually delta nine and see here's the vlog here you can just hand them that memo from the state of wisconsin here's my chromatograph and you can run it right there that's right yeah run it like yeah yeah that's that's weird okay anyway so that's uh that's that do you have a cup i can use [Laughter] how to measure delta eight okay guys this is really super simple delta a comes out right here here's thc intel day comes out right here so um this is a 70 uh 70 30 water group that's not a gradient it's just a isocratic phase i usually use point one uh formic acid in both of these phases you just run it straight out on a reverse phase column with hplc and it'll you'll get a separation so um and you'll be able to get more and more selectivity between the isomers of delta eight and delta nine um just by uh just by decreasing this amount so you go 60 but you see i was too impatient i actually want a two minute run instead of a four minute run i had to wait four minutes to get those results you were impatient oh man oh oh the other thing i want to tell you i can't even imagine okay you see this line right here okay there's a there's a huge peak that comes out like at minute 10 and a half okay really so i don't know what i have no idea i have no idea we're that means we're doing a field trip someday he's going to figure that out take a look at this guys i mean you just want to make sure that you have you understand what the unknowns are oh sure that's about it so okay um be smart i'm just going to show you a quick demo it's not going to be let's go um and then we can get into some of your questions and we can talk more about it but yeah we'll do a quick demo and show you how i did this all right oh my gosh this is awesome can you hear me okay yeah okay so this is like uh rogue rogue chemistry right can you guys get uh can you guys get a pan on this right here okay there we are okay there we are okay now we're cooking okay by the way this is a nice little piece of equipment um so this is one of the things you're going to need to do use for your little chemistry experiment here um this is called a uh well it's just a stir stir plate with a heater on it what's nice about this one is you can set the temperature that you want the process and it's got this little probe here okay and it's nice because it'll it'll always keep that temperature about what you want okay so here i have um cbd this is a isolate okay so i'm just gonna pour that in here this is exactly what i did guys it's not not very hard okay this is heptane so i just poured that heptane in there awesome okay i just splash around see look at that i'm going to start to uh yeah basically this is what i did super simple um this is some of my uh acid washed uh alumina that i did aluminium uh that i did right here so i would pour that in there and i'm putting it about about uh 14 to 20 by weight okay so uh yeah so just keep that in mind guys and then here i have a little acid uh little acid that i'm putting there okay and it's pretty good now this is not a volatile acid one thing is yeah which means is that we're not gonna we don't we can't actually smell it but obviously um you know if you're gonna use a volatile acid like acetic acid you're gonna heat it up to a hundred degrees celsius it's gonna come off so you're going to want to do this in a hood in a hood in the hood is where you're going to want to do this so and that's not wearing a hoodie no no that that is in like in a hood you know walk-in hood it's it's spinning yeah venting hood the venting hood okay so then all i do now is i as i change this here to 100 degrees watch out for that there here randy and i'm going to go ahead and do that i'm going to turn up this heat i'm going to turn this on like that it's at 100 degrees okay it's not going to heat up now i just set my timer for you know maybe three hours and then this will turn color like it'll turn this color in fact right here is that it yeah this is it i made this is yesterday you can see it's got um you see how it's it's kind of um it's got uh it's it's got a heptane in it so i haven't removed all the solvent from it yet but when you take the heptane out you need a rotavap or a fractron or something like that to do that then then then this stuff will all come to a like an oil so that's what that is so it's really simple guys but you're gonna get some delta nine in there and uh you know that's basically it notice it's got a little bit of yellow right there so that is it now i also showed you this once you remember i put that alumina in there so those are solid okay and you want to be able to basically filter all of that out so this is just a simple buchner funnel with a um you know with a vacuum on it and a sidearm so sidearm and then you have uh you have like a little adapter here this is a ceramic uh buchner funnel and then a filter paper okay if you were doing this at large scale of course you use a drain droid for that and then drain droid would be perfect for for that kind of purpose but um i think we got it i mean that's how simple it is guys it's really not really not that difficult and this is just to make a one-off batch make a one-off that's try it yeah you can send in the sample you can send the sample to us we'll run it for you um but but if you do that i'm gonna be looking for all of the uh unknowns i'm gonna tell you hey you got a lot of unknowns in there and things like that so that that's i'm gonna turn this off now and uh go back to our original position okay so um as we go through there sorry for that that was kind of fun actually we we had a little bit of a technical stuff uh here usually we do this right at the lab we were talking about doing it in in the lab itself um but here here here we are all right bam bam okay here we go all right so mike up hey okay now it's working i thought that was awesome oh yeah now and so this is a one-off uh and if somebody wanted to do this what would they how much would it cost us for that little setup there oh you got you got maybe uh 1200 he had the 1200 you got maybe one two three thousand three thousand bucks something like that three thousand dollars you can do some one-off yeah delta eight yeah if you're gonna you might have like a lot of people might have the um you know hot plate already they might have a vacuum pump already they might have a little bit and you can repurpose all that yeah right i think so so i i think that that's good what um if you want to do this at high scale at scale yeah do you have slides on that or is that something we can just talk about yeah we can just talk about that i mean oh okay so if you're gonna do um you know multi-kilos per time you're gonna need to have a large um you know reactor um which is a 50 liter reactor that's a stirred reactor that has a heater cooler on it okay and also uh has a um could you get that hooked up for him okay why are you worried about my arms no i just i just he's worried about me look at that first time for everything you know maybe we should get these things on a little a little stand that goes right here no these are more fun i don't know okay i was able to boom you i didn't i didn't hit you i thought about it but okay i didn't um yeah yeah so oh the acid is acetic acid guys uh that's a yep and uh no it wasn't sulfuric we didn't use any sulfuric acid in there at all yeah sulfuric is really dangerous by the way uh if one little splash in your eye you go blind seriously so be very careful with the uh sulfuric acid um yeah all right sorry he's remaking me yeah i'm i'm far away okay there we are oh and now i'm even further away awesome okay um so scale so if we wanted to scale this up yeah could you set this up as kind of a production yeah yeah so you could set it up as production um you'd have to have here's the workflow that i think you should have i mean you're going to have to have some sort of a solvent remover um you're going to have to have some sort of way to actually reactor so you'd you would never do a scale up like that you know you you know so you would want a host enclosed yeah you'd have a closed reactor um and if you're using solvents of course you have to have a enough um you have to have enough solvent there uh and you have to have a control area for that solvent along with you know approved containers improved storage and if you're going to use any type of motors any in there along with that it has to be a c1 d2 piece of equipment so you know doing it on the lab bench is great but for production purposes there are other requirements you need to be thinking about so you would you would need to have um you know probably a start a stirred reactor with an air motor or a inert gas motor um and then you'd have to have a heater cooler heater chiller on that okay um and you can buy those at a number of places we we uh we often quote those in a quote and patrick package um if you have uh for fractron you can use our fractron to do all the solvent removal um if you have some road of apps you're going to need to have at least a 50 liter road of app um and the reason i recommend to have multiple road of apps or a fractron uh simply because you're going to be trying to remove the solvent also you know and what's great about the fractron is it doesn't have it has two different types of falling film okay it has a packed bed fractional uh falling film and it has a tube and tube tube and shell falling film so you can actually isolate one of those uh vessels one of those uh you know falling film evaporators and just just circulate it in there if you want to use it for a single purpose so that it's super versatile guys very nice yeah so um that would be that and then you're gonna need to have some way to remove all of the um you know delta nine from your reaction pot right so that means uh you know some sort of chromatography or some sort of thc remediation um yeah something along those lines so and we have gone over the thc remediation there's there's lots of different ways to do it there's not just one way um you know you guys can choose a choose whatever it is but we can also put that together into a package for you um and uh you know you know see how that goes along with slps and and uh you know and then training and consulting to really make it happen so what we've talked about is being able to put together a kit for you on the smaller side so it would be a small batch kind of thing that you you can do um it'll be a little more than the three thousand dollar little lab thing that we have here because that's that's just a one-off that's really small so we talked about that but then on the large scale side if you really want to do delta eight you're going to need you know from our equipment side of it you're looking at the fractron you're looking at you know you you need solvent you need the heater and the chiller you need the pure 99 full chromatography and all of this can be repurposed for other uses post extraction right right right yeah that's right true yeah you would use it for other things as well you'd use it in your isolate process you would use it obviously in your winterization process so you're going to be using all that stuff anyway so yeah and then you know we would give you all of our processing methods as well as part of that um and you know we list on that if we were to sell that it's like just over a million dollars yeah that's what we do it's a pretty high throughput though yeah a very high throughput oh my gosh the fractron will do how much yeah so i mean you would have uh you would have a you'd be able to 20 you know deal with it like 20 gallons an hour yeah flow through right right but you'd be able to deal with it with a very low operational cost oh yeah because it's all automated and then the pure 99 you're we're looking at pure 99 pushing through how many liters an hour we're um well we're eight liters an hour or eight liters a minute sorry excuse me eight liters a minute yeah times that's times 60 okay that's a big number yeah eight liters a minute on chromatography that is full out optimized for thc remediation which is what you need for this and that's just post thc remediation right correct so you you run it you've got it um and that through that's a huge throughput so you can get you know delta eight at a high level what what is uh what is the market right now right now for delta eight you know what i i looked uh on a couple different websites and um it was wildly varying um you know when we we looked at some of the delta eight we bought some delta eight and um you know wasn't it has i think a lot of those other things that you see in the um you know chromatogram those are they have they affect the aroma and the flavor so my view of the delta eight is that it has a definitely has to be formulated okay you're just going to put in straight up delta 8. well i don't know if you really want to do that because it's not not going to taste very good and um you know and or have no taste at all i mean you know most people want to enjoy the flavor and aroma right um in order to uh in order to really enjoy it so that that's uh yeah so i don't know what the what the price is but i think it's it's well it's it's a lot yeah i've heard ten dollars a gram that's what i heard you're higher than that so yeah but that's that's a lot of that's a lot of coin so there's a way there are ways to do that and you know for that we're actually doing a special right now rather than one million five thousand dollars we're going to do we're we'll actually give knock 20 off of that so show special 799 000. wow but you have to put in the code yes what's the code dr john rocks okay all right i think that's a wrap and as an alternate the other is a delta 8 lab so you can use dr john rox or delta 8 lab i use that code and will actually even do that for you if you're on and you want it even better yeah we'll even give an extra five percent for the first three that sounds like a good one yeah so we could put that together for you and uh you know basically gave you everything you need with a little sheet here's how you do it and and uh we if you send the test into us we can we can actually test it for you so and we're we do this all the time so that's this is our world and we want to make sure we've got that for you and then we're going to put this other kit together um and so we'll put we'll post that somewhere i don't know where we would post that uh i think we're going to we have a store we have store link that we can put on we'll put a smaller kit together for you know the small batch as well but uh if you need something then go on our website we've got our bot and you can try to stump our bot the bot is the bot rocks spot rocks that's pretty good i like it and just ask the questions and then you'll either get a call from myself or elijah or q or manual or whatever we can and we can answer more questions for you on the equipment itself uh but you know this works for any extract if you're a processor right now let's let's go we can talk about this all of our gear will interface we're co2 on our extraction side but we have we're selling our fractrons and our clear stills and our pure 99s to ethanol processors all day every day yeah um and the drain droids i mean they're yeah it's all going dry and fractron so anyway this was a phenomenal show lots of tables chromatographs chromatographs chromatographs yeah i love that we went through it so so this is good and i don't think anyone else i think did we did we win a prize because i don't think there's another webinar you guys have sat on where there's a million dollar offering did we do it we have never we have never done that actually we've never and we don't usually do that but this is kind of a one-off thing we don't like to push our product but we we did want to give you a special for being here and that's where we're at sounds good so didn't mean to uh oversell but this was awesome there will be a replay and this was predominantly education that's what we like to do yeah and we love being here because we like to hear your questions we love to interface with you that's what we want to do and again congratulations to samuel gorton ennisburg falls vermont uh king of bourbons thank you and i know uh did you see bowdoin and jeff chime saying yes vermont i saw that and i wasn't sure you know yes oh that's right that's what's this you said visser's comes via vermont how does that work why is there native wisers yeah they're their neighbors it works it's good canadian rye is really good that's okay anyway that it is good um delta eight delta a thc we worked we talked about all of these we talked about lists of compounds cannabis components cannabidolic acid we there's a lot of things that we talked about that i have no idea how to pronounce isomerization yeah yes richard thank you for popping that into me i i did it and i was correct we have a lot of chemists who uh come to our podcast yeah we do chemists investors farmers processors we i just we really appreciate you we really appreciate your questions and just keep bringing them in always ask your questions we convert those into faqs all the time live tour cbd jam sessions we've got our calculators use them talk to us uh we answered a lot of stuff here this is really this was good we need to put together as uh like a conversion calculator first delta eight we'll work on that one yeah it's it's just kind of thinking out loud but we'll do that oh sure awesome thank you for being here we really appreciate you we went a couple over a couple minutes over um but thank you and uh sorry if this seemed a little hurried but we wanted to get through all of that for you today so thank you for being here and we'll see you next time thank you take care good job you", "vvOrD3iny_8": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another delta 8 video uh this is another delta 8 hemp video i actually completely forgot i still had tincture i still had another one of these products to make a video on and uh what better way to have some apple juice but these are tinctures and with tinctures they actually are droppers or like you basically put it underneath the tongue and let it absorb into your system but i've seen people put it in drinks as well and i'm very fortunate enough to have the pineapple express one if you can tell from the intro uh it also says the amount per serving is 30 30 drop wait serving size 30 drops wait serving per container 30. okay so those 900 drops is what they're saying and then one serving which is 30 drops is 33 milligrams of delta athc so yeah let's see this i've only tried a few tinctures and they're mostly very i would say it's a very alcoholic taste because i believe there's like i don't know was it glycerin i don't even know what it was in there but i'm sure there was alcohol in the last tincture i tried definitely was not good at all so we're just gonna open this oh it shows okay so this is at about 75 milligrams i'm smelling it smells really nice so 75 one milliliter is 30 drops so we're at 75 so that should be about should be about 22.5 milligrams all right 22.5 milligrams here we go kind of tasted like bubblegum it's a very minimal taste at best but since it's the only thing i put in my mouth like i can taste it but like if i were to put it in this i feel like i wouldn't taste it but we're gonna do that um but no not bad i was honestly expecting a much worse taste so let's do another let's do another 75 in here so obviously the effects aren't gonna [ __ ] just immediately take over you know so i will be filming again in about an hour or so uh but yes i wanted to get a shot of me pouring this in here how many shots let's see seventy-five another 75 [ __ ] it we'll do another 75 all right so how many was that so that's about 70 milligrams of delta eight thc in there i think i did over 100 plus milligrams on this stuff so i'm excited to see oh [ __ ] you can see it's just is that chill in there what the [ __ ] so just like that's crazy there's like a layer on top yeah i drink mostly it well that tastes like pineapple and apple now pineapple and apple juice that's crazy good so i'm gonna get back to you in about 30 or 45 minutes to an hour i do have a fast metabolism so it might be a little bit quicker than that but overall you know another good way to take delta athc you know there's gummies there's actually dabbing it there's cartridges and now there's tinctures as well and for those of you who you know i think i feel like like some people don't like to um medicate you like normally you know smoking flower or vaping or dabbing or anything and they want more of a i wouldn't say a better way but a more i don't know how to say it but it's just you know you just put it underneath the tongue and you go about your day that's about it you know what i'm saying and uh you you set it in your mouth and you forget it basically but other than that yes i will be filming or i will get back to you in about an hour or so so [Music] all right guys so i am back uh it's been about 45 minutes i mean i do feel somewhat of a buzz but i honestly feel like what i take like 100 milligrams i think my tolerance is a little bit higher than that but i definitely do feel it i definitely feel it around the eyes and everything um as far as like the drink goes i drank most of it because it tastes like just apple juice now and uh as you've seen from the earlier clip it was just sitting on top i mean yeah it's still it just tastes like apple juice but you can still put some of this in here [ __ ] it so we're gonna end it off i'm gonna take some more but i definitely do feel it and for how little i took you know i didn't take that much i took like what 80 milligrams or something or so [Music] okay i'm gonna take some more real quick before i end it off but i definitely do feel a head change oh but yes uh definitely i would i would definitely recommend it for the people that um don't want to smoke or vape or dab or eat edibles because you know that's a lot of uh sugar you know all those gummies like that one video i did recently there's a lot of a lot of [ __ ] sugar especially in the morning but this is a more subtle way of dosing and uh and yeah it's just a great way to to get some delta into your system and it's legal link will be in the comments below if you're interested but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this video cheers to some regular apple juice i mean there's a slight pineapple but not as strong as it was when i just put it in there but yeah hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] do [Music] you", "2mPgN8FttQE": "hi I'm drew owner of connoisseur concentrates and I'm Kendall logistics coordinator at connoisseur concentrates today we're going to be explaining our solution sample pack what comes in it and how to correctly use it connoisseur concentrates has created an all-natural terpene blend solution that can be used with any extract to turn it into a liquid to be used in any vapor pen without the need for PG VG or P eg our solution is geared to industrial manufacturers of vapor pens dispensaries and people's wishing to start their own company manufacturing vapor pens our sample pack is a great inexpensive way for you to try a few flavors and see what you like before committing to some of our larger sizes our sample packs include three different flavors of our solution with 0.6 grams in each file it also has three disposable vapor pins which match each flavor it also has a mixing vial an eyedropper to fill your pens more easily we found that you only need about a half a gram of the solution to turn any extract into a liquid for a vapor pen it depends on how hard you're starting extract is and how soft you want your ending viscosity to be depending on what type of vapor pen you're using so for a hard shatter normally use about a half a gram if you're starting out with a softer oil sometimes you can use a quarter gram and depending on how soft your oil is for co2 extracts you may only need a few drops to start you take the mixing vial that was included in your sample pack put it on your scale and tear it out then you add one gram of your extract into the mixing vial once you have your extract weighed out it's time to add your solution you may notice depending on what flavor you pick that your solution is separated which is perfectly normal it's a variation between the terpenes and the flavouring and once you mix it in with your extract it's going to stay blend it and not separate again so go ahead and shake up your bottle a little bit open it up and you're going to want to add approximately 0.3 to 0.5 grams and it's really going to depend on what type of extract that you started with again if you started with something hard like shatter go ahead and add a half a gram and if you started with something pretty runny and start out with the third of a gram you can always add more it's a little harder to add less once you've added your solution to your extract it's time to blend the two together you have a couple different options of doing this normally what we do is we just heat it up a little bit with the lighter in your sample file and it's going to mix in real nicely it takes about 30 seconds of blending and then you're all done we all know that heating your extract and darken it so there's a couple different options if you're really interested in art darkening your oil at all you can let it sit overnight or sit there and start for awhile with no heat and it's going to blend in together if you just want to get it done heat it up just a little bit and it's going to blend in real quickly although you may just get a shade darker for today's purposes I'm going to go ahead and heat it up with the lighter and let you see what it looks like when you blend it using just a normal flame what we recommend is that you heat the solution with the lighter just until it starts to boil you'll see it bubbling just a little bit it's already hot at that point you don't need to heat it any more then you take your stirrer rod and start blending the two together it's very simply it's important to note that it may not blend in the first five seconds sometimes you got to take 30 seconds to blame if you're in a rush you can heat it a little more but a little patience is a helpful here if you're trying to retain your color that heat is enough to blend most things and simply stirring it for 20 or 30 seconds is good if you notice it's not fully blended or it's not the way that you like it just add a little bit more heat to it and continue to stir and it will blend right up for you if you're making see-through vapor pens like the 5-10 styles and color is extremely important you just let it sit overnight if you let it sit with no heat it's going to dissolve and blend on its own you're not going to lose any coloring and it's going to work perfectly if you're feeling the burner included in the sample pack you're going to notice that there's a small white tube on the inside of the burner make sure that your liquid does not go in that tube that's an air return - there's a sponge on the exterior of that tube that's where you're going to want to put your liquid make sure not to overfill your burner you only want to put a half a gram you want to make sure that the liquid gets all the way absorbed into the sponge or it's going to leak out at the top remember it holds about 1/2 of a gram which is about one inch up from the bottom of your eyedropper once your sponge is fully saturated with liquid we've included some tops for your pens go ahead and put your top on and then you're ready to go each pen is rated for about 400 puffs which means that it's realistically going to hold one half gram you'll go all the way through it you may be able to fill it one more time but it's really only rated for one use but if the battery lasts go ahead and give it a try remember that our disposable pans are simply that they're just there in case you don't have your own vapor pen it's not going to replace one of the really cool vapor pens that you can buy at the store feel free to get any vapor pen you want they work well in any vapor pen but in case you don't have one and you don't really want to run out to the store and commit to that we've just included some inexpensive ones in the kit so that you have something to sample without having to run all over the place once you've had a chance to play around with our sample pack and find out if this product works for you contact us we have larger options for the solution we've also got some good options on all the disposable pens we have a good line the 510 pens any hardware you need let us know we also have some solutions for filling bottling and any size scale we can comment thank you for watching our video we hope you enjoy your sample pack please write us a review and let us know what you think and for larger applications be sure to check out our both mixing instructions see you soon", "nmdCws_tVX0": "welcome welcome thank you for being here I'm Bob Jackson and today we are talking about Oh cheer up it's it's it's innovative I promise can't wait to hear what's changed so this is the Smok RPM 80 pro they did make a regular edition of the Smok RPM 80 the only difference being one takes an external battery one has an internal battery we went with the pro edition for the external battery because we want a true 3000 mAh and we're professionals yeah naturally even though they claim that the original version has a 3000 mAh battery in it I just wanted to go with the external battery so this despite being a pod device is not a Salt Lick device this thing goes up to 80 watts yep they have released a new coil that goes up to 80 watts that 40 to 80 coil yes that would be the rgc co nickel mesh 0.17 ohm coil now if you've watched my other videos which you should have but you should the conical coil is actually from next mesh yep so it was in the ROFR f the profile of unity the profile you may be RTA all that good stuff all had the next mesh mesh mesh in it so I mean that that's something that's huge the next match was like the best flavor you could get out of a mesh coil and smoke is not known for their flavor so at least I hate at least they're partnering up they know I good at there know what they're bad I completely maybe they could make something you got it so I tried this thing out yes Bob did I I got it's not a Salt Lick device I put my freebase juice in there I put as always honeydew very Kiwi with mint and I ran this thing with the new coil because we've already talked about the old coil the RPM coil it does in fact use the RPM coil yes but it has a new coil this oh wow it's the device look at that is that a tablet device - so yes this is the stab wood coloring no it is not a stab with the place it's just a sticker yes I mean if it was us that an actual stab wood device it would cost a lot more yeah I get that but red stabilizing wood there's no wood there's red but there's no wood yeah it looks like it until you touch it yeah and peel it off it is just a sticker unfortunately mm-hmm like I said if it was actual stab wood it would be like triple the price right which is which is fair to stabilize wood looks phenomenal feels phenomenal but if you're not gonna do it then don't don't do it they did it on their Nords as well yeah but that's it's also like just taking a Ferrari sticker and putting it on your Honda so it doesn't make it Ferrari no but it looks cool sure from a distance you can pass that off yeah okay as for the actual device it should all be familiar here we've done the RPM reviews it's the exact same setup I think the only thing is is when you go to cycle through the color change by holding the fire yes it does it single we were another one you could just keep spamming it and it will cycle through all of them this one it's just like red stop blue stop nice stop so this device does go from five to 80 watts Wow is it round over it does so once you get up to 80 watts if you press the button once more it will actually round over to one watt you look at that so if you hold it down it does move pretty quickly which is nice it's 80 it will not roll over on its own you have to press the button one more time and same thing to go back so I have been running this thing with the new coil in it the conical the conical coil I have been running it at about 65 watts I got upand sighs oh this is important what a tease this is important the pod size the pod actually holds 4.3 I think it differs between the two because it once again there are two different pods I am a straight-up liar both 5 mils 5 mils okay so it is a 5 milliliter pod I was running it at 65 watts my single 18 650 battery died after 2 pod refills so I got through two entire pods at 65 watts so 10 mils on one single battery charge okay so I changed out my battery okay I went through two more full pods and I can definitely tell the coil is on its way up really yes so not even a day because I know you I did that in a day but we're talking 20 milliliters on a single coil and I mean it is not horrible like I can still it's still tolerable but the the next mash flavour that is typically there with these devices yeah it's gone after four refills you're also let's be fair you're using a mint juice I am which will make it last a little longer very minty juice and you are one to run your coils until they are the carbonized yes so it's not that bad though I promise you what really not that bad what about dry hands okay so we filled this thing we were together I did not prime the coil but we put it in we filled the pod and we let it sit for probably fifteen or twenty minutes I'd say was it almost 25 30 minutes without the whole YouTube video yeah and then you try and then I tried it and even after letting it sit for that long my first four pulls on it we're completely cotton mmm like they did not absorb at all so I'm thinking you definitely have to prime these coils okay like if there's no longer little pod devices like you actually have to just like if you had a tank get in there prime your coil make sure it's soaked in do a couple of like non-fire polls on it make sure it's actually juiced well because it will not absorb otherwise so to use the next mesh but not the next mesh cause you're probably yeah yeah so yeah that's that's my take away from the device the battery door on the bottom here it is just on a little flap yeah yeah it is just a little hinge Wiggles back and forth okay we remember this from a lot of their other devices okay yeah and it just it goes in and slides locked so that's the battery door I know it's not the best airflow on this guy they've got one airflow at the back one airflow at the front okay just above the fire button so I did not have any issues it is a large enough device that even my big gorilla hands can hold it without blocking the airflow which is awesome it is still standard 5 flicks on 5 flicks off just like the RPM 3 clicks lock the fire button you can adjust your colors all that good stuff luck your wattage with the up and down at the same time it's got it all just like the RPM the pod on this thing it is a top fill pod Wow which is great because what was the last one we reviewed with the top no no with the bottom fill remember that one the fetch yes yeah the schmuck fetch with the bottom fill pod so this guy's got a top Philpot actually again with my big ass gorilla hands very easy to open a little hatch their substantial filling hole it was very easy to fill no bubbling back nothing like that pod just snaps up I was look push the back of it comes off it is in there with magnets little magnets down there two of them holding that view yep I didn't have any issues with them falling up by any means the bottom of the pod even after a week of use still dry Wow not a drop of juice which is amazing shocking like very they coil is still a pushing coil nice so just like all their other devices now and is a pushing and pulling oil with the two flat edges now is that is that airflow on the bottom it is that's something you don't even notice there buddy boy silver ring here she turns it's hard to see cuz my fat fingers turn so you can have your airflow opening closed here draw that did you just close it right on nope okay I'm looking at right I'll try it's almost Christ okay okay I'm trying I'm trying it goes back dave says it's a new pod awesome that is a much tighter draw ah and it's nice because you can see the silver yeah so where the air hole is in the front there you can actually see that it's closed off okay very nice so that means it's only getting through the one end absolutely so it is USB to micro USB charging okay just port right in the front yeah easy peasy oh is it like this one yeah like that one you didn't want to go through the box I really didn't want to go through you know what their their devices may be innovating but the packaging is all the same your battery safety because this one does take the external it's gonna give you that as well how to play what am i playing ooh five thousand US dollars scratched win we gonna win live on camera what I don't know second prize is an RPM kit 80 kit in an RPM Pro kit and third prize is a t-shirt and a hat doesn't say where it's available we got Europe hotline USA hotline and all other regions hotline I wonder if we're inclusive in that but I don't know cheese I'll take me Oh take me two seconds buddy here okay well he's checking if we wanna do t-shirt I assure you so this is the lucky spot that you get with the device it is pre-installed with the coil all that good stuff I mean we know hookean we've done reviews with the RPM thority with all that stuff we know how it works it works basically the same as the other one this one's just much higher wattage and of course there's the instruction manual in there oh wait lucky draw you country you can't participate okay so navigate to the website fr is my trolley putting you a little code and see hey I didn't get anything no keep it going I didn't get to hit enter just said sorry you didn't win a prize at least that is kind of cool I've never seen a company give you a little something to win probably now this other pod I did check no adjustable air flow so it is only that our GC coil that has the adjustability yes sadface it happens I mean none of the Nord products have really had adjustability so why would they start with this one oh let's be honest I was last time Smok did do adjustability I don't know yeah yeah all right moving on question for you Bob yes with that battery door being hinged on one hinge yes how many drops do you think that'll take less than ten more than two are you a betting man yes it's it's just a simple one huge battery door don't drop it you know you're talking yeah this is why I tested this device yeah you do wanted to put stress test on it to correct so leave your thoughts what are you thinking do you like it is it innovative I mean it's not that innovative it's not it's it's the RPM 80 it's it's an up size rpm 40 with higher wattage but it's it's not meant for salts no definitely not when they're sub ohm coils it's a 80 watt device if you really wanted to run it at 80 like yeah I wouldn't recommend it I did mine at 65 I still went through a coil and for Phil's 20 mils which is how long for ya for me that was about six hours but for the average user that could be a lot longer should be a lot longer should be should be it is Smok so not only do they kind of burn out within let's say 12 hours right car 12 hours your coils burn yeah open the pack up it's a dud coil open another one up dry heads yeah yeah yeah okay whatever I do like how they pair with neck smash at least they are trying new things yeah oh just try more try harder I've been duped by too many small coils to be in love with them I you know I used to have all the TFE 12 about all of them one of every color yeah and every pack of coils one wouldn't work no effort it's helped by this four cell that is true so I got a little bit of a a bit of a grape with a smile but if you're a fan of the RPM 40 you're looking for something a little more powerful yeah if you want to get back into freebase juice save yourself a little a little little money compared to the Salt Lick and lower your nicotine intake yeah absolutely that one is nice I suppose because you can click the arc in coil and if you like the coil having a removable battery is extremely handy so you're gonna pop that sucker out and pop a new one in you don't have to wait because it's a fast charge 1500 mAh for their PM 40 but that would still take two plus hours yes so yeah that is at least nice but at the same time and you do pick up one of those you're gonna need a battery if no spare battery as well as a charger ideally yes because we all know they also offered it in the internal battery version correct which would just be sad kind of 80 Watts internal battery yeah that's a member and if you had that 80 watt internal battery yeah you would get an hour and a half out of it that's it and then you have to wait so I mean at least you would have been able to elongate the coil life without it because you wouldn't be able to use it fair enough that's all fair enough all I gotta say color options ooh-la color option like there's seven seven color options I think there's both so far three or four stab wood designs yeah yeah well I'll show them somewhere on the screen of course but yeah I think that's it III I got nothing else to say about it it was creative one drop on it just one just from what is that three feet and then we're gonna have to move the camera get a clear shot of it landing no don't believe us here I'll use my phone I'll get the under angle you know it'll break hold on hold on yeah uh you know three watch your toes - oh wow she attacked the battery got friendly came out yeah we had a little little yard sale there any of the pins break wow that's pretty good I said too good time everybody gets one is that as easy as it was to push them before yeah okay still good all right battery latches all right turns on screen shot it's survived well let's scratch on it I mean it is a metal housing so that helps hmm right I mean you'd have to hit the battery door pretty much right on the edge of the or watch or if you got the hinge like the partner yeah the perfect place yeah but you're more you're more than likely to break the pod before you break the device I agree all right all righty so that's gonna do it for this video cool you're gonna use that as your new daily Bob no I'd have to open up a second vape shop just to afford to be able to buy all those cool yeah still working all right it's good for some people is probably not great for everybody like I said we it is not a salt Nick device unless you're in singing and you want to run salt Nick at 65 watts or higher it's pretty metal yeah yeah that's pretty hardcore but if you you've used the RPM 40 if you've gotten your hands on the RPM 80 leave some

the next one bye", "Agm6GR8hhaY": "what's good vaping and CV squad so I've had a lot of Commons questions on this and I've seen a couple videos on it but for anyone that doesn't really venture out to any other channels or anything I just want to post this for you guys to show you this so the first thing I wanted to show you is actually an easy way to open these guys I know these bottles can be very hard to open and as you see these bottles do have seals around it see one right there see one right there there's a third fourth and the fifth one I actually already broke but if you were to have just a simple flat head and I've seen people do this multiple ways they can do it with the credit card they can do it with a whole bunch of different ways but you just want to stick your screwdriver or whatever it is right in on that seal sorry that you're seeing the [ __ ] crap there was using this screwdriver to dab with believe it or not and do the same thing on each one just be careful that you're just breaking the seal they're really easy to break and then you're not cutting yourself and once you do have all the seals broken I'll show you how much easier it is to get this [ __ ] open seal put a break broke broke and here I'm crack just like that so now push down to get it off it makes a little easier does it make you crazy a lot easier but it does make it easier it's not gonna make it super simple now the other thing I wanted to address is on these bottles and stuff if you notice they always get juice caught in the tip and you could turn over the bottle and sometimes juice will come Vulcano like squirting out of the tip just like that just from the air pressure that's in there but will make it come squirting out and shout out to a rod who showed me how to fix this problem so the reason why it's doing that is from the air pressure build up that's in the bottle and there's trying to escape and the tip so small it's got to push out the juice first so if you do have quote master building kit version 3 then come with these nice little they're like tweezers but they're these a very fine tip they almost have like a cone shape to them they start out small and then they get bigger as it goes up you literally just push that I'm going to show you right here in there see me get it in I push it all the way down into the tip I'm gonna rotate it around just like that to really get the tip to widen out you can push down in a little bit more if you want damn and that's actually gonna win the tip enough for you that you can almost see down in there and it's not going to have juice always squirting out make sure to do that one more time that's really good in there I'll really push it in I'm really widen it out so I don't want to waste any of the [ __ ] juice I'm buying and I'm pretty sure y'all feel the same way you guys don't want to spend you know and I mean 20 bucks on a bottle of juice that's one of your favorite juices to vape and it's going everywhere wasting leaking out because these bottles say well you'll notice the juice will build up here on top over time just from its squirting out and stuff so I just wanted to show you guys those two little trick shout out to a rod for showing me that last one um I greatly appreciate that bro you teach me that little trick now the tips wide enough that it will be able to instead suck air back in through the top without it having to push out your juice first and wasting it so just want to show you guys that really quick don't waste any more of your time he'd shot at you guys for watching and stuff like I said you're just gonna need something like with this fine tip to be able to push down into the bottle and move it around you don't necessarily have to use this tool but if you do have one of these building kits on hand you probably already have one of these if you have that I think this is the version three for the coil master but uh thanks for watching guys huge shout out to all you Christie's all you babes squad members and I will see you guys in another video", "xCcf04PqrxQ": "is of you guys sounds like it excited oh yes okay so I picked up from the shop okay so I picked up

it yeah hi guys this dizzy is really cute and just portable right yeah you know ooh you hear that see you can't say look look oh nothing", "Jvg_QR6ao2w": "hey guys I have just bought a load of 13 for me one from place called terpenes UK terpenes UK and they have a couple of brands they work with as well on website I've got like one from each of the brands one of the staff picks and then I bought a few more from the actual main supplier which is the terpenes UK brand itself yeah I thought I'd make this video to see what they will smell like and I haven't smoked any of them I literally just opened this about 10 minutes ago and I'm quite excited to some otherwise you can see a foot quite a few in there so yeah guys the first one is going to be dosa dose and what I plan to do these to make some fake juice I got some THC distillate and I'd like to mix these in so if anyone's body tips the best way to do that to mix to make tea THC just looked into some vape juice I mean I've got propylene glycol vegetable glycerin this if I could do it with just those ingredients I'll be great I do have some EJ mix on the way but I'd rather be able to do with just vegetable glycerin impossible so yeah onto the first one dose he does oh wow okay that smells lovely smells absolutely fantastic it kind of smells like sniffing a bag of hair about all-stars in fact that's exactly what it smells like doesn't smell like weed at all I mean maybe right in the background some of this same smell of weed that is the only smell that's not Haribo all-stars and yeah if you're looking for something that's deliciously tasty then go ahead I'm here for something that smells like weed to be completely honest so yes decent and just let you know though this is how the packaging comes so it comes a little oil when we pack it and get a dropper in there I believe this is the sample if you all go it's quite a hard website to navigate so if you go down to the bottom of the page it'll they've got like packs where you can buy like five half a milliliter vials for 25 pounds or something and then you can occupy like the one milliliters eat for like a 10 or 15 or 13 heading which supplier already open this one and smell it yet but if you it off as a first when I looked at [Applause] this is monster cookies and once the cookies focus I believe this is from the yeah Japanese you can oh okay that's an mm it's got her that's really nice it kind of some reason reminds me of IKEA I'm not sure what relevance that has and it's kind of a blueberry ish smell it's a very complex smell there's lots of things going on with that again I don't know if any of that what's going on with that is we'd smell but that smells really complex maybe a bit of cheese like as in the strain kind of one of those inflatable plastic balls used to get them the big pits in sport soccer world and places like that I bear that smell as well and yeah that's nice again not all weeds smell but I mean if you're not looking for a weed smell then I suppose we're in two entirely different categories right here yeah that's good for it was granddaddy purple and this one is yes some some tappings UK as well this is another half millimeter vial Oh tough to get off that one yeah hmm you kind of smell the orange and I can't kind of smells like a Baraka you know put the book on the drink is fizzing up it's sparkling everywhere there's that weird kind of chalky orange taste yeah I smell that hmm no it's my granddaddy purple that smelled like that okay yes so far as a three and none of them are smart like weed really remotely I think it got about 10 in here so we'll carry on skills our kids are cool story I had some some dabs of this the other day my friend bought a couple of grams of this and this was clearly the nicest but and one thing I will say is the skills dabbled that we had smelt like Mandarin like straight-up they just smell like a citrus orange e fruit so I don't expect this obviously to smell like weed so I'm kind of interested this one considering I had it just so recently and it skitters and that's a given tough you Oh this has got a very very strange father a kind of a stringent again it's got that horrible all stars mix much much more faint than the dose you know whoever it was that had the hammer this has kind of got like a chemical smell right maybe a petrol smell with a bit of that harbour again I mean there's not much Mandarin in there which I thought that was going to be coming through I don't I could have been I was obviously we live in the illegal black market there's no way I know that why I actually smoked as skills dabs was actually skills at all so I don't know leave a comment in the bottom of the comment section last one if I were you think skills because one I swear down it was no different to just smelling a peeled Mandarin there was there was no other kind of smell going on Blue Dream yeah blue drink this is another one from turf games UK flash it I teased it to the camera so I can't bring back that kind of blue dream yeah now I've smoked blue dream before not extensively but it's motive quite there so it's got one of those old classic strains yeah smell mmm don't even really like that you know again it's just more that what's becoming quite similar now like a similar chemical smell actually this one's mild and mild I mean I I don't think this is that bad but it's just becoming quite similar which is fine to worry me and I don't read much to say about that flu dream really it was unoffensive it's nice okay oh this this is such a big man with me I'm gonna wave it this is the one I kind of went there for and end up buying like [ __ ] a hundred pounds worth of terpenes this is why I went there for blue cheese and this is not from the terpenes okay so you know we ended that one last glass with egg on there for me Harlequin okay so this is this is not a turkey in UK once I know I'm interested this is real it my fire and so I'll pop this open shut up okay Harley Quinn yeah this is from a company called m/v near body polish hmm I don't know man like I just Mo's like it's a chlorine I just love that same pool with a background of that strange chemical smell that is a bit petrol II but I paint thinner I guess I've been a lying press kinda disappointed I mean you know I thought if I bought a hundred pounds worth of one milliliter bottles per feed which is liable I know we can count this up at the end but it's probably about like eight different perfumes I thought I'd find one that smell like wheat and in fact the guy I contacted there the person who runs his company directly I left them why still no text message just saying have you got discount code essentially i'm buying quite a lot I'm a first time you know journey discount codes available they'll let you know we'll throw one in for you and then they advise me basically to get rid of some and to change them out I give them what I wanted I said I want weed flavors and do you have any recommendations here's my here's what I've bought basically is the list of all the support for and yeah they gave me some recommendations to slip some stuff out like I think I had headband and they said swap this verb was it granddaddy perps so that's kind of similar with any persons best and then I said can you like they they said what will do is will throw you in another one for free and I think they've run this one of the free because I don't remember ordering the go Gog and but they asked me what one they wanted for free I said just give me the one that smelled like weed so go Gog hopefully okay so the moment of truth is I mean if this smells like weed then we're on to something in it because this is the kind of back pocket Ace of Spades oh gee oh gee you see what you're saying please no beautiful like a cannabis plant mm yeah I mean it's just more that horrible flavor mixtures household chemicals how disappointing really but I mean that they do smell nice and maybe they smell nice when they when they smoke I don't know I have never done this before I don't want to be ignorant to I don't know yet so all I'm saying is they don't smell like we not not one a single one of these so far has my weed remotely okay and this is another promising hope I guess this is xj 13 this is another one of the recommendations this is for different places is from the terpene store so let's give this one a smell hopefully this is by a company you can make a terpene that smells like weed Oh now that smells really nice that smells that's the clothes that's definitely by far the closest to weed that that's good I'm I'm gonna recommend that it doesn't smell like I've just opened a bag of weed but if you're looking at like comparing every other one of these bags hands down the winner smells very nice it's got candy smell and then it's got like a background of light just like sour like kind of sour hazy smell as well like a hazy smell going on hmm yeah definitely a hazy smell in fact it's very similar to this I got this the other day I haven't actually tried it yeah but it does smell this is when I thought I was getting all these terpenes I thought they'd all smell banging because this is the only thing I've bought so far this is Terrapins on it so it's made of terpenes at the company US and this does actually smell kind of nice this to me you just miles like the super Lemon Haze I want to screw really nice bit more sour than to see family it's a good skunk number one that's that that's what it is apparently you can see yeah but yes but yeah that back to the terpenes this is this so far my twin on it's a nice smell its kind of mint eNOS to it but it's also hazy and it's got a lot that sour kick and then very like the tiniest bit of that Haribo flavor the tiniest tiniest bit just in the background you notice after a couple of smells if I was gonna buy okay my battery ran out so I just plug the phone in charge I start about that yeah running up this this is my favorite so far decent nice round profile it's kind of a mixture of all of these but with a more convincing weed smell I could believe that this came from a weed none of this stuff his own is believable in my opinion and now for the big unveil why had to come back to you because this I always imagined to be a very hard strain to to kind of replicate me to fix this camera beat yeah I always thought this would be a hard strange replicate because it's so yeah I mean it's just this blue cheese and it's cheese cheese is just a strange I think it's my favorite like stream in terms of taste I didn't love the taste of cheese like a smoky all [ __ ] day but yeah let's let the suus it was like how it compares it's from a different company as well okay Anton blue cheese from advanced uhm yeah this is a different companies as in 13 UK it's on their website that's why they're suppliers and I was actually recommended this by the guy he said it's an awesome beautiful strain profile he said that specifically without me asking him about it so I almost don't want to open this because I I can perceive disappointment but then again in XJ from the other company turned out to be nice maybe it's just terpenes UK that's [ __ ] again man yeah Haribo it's just yeah however there's no kind of other smell going on there's no cheese smell there's none of that you know the blue cheese snow that kind of weird almost like nasty but he's by itself but when he's combined with the blueberry flavor and kind of everything it really just kind of shines and has a nice creaminess and yeah none of that ice is just mullet Hammond straight up like sniffing a bag of heroin all stars right now there's something else going on there as well it's a fruit it's lime maybe however Haribo and lime so don't buy don't even think about buying this apiece want a blue cheese because it's just not and again that with all these strains I mean let me know what you guys think please leave a comment just drop me a question I'm gonna try and answer as many questions as I can as with people to ask them about this because I couldn't find any information about terpenes in the UK yeah ask me any questions you like I mean I didn't think any of these matched up to we need apart from let's say this XJ 13 which still doesn't give this one more girl from us because knowing all these days yeah I mean again I don't think any of these are banging well I haven't amazing season gonna oh my god guys exactly that strain I smoked out that you know I mean it's not it's not there but this is this is good I mean if you're gonna buy a strain from that website you want to just try out terpenes I said try this actually everything else either smelt like petrol Haribo or household chemicals although bear in mind what everyone's bear in mind I have not smoked any of these so maybe they when they are combusted they change their profiles that's very possible I suppose but yeah in the whole quite disappointed especially considering I know that terpenes can be done right because this does smell like I mean it doesn't smell like I'm smelling a bag of weed but it's like if I gave that the so many of you know my god that smells kind of like weed it really has got like a sourness that is really only found in the smell of weed and also can be done and yeah alright I'm hopefully gonna make a follow-up video we get some clicks or whatever with me smoking some of these mixed with THC concentrate distillate so actually distillate I'm gonna make some big cuts I have pretty much got like everything I need for it now if anyone wants to give me some pointers on how to make THC carts using terpenes pg/vg if that's possible and that'd be great thumbs up and yeah thanks for your time and nice peace out", "5VDmLI8gLkA": "what's up good morning beautiful people all around the world wherever you're at watching um we're gonna do a sesh real quick and then i'm headed over to uh curry leaf in like i think two hours or so they open so i'm gonna head over there pick up my pick up order uh hopefully my pickup order is secured i know they have uh new employees and stuff so we will see uh cheers everybody call my brother yeah okay yeah do a sesh because it's early in the morning and i'm already breaking the sweat early this morning i've already cleaned up my brother's room because he had his trash just everywhere i helped him with all his situation got him ready for today breakfast what not clean the room all that good stuff then i came in here and worked out for a little bit and cleaned my room long morning [Music] this tastes amazing yeah your leaf supposedly had that purple sunset and then a brandywine too so i went ahead and put an order in for three and three we're supposed to be having to sell two today three eighths for seventy five dollars so i'll try to stack up on that since my flower reset today yeah anyways let me hit this one more time and then we'll get out of here all right let's go for a ride [Music] [Music] all right so i'm back from cura leaf and yeah i got me some jars of flour and some gummies my gummies got my gummies the nano ones i love these little things and then i got me some flour some purple sunset purple sunset purple sunset and then three jars of brandy wine i guess uh for six jars of flour i took advantage of that salad it was having today is the last day of their cell uh three jars three eight jars for 75 dollars so i doubled up on that and got me six jars for 150 i think that was so that's over a half ounce that's a half ounce and a quarter also i had 28 dollars in points so i took that off so i ended up paying like 120 something for 21 grams of dank medical cannabis you see a percentage of stuff matter the terpene profiles matter of the strains all of that stuff really mattered uh one hit of some um i think it was purple sunset and i'm feeling very lovely so yeah i just wanted to show the haul off real quick i gotta go do some yard work i'll try to come back to this and do the sash so stay tuned not done with the yard work just yet worked up a good sweat and i'm like yeah i need to go in and take a smoke break really quick and nothing's in the bowl dang it nothing's in the bowl so i gotta pack this up really quick yeah i noticed my back and stuff was really starting to stiff up on me and hurt i guess from the workout earlier so i was like yeah let me come in and take a tote then get back to the artwork then i'm gonna shower and stuff and then we'll do the session oh my that tastes so amazing very sweet very beautiful taste all right gotta finish the artwork like i said be right back all right let's get to the sash and let's talk about some news too why pack up a bowl so real quick stimulus news update i have not seen no stimulus and uh nobody around me has seen any stimulus so the stimulus is still missing um but ferrello uh ira says by the 24th they're sending out more direct deposits and if you do not get a direct deposit by the end of this week then you are getting a paper check for a prepaid credit card creepy credit card so if you are disabled or something and cannot get to a place to catch that chick that really sucks like i noticed one person that has a managed uh finances and they're completely disabled they can't even move out of the bed so they couldn't even get to a place to cash a check so i'm kind of i'm kind of wondering how they're gonna help people like that like people that get sent paper checks or whatever and they can't even get out of the bed to go cash the check and yeah uh that's a mystery if you're in that situation when you can't even walk and whatnot um you can't even get out of the house how is the paper check gonna help that kind of person i don't know okay all right so i need to get off of that uh subject because like i said the whole stimulus the way they're handling it it does really make me

having my own little store go from nothing now i have something and hey i definitely checked my merch out and all that good stuff i'm go ahead and hit this ball cheers everybody i'm basically sore all over from the yard work and my back kept on giving me issues like for real if you don't know i have back problems like i have a crooked spine and also i have herniated disc in my upper and lower lumbar multiple herniated discs somewhere back there apparently it's the worst spot to have a herniated disc uh especially because i train martial arts a lot and yeah it gives me problems for the rest of my life from what the doctor told me he's like hey straight up told me i'm screwed for the rest of my life i'm gonna be living in pain for the rest of my life that shooting pain that i feel that shock the gripping and spasms and all of that he said yeah i'm screwed and i mean because he said he's had herniated this before but never in that spot and people that have had him there yeah there's just a life of pain for him and that's just honestly what my doctor told me and i think a month after that i got my medical cannabis card and i never went back there again because i mean if i'm going to be on pain medicine or whatnot for the rest of my life it's my choice and that's why i choose cannabis cha i choose cannabis but yes i choose cannabis cannabis helps me i mean like i was saying like if i'm gonna be forced to be on any kind of pain stuff for the rest of my life at least i have a choice with medical cannabis i would twist strains and different methods and it's not the doctor this experiment and know me with all kinds of different pills because there was yeah they're like we have this new pill and we could try this on you i'm like new thank you um let's take another hit of this this purple sunset is so lovely it's really relaxing man i'm feeling so pain-free right now like all the ways and everything's just going away even after that yard work the best part after he's hard work smoking with a shower i'm in the shower after working any manual labor in the heat that cool shower is the best part then smoking probably shower and smoking at the same time but anyways yeah uh that's another thing if you don't know about me i got used to taking cold showers when i was training a lot because i would always be so hot from training nine hours a day martial arts so i got used to taking literally cold showers i don't even need to use hot water in the shower let's turn on the cold water down and that's just it feels really good to me i just got really used to taking cold showers because where i was training that in the woods and whatnot yeah cold cold water just felt good especially extreme heat training sweating your balls all cold water definitely and i mean i got used to it so i could literally take cold showers in the winter time and it doesn't name a phase man uh just because yeah i just i'm that immune to it as i say like in the video games i play i have that immunity got that immunity baby that and some other stuff uh this video i'll share that and cheers again this purple sunset is amazing i think i've said that tastes so sweet and i'll keep

24 a.m on a wednesday i went to starbucks this morning i got my coffee i got a venti soy latte with five blonde shots it is beautiful beautiful guys i might have like a [ __ ] stroke just trying to say a [ __ ] sentence but y'all so i have so much to catch you up on so i've not been doing well recently i like i guess i just kind of feel like i'm less than everybody and i guess everybody feels like that sometimes um it's really been weighing really heavily on me recently especially because like i don't know i just like i want to be able to love myself it's just like i feel like i'm incapable of being loved and i want to get past that [ __ ] i'm not wearing any green i forgot that was a thing that you had to work green on same patch and say i feel like my energy right now is very susceptible to whatever i think about so let's do some cool manifestation you know what i mean so like i am manifesting that next year is just amazing for me like everything just ends up being so good like i can get my medical marijuana card because y'all like severe pain and severe nausea count as like one of the things on the medical marijuana qualifications for colorado do have terrible stomach pains if i don't smoke and i literally can't eat unless i smoke because i'll get so nauseous and like in pain yeah so i'm very excited for next year and i love how early it is because i can just sit here for so long but i also hate it because the day can be so hard to get through do you know what i'm saying like the day can be so hard to get through i'm so excited for my future it's gonna be so good and like i'm gonna decorate my room the way i want i've been like i have a um pinterest board obviously like i have pinterest and i have been saving like room ideas like my new life aesthetic like guys i'm so excited hey everybody so i just went to the dispensary and i picked up these and each little piece candy has 25 milligrams and i also got two of these there's 200 milligrams of delta eight in the whole thing and then there's one of these which seems more like a cbd thing like under 25 milligrams cbd and then it has a little bit of delta and even less of delta 9. um so this looks good but i do think that it's more of a cbd type thing which is cool too so i'm probably gonna i'm probably gonna eat these today and then save the rest for later hey vlog so i just came out to my car because i don't really know why i just don't really want to be inside um i just took a lot of edibles like an hour ago so yeah i'm a little high right now um they were delta eight they're the ones i showed you from today i look so ugly oh my god i i saw the sign guys this like right here is like a picture like holy [ __ ] hip hop i need to take my car into the shop [Music] you know what i mean i want to lay in the grass but i also don't want to lay in the grass because it's just not fun here i don't feel free does that make sense this mountain thing i need to take you guys on to on a hike onto like onto a hike there my arm is warm i'm so sad guys i just thought like i'm just sad hey everybody so i just got out of my first class i woke up this morning and like still very high from the delta a edible i had yesterday like y'all also i am going to the dispenser today um to get more of the chocolate bars because i want to start taking edibles just for a little bit like the delta eight edibles so when my when i go back to like smoking like blood like i feel like it'll be different i'll also like i'm most out of like wrapping papers so you know um yeah and i'm almost out of bed too so i'm gonna get some edibles um so i'm very excited for that also yeah i lost my little stud in my nose yesterday so i had to put a little ring in there and like it looks fine like i'm not mad about it but like i'd rather have my stud now that i'm going to get my coffee like i'll i'll be fine yeah i mean also you dumb idiot um but yes that's about it i think my eyeliner looks really good today like i'm pretty happy about that i don't know what i did with my eyebrows i did like little like i don't know like drawn on eyebrow rings i don't know and guys in class i felt so bad but like i was just like i'm suited in class i was not expecting that let's just say that y'all i like really like my hair like this oh okay so i'll catch up with you guys later um i'll probably take another edible tonight so i'll let y'all all all update you on that too um i liked what i did yesterday i like smudged a joint after i took the edible and when it kicked in it was like perfect hi vlog so it is the next day i guess i don't i don't know i have no track of like no concept of time right now i am going to get gas right now and yeah i'm excited to pick up some cbd that'll be fun i have class and an hour of spanish and then i'm going to go to the cbd dispensary on my lunch break and then afterwards i have ap lit whatever whatever did you all see that oops hey everybody so right now i'll be on my way to pick up some cbd from cbd dispensary i love there are a lot of dispensaries around me like a lot and i'm so grateful for that guys i feel like i don't talk about how like grateful i am just like to myself or on this channel like i feel like i don't express my gratitude very much i just kind of take things very like not even i don't it's not even i take things for granted i just don't express how grateful i am for something we are stopped this is surreal like this feels surreal to me i hate this [ __ ] i'm just glad you guys are here i'm just very glad you all are here because if y'all weren't here i'd be bored out of my [ __ ] lines and also if y'all weren't here i would feel so alone y'all make me feel safe what the [ __ ] is going on but y'all oh life hack if you ever have like a starbucks cup you should always empty it out and like um i mean like after you drink it like clean it out and [ __ ] like that and then if you're ever worried about the cops like pulling you over and thinking that your cbd is actually weed you can always put in a starbucks cup that is empty and like all cleaned out obviously and [ __ ] like that you know what i mean but yo what the [ __ ] is going on like i'm so upset right now if we don't move soon i'm going to cry but y'all it's okay because this will end soon and i will be at the dispensary and i'll take a different way home because i know better hey everybody so i'm driving in the rain and y'all i wanna i'm i think i'm going to starbucks i don't really know if i'm gonna get anything or if i'm just gonna like turn around and go home after this because i don't know why but that's just not the point of why i'm filming right now because i just got out of philosophy class today they were like so anyone who would consider themselves consequential as like a consequentialist with the knowledge you have already like obviously we don't know everything about it so we can't really say like i'm a consequentialist but like with the knowledge you have like everybody who would consider themselves that go over here and consequentialism is like basically judging the morality of your actions based on the outcome it's more like like they take intention into consideration as well but there's another one that a lot of people might classically agree with which i was really surprised about but also it kind of fits their personality like um like there's a rule and like you don't break it and if you break it you're automatically doing something immoral and like obviously it's like like let's say like you're smoking weed and then the cop walks up to your house and it's like [ __ ] what you doing and then you say well i'm smoking weed and then they say well i'm taking you to jail because that's illegal in consequentialism you'd probably be able to be like oh well i have terrible anxiety and this helps so like is it actually bad like am i hurting anybody is there any bad outcomes from this the cop would be like like if we lived in a consequentialist society the cop would be like i guess you're not hurting anybody and there are no bad outcomes okay you're good keep smoking your weed like in the cup would just walk away but the other theology which a lot of people actually agreed with it was like you make a rule it's like the cup gets your house i smell weed oh yeah i'm smoking weed okay you're coming to jail um oh actually i have really bad anxiety and like i really need to do this too bad it's a law you're coming to jail with me that's what the other one was and it started with the d or something but i'm not sure what it was um but a lot of people agree with that and i was like really and like i guess our government does do like like we have federal laws or like whatever and we have like just laws of like um not just federal like i'm some really smart guys hi could i have a um could i have a ham and swiss panini not heated up okay cool uh that's all i don't know if they were done i was just like okay that's all and they just did not say anything i literally work here though it's like fine but like so weird also when you go through the [ __ ] drive-through turn off your [ __ ] windshield wipers if it's [ __ ] raining stupid [ __ ] idiot not you not you that was not directed at you it's just directed at one customer who literally saw us like getting splashed every two seconds and just like left it on hi vlog so it is so wet outside like it's raining or it was raining and my like i'm soaked like look like i do kind of want to change up my hair a bit um i mean like honestly i could just cut it all off like honestly i could", "1RV4l3orj3k": "hey guys it's my and Nani coming at you with another video today we have a little weed hall it's not really it's not even really a hall like because you did get free up Susie pause what's the name of the disco that we ordered from oh it's like it's holy flag window fly yeah okay flag window is where we got it from shoutouts hotel mystery that's what's hot how I roll Rose I appreciate the free stuff because they don't want to do that all this time they're actually like food definitely wet hand Rosie's like they're loose is [ __ ] and there's a whole there's like a whole it cuz like we got four holes dizzy pods yeah I said it's dizzy but I feel like we always say cz we say steezy usually I don't know how it's usually said or they'll right-wing we got four half grandpas because we're trying to get like a like a crown ha to each his shoes when you gelato and I was gonna say Strawberry Cough and we usually like shares to like balance it off but the guy didn't even have like grandpa so we got four we got four half grooms and like this makes more sense because we could like boom dish match now and now we both have our own show lardo our own like the shell our toes like a like indica dominant hybrid and the gelato it tastes like eucalyptus we just had a last time yeah and that was like the last pot I had we were this morning so yeah oh yes we're here if these days we'd be going through these we need to save them like where are they oh yeah it retailer prize you can refill those oh yeah I have like the syrup stuff not syrup it comes innocent okay so no you shouldn't you should use your auto right out and I'm gonna do every cough is in which I like that idea okay I like strawberry coffee for like school and stuff yes school it creates a video I like doing hard off of it a lot I'm just gonna okay this is funny we started we fart we started like dizzying like maybe like a month and a half ago like were at her friend's house and he like let us hit his pod and we thought it was really cute that they look like jewels and we've been easy onyx every since yesterday they're just so sweet like look at this in comparison to my hand it's only my palm like it's sleek as hell it looks just like the jewel it's just slightly less boxy yeah appreciate the design of this like way more than a jewel heel isn't great although I have heard this is like the packaging is very wasteful because like it's only this one pod here it is cute though it's cute this looks like a groom no I thought it was a grand when I first did the like aground okay we should save the phone thanks to maybe there could be something no but isn't this slightly bigger okay it doesn't matter it's a half gram 500 milligrams you're still gonna get high yep wait over you so we can take our first I know they're taking thingy of these are something to you like these are nothing there with their no their wasteful their value to illustrate of rubber hello these lying around like I bet next time we do a deep clean I'm gonna find them so Susie you're a little like marketing or like PR team so probably think about like create like low waste packaging because fishes like us we appreciate that and when I spend more money with you when we know that you're like oh this really small like I feel like the packaging should be small - like what if it was even like skinnier than this or something like that I mean or something you know cuz I know you need protected around it like that's fine oh yeah first it okay we got it look make eye contact okay let me wait Melissa so I tried to preserve I Drive to like be real okay like take the whole like recommended dose and to like the light blinked and not alright that too but I [ __ ] I [ __ ] myself up because sometimes the fog is really hot and it started biruni my lobe it didn't Oh mine is high there's always burst my look at least on mine like you burn smiling - it's never been like events like okay no are you in mind he gives me his eye and it burns my lip and alright how about me I pick yours too like that has not happened to me oh no maybe my looks like or just like different okay it burned my lips and it threw me off this hit me we start coughing because my look copper it's not just like this one well yeah I mean I want let's switch off okay but it tastes amazing it tastes like strawberry of course oh yeah okay the strawberry cop is like my favorite by the way I got enchiladas for you guys who the yeah like the gelato this is strawberry right yeah the strawberry pop this is sure a lot of tastes great ow do you see really high is it DC that achieve it by the way I wish you required the first time you hit this because if you're new like you get highest but it also feels like dad's like there's been times where I was literally like in my bed choking and I'm like I can't believe it I was about to die right now but they pit but awesome we found out how to hit it right - oh yeah in that place oh yeah no so this was like our first like we used to I like disposable vape so whatever I'm like sometimes like we probably like paint her and prove we weren't like vapors and this this is like the fire in the vapor yeah like so we started like vaping actually and when we hit it we hit it like how you hit like a fly it will like me like holding your mouth etc they're literally like this Roy's year-long accident we were like watching someone else yeah like I would feel like my neck was like choking is so from the inside or something yeah like in we're watching someone else's video and like I thought they were hit it I was just like oh I've been doing this wrong the whole time and I realized it's more of like uh you gotta open up opening your whole neck like does he drink to your chest and like with that like I'm able to like not cough as much off of it cuz sometimes I want to be really lucky like the packaging is low-key but like my copying is not looking like everyone turns around and turns a nice cuz I'm coughing like crazy and I sound like oh yeah and but like the cough is row because late just with like so hippy in baby in the coffee's row but overall I think the the hit on Sue's these are like really clean compared to other compared to other like bait products this looks super yeah nothing like it does there like her you know it like good ding smoke do you know what yeah I feel like it hurts the same as if like if the bomb were like this small in the fire go straight to you straight tears but like no no heat like no fire like out of them like a heat other people it's like strong is our way yeah there yeah yeah yeah I feel like other basically head like straight to the back of my neck like it feels like I'm damaged in muscle no yeah totally but I don't know my mom's a baker I want to get her to try this my mom is let me know if you want to see that I'm excited it's for what I like visit home for the holidays - oh baby my bed at home because my mom's not a smoker and she was actually so happy when I said her like I was like oh really though she was like I stopped smoking mom and she was like it in the camera like but you don't like the snow you don't get the snow with this although except the og women we have a Coniston it kind of smell like it's kind of day yes I've overheard danger though there's like the indica was honestly look are that fun like they stay like they smell dank they taste ink and you [ __ ] like hit it and like you're you I guarantee you like sleep for four hours every time like no matter what like if you damn near like an atom or some yeah it was like you don't feel like you're gonna sleep right after you don't hitting it but you just know you like back in it yeah I'm better with it now though totally I could live my life and hit it I'll be like open it too much but yeah I see how long are you guys laughs oh yeah what's today is
