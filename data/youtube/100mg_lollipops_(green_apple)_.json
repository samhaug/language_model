at a brand new product from a brand new company when we've never looked at before that is premium Cali dreams candy company they're a hundred and twenty milligram THC medical cannabis lozenge although I don't think it's a lozenge at all I think it is a caramel apple pop with 120 milligrams of THC big fan of the caramel apple pops it's a weird combination but the apple flavored lollipop with caramel on the outside it's great never had one with Whedon before especially one without 120 milligrams I picked this up for I believe 13 bucks at my dispensary although it was on a going out of we're no longer selling these soon to be illegal edible special for 50% off so I got it pretty cheap I'm excited to try it I always like different kinds of edibles and a caramel apple blowing pop sounds pretty good so for 13 bucks 120 milligrams is pretty good for that price especially for something that's not just a brownie or cookies something a little different like a lollipop like the packaging from the outside pretty basic stuff but uh but nice enough as is let's go ahead and shut up now and open it up and see what this bad boy tastes like and if this is the first time you're tuning into wheats the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat some number of this product well probably not gonna eat close to the whole thing because it's a big lollipop but I'm gonna eat some of it let you know do a taste test let you know how it tastes how it smells all that good stuff then I'll finish it off and for the most important part I'll come back in two hours to actually let you know how I am feeling guys because that is the most important part of the edible review how you feel not so much how it tastes alright so here is the pop here it's kind of smushed into this little container it's seems like it's gonna be hard to get out but let's give it a go okay came right out nothing to worry about so there it is there's the caramel apple what is this called again Cali dreams medical cannabis lozenge 120 milligrams handsome looking product give it a lick it's not bad no real cannabis taste can't detect any cannabis taste while just looking through it here I don't have the cojones to just bite straight into this but the taste at least so far pretty good if if it changes if there's something with a lollipop that's wrong or if the caramel eventually gets a weedy taste I'll be sure to let you know in the to our follow up but for now I quite like the taste of this one and like the funky style so guys I'm going to finish this off and then I will be back with you in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching wheat see you soon [Music] welcome back guys it's been two hours here are the fruits of my labor the demolished remains of the Cali dreams 120 milligrams of THC caramel apple pop although that's what I'm calling it they call it a medical cannabis lozenge which it is not I liked it it's uh it's gotta be pretty high not not outrageously high not it's not super crazy effective it's not as good as a equivalently a good you know cookie or brownie it's not as good as like a hundred and fifty milligram Korova for example but I do like things that are a little bit different and I think this one's a little bit different it tasted good pretty much the whole way through the lollipop had a little bit of a Candace cannabis flavor but nothing too bad it was totally totally fine then at and you know was far from making me gag I said that's not the best descriptor but yeah it was pretty tasty the caramel was good I liked it it was a good way of getting THC and if you can find it 50% off like I did it's a hell of a deal at 13 bucks I still think it's not a bad price it is something that unlike a cookie or a brownie or rice krispies treat or whatever else you can't really split it being a lollipop so that might be you know something to strike against and you're gonna be taking this whole thing by yourself and you can't really save it for later either you can't really have half of it otherwise you just have a sticky mess so it's something you've got to commit to if that's you know what you're looking for for me it's a it's a middling endorsement for the Cali dreams hundred and twenty milligrams you see the dispensary near you and you're looking for something a little different a little outside the mold give it a try I think you'll be happy you did thanks so much for watching wheats guys that's going to do it for this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a later review peace", "ULaV_ZP2b3Q": "[Music] hi friends welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another thing from canna candies there our first lollipop the grape medicated lollipop hundred milligrams of THC as rated by SC labs which is always great to get that little reminder that has been officially rated and it does have the THC as promised in there thanks the good folks at SC labs as I said this is my first lollipop not my first candy I've had hard candies from Canada candies before and in the grand scheme or scope of candies they're not bad I still wouldn't necessarily that wouldn't be my first choice for edibles I'd still stick with the confectionaries as always but the kind of candies are far from the worst types of candies so the lollipop I think cost me seven bucks at my dispensary which is a pretty affordable for a 100 milligram edible so let's just go ahead and open up and give it a and give it a taste here this is the first time you've ever tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this lollipop and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not necessarily so much how it tastes so here we go we've got our big gourmet lollipop purpley black give it a lick how many to get to the center one to our you know things yep it tastes like a great bali pop without a lot of flavor and just a hint of weed exactly what I thought it was gonna be not great not terrible pretty much what you think it's gonna be as well think of a mild flavored grape lollipop with a bit of an earthy aftertaste except not as bad as sounding as that and that's what it's gonna taste like but guys without how hey how's this gonna make me feel for that you're gonna have to stay tuned and I will see you guys in two hours I'll be back right here to let you know how I'm feelin thank you so much for watching see you guys soon peace hi guys my dog squid here and I are back to talk to you about panic and ease Medicaid and lollipops the hundred milligram great flavor here I and I'm I'm kind of hi about what I would expect for a hundred milligram at all not a lot of red in the old I boss but again it's only 100 milligrams and I'm feeling about what I would think for that maybe a little bit lower probably just because it's a candy and those don't tend to hit me as hard as the confectionaries um but I don't I'm not dissatisfied with it it's again right in the sort of wheelhouse of what I was expecting didn't taste terrible I'm moderately high and for a candy it's it's one that I can recommend and it's pretty cheap bet like I said I think it cost me seven bucks so it's affordable it doesn't taste terrible and it got me pretty it got me a little high so it's what I was looking for what I was about what I was expecting if you're in the mood for a lower dose edible or if you're a new smoker and you want something a little bit higher dose that you can sort of media it out over time maybe give the lollipops a chance especially these ones from can of candies I can verify I and SC labs can verify you know they'll it will it will get you high and it doesn't taste too bad so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I really appreciate you tuning in as always we we'll see you on the next review and thank you so much for watching peace okay hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to

yeah like two years ago that's why i bought these it's all amazing but it's a different flavor and it's not melted together like mine was so we will get an accurate dosing this time yeah yeah are you just ready to do it like let's do it okay it was so like that was such the perfect like rip whoa okay you might have better luck with that how much do you want to take today two two i'm still a little bit high from earlier i'm gonna take three so then should i take and now i don't want to die take however much your heart tells you to take let's see okay these are really good i like these better than the blueberry ones yeah have you ever had these ones not many ones i've only ever had they were blackberry okay and melted so these are actually pretty freaking good i'm not gonna lie i'm my third one right now and i know that there's like no going back after this how many of you eat in two so that's your third this possibly will be my third it would only be fair if we both took three yes

the other other eyebrow i just forgot to give it no wait what are you saying what did i forget i'm just saying um didn't put that on that eyebrow i don't think i'm gonna get it on right now no it's a different one i'm not crazy you're crazy i had a water bottle somewhere and i'm gonna need your help locating it so your left hand reach it forward and just right down that was like the claw game we

need you to give me the brush that is green that is fluffy on the tip yeah yeah this one yes okay the cut crease and the girl's eye was like a brownish taupish color and if i remember correctly on the top right somewhere over here there's like a brown color that we're gonna put in her crease yes is this your eye yeah this is your eye okay that is your thumb this feels right the tricky thing is is trying to get the same color on that eye i think we're going to find out that's like yeah that's your crease am i stabbing your eye yes i'm so sorry and that's my eyebrow okay i'm so excited for this

types of citric acid one liquid form and one powder form I also am going to use two different types of molds I got these molds for Christmas this mold here is meant probably for chocolate but it worked for lollipops but the best way to make lollipops obviously is by using a lollipop mold that has a place for a stick so let's get started alright start with two cups of sugar 3/4 cup corn syrup 3/4 cup of water turn your heat on to a medium heat and stir this up until the sugar dissolves try to keep the sugar from collecting around the side wipe the sides down with the wet paper towel to keep it on sugar now let that boil until it reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit let a boil in the pot for about 20 minutes add about 10 drops of food coloring of your choice stir that in we want the water to evaporate now add the flavoring I'm using apple flavor one dram of apple flavor by Lorraine's oils and add a bout a tablespoon of this at a tablespoon of tart and sour I'm just gonna guess and you can purchase these at a cooking shop or probably on Amazon I don't know if that's going to make it sour enough so I did add some citric acid I've seen them do it on lofty pursuits so I'm gonna try it out but see it's not going to boil out so it won't burn I put lollipop sticks in these molds and these do not require in volley pop sticks so we're gonna see how that works pour them into your mold and take the stick and just twist it a little bit there you go all right the pot would be a mess so all you need to do is fill it with water and the water will break it down and clean it up all right it is possible to use these molds the only problem is you have to keep standing them up until the syrup is hard and there you have it some sour apple lollipops thank you thanks for watching", "GakeYj3uu4o": "(bright music) - Hi guys! Welcome Back to - That Youtube Family! - And today we are actually going to be making some lollipops. Some really cool lollipops that are going to be in the shape of our faces maybe? Or - They'll be beautiful! - Whoever's faces we choose. So we are actually at a\ncandy shop called Spun where you can make your own treats. It is in London. - You can personalize them. - Yes, and so you can\npersonalize lots of lollipops so look over here and there is actually a lollipop face. That's what we're doing today! - [Audrey] That looks crazy hard. - We are going to try. - But we'll become masters. - We're going to be\nmasters so I chose that I want to make Jordan. - And I'm making our dog, Logan. - [Audrey] Who are you doing? - I'm gonna make me cause\nI think it'll be easy. - [Audrey] Who are you making? - Dad. (laughs) - [Audrey] Two dads! - I'm making a random face. - Jake's making someone random\nand I am making myself, so. Let's go! - [Mom] How excited are you? - So excited. - [Mom] Boys, how excited\nare you to be here in the candy factory? Yes? - [Jordan] I hope we all get our faces. - You can watch them make the candy and it says on the sign\nthat they can teach you. - [Jordan] What? - [Jake] I wanna learn! - They're gonna teach us. They're gonna teach us how to make candy. - DIY! - [Mom] What do you think\nabout eating someone's face? - I'm not gonna make a face. - [Jordan] Logan's baby face? - Aww! The baby! - [Jordan] So cute! - Yes, I want Logan. - [Mom] Ty, who would you eat? - Audrey. (laughter) - [Mom] Alrighty. Let's get Audrey's face\nand have Ty eat it. Challenge accepted. - I'll make a really good face like... - [Dad] Okay. They are\nchoosing their flavors of candy for their face. - How about Tooty Fruity or Lime? - [Dad] Let's go with Tooty Fruity. - Tooty Fruity? - Alright, Mom and I\nare gonna be the same. We're gonna be Tooty\nFruity and everybody else is probably gonna pick like Coconut or Pi\u00f1a Colada or Lime. Some crazy flavor. (fans) - [Dad] This is the first step. Nobody can make up their mind. This could a long day. Okay, here comes the sugar. It's extremely hot. - So, let's get started. In this pot, we have a\nmixture of sugar, water and glucose that we've\nheated up to 155 degrees, so it's very, very hot. Hotter than your kettle at home. What we're going to do,\nwe're going to pour in our Tooty Fruity flavor. - [Dad] You chose Tooty Fruity? _ Yes. - [Dad] Alright, Tooty Fruities! - [Employee] So what\nyou're seeing now is just the liquid evaporating\nfrom our flavoring but the flavor will remain inside\nof our candy mixture. - [Dad] You think a genie's\ngonna pop out of there? - I hope so. (bright music) (fans) - So do you know the name of the material this table is made of? - [Audrey] Granite? - [Dad] Granite. - Granite. Do you know what\nthe granite table does? - [Mom] Back up, Ty. Do you smell that guys? - [Audrey] Do you smell that? - [Jordan] It smells so good! - [Dad] Is that bubbling because it's got air in it or is that\nbubbling cause its lava? - Lava! It smells really good. I'm glad we chose the Tooty Fruity. - I think they just made\nthe world's largest sucker. - [Audrey] Oh yeah! - [Mom] It's like huge. - [Dad] Yummy. - [Mom] Look how big that is! - [Employee] So. Do you know what the granite table does? - [Mom] Nope. - [Employee] So it absorbs the heat. So what's gonna happen- - [Dad] Alright so they're\nmaking the face color. What do you think Audrey? Is that your face pigment? - She's pretty pale. - I don't know. Does it look the same? - [Dad] I don't know,\nmaybe a little lighter. A little orange, Audrey. (playful music) - [Audrey] What is going on? I am so confused. - [Dad] Oh they're cutting it. - [Audrey] What? - [Employee Woman] We just\ncut the edges with scissors. And now we take the colors and pull it across the table, pull\nit out a little bit more. - [Mom] Wow. That's magic. - [Dad] I would have\ntotally messed that up. - [Mom] I would have messed this up too. - [Female Employee] You just\ndon't want to cool it down too much, that's why I'm\ntaking it to a heated table right now. So it's heated to 75 Celsius degrees. - Do you know what we call (mumble)? - [Off-Screen Female] Uh, no. - It's a non-Newtonian\nfluid, and candy is the same. So, when left alone, it's nice and soft. If you apply force to it,\nit turns into a solid. - So we just need to fold this, to have the same consistency as we work. - [Dad] Who's excited? - Me! - [Dad] Who's feeling artistic? - I don't know. I'm worried that I'll mess up. - I am not an artist. - Hey, if you're gonna paint this canvas, you better be accurate. (laughter) - Yikes! - [Dad] All right, we'll\npaint Mom so it looks good. - I'm trying to paint\nJordan as Buddy, the Elf. - Oh, no! She has a picture, too,\nwhen I was Buddy the Elf. - [Female Employee] And now we start making a demonstration for you guys; how to make faces. So, I'm going to try and make Jack's face. - [Jack] What a handsome devil. (laughter) - [Female Employee] Just don't want to use too many\ncolors so that's why I'm just going to make a\nsmall version of the face. So, with this white, that looks creamy, we need to do something\nto make it lighter, and more white, and also (mumble). What do you think we should do with it to make it whiter? When you mix, when you stretch, actually, you add air bubbles to our sugar to make it more fluffy and lighter. So I'm going to do it with hands. - [Mom] That's your swirl. It's the slime swirl, guys! - [Dad] Jordan, you should\nbe very good at this. - I'm just doing this\nwith hands, but if we have bigger batches making a crop, for example, of lollypops, we use a loop that's over there on the wall, and\nwe stretch it like that. So it's kind of a challenging workout. - So we can do anything\nup to 14 kilos here. So this is a six kilo batch, so you can imagine how much 14 kilos is. - But this is just like one kilo. It changes the texture so it's\nmore like meringue, maybe. - [Dad] Professionals\ngonna show us how to do it. I have a bad feeling they're\ngoing to turn us loose. - [Mom] I think I changed my mind. I think I'm going to make an alien. That might be easier. - [Female Employee] So\nnow we've done the nose. - [Jack] When we're doing\nthe bridges of the nose, as well, you'll want to make sure we're pushing up so we're\ngetting the height of the nose. Now, we're going to do the nostrils, so you'll dig in two holes, and then using each\nnostril, we're going to slowly put each stick\nin and pull up and out to create our nostrils. - [Dad] What do you think? - I'm worried. - [Dad] Are you gonna be able to do that? - No. (bright music) - [Dad] Okay, so that\npiece of candy cannot talk back, and see back at you. - This is hard. - [Dad] I'm imagining what\nours are gonna look like - Ugh - See, the face is wonky\nand pale (fans) this is still quite hot, so I'm going to place it on the cooling table, and your cooling tables are over near the wall, so yeah. - [Jack] Before we get started, I'm just going to tell you a few things. On the tables behind you, I'm going to be bringing around some gloves. [Dad] Good luck, you'll need it. Okay, they've set us free. Time to make our masterpieces. Jake, are you ready for this? - It's just like slime! - [Dad] All right, Audrey. I expect greatness from you. I think I heard Ty say he was going to make the best looking guy in the house. Who you making? - Dad - [Dad] Dad? And Jordan is going to\nattempt to make Logan. - This is going to be hard. I don't know how I'm going to make Logan. - [Dad] We'll see about that. - Yeah. - [Dad] Okay, I'm going to let you guys get some of the details,\nthen we'll come back. Okay, so, I've got mine started. There's the beginning of mine. Oh, I've got something on my nose. I wonder what that was. Okay. Jordan is - I don't know! I don't know\nhow to make a doggy face! What's the shape of Logan's face? - [Dad] I don't know. Good luck with that one. - [Audrey] I'm so lost. - [Dad] Audrey's made like, if you want to make an eye, you do indents like that. - [Audrey] I don't even know what to do. - [Dad] Jake, good job Jacob. Look at that. Getting a good one. - [Audrey] Maybe we should just leave this to the professionals. - [Dad] What's Mom doing? Oh, look at Mom! - [Mom] Making Jordan. - [Dad] Making Jordy. - [Mom] Trying. - [Dad] Trying. Good job Ty. - And now what you're going to do is get the sticks and we're going\nto make two nostrils. - [Dad] I like it. Going to make my nose? - [Jack] So then, I'll do one, you do one. We're going to put the stick in, and bring it out. There you go. - [Dad] Good job, Ty. I didn't take my mat with me. Good luck. Good luck. - I don't even know. - [Dad] All right, how we doing here? - [Jack] If it's cooled down, you can. But don't eat any warm candy. - [Dad] This is mine,\nthe beginnings of me. Nana's working on it, Jake's working on making the nose again. Nana's going with some black eyebrows. How we doing over here, Ty? Oh, look at this! Audrey's going with some green eyes. Really green eyes. Grandpa's going with googly eyes. How's Grandma doing? - Well, trying to make something\nthat looks a little human. - [Dad] How's Mom doing? Maybe! - [Mom] Not so good. My teeth are breaking, but - [Dad] Get some color in those eyes and some hair on there, it\nmight look just like you. All right, gotta get back to making, or we're going to lose\nour heat on our candy. Okay, next step. I got my eyes and my mouth done. Let's see. Can anybody guess what Jordan's making? - [Jordan] You already told. - [Dad] Logan. All right, Nana's got the eyes. And the teeth, and the eyebrows. How we doing over here, Jake? - [Jake] Okay, I'm doing okay. - [Dad] Jake's getting it going! Good job. How's Ty Ty doing? Your guy looks beautiful, whoever that is. How we doing over here, Audrey? - We're doing. - [Dad] We're doing? - Does that look like me? Probably not.

(upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually. (chill beat)", "o_9i6xjzLRM": "hi everybody welcome to the i'm ready test kitchen i'm lauren and i will be showing you how to make caramel apple suckers today this is a really really fun recipe it's very nostalgic it reminds me of being a kid and getting a million of these suckers in my halloween bag so i figured why not give it a shot try and make some myself so for this recipe it's really simple you don't need that many ingredients it's just light corn syrup water granulated sugar our tart apple extract water soluble and then some caramel so our first step is adding all of our ingredients here except for the extract and caramel of course into a pot and then we'll turn the heat up until it all reaches 300 degrees which is the hard crack stage for candy i'm just going to turn up the heat and you don't you don't want to stir this the whole time i only stir it until the sugar is dissolved in the mixture and then just let it be don't touch it at all so let's turn this bad boy on i'll let it heat up just a little bit until it's hot enough for the sugar to really dissolve then i'll give it a good stir once it's dissolved we'll put in our candy thermometer here these are easy you can find them pretty much at most of your grocery stores you can get them online pretty inexpensive and it's really really important to have for this recipe so now that our sugar is all dissolved we are going to put in our thermometer and again we want this to reach 300 degrees and during the process of this you'll really be able to see the different stages of the sugar and how it gets really thick like a syrup and then it gets even thicker so it's more of the form of a hard candy so now we wait all right so we have reached the hard crack stage and this is where you will want to add in any flavorings if you want or food coloring so we'll be adding in the tart apple extract uh just one and a half teaspoons so you don't need much for really bold flavor and that's about five grams and we'll also be using a green food color because the original are green so these have to be green of course and you can smell this it's so potent it smells just like you'd imagine a tart apple to smell like we're just gonna add a little bit of food coloring and do a couple drops perfect you want to be careful too don't have your head right over right over your pot because you will get blasted with some extract steam and it's not fun i've done that before you'll you'll regret it all right so perfect so now this is ready to be poured into our mold so now it's time to pour our sugar mixture into our molds i've prepared these ahead of time all you have to do is grease them put the sticks in and then put them in your freezer until you're ready to pour in your mixture so it's okay if uh some of these overflow they don't have to be perfect they just have to be delicious all right so now these are ready to cool you want to let them cool for about one to two hours and then we will uh dip them in our caramel so we'll be back all right so our suckers have hardened and now it is time to dip it in our caramel so i just have store-bought caramel here you could heat it up on the stove in a double boiler or just pop it in the microwave like i just did and you'll want it to be a nice silky smooth consistency like we have here so let's dip i have here a sheet pan lined with a parchment paper so they won't stick once they dry make sure we get it nice and coated oh that looks so good i'm so excited to eat one of these look at that so adorable gourmet caramel apple suckers if you want them to harden a little bit faster you can pop them in the fridge after you're done dipping um if you're not in a rush you can leave them out at room temperature it should only take about you know an hour or two to uh harden up and be ready to eat all right and there you have it delicious caramel apple suckers these will be ready in hopefully about 30 minutes because i'm going to pop them in the refrigerator because i cannot wait to eat one i hope you guys enjoyed this recipe thanks so much for watching and we'll see you next time make sure to subscribe to our channel below so you don't miss

I had seen these like weeks ago and then Camille sent me a message on through YouTube and she said hey do you know that they have these out and I did but I didn't realize they were different flavors than the normal flavor so Camille thank you for pointing that out that they are special flavors it's not just Halloween packaging because you know sometimes yeah but these were a doll or at Walgreens and then Kevin had these they're tipsy camel camp caramel apple pops and they are three flavors green apple Golden Delicious and red McIntosh they sounded good well let's do my part yes the moment we got a piece of wax paper down here working it says that the whole pack is 240 calories Thank You Monte starburst - did you read the fibers they have bewitched berry baddie black berry chilling cherry Kiwi and mysterious mango so blueberry blackberry cherry Kiwi and mango so those are different than the normal ones right I think baby like tropical I think tropical has mango in that doesn't it don't thing in the tropical eyes in terry manttan I don't know I don't know I don't even Starbucks that often did we get one of every place it looks like yeah I put a mini set okay so we got it looks like we got three of each color so that's good because we can eat one of each and then I can take a picture I can take a picture book lunch ever yeah I like the packaging too because they have like like this green one has little skulls on it and this one has a ghost the ordinance goes and this one is a cat so yeah so I'll take a picture of those when we're finished which one is your mang that one the orange one the man got one okay no one scares me okay I want to save one with the picture the mango scares you yeah I'm not sure I like mango that much it smells really good hmm actually tastes like I can't look now fellow tourists hmm that's not one already go hum it's up bad but I like the original orange one better so I'm gonna swallow that um that's good it definitely has a Heather remind your cam up a little bit that gets to this mango um it's not bad it's not I just like the orange better yeah but it's not a bad bite where it's a good flavor well you want them mm-hmm let's do the green one once again though strawberry Kiwi okay try to keep going with a picture on it I think I might like this one on half oh if I can if I can open this one is pink on the inside it looks like it would become a watermelon a para type not possible no it's gonna have dog hair all over hmm strong love love that's a Cherokee way mm-hmm that is so that's good um definitely is a cherry flavor with something yeah I'm assuming it's Kiwi but it's good you look blackberry blueberry blackberry first it's the bouquet blackberry butters it has purple and purple so purple rapper and purple news um mmm you immediately taste that pot very there you go good strawberry butter [Music] that is really good your mum's me of a gum had a trident language gum I think there is something blocks oh we got a blackberry yeah a lot yeah don't is good now blueberry bewitched a blueberry chew off side of this one help lag show the picture of the kitty cat on there I guess they sell these in big bags to to where you can give them a mouse great maybe you would think so yeah I think there's so much like many packs up for work because a bluish yeah yeah we're we're giving out starbursts mmm yes there were a 2-pack well three there's three starbursts a little packet mm something him no man we had some more package things Nick good that was a lot lighter flavor the blackberries better believe it or not cuz that's why it's good it's a very light flavor it's not really strong at all my favorite is probably the library yeah mine too if you if you measure things and you wanna eat them out a tome I would eat the blueberry first just because it is a lighter fiber because then when you get to that Blackberry it's gonna be really powerful I need the mango first to get out of the way I would give my go away I mean some of you probably love it and that's great for you but you have two people here that don't think it's bad it's just not someone else these are suckers we're not gonna get to be to get to zero that's okay sir well we gotta open one and share it Harwich it eat your own tongue I want you know I I don't mind you a little bit stiff but I don't want a sucker spit oh I don't know let's do just the regular caramel the green apple no don't write it rare well this is still a Golden Delicious apple they're all caramel it's just what kind of apples in there this is the Golden Delicious this one's a green apple so it's gonna have that tartness to it and this is a red the red McIntosh that's a problem yeah see I feel think about the episode does that go they must know it's an element kool Moe man it's on the outside but I don't think there's that Center I think you'd have to wait a while to get to what it tastes the sucker on the middle because it's all caramel on the outside you'll break your feet down right back down I'm not sticky I'm just trying to stick that uh-huh nobody plans I'll tell you what that's some good caramel it's gonna sound weird but the first flavor that a good like I've got reminded me of something from a bakery like for my cake I bet it got some sucker but is it good you know talk homo that maybe maybe sucker resort the best thing to redeem mmm-hmm special into the thick hole that is very it's a good sucker mm-hmm keep you like caramel I'm assuming there's an apple flavor in there at some point in time yeah their ships world or something I don't know yeah I'm telling you're good at that Colin stuck in your teeth the back yeah I managed to get my caramel rolled up in a little ball so yeah it's very good I want to know spooning rapper is our equation magically it's not there anymore magically there's just a teeny tiny smell that is a very good normal it's good or do you get them I don't get the yeah Apple at all but I love and you even bit into it so you've got a big hunk of the middle yeah I didn't get in there plenty on you wanna try a red one I don't know I don't know if it's gonna be worth it we'll try one more the green one probably that okay the green we program is a stronger sophistication its best we should do it off camera hmm that's a green ring green sucker again it's coated in the caramel don't break your tape don't I can buy that it's the size of my room neither comas the same I'm wondering about the Sun I know with you one you know the suppertime different I'm just thinking if you get these in the bag for Halloween kids gonna be happy with any of these cuz they're all gonna have that thick thick caramel on the outside it's gonna take them a while to get to the sucker that sucker tastes good I mean the green part tastes good it's not super strong but it is good and how many calories are these each 16 16 I don't think that's worth it I just took you along it was like a while mm-hmm now the best suckers Kevin probably does not remember the best Halloween suckers we've ever had and I've only seen them last year at CVS they might have them everywhere now but they were at CVS last year and you couldn't mom anywhere else in town they were charms brand and they were candy corn flavor we actually mean oh yeah we kept them and you would get you one and that would be like your sweet thing that you would have whoa watch TV because they tasted I mean like dead-on candy corn and they lasted so long that flat one like these yes yeah I never even color yes they were color like a piece of candy corn orange wide in yellow and they were just wonderful in their charms brand so if you see those you have to pick those up because I'm telling you they are awesome awesome awesome yeah so well these were good the Starbucks for good these are good these are gonna last you a while sorry I had it spits them out off-camera but if you get you get a green apple flavor out of the sucker once you get down to probably not the best idea level review sounds on camera they do have a try thing charms even has a graph and you know what we might have reviewed those last year on camera I don't know you know you would have to do a search for charms undermine my channel but anyway these were both good I think kids would be thrilled to have any and things like I said because that candy a better caramel is so strong and then the star works for good too and I'm sure you'll be able to buy them in smaller packages so hopefully you enjoyed this review and thanks for watching [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "UirMWx9OdK8": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy crazy confusing place you call your dispensary today we are taking a look at one of those especially confusing what exactly are we talking about here kind of products that your dispensary may carry and what exactly kind of product is that well it's none other than other than tincture i guess what we're calling tincture in this day and age um and what we can also just call um emblematic of all of this sort of inconsistencies in uh weed policies especially when it comes to um dosage requirements so uh and how is that true well we are taking a look at an 800 milligram tincture that stretches the very definition of what tincture is and that is the five star extracts flavored tincture taste of peach oral uh tincture product again 800 milligrams of thc so what why am i so dubious it's not that i'm dubious of the 800 milligrams i'm um they have their lab testing results on this little confusingly curled up sticker here and you know shows the amount of thc in there i just bring this up because this isn't tincture by any traditional definition uh this is the exact same stuff that they were selling years ago when there was no limit on a thc in products and they called it syrup which was an allusion to the codeine sort of cough syrup that people used to drink i guess the idea was that it would get you so high it would be like coding i don't know i think but it shows you kind of how far off we are the mark here this is that exams exact same stuff which is now no longer able to be sold because the only thing you can sell over 100 milligrams is tincture so their notion or what they decided to do was not so much rewrite or create a new product but just simply rebrand existing stuff and i'm not saying that i actually don't know if they existed then or not but i've seen a lot of these syrup companies doing this cannabis is another one and i love them um but it i'm not blaming them i'm not saying it's anything wrong with them i'm just saying the laws are so stupid and screwy that way that you get weird stuff like um candy flavored syrup being called tincture which is nominally at least supposed to be medicinal um and uh this is again just like pink snow cone syrup except it will almost certainly taste gross now they do uh back when they used to sell this kind of stuff before they had you i think the consumption idea was you would take it like a syrup you'd mix it in with maybe soda or something here they really do suggest you take it like a tincture which i don't know if that sound is coming through it is just as thick as cough syrup so uh that seems kind of odious to me to have this much under your tongue of that thick goopy liquid but you know maybe we'll try it both ways and see uh so for an 800 milligram thc tincture i believe this was 60 bucks which is um more expensive than say your breeze uh kind of tinctures but kind of maybe in the range of some select those kind of levels so it's not the cheapest tincture out there either um uh it comes with this fancy and by fancy i mean the least fancy thing you've ever seen this little syringe for dosing which again thick thick syrup um so yeah not the cheapest um i've seen these five star extracts all over southern california especially in the long beach area and they usually come pretty highly recommended from folks as well uh and like all of our wheats reviews the way we're going to do this i know this is 800 milligrams i'm not going to do all 800 milligrams of this uh thing my guess is that it's gonna be quite gross um i uh when we do our tinctures the way i do all our edible reviews here on wheats is we do 100 milligrams because that's generally the size that you're going to buy in most edibles um and that's what we use as a baseline to review things off of so i will try to get as close to 101 8 of this bottle as possible really should have brought some scissors live and learn um i think i was able to just kind of pull it down yep there we go that smells like uh cheap gas station peach rings and weed lovely uh so yes as i said uh about 100 milligrams and then after i do all 100 milligrams it'll probably take me about i'm usually go over about an hour to do the whole thing i'll come back about two hours after that point let you know if this stuff is worth the hassle and the expense um my initial instinct is gonna be there are a lot of other tinctures out there that are cheaper and smaller so this one has some strikes against it already but we shall see you know maybe the thickness of the syrup something something yata cannabinoid receptors binding gabanoids done i don't know what i'm saying what i am now saying is wish me luck oh yes um our dosing uh instructions here on the back say that boy everything about this is just so cheaply uh or so rush put together 2.2 milliliters from here is 10 milligrams of thc our syringe is 3 milliliters um so you guys can do that conversion at home that's what roughly 13 milligrams ish in three milliliters uh in a full syringe which would be what how many of those in totality oh 13 times seven yeah like seven of those uh well no eight right yeah eight of these oh boy eight full ones of these that's gonna be fun well there's our oh my god okay they want me to put this all under my tongue that is ridiculous guys oh jesus okay well we'll try it um i'm guessing i'm gonna reserve taking this like normal syrup here we go oh [ __ ] um oh my god wow that is oh that's so bitter that is so insanely bitter wow wow oh my god oh that's um that is up there for most disgusting holy [ __ ] yuckers i've had to do that is nasty man at least i mean try to keep that all under your tongue as soon as it hits those taste buds ugh it is i mean it it tastes like cough syrup just straight up cough syrup ugh six more to go um i'm not going to be doing all of these sublingually i might try to do one more right here sublingually for you guys and then the remaining five i'm just gonna probably pour into a glass because and mix it with something this is just too much to bear [ __ ] okay oh [Music] oh oh holy christ disgusting oh it's still coming up oh jesus whoo well this is what i'm definitely suffering for you guys [ __ ] i hate this wow so what five six more six more of those for me everybody and just what um i'm gonna try to do these as uh over the next oh it might take me longer than an hour to get through all of these lovely little sons of guns but trust me i will and two hours after i get the last one of these hello buddy how are you doing the last after i get the last one these nasty sons of [ __ ] down i'll come right back here let you guys know if this is in any way worth all of the the uh rather prodigious amount of grotesqueness you have to stand ugh so far got a lot working against it sorry about the uh so much bitching um but you know we're just trying to be honest here and i will see you guys uh you know three three and a half hours pray for me see you soon [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about three and a half hours or so since i first said hello to you um in about 90 minutes since my last dropper under the tongue of this five star extracts the taste of peach as you can see or maybe our camera i'll show you the level is down to about 1 8 down as we're doing only 100 milligrams and uh this is gonna be a fun little end of this review because not very often anymore do i get sort of conflicted feelings about things it's pretty binary at this point this is good this isn't good buy this don't buy this like you know it's there aren't so many shades of gray but here um i i there's some yeah some interesting things um first and foremost does it work hell yes uh this is the 100 milligrams i did which was a [ __ ] lot um of liquid uh hit very hard i have no complaints in that department this is among the strongest tincture i have done um it is yeah the i don't know what the formulation is here but wow uh very very very um uh positive when it comes to your uh getting your your actual high off the product 100 milligrams this did the trick and then some um but there are other things about it that are that may make me say like well maybe not you maybe not want to invest in this and um we'll go back to the price again briefly it's more expensive than some other tinctures uh for theoretically less thc but i'm gonna guess that this is gonna i mean with as strong as that hundred milligrams that first one was um it's gonna feel very much as if it had the full thousand milligrams or more uh in comparison to other sort of equivalently strong tinctures out there um so yeah again price theoretically it's more expensive but it feels quite a bit stronger in some regards um the other big downside is how much you have to do for especially for tinctures so i brought a comparison here i'm working on this review of this breeze um cbd thc one to one spray um and this thing has a thousand milligrams of combined thc cbd and i've reviewed one that has a thousand milligrams of just pure thc so this is oh it's half a fluid ounce it's not even oh my god okay that uh changes things again this is a half a fluid ounce 0.5 fluid ounces um and it has a thousand milligrams of cannabinoids in it this is six fluid ounces and has 800 um uh milligrams of thc in it and that is crazy um i thought this originally was one ounce it's not it's half an ounce so i have to change my calculation thankfully just gotta double it um that makes this right here 15 times literally 15 times stronger per volume than the syrup and the syrup is revolting it never got easier to go down um i did take it sublingually every time i did not end up mixing it i just decided to stay consistent but it is truly gross i am very much looking forward to doing the rest of this bottle because it's it's a really pleasant high but [ __ ] is it nasty um it way worse than i mean i feel like such a prima donna now with these um these are nothing compared to this so it's real gross real strong and you have to do a [ __ ] ton of it but it is real strong and it will get the job done you just gotta kind of suffer through it um and you know uh kind of hard to say whether or not it's uh you know that that is ultimately gonna come down to you those factors whether it's worth it or not um if i want a uh a really powerful high this may be something i go to in the future but if i'm looking for something more casual something that i don't want to just have to put on a clothespin over my nose and just gack down probably stay away um and before i go guys normally i like to save the cherry on top so a little something extras a little just extra recommendation that's not weed related um i usually like to save those for our favorite you know overwhelming two thumbs up style reviews however today let's give you one that i'm a little conflicted about not conflicted about the actual thing but conflicted about oh man it'll just make you uh feel uh conflicted in your soul uh and that is what a terrible segue by the way um i was trying to think of like oh [ __ ] i want to recommend this book what's a transition don't do it while you're high on five-star extracts try to think of one beforehand anyways the uh book is called oh my god why did i not look up the title exactly as hot as it is called um ah yes the book is called evicted poverty and prophet in the american city by matthew desmond uh released in 2016. uh i just finished it earlier today uh it was the pulitzer prize or a pulitzer prize winner uh for nonfiction in 2016. and uh dessert absolutely deserves it it is a book that won't make you feel very good it is a book that will uh continue to you know make you realize oh boy we've been kind of living in a collective delusion for a while but hey no better time to burst that bubble than in the middle of a pandemic so give evicted poverty and profit in in the american city a chance it it's as good as everybody has ever told you that it is if anybody has ever told you about it um but again if you're not looking for something that's going to thoroughly depress you to your core avoid uh and that's the conflict and because we were conflicted about our five star extracts the taste of peach super strong but also you got to do a lot of it and it tastes like rotting ass so thumbs up for evicted poverty and profit in the uh american city thumbs sideways for how it makes you feel and thumb sideways for the taste of ass boy this has gone long you can see how strong it is when i ramble it's because i'm high thanks so much for watching guys be sure to stay high but of course even more importantly stay healthy my friends it's crazy out there and in the meantime oh i already said stay high and stay healthy [ __ ] do those things and i'll see on the next review goodbye", "LLzin4WP29Y": "we've a presence on you boy early stay we'd be doing a review on crafty cannabis once again another strain another new strain candy at whoa gee shoutouts top artists

all I was thinking was it's gonna taste like Apple it tastes like a my eyes did not remember as a kid I mean they still exist but as a kid I've seen him a lot candy apples go to the bodega I'm from Jersey so every quarter was a corner store every corner bodega okay I went to the bodega and as a little kid I always seen them candy ass never got one I never really liked it matter of fact I don't even think I would've tried it as a kid I just wasn't into it I was like damn an apple covered weekend he and caramel and peanuts laughs not for me I think I tasted it one time I didn't bite into it I licked it cuz I was a little kid and I was scared such lifting they taste bad the toilet remembers the candy and the caramel taste fast-forward a thousand million years later now I'm a grown man I have not even a candy apple tasting this I would assume this is exactly what a candy apple tastes like for everyone out there whether you're grown up or you're a kid if you have an addiction to candy apples right here my friends this is what you're going to need the candy oops oh you're gonna need it it tastes exactly like it I know I know I know it's been a long time I know I only licked it one time but this is what it tastes like I promise you you know Andy does not lie try it out for yourself Cheers okay like I told you last time my stranger knew everybody's palate you know your tongue everybody's tongue is always gonna taste something different than person so just because I tell you I don't taste Atlas doesn't mean that you will not take that much me personally I taste caramel I taste I don't want to say it cherry well I taste some type of candy which you either outer shell and the layer of the Apple obviously I don't taste peanuts that would be kind of weird but yeah all I taste is caramel and candy the caramel is in stronger than the candy the candy the candy is a powerfully them but you taste the candy a lot too and that the caramel is is there it's very consistent I just really wish our technology was also here stick this in the camera and then you must put your lips on it actually hit it cuz I wish you guys forget this for those of you that have tried the candy apple then you probably know what I mean that it tastes like any other house caramel has a cherry candy space once again I'm sorry but I do not know the percentage of this but I do know all of crafte Candice's they it starts out like 70% and it goes up there's nothing lower than 7% from what I remember from what I've had nothing lower than 70% and everything is higher than 70% which is don't

apple flavor this is just a Jolly Rancher on a stick basically it should taste exactly the same as you know the original Jolly Rancher candies yeah it's from the Hershey Company Jolly Rancher classic hard candy okay so let me go ahead and open it if I can open it up see yes it's green of course okay here's what it is less clear than I thought it would be actually I thought it would be like a clear candy let me go ahead and all right tried it and it tastes exactly like the regular kind Stan flavor and nothing really new just kind of in a different form than the standard and this is not new at all like it's lollipop Jolly Rancher has existed for quite a while but yeah there it is Jolly Rancher lollipop", "ATYn-KBNgc8": "what's up everybody welcome back to another episode of strange city today guys gonna be reviewing mile-high suckers um we're gonna got the we got the mixed berry flavor working with 10 milligrams of CBD and 30 milligrams of THC so that is what we have got going guys just getting into it here and open it up for you it does have a yes do have to bite it or open it with scissors because it is childproof guys so do mind that that it is not gonna have a seal I would open it the other way I just walked up so you got your lollipop here it's got an imprint of THC with an M underneath to say medical or to dictate medical tastes really good but we're gonna get out of here guys see you shortly 30 minutes an hour so I'm like that not sure gonna let this kick in and we'll come back and I just loved you guys off meant to do it a piece but with bad guys to review this after we're high from it peace guys what's up everybody welcome back to the second part of this lollipop mile ha sucker review guys mixed berry flavor from mile high 30 milligrams of THC 10 of CBD picked up at affinity guys today the repeat that we're doing on this is gonna be the more of how to fix and things like that the first part was more of the taste I'm still eating on it obviously I didn't finish it should knock me out went to sleep but very very good guys um the taste overall when you first start into a lollipop I pop second taste is gonna be that dry Hoshi powdery type taste I don't know that house to describe it you kind of have to eat inedible to illegal edible to to kind of get that flavor or that that taste for it so thank you paying a my Lighting's perfect leave it right there so we're pancake being my lighting studio basically really really good guys I would give this a good a good eight or nine out of ten I would say it eight out of ten the flavor is pretty strong on it of candidates I have have had some edibles that geez what are you doing that don't taste as strong of cannabis or that powdery taste I'm not sure if that's really doable with a lollipop but from edibles that have had those chocolate bars and drinks and stuff like that they have tended to be a little less weedy if you will and a little more of the lollipop or the other taste so that's not really hindering the full experience of you know an enjoyable edible so that being said guys basically this stuff is like edibles are a full-body hi to me I don't ever get edibles in my head on they never messed with me in the head it's always a body high and it's always something I don't really ever feel until about 75 milligrams but this was pretty good man I I didn't mean finished all of it i I did feel some effects from it which would just be kind of lighter body and [ __ ] your body weight seems lighter I'm just kind of floating you know spaced out but it's really good edible overall guys and for something to just kind of walk down the street if you will and eat which is illegal so don't do it but yeah it's a very concealable very discreet way of getting high you know around people or you know around around nobody just to do yourself if you don't like smoking cannabis or anything like that this lollipop would be great for you guys that's gonna be it for the mixed berry mile-high sucker review guys if you like this video give it a thumbs up below and subscribe for more peace guys", "U65plLwF2Ro": "what's up everybody it's your boy heavens and this is my smoking channel today's video is going to be all by the title you could already tell what today's video is going to be but it's the part 2 to the yummy karma wicked apple drops this is my review of the wicked apple drops like the last video was just me in taking them and ingesting it and like showing you guys me opening the package and [ __ ] like that and taking the product and i was just i reviewed the taste and [ __ ] like that but now i can actually review how the product makes me feel or would make you feel if you were to take it as well if you have a high tolerance like i do then it's gonna be like it's going to creep up on you it's not going to smack you really hard uh but it will definitely be a noticeable uh addition to your high like the last time i took a thousand milligram tincture i didn't smoke for the first two hours but this time i decided to smoke i smoked a blunt and i smoked i took a couple blinkers i was vaping the whole time but i was vaping the last time i took the uh tincture as well but this time i just didn't know i was sore oh i smoked this time instead i'm really high as you guys probably already know a thousand milligrams will do to you but um mostly where i feel it is like a heavy body high i don't really feel too inebriated like mentally or psychologically it's mostly just like a heavy sedative feeling if you have a high tolerance and you think just because you take a thousand milligrams you're gonna get really high it's not gonna work you'll get to like probably a nice eight or nine but you're not going to get that um stone cold like 10 like half higher than balls right now like that you'd get if you were to just take a tolerance break the tolerance break is the only thing that'll bring your tolerance that low the thousand milligrams is the thing it will bring you the closest to that feeling i feel but it's still not um the end-all be-all that'll get you to where you need to be um but it is a really good dose i like taking the thousand milligrams the first time and the way i could tell that it was kicking in this time as well as the first time was i started get this really warm type of body feeling like a really like i'm really warm kind of like the dab sweats but in a more subtle type of way i'm vaping her now the juice i'm vaping on is my big bottle code it's called like blueberry muffin or some [ __ ] blueberry cake i think that's not what this video is about it's about these uh wicked apple drops by yummy karma um would i get them again i think yeah but i definitely wanna uh i told myself i was gonna wait this time until i took a tolerance break but i didn't so next time if i pick them up i definitely am going to wait until i take a tolerance break so i can see how the thousand milligrams affect me uh when tolerance isn't an issue but either way the thousand milligrams definitely will get you high this video isn't as long as my last video but it is my part two the review to the yummy uh karma drops i won't say it again i said it too many times but if you guys did enjoy this video make sure to slap the like button down below if you guys have any comments or criticisms like always let me know in the comment section i'll make sure to respond to you guys as soon as i can uh but if you guys enjoyed the overall video make sure that you're subscribed so i know to keep on producing content that's similar to this but yeah i'm just big chilling if you guys can hear a sound this whole time that's because i'm literally [ __ ] uh soaking my feet right now like real [ __ ] but uh yeah i'm just big chilling hope you guys are as uh chill as i am today as fated as i am uh until next time you guys stay faded stay high peace out", "KVKmLQ4HwZ0": "hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review on the medicated hard candies this one is great so it's a hundred there's the 100 milligrams of THC right there it's from cannabis no I did the blue raspberry one before and I I didn't taste blue raspberry at all so hopefully this one tastes like grape I'll take them all why not so open and all these flippin things I can never okay always stuck together but it's not just so like I'll show you what they look like Thanks so they look like this like usually come like this these ones are because of the heat but they they come like this so they're 25 milligrams each you get four blocks which equals the hundreds milligrams I'll just a little piece so they look I broke it off as I was talking they look like that just little little cubes so it tastes like a little bit like grape and that was probably add I can taste the grape in these okay I can still taste the the THC but overall the grape flavored hard candies from Canada's mom are good that's like sometimes you get a little bit of THC and the rest of time it's grape so it's just about 6:00 p.m. right now this usually takes like an hour and a bit to kick in usually I'll be back alright told you guys know when it kicks in you know all the good stuff but so what I'm gonna do actually cuz it takes so long I'm going to roll a joint and I'll smoke that while I wait for this to kick in and it should be decent ah-ah-ah I'll really join up and smoke that and come back and let you guys know [Music] all about the hard candies from cannabis no okay I'm back and as you can see this stuff has kicked in so I smoked it what I told you guys I was going to roll the joint I smoked the gorge and if you want to see that part you'll have to go and watch the video before mine or yet before mine in its video I smoked it so I took I took this at 6 and I want to say like around seven ish I could start to feel it and it was like oh this feels good and then so then I was like you know what I'm gonna wait a little bit just to see if anything is different or so I waited and I was like so lolling around because it's 8:30 right now and this stuff is I didn't realize how strong the scats and like you feel good but you don't want to do anything like you're like everybody I would recommend you take a shower cuz the shower feels good if the reason I took the showers because I wasn't feeling very well and cuz I just kept on getting stronger and like I tried to sit down and relax and that didn't help and then I was getting like these pains like it was like really really deep into like that the area where sometimes it's painful anyways and yeah like I didn't feel well so I took a shower and that that helped okay I feel like better like I don't feel like I'm gonna throw up cuz that's what I felt like I'm not really sure why but like if you were to do this at somebody else's house um you might as well bring like your pajamas or something cuz I think you wouldn't be leaving yet BRE thirsty on this this is a this isn't oh my [ __ ] like this is really good get in cannabis Mel cuz their stuffs good yeah you really don't feel like doing much like um you're in the shower for like a long time and it's like really hot so that you know that feels good whatever but then it gets to the point that there's like too much Steve in there so you know whatever and then you just feel like doing like nothing but you may want to find like a good place to sit or lay in watch TV or just think about things or just really do nothing I wouldn't recommend like reading a book cuz I don't really think you'd get far you me at this point in like I'll keep busy but like if you were to read a book I think right now I'm like if you started to you would you wouldn't get very far like you would you would have I could forget just talking about oh okay if you're reading a book like you may get maybe ten minutes and then you probably fall asleep because this stuff makes your eyes like really heavy like they just like they feel like heavy hit down here like I think anybody could tell that you were high because there would be no hiding that one not only hungry or anything thirsty yes but like I'm not hungry or anything so that's good because I think if you were to eat a lot on this right now just because I mean probably like not feel very well like you'd probably throw up or something yeah and the grape um the grape flavor yeah I think it's good I so far that's the only one that I've had actually tasted like what it said cuz usually like I say I could just taste the THC in it oh I am so thirsty what's relaxes you I find to like your I think if you had like sore muscles you know from doing whatever running or I don't know just it kind of like eases everything like it just kind of like your muscles don't feel all like like in a like in a ball like however like that they feel more like you know just like they're just relaxed so if you have pain regarding that this would take it away if you have like just general aches and pains this would be also the stuff that you would like to sit down to like this is the stuff that if I would like to be sitting on a porch and like in a porch I say in on Auto Parts I hope to god I didn't say invited yes sitting on a porch like you know like the farmland type of stuff I can't like a great big it's like I'm just meadow way out there and you can just sit in your rocking chair and just look out into the meadow um this would be the stuff to do it on because you may find like it would be peaceful because you wouldn't be around like neighbor you wouldn't have neighbors and stuff and I think that would be something good for people to experience you may find like a peace with yourself or something like that I don't not really sure so just walking away yeah I don't even I don't even know what I'm gonna do but I have to stay busy because I will fall asleep everywhere looks so comfortable yeah you're not like this high isn't getting any like lower whatever it's not decreasing it's just there like it's it's just there where like no matter like you tried to think it off or just like it's just there like your whole everywhere your whole body is high I guess which is a little weird and I never thought of it like that but I guess so right because that's so I don't know unless it I don't know maybe I just want to talk about stuff I can't um what else what else does this make you feel like doing mmm if you had a lot of time on your hands and you wanted to redecorate your say living room or something the base would be the stuff to do that because you'd be so concentrated on how you know everything looks and how blends in together and stuff like that this is like the stuff that I will say to that you would want to say if there was like one Christmas thing that you did by yourself you know I don't think putting up the tree would be that but if it could be maybe you'd anyways or whatever this is the stuff that you would want to want to do it on because you'd be doing that but then you have like a lot of thoughts just about things and hmm I don't remember what I was talking about so I will have to start I need a subject which I have no idea what it is you feel kind of like exhausted on this like you just you know such a hard day Wayne you did have a hard day but if you didn't have a hard day this stuff makes you feel like you had like just an exhausting day that's good seeing them like like now like it's getting closer to 9:00 and you're hungry like it's a little bit there now but it's not like you need to like be something really good and you're you may want it but then you may wait like Oh see I told you it makes you I feel tired and your eyes really worried I couldn't imagine doing like anything real like like I know there's people hide like drink and drive and I know there's people that do other drugs and drive including lead or edibles and whatever but I don't know why you would drive when you feel like this I mean yeah you would be cautious but I don't know I just I don't know I to me that's not a very smart thing to do but you know just my opinion and um so anyways it's an oh my [ __ ] that's what it feels like to me that's like a whole review of it right there you get it at cannabis no I the package is not here but it's the medication hard candies grape yet four cubes and it's each cube is 25 milligrams of THC um makes you feel like doing nothing I'm very happy before like you get to this part I'm still happy I just feel more relaxed if that makes any sense I can relaxed and I'm happy relaxed not like well yes you can be pissed off and relax because that doesn't even make sense like I'm mmm I think I just need to somewhere I think so that's that's everything that's I don't that's everything I don't have anything else to talk about get a cannabis mom just charlie so that's it that's all bye", "VeH8zfDrt9k": "[Music] hi welcome to infuse these the cooking show where everything is infused especially me today we're making lollipops this episode is brought to you by the body fast herbal infuse er you can save money on my favorite herbal infusion machine with the cove ruff house at the urban futurecom here's what you need to make infused lollipops you need 1 cup of granulated white sugar I have a cup of light corn syrup or a quarter cup of water and 2 to 3 tablespoons of infused tincture you can use alcohol or glycerin tinctures 2 teaspoons of flavored extract such as orange lemon mint or whatever flavor you like 6 to 8 drops of food coloring which is optional you'll also need some lollipop molds and a candy thermometer the first step is going to be to make your tincture if you don't have one already and you can use a vegetable glycerin or an alcohol tincture either way though you're going to need to deke are you for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes then put them in the hopper of the mighty fast if you're using that machine and then you're going to add in about a liter of 151 proof alcohol you don't want to go to the hundred ninety or any stronger with the herb oil infuser machine it will burn it up and then you choose the mighty long cycle that'll give you the right temperature so that four hours later you have a nice tincture just like this then you just need to strain it through the provided hemp cloth or whatever cheesecloth however you want to strain it out put it in a jar and then you have your your infused tincture that you can use for any kind of recipes such as this here now we're gonna proceed along now with the rest of the recipe we're gonna take our two sugars our that's both the corn syrup and the white sugar or put those into a very small saucepan I'm gonna put that over a medium to medium-high heat and just let it start melting and you also want ahead and add your water and at this point what we're doing is we're just making all this syrup turn into sort of a simple syrup and then we're gonna bring it up to a boil it won't be long all of yours Sugar's will be cooked together it'll turn real clear and start boiling and at that point you want to start monitoring the temperature make sure you have a candy different a candy thermometer that will go up to over 300 degrees because that's we're gonna do we're gonna boil this it'll take a little while but watch it very carefully because it can get hot really fast once it starts getting hot but as soon as it hits 300 degrees exactly we're gonna take that off of the heat [Music] and then that part we're gonna let it start cooling down now you're going to also monitor the cooling process because when eight hits to 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's where we want to start adding in the rest of the ingredients so I'm adding I'm using orange because I want to orange flavored lollipops here so magadh about two teaspoons of the orange flavoring then I'm also I'm heading in some yellow food coloring a little bit of red food coloring to make the orange lollipops and now I'm adding in the tincture you can use two to three tablespoons here I'm adding two I don't want to be too strong but you can add in two to three and you can evaporate it down if you want to first but it's gonna be okay but you can see now when I start mixing anything together it's still 250 degrees so it's going to start evaporating and bubbling out the remaining water for you already we're just going to continue mixing that down by hand very carefully it's still very hot until you see it'll all incorporate together and become very sort of translucent and sort of unified in color and you need to move pretty quickly here because you don't want to the candy to harden up which it does pretty quickly so you can put the lollipop sticks into the molds in advance and you won't have to be rushing through it like we did there but then we're going to pour that carefully pour the candy into the molds until you cover up the sticks of the lollipops and then after you have all your molds filled up you're gonna let that chill best in the refrigerator or freezer for one to two hours till they get fully hardened [Music] and once they're fully hardened you can pop them out of the shells really easy you can use these silicone molds that I used here they're perfect for this this recipe had filled up three of the molds that came with four in the pack but just filled up three of them came with the sticks if you like that mighty fast herbal infuser and these kind of recipes please check out the herbal infuser calm if you want to buy one save money with the code roughhouse

that's grape flavored hundreds milligrams of THC this is the green apple same thing 100 grand 100 milligrams of THC and then this one is blue raspberry and 100 milligrams of THC so I'm gonna be doing a review today I'm gonna pick one and then I'll review that flavor and whatever and then so on I'll pick another day and I'll do you know grape and then the green apple so today I've decided to go with the the blue raspberry you get all of these a flavor at Canada's mo and I had a feeling that because it's summer and because it's hot I think all the cubes have stuck together so there's the top piece there's this yeah yeah doesn't have a smell but that's how they look so you get four cubes so I'm just gonna put it all in my mouth that's all because I can't even like it would be too hard to even try to break so if you're going to eat these individually they're 25 milligrams of THC per cube let's try I'm not really tasting the blue raspberry yet I'm tasting THC mm-hmm I could teach something but I don't know if it's the blue raspberry just like a little bit of a sweetness but um it's trying to cover the THC but it's not doing a very good job the THC I just coming out I just read in the back here they're from can occur concentrate so that's maybe that's who makes them and Canada does know sells them or I don't know I know that you get these at Ken abysmal they're slowly starting to break off the cubes but yeah I'm not uh not really I'm not really tasting the roster I taste something a little bit sweet but then like the THC is very overpowering I guess you could say so next five o'clock right now I'll come back when these kick in let you know what they're like once it's like usually they're pretty good I've never had a problem never ever had a problem with anything from Canada smell okay so I'm gonna let these dissolve come back when this is kicked in here it is again the medic medicated hard candies Canada's no I'll be back my kicks in okay so I'm back and this is kicked in [Music] what happened was okay so it started to kick in maybe a little bit after 6:00 and I thought well maybe like it's just like this is gonna be it type of thing so what happened was I rolled a joint and smoked it and if you want to see that part you'll have to see watch the video before this one because ed and I are but with making videos like on at the same time so that wasn't a very smart decision for me to smoke the joint but it's it's done stop it I can do now just like sit and wait it out so this is very good stuff I don't really feel like doing anything though like yeah I don't know we just don't feel like doing anything I'm very thirsty and there's no need to smoke a joint just maybe wait the extra five minutes cuz that's what I should have that's what I would have that's what I should have done is wait um maybe the extra five minutes and then I would have been like oh you know what I'm not gonna smoke this drink is here it comes but no there's another don't do what Donna does I'm just drinking coffee because it tastes good right now like it always tastes good but right now it tastes really good and um yeah go ahead go to cannabis mom and get those the hard candies all the packages over there darn it I should have grabbed it maybe I still will keep we'll hang on grab it and go back over there and show the I put my coffee down I don't think that's in the same place but okay this medicated hard candies getting my cannabis no they're good they're very good if you're just starting out then just try the one cube I don't I don't know don't do like more than one but one kit would be good um any any any um like any pains or anything I that I don't feel anything right now it feels good feels good and then at the same time like you don't feel like do anything either so you're not really enjoying it but you are in another way [Music] like I can talk about a lot of things but it probably has nothing to do like I fit you know what today was like the type of day that that like it's like and sort of like in the middle of August and [Music] it wasn't like too hot nor was it like to hold it was just like it was just right and I was just like I don't know like it reminded me of like when I was a kid and stuff that like those days those summer days like that like they were you know you'd be riding your bike or doing whatever like it was just uh it was just like a good day I can't remember those type of days and it was a good day and then at the same time I think like sometimes you get a couple like hot days in August and but then after that cuz like September's coming right and sometimes in September you get really really nice warm days which are okay but um the days like how today was like you know Falls coming and I love fall like I think it's like the best the best season out of all of them I just really love fall so that's what today and I don't know why I'm telling you this but yeah that's what that's what today was like it was like a perfect like temperature-wise day like at the same time like it when you're doing this it's very like real axing and stuff mm-hmm I'm not really hungry at all like it I'm not saying that I won't get hungry but uh hungry at all like so it doesn't really give you the munchies not not Radia way like it's um it's just about seven o'clock so yeah I'd say like the Munchie partly good I don't I don't feel hungry so my eyes feel very heavy though and yours you need a drink always cuz it really dries you out and what else I don't know I like the I like the edibles and then I like joints bonds are okay but like I think edibles are beta bowls and the joints so just are my thing I like to do that stuff because well the edibles like you just eat it and it it's a longer high so whatever reason that you're taking it for you you'll be good for a couple hours which why not and the joints well I just find those easier to inhale yeah I like to just smoke a joint it's okay and to do a bong thing like you're a bong toke I don't know what just I can't get it all in so like that's why they like I like the joints but like if I have to I can do the bong toes it just takes a little bit more or longer to the whole process type thing [Music] know what to say I can't know what to talk about I just don't know what to tell you guys like should I say this and I can probably know it's open I feel really good though this is this is a nice side this is a nice feeling I'm [Music] like I'm not paranoid like if somebody knocked on the door then I would be like oh [ __ ] even though there's nothing even to smell I would just be paranoid because how am I going to say to somebody like how am I even gonna talk to somebody because like my eyes you could just [ __ ] tell but you know you just know like I couldn't say oh no I have somebody's I don't want you I and I'd be like oh no like [ __ ] you can't even I can't even say that so yes if somebody was knocking at the door I I would get a little bit worried about that but otherwise it'll is like I wasn't that or whatever like I'm I'm okay I I just feel really good and relaxed and um it's just stuff that like if it makes you feel that relaxed that you kind of wish that you were sitting on a dock and just looking out there onto the water like you were just looking that's what or if you're like sitting on a dog and it was like either you know you were watching the Sun Rise or you know if you're watching inside today it's that kind of relaxing relaxed feeling and it goes well with coffee this this is what you feel and it feels like it feels like that except I'm not sitting on the dock watching the Sun set or rise up so but anyways that's what it makes you you feel like well sons like Hannah over there but it's not setting yet this I'll already be done this before it even said so those annoys I don't know if you can hear them you know those buzzing noises I think it's crickets or something or some type of insect you know that highlight noise that you hear but I remember I was a kid I don't know if you can hear her anyways as a kid because um like Killarney is not that big of a place so there's like lots of bush and stuff and and there's like little trails and stuff like that so like if you're out playing with your friends and then you guys decided to go on this trail and or go whatever into the long grass or whatever like stuff like that ain't always you'd get further out there and you can hear those buzzing those I don't know what insect that is and often sit like a cricket or oh I don't know what it is but so anyways when I hear that stuff that reminds you know I was a kid it's funny how like I don't know if it's like a 40 thing or it's gotta be maybe like 40 high and in your 40s or something and like when you think of like certain uh sound not yeah like sounds are like just certain things and you think like way but like when you were a kid and it seems like it was a long freaking time ago like it's not like you know when you know when you're 20 and you go yeah when I was a kid well when you that wasn't you know you're still kind of our kid at 20 but if 40s yeah it makes things seem a long time ago when maybe because if it is a long time ago or maybe because you just feel like that cuz like 40 years though that's that's pretty long I'm going to have to go make another coffee soon because I'm just about done this one and I need to like this bad has to be he liked me because I took everything off and washed it and [ __ ] I just don't feel like doing it no but it has to be done just like it just seems like it's gonna be a like a Wyatt like a couple minute job ooh yeah I was gonna turn into like this you know Ted minitor probably like 10 to 15 minutes to make this bad like that's I should have made it before or like while I was eating the edibles I should have made it then because they would have been done in a couple minutes now the only thing I have done is like I put the pillowcases on the on the pillows like the sheets and stuff are here but like the what is it like the mattress protector thing like I wash side and that's dried and everything else but hmm after you'll get that on the line on the clothesline so I was like go down and get that come back put that on and then put the sheets on and like and you gotta put like the blanket and comforter part so I'm really not looking forward to that but you know why I think um I I think I just need some more coffee and they need to just go sit down and you just think a little um I think that's it like I think I'm just gonna I'm just gonna enjoy it that's time I was you know worries about anything unless somebody knows so let's that's my review on it skid here's the package and get it at can abismo that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "F-Ki-DqiXBQ": "hi I'm for traders Wonderland cat and I'm doing a review today for dr. Bob's medicated cannabis lollipop it's a 40 milligram THC lollipop I'm gonna be your flavored it's a hybrid by the package never had one of these before that everyone told me they're really good it's actually a pretty big lollipop can't really taste the fact that it's medicated which is a big plus for me because I don't really like the Medicaid taste and I got root beer and it really really tastes like root beer so oh no I have to say pretty good review I like it so far stay tuned for more thank you for watching join me on Fort Wayne nurse comm be my fan follow my Instagram", "21JMBlc-5M0": "well hello this is Darnell I'm 19 coming at you from my kitchen oh yes I am mm-hmm how the [ __ ] he doing I'm doing well I went back to the drawing board and I'm gonna bring you guys some Jolly Ranchers hard candy and suckers I've done these three times now and they've come out perfect each time so first let me just apologize that I'm not doing the demonstration live with you I will do one though I promise so this is what you're gonna need you ready 1 and 1/2 cup sugar 3/4 cup Caro syrup 1/2 cup water citric acid your flavor and color and a gel paste food corn okay candy molds sticks a candy thermometer a knife or a vegetable cutter an 8 by 9 pan or an 8 by 8 panel all of these products can be purchased at Walmart or Target or anywhere like that with the exception of the citric acid you probably will have to get the citric acid online at Amazon I didn't find it in any grocery store around the food coloring gel that I used there's a Wilson brand and I didn't really care for it because the colors work that vibrant so I went with a generic brand that's called great value that I bought here for 2 bucks and I use the tiny bit of the red ok this flavoring they sell at Walmart there's two in a pack they're considered a dram you used one DRAM per Sippi so you will need one of these in the flavor that you like punched in paper and a saucepan and that is it my friend that is it okay so this is what you do I'm gonna pick a rib first like always tell ya this channel is for eighteen and older you know this right cannabis and cannabis enthusiast and if you are not going my friend get the [ __ ] off my channel would you subscribe up there comment down there hit that Bell if you want to know how I'm gonna go why I put up any videos like this you never know what a girl's gonna put up you just don't know give me a flavor hit that thumbs up on your way up oh it takes a second if you love this recipe I thought about going back old school I was raised on a farm and we homesteaded and I remember Carol syrup water and sugar and flavoring and you had candy so when I brought you the recipe for the gelatin I thought it was gonna be a little bit easier and I've had a couple people that are having some problems with their butter floating on the top and I bet it's probably because the temperature is off one or two degrees now a couple things I want to tell you fYI when you're making candy have everything ready to go prepared ready to go eyeing your pan with parchment paper have your thermometer out your molds out sticks out your knife and everything okay so now what you're going to do is we're gonna take a rib you're gonna put down in the comments what you're ripping on and now I'm going to tell you how to make it choose that just makes everything perfect alright grab a medium-sized saucepan take it and put it on the stove on a medium heat and you're going to add 3/4 cup of your Karo syrup and your 1/2 cup of water you're going to let that dissolve until your Caro syrup is completely dissolved then you're going to add your 1 and 1/2 cups of granulated sugar keep stirring it mixing it up once that's all dissolved stick your candy thermometer on the side of your pan make sure that the bottoms not touching your pan or you'll get it false reading have your parchment paper in your pan lined your mold ready to go and your knife ready to go sometimes when you score you want to keep a little cooking oil on hand so have that out as well and we're going to talk about that once you get your sugar and your corn syrup and all that's incorporating it's boiling really nicely you continue stirring that so your sugars don't burn until you reach about a 250 degrees when your candy thermometer at that point I stopped stirring and I just watched my boil I don't walk away from my candy and then tell my candy thermometer reads 310 and when it reaches 310 I'll remove it from the stove place it on my cookie sheet I'm going to add my 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid my one dram of watermelon my gel red food coloring a slight amount because I did watermelon candies I infused my candies and also used two tablespoons of gorilla glue tincture and 6 grams of teeth by no means do you need to any of that in your candies and you can have that as an option if you are adding cannabis or tinctures to your candies please do that after you've removed it off the stove incorporate it when you incorporate your citric acid your flavoring and your gel mix it up really well Labe pour it in your pan and just set it on your cookie sheet okay at this point now you're just going to watch your solution it's going to begin to cool and as it cools you want to come by and grease your knife or your vegetable cover and you're just going to take your product that you pick off the stove and that's in your pan and if you look at my Instagram you'll see how I scored it now we're just going to imagine that this is our candy for a second if you will grease your knife or your vegetable cutter and just score right here in the center I worked Center out and then I turned it and worked Center out and just kept turning that now just a couple points if your candy won't score it's probably because it's too hot if your knife is sticking to it it's probably because you don't have enough oil on it so come back and try it again if you score it and it didn't work your candy will just wine itself back out again just periodically go back and do it depending on where you live and the altitude of where you live is how long it'll take and it's generally around 8 to 10 sometimes 12 minutes and you'll be able to score it then just set it take it out of your pan set it on your cookie sheet because you're scoring it let it sit on your counter for an hour and you can come back and you can break them into pieces now I made suckers and I made Jolly Rancher candies wat kaminin and puts him in a pretty jar for me and I did six seconds and these are what the candies look like they're perfect and then I made up a little package of ten and I usually do like though giveaways and gifts and things like that with some suckers and some granola bars or whatever these are very perfect size they're just like the Jolly Ranchers they're amazing hard hard hard this will make about I'd say 35 to 45 pieces of candy depending on how big you cut your candy pieces up so if you have any questions let me know once your candy is all cooled and you've broken it up and you want to make some suckers I made square ones Walmart also has round ones like this what you do is take some of your broken pieces of candy mine are stuck because I'm videoing take and stick them in the molds and what I do is I really shove them down in the malls to well sometimes the mold looks deformed I turn my oven on at 275 I place this on a cookie sheet and I leave it in the oven for 15 to 17 minutes until the candy becomes a gel again then I take it out and I place my six in it a couple minutes after that to make sure they don't fall over and you think you've got candy now because I make these in blueberry in fire watermelon and an apple I sometimes have a lot of variety pieces left over and I take them and break them up in a baggie and I stick them in the mold so that my suckers come out all different kinds apple cherry strawberry so that's what I did with these so those end up being like that posh posh if you will medicated candies that I make sucker southern they're amazing I do apologize that people had issues with that recipe I did go back to the drawing board and I thought shizzle man homesteading sugar corn syrup and water and play-doh you got candy so star go back to homestead you're not good you guys are going to love them these you can store up to a year in your freezer on your counter for a good month or longer if they last that long these tastes exactly like Jolly Ranchers this is a must citric acid and the reason is is because citric acid gives candy its pop gives it its flavor gives Jolly Ranchers they're their sharpness their sourness and if you don't use this you won't get that Jolly Rancher flavor so make sure you get your flavoring of yours whatever one you like watermelon out or whatever use a little bit of paste they have the typical colors for Jolly Ranchers and use your citric acid you can use as much as a teaspoon of this the more you use I've used it it's better just don't go over a teaspoon and your sticks check your thrift stores go over and then I don't know where they have all the paperwork and all the books and coloring books and things like that they always have craft step-over they're not even open yet you can find your sticks with my duties since they're pretty cheap these molds Walmart everything here you can get at Walmart I will leave a description at the recipe below under this video and the only thing that you'll need to purchase online is probably your citric acid because I couldn't find it in grocery store unless you have a candy store near you I hope you guys love the recipe again any questions please let me know yes someone asked me for a how to clean glass bomb so I'm gonna bring that to you as well I have not forgotten about that she's been really really busy with the holidays and everything coming up orders are coming in so if you guys want your holiday orders get him in because miss Deb does get busy I'd love to fulfill your orders I hope you're having an amazing night I love you guys so so much and again I'm so sorry you had trouble with the last recipe I posted they bring you recipes because they're simple easy and they're [ __ ] good and if I screw up I'm sorry just make a girl aware slap a [ __ ] in the head and I'll go back to the drawing board and bring you another one click one letter one tree right you", "JdogWWkL6tI": "you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey it's Lucky Penny shop and it's time for something pretty fun looking it's a sour flush toilet candy yes it's in the shape of your basic toilet and there's two plungers which are lollipops on the ends and let's just take a look at the toilet seat it says sour flush and the toilet top is peeking out and there's water pouring out he's got the two plungers there green apple this says warning not for children under three small parts and to seventy nine and I have to say it's pretty intriguing so let me see if I can just slice yes I can without cutting myself well here we go we're going in captain we're going in alright so let's get our plungers off because I want to see what's in the back section of this toilet looks like this lifts this lifts oh I gotta lift up lid now that's interesting let's see what's in the back here now I have to cut this and then maybe it's storage or something maybe not maybe it doesn't open looks like it wants to open I'm gonna say no on the back okay just thought maybe it was some kind of strange little storage area there is the plunger device so you can flush sure I mean the flusher device so you can flush your toilet and then these are pretty neat looking green it's like a light green but they're green apple so there's some set up time here it's like a project to get to your toilet candy you know why don't I just cut it right so I'm gonna do that straight down there we go that's what this is kind of sticky that's why I'm struggling back out all right there's one plunger now let's get to this toilet lid I'm gonna store my other one in there because it just looks cool stored there you know doesn't stay straight let's get this off now such as peels I'm healing my plastic isn't our trick you could do that to people where you take cellophane and cellophane there toilet seat it's kind of what happened all right now let me just take the one that's sealed here and get my toilet stuff ready to eat a piece of plastic I dropped don't want to eat that never you know there's a good amount in there so if I stick this down it's this hole a piece of the lollipop there stick that goes way down okay I think I'm ready cue the toilet flushing sound okay don't know how to do that so now I guess I have to wet this with saliva I know it's disgusting and stick it in my toilet look at that plunge it plunging my toilet and now I have a nice sugary coated green apple lollipop hmm it's tasty it's very good is it super sour no I'm gonna say it it's definitely not super sour not like a warhead that's for sure sometimes I make snorting sounds now that one was good much bigger bike tour lick because look how much is on there now mmm my last taste of my plunging my sugar excellent now I think you're going to go through all this sugar just in one this is just a bonus you don't really need it or it got more sugar in there so how that it's the sour flush toilet candy that one's a success if you can find it I say get it it's fun and thanks for watching it's really appreciated as always

there's the ingredients if you're into that and then here is the nutritional facts 5 teaspoon fulls alright so I'm not sure it just looks like an industrial type pop cop or something where you yeah there you go and I guess it just squeezes out it sure does we get a bowl in here some reason I want to just watch it squeeze out mainly just because we can all see it pretending like it's your mouth squeezing in so it's a thicker consistency I'm gonna taste it so here we go I don't I'm just intrigued by the whole thing mmm it's good it's sour I like it it's got a nice apple flavor it's pretty

capped it up - so you don't have to see my salivation on the end there but I was gonna say something I probably I was gonna say oh it's hard to squeeze out that's one thing I did notice you have to squeeze it pretty hard let me wipe it off I have a towel right here okay so we're cleaning in you have to put a lot of pressure and that's pretty much as fast as it's going to come out and it's a lot

handful of them in there and lets them dissolve it takes a day or two sometimes from all to dissolve but it tastes just like the candy and you can use if you like it sweeter and more candy flavored you can use more if you want to want a little thinner I guess and taste more of the alcohol you just use less this one is kind of a name between she makes hers extremely sweet for me but she makes them for me that's not quite as sweet what she likes that okay let's give it a smell and the taste smells exactly like Jolly Ranchers green Apple Jolly Ranchers with just a hint after uh alcohol mmm

"oQWc_Iso458": "look at this delicious candy lollipops they have different flavors like chocolate with cream cheese icing on it and so on wow", "ID_y1ArCBmU": "I'll start things off with grape lollipops it's a perfect introduction to candy making so the first thing I need to do is prepare my lollipop mold you don't need to buy a fancy mold to make lollipops you can actually create your own what I have is a baking tray lined with parchment paper and I'm going to sift 2 to 3 cups of icing sugar on to the tray have a nice thick layer of icing sugar the amount you need really just depends on the size of your tray basically you want about half an inch layer of icing sugar just grab a spatula when you're spreading out your icing sugar do it loosely don't pack it down and the bigger the tray you use well the more lollipops you can fit on now that I have an even and pretty level layer I can create my lollipop shapes what you want to do is take a flat bottom glass in any shape you want and press it into the icing sugar packing it right down and take a little peak to make sure that you have clearance of about a quarter inch maybe just a little less all the way around this is where you're going to pour in your hot sugar to shape your lollipop you can find lollipop sticks at some grocery stores but definitely at stores that sell baking supplies and I press it into the icing sugar so that one end of the stick goes right into the mold there we go now I'm all set what I love about making lollipops at home is the fact that you can control the flavor and the color and you can go all natural using clear fruit juices is a great way to add flavor and color so I'm making grape lollipops by using grape juice I'm measuring out half a cup of grape juice now on its own this grape juice is too thin it won't add in a flavor or color so what I need to do is reduce it I'll put it in a small sauce pot turn up the heat on high and I want to reduce this down to about 2 tablespoons by volume this will only take a few minutes and you could use any juice you want so long as it's a clear juice that way your lollipops are nice and clear there we go my juice is reduced to now a syrup two tablespoons worth because the water has evaporated away so you're left with that concentrated flavor color and sweetness so now we're all set to start the actual lollipops first I put a quarter cup of water in the bottom of my pot that way it makes it easier for the one cup of sugar I add to immediately start dissolving you want to liquefy that sugar pretty quickly and then typical to a lot of candy making corn syrup white corn syrup is a common ingredient that really gets the clarity and the set to your candy making so I'm adding a quarter cup I'll set my heat to high which is how you cook all of your sugar when your candy making and that sugar boils and it boils beyond 212 Fahrenheit you want to cook it all the way to 300 degrees Fahrenheit that's called hard crack in the candy making world and it's before it turns to caramel but yet it sets up so that your lollipops have a nice crunch using a thermometer is important in candy making that's how you know you've hit your temperatures precisely but as the sugar starts melting and coming to a boil and throughout the process I occasionally take a brush dipped in cool water and just brush the sides of the pot this ensures that any sugar that might boil up and hit the side of the pot doesn't then cool down and crystallize give this a little check I'm at 235 the goal is 300 I can tell I'm getting close because the bubbling of the sugar is starting to slow because the sugar itself is thickening up there we go once your sugar hits the 300 degrees take it off the heat and then you want to add that concentrated grape syrup and give it a quick stir in immediately it adds that gorgeous purple color and I can smell the grape now you take your ladle and pour in to each mold make sure you're covering that lollipop stick if you find your sugar is starting to set up on you you can always put it back on the stove on low heat to remelt the sugar and this is where you can get creative with your decorations you could add sprinkles a few draws a is like I'm adding finished with a few more small ways once you're finished with your lollipops you want to give them 15 to 20 minutes to set up then it's time to take them out of the icing sugar they will have icing sugar on them from the mold so first I take a little brush to brush them off and take a lightly moistened cloth or paper towel and just wipe off the icing sugar and then I dry it off and there you can actually see right through it once they're cleaned up and have had a chance to air dry a little bit then you can pack them up in little sello bags for gifting or just store them in an airtight container until you need them I bet you never guessed that making lollipops was actually so easy an all-natural to love that nice grape flavor it just looks so sweet", "URAZeH9djsM": "hey everyone awesome visit us here in today are bringing you some minions candy we have three minions popping candy and a store lineup talker candy let's start

about these Smokies so I got a little edibles something for you but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] the [ __ ] please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that thing so you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] if you dig in the turfy shirt go over to counter me calm yourselves terpene shirts can survive 10 11 12 13 14 maybe it's a minim [ __ ] man I got some new designs actually that I'm working on so it's gonna be some new [ __ ] coming in I'd say probably Annabelle maybe give it two weeks three max but I got some new designs on [ __ ] with so I'm gonna get that [ __ ] done so uh anyway man Smokey's I it's a pretty good edible from what I've heard I don't think I've ever had these and if I did I might have had a sample but I don't think I've had any of these to be honest with you man but people come in I got this one cat he'll come in and he'll get no joke like 20 of them were some [ __ ] he gets like a [ __ ] ton of them and a lot of like older people like them a lot of ladies like them but also here a lot of dudes like man um motherfuckas tastes good you [ __ ] around and eat all of them so I think that's a pretty cool thing the flavor I have right here is the blue raspberry so it's more of a fruit chew versus gummies and the reason this is a fruit chew I think it's because it's vegan so it's kind of hard to get like vegan things to be like gummies so usually they'll use like a agar powder or something like that I'm not sure what this one used sugar and corn syrup though they use pectin okay yeah so it but it's hard to get it to be like more gummy so it's more so of a chewy type thing so still good though you know and they also use a distillate in it for their infusion this one is actually I think there's a slough pack if I'm mountains yep Wow pack this one is a lau pack so they get their flower for the distillate from from lau pack Smokies has like different I guess they're sponsored by different peanut sponsor but they're flour is produced by different companies depending located so they have California they have Oregon I think Washington and I think Oklahoma working yeah so I think it's like Oregon Oklahoma Washington and Cali I have a Sam in Cali so I got the Lao backward it's only 20 milligrams I'm 20 milligrams the 20 calories per [ __ ] gummy ten milligrams per gummy 100 milligrams and the whole goddamn package so I guess that's pretty much it man I mean that's the most we could say I heard that they use real fruit with it it says natural and artificial flavoring so you know not sure what all that means like I say they're gluten I mean they're vegan and they're gluten-free and I believe that's it let's open it up hopefully if he's ain't all melted to get okay man oh that is been in my closet so hoping these [ __ ] like me just one big mesh or mesh ball all right so circular about the size of a quarter roughly so [ __ ] man they also be having like sour flavors and stuff like that but this is just a normal Flav so let's make this [ __ ] happen dude it's to ten milligrams of THC and two milligrams of CBD per serving we got to talk about the CVD so anyway man that's it bottoms up [ __ ] and [ __ ] gets [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah I can see why comes our bomb honestly these are probably the best companies I've had that are infused I doesn't think these AVX gummies that I had before was probably the best or now the Kaunas is pretty good with these [ __ ] right here hang on front these guys are vomits [ __ ] dude yeah these it is it they get these right to it don't you just disintegrating you know in your mouth yes it is like it's digging it is chili he did they think these things are bomb Victor's life is normal but again you need the plug around to eat the whole bag of these [ __ ] yeah man so mm-hmm this isn't good now someone asked me how come I don't do like how I feel on them and how effective they are and things of that sort there's a few reasons why I do that and I think I've explained it on a video but I'll explain it on this one too the reason I don't do that is because eight how high I get has zero to [ __ ] do with you hi our tolerance is different so I could say oh I took 30 milligrams and I didn't feel anything you could take 30 milligrams and be on the [ __ ] moon right I could [ __ ] around and take 40 milligrams be like man I'm high as [ __ ] you can take 40 milligrams and that fella goddamn thing everybody's tolerance is different so it's to me it's a waste of time to sit here and come back two hours later and be set my camera back up boy okay that's how I feel because everybody's high is gonna be different I just think that's like a big [ __ ] waste of time as far as I'm concerned and then also I don't think it's fair to the company like let's say I hit I eat something and I'm like I didn't really feel anything from it but yet I've been smoking weed all day or something like that and then I said I didn't feel nothing I mean you [ __ ] don't go [ __ ] with them all over I just had too much weed that day and it didn't affect me so I don't like [ __ ] what other people's companies and taking money out they Pike it over [ __ ] like that so that's why I don't do that if it was a shitty tasting gummy I just wouldn't do the review like I wouldn't release it like that was my first time eating that [ __ ] is good but if it tasted like dog [ __ ] and feet I just wouldn't [ __ ] release the video but honestly that should have actually really really bombed so I definitely say if you can find some Smokies go look for that [ __ ] of your own one of those four states I mentioned Cali Oklahoma Washington and Oregon definitely go get them shits them shits a really really dope you can check them out on a website and share the things just Smokies calm and the Smokies would Izzie so it's not a half Smokies so I'd definitely go check them shits out man but I got to give it to him the [ __ ] badass so uh this weekend I'm gonna pop like four or five it [ __ ] and see how they do but I yeah man [ __ ] I got a lot of cool [ __ ] coming I got a gravity bar i'ma show you [ __ ] a [ __ ] so I'm just getting some [ __ ] together with that but I got some cool [ __ ] I got some hash then I picked up man I got a lot of different [ __ ] that I got now I got iced up with all kind of different things so of course I'm gonna show you share that with y'all so anyway man that's the end of this video y'all make sure that y'all love each other keep the love going be peaceful to each other keep the peace go on go over to Canada mink on get yourself some terpenes shirts that i'ma holla let you [ __ ] a [ __ ] ass later I'm out this [ __ ] peace [Music] we in a jungle smoking legal", "898nGn68K0c": "[Music] good morning so today we've got our apples on the stick the miniature apples on a stick and I ended up having to do another batch because I waited so many trying to get the candied apples and while I'm at it I was planning on combining these two together and make them one video but the candied apple video became so long that I've decided to break it down into two videos so one for the candied apples and one for the caramel apples the process to make the apples himself free dry the apples is the same so I don't show that in this video but if you want to see that just hook up the candy apple video and it'll be in there so the first thing we got to do unwrap all these caramels I've got a one bag of crap caramels I'm gonna make it according to the instructions on the bag [Music] [Music] all right so we've got our caramels in here we're going to add two tablespoons of water turn it on medium-low heat we're just going to stir constantly it says until it's totally melted obviously there you don't want it to stick and or burn that's why you're going to stir it constantly and it's coming up getting really smooth so I'm going to take this off the heat in a second and we'll start dipping okay so in my old age I forgot to press record when I was dipping the first batch but lucky luckily enough I ran out of caramel sauce so I caught it so you'll get to see me dip some of these I don't have a lot left but well we'll get a demonstration of it anyway [Music] [Music] there you have it I'll get those in the fridge with the other ones we'll let them cool down and then get them wrapped up for the display I'll see you later okay I'm bagging these up and they were really sticky and sticking to the bags at room temperature so what I did is I stuck them in the freezer for about half an hour so I figured I'd better to let you guys know and then they go in the bag real easy now when I go to went to take them out of the little baggie at room temperature the caramel does stick to the bag of what I think you can do is keep these stored in a refrigerator until you use them and it's close to the time that you're gonna use them people cool and that way it won't be as sticky when they try to open up the wrapper and get it out but I mean it's caramel you would expect it to be sticky and no but you can do about it but I think that would help you overcome everything just freezer for half an hour so that you can bag them and go in there real easy as you see you could do it that way for storage I mean you can keep them in your vacuum sealed bag out of the refrigerator I suppose but if you're going to be using them in a display or something maybe you might want to keep them chilled and then display them as close to the time that you take them out of the refrigerator I mean you can still open them I could still open it and just when I opened it when they were at room temperature the plastic stuck to the caramel so when you pull the bag off you got strings of caramel and that kind of stuff kind of messy and then still work but I think if they were chilled and work a lot better so I thought I'd just share that with you as a graph innate almost finished this way so much easier it was almost impossible to get it in the bag when they were at room temperature steps ticking is going nice and easy I didn't freezing solid I just stuck them in the freezer for about Oh half hour 45 minutes maybe an hour all right if this all cleaned up and then we're gonna set up a pretty display and get these posted on the Internet on the YouTube just in time for Halloween [Music] you", "jz6ROF_lmaQ": "hi guys like the video today I'm vlogging we're trying caramel apple pops which I never tried before but if I have I don't think I actually enjoyed these if I have I hold my palette it's changed so I hope these are good 1 2

tomorrow's vlog video at this point I don't know what it is yet so let's see who's tomorrow bye", "rJ0zupx9HJk": "let's see what it's time for yo-yo faced 12 hello everyone today we're making a recipe that has been requested a couple of times this is a traditional fall treat candied apples and people have been making these for years and years so we're medium heat place one and a half cups of sugar one cup of light corn syrup and one cup of water then stir this over high heat and continue to stir until it starts to boil and the sugar is dissolved and once it's boiling you can stop stirring and you need to heat this over high heat until the sugar syrup reaches 285 degrees Fahrenheit which is the soft crack stage and you can use a candy thermometer this would be the easiest method but there is another method of telling you reach the soft crack stage I'll put that information in the description box so while your candy syrup is boiling you can prepare your apples so remove the stem from the Apple and then just insert a popsicle stick into the Apple about halfway these are Gala apples because it happens to be what I have in the house you can use whatever Apple you prefer and I also thought I would try doing half apples because sometimes eating an entire candied apple is a little bit too much especially for kids so I wanted to try these half apples so once that mixture has come to 285 degrees Fahrenheit take it off the heat and then carefully add a half a teaspoon of cinnamon and a half a teaspoon of red food coloring and then stir that in and it might fit up a little bit so just do it carefully once that's thirty you are ready to dip your apples into the sugar syrup make sure your apples are nice and dry and then dip the apples into the candy mixture I just do a little dip and a turn and make sure it's completely coated once it's coated and remove it from the syrup and just let it drip off and I suggest you let as much as you can drip off of the Apple because you want to try to make that coating fairly thin so it's just easier to eat then you're going to place it on a greased cookie sheet a cookie sheet covered with grease aluminum foil or in this case I'm using my trusty silicone mat and there I am dipping another Apple you'll find that as the sugar syrup starts to cool a bit you may get some bubbles in the mixture and you might see those on the apples but that's okay they're still thought they'll still be fine now for the half apples the cut apples I was talking about dip them into the candy mixture and I found I guess because of all the moisture on the cut surface of the Apple the sugar just wouldn't stick to it and also the sugar syrup has started to cool quite a bit at that point so it didn't really work very well I also found that when you put the candy Apple was half on the cookie sheet that the cut up will continue to release juice and it started to melt the sugar and it was really kind of sticky and messy so didn't really work out that great so if you want to do half apples use caramel or use chocolate now when you're done with all of the apples take out as much as you can of that sugar syrup on the bottom fill the pan with water put it on low heat and just let it heat and all that sugar that's stuck to the pot will dissolve you can also put it in some hot soapy water and just let it sit that'll do the same thing not that difficult to clean up at all there are the apples these are good to eat the same day or the next day at the maximum because the candy will start to absorb moisture from the air and they'll start to get sticky now if you've ever had candy apples you'll know that these can be really hard to bite into for that first bite you have to crack through that hard candy shell so these may not be suitable for really little kids or you might have to try to get it started for them by cracky image candy shell because the candy is so sweet I find that the best apple to use for this is a tart apple like a McIntosh it's a nice complement to all that sugar so there you go a traditional Halloween or fall treat the candied apple give it a try thank you so much for sticking around to the end of this

inside\nand sherbet filled candies. What you'll need to make these is some sugar,\nglucose syrup, water and some cream of tartar. Put the sugar and the water into the pan with\nthe glucose syrup. Place that over high heat. If you've got any sugar crystals on the sides\nof your pan then you just want to wash those down using a wet pastry brush. Turn your oven on to 100C or 210F and place\na tray lined with non-stick baking paper in to warm up. Let your sugar mixture boil until it reaches\n150C or 302F. Turn off the heat and stir through the cream\nof tartar. Now we will follow this same basic process\nfor all of our candies. For the sherbet filled candy add yellow food\ncolouring and stir it through. And then pour that into a warm tray that has\nbeen lined with baking paper. Now to protect our hands from the heat we\nare going to use .. silicone gloves but these are not going to be enough so we are also\ngoing to use cotton gloves underneath them. Oh, and let me show you my nails while we\nare here - these are one of the designs in my own line of wraps that I'm doing with Jamberry. These ones are called YUM and they have cute\nlittle icecreams on them and I'll link to them below. For those of you who asked last week what\nare wraps? They are bit like stickers made out of nail\npolish, and you use a little bit of heat to stick them onto your nails. And they last up to few weeks. We are going to put these ones through some\nrough treatment today with heat and gloves and in and out of gloves. Fold in the edges towards of the hot sugar\ntowards the centre and then lift it up and begin to pull it out and then fold it back\nin. The more you pull it, the more shiny and opaque\nit becomes. If you want it to be transparent then don't\npull it much at all. Place it back in the tray and flatten it out\nas much as you can and then put it in the oven to warm up again. Now that it's warm you can stretch it into\na rectangle. Now usually when chefs make this sort of candy\nthey have a heat lamp shining on the candy that keeps it warm while it's on the counter\nso you don't need to keep putting it back in the oven, but they are super expensive\nso this is the way to do it home. Place a generous amount of sherbet down the\ncentre of your rectangle and then bring the sides up and around to cover it. Push down each of the ends to seal in the\nsherbet. Squeeze it to make a cylinder shape and then\nplace it back in the oven for about 30 seconds to a minute, just keeping an eye on it because\nyou don't want to overheat it. Once you can just stretch it when it's soft\nenough to stretch, pull the candy to make a long snake. Working quickly before it hardens make firm\nindents along the candy so that you are sealing in the sherbet into each one. To make lollipops we'll need a few different\ncolours in the one batch. So place strips of foil along the tray and\nthen cover it in baking paper. Prepare the candy just like we did before\nbut this time add a few drops of essence, I am using a fairy floss flavour. You can buy all different ones and then just\nflavour your candy. Pour some hot mixture into each of the sections. And then to get you pan clean all you need\nto do is fill it up with water and leave it to soak and the sugar will just dissolve off. Add food colouring to each section in the\ncolours that you are after for your lollipop. And then using scissors, cut along the baking\npaper so you can work with one colour at a time. Fold it into the middle and then stretch it\nuntil it becomes opaque. Make it into a snake and then set it aside. Repeat that with the blue. And the red\nAnd the yellow and the clear one as well to make it white Then warm them slightly again in the oven\nand place them together to make a cylinder and squeeze them so that they stick together. Cut the cylinder in half and leave some to\nkeep warm while you stretch the other half. Twisting as you stretch so you get that pretty\npattern. Take a lollipop stick and poke it into one\nend then wrap the mixture around and around pressing it into place. And you can keep going to make your lollipop\nas giant as you want it to be. To make the spirals remove the mixture from\nthe heat and add in flavouring, for this one I am using musk. Split it into two sections and add red colouring\nto one half and blue into the other. We are going to take the blue half and pull\nit and stretch it to make it opaque but with the red half we are just going to leave that\nand not pull it all. Keep pulling the blue half and twisting it\nso that you can see there the more we pull it and the more we twist it the more opaque\nand shiny it becomes. Don't pull the red half just cut it in half\nto make two long cylinders. Pull the blue into two long snakes too and\nthen stack them up to make a square. It looks a bit like toothpaste. Squeeze them together to round it out and\nthen cut that into two. Working with one half pull it and make it\nthinner into a nice thin long stick. And you can slice it while ti is warm to make\nindividual candies OR to make the spirals, wrap it around a thick skewer. Once it is all the way to the end you can\njust pull the skewer out and leave those to cool. See how the pink there is totally transparent\nbecause we didn't pull it and the blue is opaque. The other thing you can do is roll some of\nthis mixture into a ball and make round lollipops and just put a stick in one end. And you can make as many different candies\nas you like just by flavouring and colouring each one differently. And now for something which is going to be\nhard to do without a heat lamp but I reckon we can do it. We're going to split the mixture into three\nand colour some red, leave some plain and colour the last section green. Pull each of the colours just like we have\ndone before to make them opaque. And then stretch the red one to make three\nlong snakes, return one to the oven to warm up. And once it is soft and pliable, place it\nacross the top of the two red snakes and shape it at the top into a point. Add some white along each side of that triangle\nand then flip it up the other way and add a strip down the centre on the top. And then finally add more white so that the\nred is completely covered. Warm your green, and stretch it out and add\nit over the top of the white so that it goes all the way around. Now you are going to need to place that back\nin the oven to warm it up because those two red ones are quite cold by now. And once it's warm you can just stretch that\ncandy out into a long strip. Now to cut it without it shattering it needs\nto be quite warm so return it to the oven until you can bend it like this. And then quickly using a sharp knife, chop\noff pieces to reveal the little heart inside.

In honor of the new Jurassic Park movie Jurassic\nWorld, that is coming out, I thought we should make a themed treat. Jurassic Park is one of my all-time favorite,\nclassic movies, I love Dinosaurs and I have seen this movie so many times,\nso I wanted to make something from the original. Today we are gonna be making Amber Fossil\nThemed Lollipops. Let\u2019s get started! The things you will need, will be: 1/3 cup\nof light corn syrup, 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 a cup of water, orange and yellow food\ncoloring, because an amber fossil walks the line on the color wheel between\nyellow and orange. Then 1/2 a teaspoon of flavoring, I\u2019m using orange flavoring,\nbut again, you can also use lemon or whatever flavor you\u2019d like. Some black licorice\ncandy, baking scissors, lollipop sticks, medium sized saucepan, a candy thermometer,\nsome baking spray, and some lollipop molds. Now let\u2019s put it all together. The first thing that we\u2019re gonna do is take\nyour black licorice and your baking scissors, and we\u2019re gonna cut them to look like little\nmosquitos to put inside our amber. So I\u2019m just gonna cut off the end, boop! And I\u2019m not making them look perfect, I\u2019m\njust gonna cut a bunch of little slices, doo-doo-doo-doo! To make little creepy bug legs. These little guys are so small, so just do\nthe best you can, doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, and we\u2019re gonna make one for every lollipop. Before we mix everything up on the stove,\nwe are gonna grease our lollipop pan, you can use Crisco or shortening, I\u2019m gonna\nbe using a little bit of baking spray, so that it doesn\u2019t stick! Now let\u2019s head over to the stove and make\nour candy. Place your medium sized saucepan on the stove.\nThen add your light corn syrup, water, and sugar. Turn the heat onto medium and whisk\ntogether until the sugar is dissolved. Once dissolved, raise the heat to medium high\nand let the candy mix sit until it reaches 300 degrees. Keep a close eye on it because\nthe heat rises quickly. Then remove from heat and add the flavoring,\n1 drop of orange food coloring, and 1 drop of yellow food coloring. Mix together until evenly combined and then\ntake everything back over to the baking station. Now we\u2019re gonna pour our candy mixture into\na measuring cup for a little bit more control. I\u2019m using a glass pyrex with a little spigot\nat the end. Now we\u2019re gonna fill our lollipops. Once you\u2019ve filled them, take your little\nblack licorice candy, and place him down. And then use a toothpick because the candy is still\nhot, and press him down, just gently. And then you\u2019re gonna take your lollipop\nstick, and place it in. And remember, you\u2019re only gonna put little\nbuggies into 1/2 of your molds, because the other molds will be the back. And now you\u2019re gonna\ndo this to the rest of your lollipops. Once your lollipop trays are filled, now we\nare gonna let them cool at room temperature, just let them sit here for about 40 minutes.\nAnd then, we\u2019re gonna pop \u2018em out. Once your lollipops have set, now we\u2019re\ngonna pop \u2018em out of the tray and stick them together. I didn\u2019t have one of those fancy 3-D Molds\nwhere the lollipop comes out all together, I just had this little neat tray, so, use\nwhat you got! Slides right out, right on! Oh and look at\nthat! And now we're gonna pop out the back. If you\u2019re just making these for yourself\nyou can just lick \u2018em and stick \u2018em together, but if you\u2019re going to share with friends,\nwhich is what I\u2019m going to do, you can take a little baking brush and a little\nbit of water, paint a little bit on the back. Boop-bewp-bewp-bewp! And stick \u2018em together. Now you\u2019re gonna hold them together for\n10 seconds, or you can hum the Jurassic Park theme song! Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, hmm-hmm-hmm! Alright, there we go, and I\u2019m just gonna\nstick him into this little foam block, and then you\u2019re gonna do that to the rest\nof your lollipops. Ta-da! Here are our Jurassic Park inspired\nAmber Fossil Lollipops that we made today. I hope you guys enjoyed them. I am so excited\nfor another dinosaur movie! Uh, if you guys can tell, I kind of love Dinosaurs! I\u2019ve got these 2. I actually moonlight as\na Jurassic Park scientist, a couple nights a week, and I used one of these mosquitos\nto make these guys. You guys didn\u2019t know that, now you do, boom! Also, a side note, is that some of the lollipops\nare completely sphered, we\u2019ve attached the backs, but if you didn\u2019t want\nto wait for those, to dry and you just wanted to eat \u2018em, you can also just leave\nthem as a little 1/2. I\u2019ll be posting lots of pictures of these\nyummy Jurassic Lollipops on Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram and Twitter, and if you\nguys make these, or any other Jurassic treats, please take a picture and send them to me, I love seeing your baking creations, I just get a big kick out of it, it makes my day. And if you have any other ideas for any other\nNerdy Nummies, please let me know, leave me a comment down below and I will do\nmy best to make it happen. Alright, thanks so much you guys, bye-bye!", "MqSH3tuiqTA": "[Music] hey guys so welcome back to another boutique Friday video this one I've been talking about I have wanted to eat this so badly ever since I got it and it's been killing me leaving it alone till today I kept meaning to review it for a while but also hesitating to review it because thinking about how am I going to do this where the perverts of the Internet aren't going to have a field day with my reviewing this it's nothing bad but it is a lollypop so I'm just like oh boy how badly do I wonder if you how badly do I want to open that Pandora's box we're going there don't do it just hold your freaking comments just don't do it man so this is a limited edition See's candy lollipop in caramel apple they only sell these during the autumn part of the year I've never had one of these but like their other lollipops I freaking love so I have no doubt in my mind this will be amazing I've learned there's scotch Mallos too or their caramel apple scotch mellows dude kind of wish I bought a pound of them now I not be able to resist looks exactly how I just like this this is what they always look like for those of you who do not have a See's candy near you or I've never bought the lollipops from them so it almost looks like it has condensation marks on here but hopefully it's still okay it's not very old I mean when did I go to the mall like a month ago something like that so I mean I'm pretty sure the lollipops stay good at least that long I definitely smell both apple and caramel there that is impressive I've had like the cafe au lait ones I've had the chocolate ones I've had the dark chocolate ones I've had the butterscotch ones and I want to say there's at least one more that I've had but they're all amazing I used to get them for Easter from my grandparents they were always so good which am i smelling more that is really 5050 I feel like but it's not like really super strong so I'm interested to see how it will be don't that really is 5050 between the two flavors it's really good too in addition to both apple and caramel I almost feel like there's the tiniest hint of like artificial banana in there too I'm not sure if that's coming from the Apple or not but um it's pretty good though it's very rich which I mean kind of knew going in it was gonna be there lollipops always are that's why I only bought one I was like I only need one but um it's really good I think I'm gonna eat this and come back because I feel rude eating this on camera just even though it's squares not around what or anything guys I mean I just I feel weird with it so I'm gonna come back and tell you my thoughts alright so stay tuned okay now that I'm done with that and no more room is to be made fun of or anything I can raid it talk whatever so for as rich as it was I think it was the perfect amount for just one lollipop because once it's done you feel satisfied you don't really want more but at the same time it was enough you know it just it wasn't like too much or anything it was like the Goldilocks zone uh but just enough of each of the things and throughout the whole thing it really did stay a perfect 50/50 of both flavors throughout which i think is incredibly rare for things like that so that was kind of cool and unlike some of the other See's Candies lollipops this one didn't leave like a weird film on my tongue or anything afterwards it just when it was done it was done it was light enough to where it didn't like really hang out or taint anything else I wanted to eat or drink afterwards or anything just satisfying in the moment lasted long enough to eat it but at the same time didn't take like forever to eat it like say a Tootsie Pop or anything I just I think they're just the right amount personally but that is just my opinion so I think I would rate a good 5 out of 5 I think it was perfect in pretty much every possible way only weirdness just the square shape of them which is true of any of them from that Brandis it's a little bit weird in your mouth because it hits your teeth with the corners so I mean but I mean other than that totally not deal-breaker cuz you could just you know put just the tip don't don't hear you thinking it you think loudly but you could put just the tip of it in your mouth and do it that way which can be easier but anyway I think it's really good I highly recommend them I think they're still selling the flavor right now I don't know for how much longer since it is not tamil flavor I'm sure very soon they'll be replacing it with Christmas flavors so if you want to try one I suggest you get to it See's candy location and see if they've still got him if they do great if not my apology such missed it anyways that is it for this

"cuvcqM7sV2Y": "hi Lisa today I'm going to be doing our review and this is going to be on these lollipops and it's cool happy sweet life under you can see this but happy sweet life lollipop and it

might want to today we're eating green apples sour strips by actual candy let's get into it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I made a review of the other four flavors of sour strips in a previous video so if you haven't seen it yet I'll put a link in the description and a pin so you can check it out if you want to see it but that is actually my most popular video so I am super excited to try these out and just see if they live up to the hype so in the last video I did say that green apple was going to be the next flavor of sour strip bold prediction for his next flavor is going to be green apples and guess what Oh hold the applause thank you thank you you heard it here first folks green apple is the newest flavor of sour strip green apple has never been one of my favorite flavors but it's always been in my top three kind of favorite flavors so I have big expectations because the other candies or so good but let's get into eating these ones right now only complaint I have about this right out of the packaging is their blue raspberry and their strawberry flavors have like dark and light stripes in that and I was a big fan of that but I'm pretty sure that's just an aesthetic aspect of it shouldn't affect the candy whatsoever but now that has some serious sourness to it that might be some of the best sour candy that I've ever had in my life oh my god so last time we rated sour strips on a flavor and sour meter so let's start with the sourness gotta give it a 9 out of 10 I think that it could be potentially more sour but I don't think it needs to be more sour so if I broke this down a tandem would be super sour just overcomes all the flavor and then all you can taste the sourness and that's not necessarily what you want in a sour Kingdom give this thing a 9 because I feel like this absolutely maxed out on how much sour you would want on a candy and still keep the good flavor of it but once you get three or four deep into the bag that you actually get to feel how sour it truly is so flavor-wise I'm gonna give this a 9 out of 10 I think that is one of the best green apple flavors that I've ever had in my life but it's not a perfect piece of candy the strawberry one last time just something about it just spoke and just was the perfect flavor of strawberry I think this is an amazing green apple flavor but I don't think it's exactly true to the exact flavor of an apple it just kind of depends what you're looking for in your flavoring all that being said this is probably one of the best candies that I just ever had in my life and I think it's absolutely amazing it's definitely worth you trying so I'm pretty sure right now sour strips are actually sold out by the time you are watching this video I'm gonna be honest there's gonna be I got six bags of these things I'm thinking I'm I guess three of them are gone by the time you're actually watching this and that's just like two days from now thank you guys so much for watching my name's

the flavor of it is a green mesh sour apple here you go sour but it's good if I had more sour sweet I would be doing it but I'm not doing that today tomorrow i will put a youtube video of something else that I want to make up thank you bye", "FAWkFq5zPi4": "hi everyone there's flowers on 1970 and this morning I am going to show you how I make my suckers it's basically the same way you make the candies your quarter cup of canola oil which I already put in the pot your half a cup corn syrup I use beehive please do not use like Aunt Jemima or anything like that like pancake syrup don't use that use beehive or you can use a no-name brand I believe that is bought a fresh coordinate Aunt Jemima because it won't turn out so we got our quarter cup of oil in there we have our half a cup of corn syrup and I'm going to do the 3/4 cup of white sugar while there's no numbers on it so I had to put a mark on the stove so medium it depends how hot your stove goes to be quite honest so I keep it if it was numbered I think it would be number four or five on the stove so I'm just gonna stir in the goodness and don't worry about it all being granule e because it will dissipate it'll heat and it'll go to a liquid state so there we go get my candy thermometer you will need a candy thermometer it has to go up to 300 degrees because 300 degrees is the hard candy state so I put that in there and put my timer on the stove for 12 minutes just so I don't forget that there's something on the stove I have done that before so we let that go and it sometimes goes from 12 to 15 minutes depending on the temperature of your stove you don't want to burn it because it's a total waste of ingredients especially the can of butter so I have my sucker trays I have my sucker sticks I'm going to make 20 suckers I believe it is we'll see how many we can get out of the mix I should be able to make 20 suckers and their happy face suckers so we're gonna watch this boil which is probably gonna be boring so maybe I should pause it you know we'll just let it go if I pause it I'll probably rough it and shut it off or something like that so I'm gonna go get my ball and I'll be right back piece got my tea got my bong so yeah it takes about 12 minutes or so to reach 300 degrees I do stir it occasionally just to move the mix around the butter doesn't always cling to you'll see it's kind of like when you fry eggs and you put oil or butter in the pan you'll see a little bit of the the residue on the outside of the item you're cooking and that's basically what happens here so I try and stir it all together but you're not gonna get it all mixed even when you're pouring it out you'll have some butter left over and I call it sweet butter there you're see see how well that's bubbling that's what you want so we got nine minutes left and I'm not even sure what kind of candies I want or what kind of suckers I want to make today I have caramel watermelon Apple raspberry butterscotch and cherry I'm thinking cherry what do you guys think wish I was live so I could ask you guys so butterscotch or cherry I don't know I'm gonna put them in my hand I'm gonna do this I'm not even gonna look I'm not even gonna look and I'm gonna pull one out and that's which one I'm gonna make cherry so we're gonna have cherry suckers yay sometimes I put food coloring in them just to give them a little punch of color I don't always do this just because sometimes my friends when they're over here know munch on some of my candies and one of my friends this is allergic to dyes so I don't know maybe I shouldn't only two batches of suckers I'll do cherry and butterscotch and that way she can have butterscotch because there are no colorings in the butterscotch well I don't have a butterscotch colors though so as you can see it bubbled very vigorously and then it fell down so that's all normal don't think it's too high of a temperature as long as you have your thermometer in there your candy thermometer and you're paying attention to the degrees on the thermometer and keep in mind that 300 degrees is hard candy state so as long as you reach 300 degrees with your mix even a little above 300 degrees you will have a hard candy it will solidify into a hard candy state so we are at almost 375 we have 6 minutes left to go and I'm gonna take some of my medicine in a little store today so I have some Skywalker og lapped no more CBD oil that did not last long I wish it lasted longer who excuse me so I'm also gonna take you once this is all done I'm gonna put you on the other part of the counter over there and we're gonna pour out the candies so I'm thinking what a neon color or just regular color for the cherry probably regular color yeah so I hope everyone's having a good day I got my healing health compassion center shirt on and on the back it says THC and CBD equal healing so yeah this is from my local compassion center I went to a little party that they had they had their two year anniversary and I went to their anniversary party and they had games and they had some really nice food out there some cookies and cakes and sandwiches and it was really nice and they were handing out these t-shirts so it's it's an extra-large I am NOT an extra-large person but I got myself a nightgown it works so we are reaching 300 degrees and let that bubble a little longer clean up my mess over here so I can put everything down on the counter yeah so hope everyone's having a good day hope it's a beautiful day where you are it's very warm out here today I think right now it's almost reaching 20 degrees and it's I don't know not quite 11 o'clock yet so I guess we're in for a hot day I was hoping for a cooler day so I'm shutting the stove off because it is at 300 degrees as you can see it said 300 degrees whether you can see that or not I don't know so we shut the stove off I need my knife so they're very hard to open at least for me so I gotta score it with the knife whoo there goes my bone there's the cherry oil oh my gosh it smells amazing maybe I should do too just so that we have really good flavor oh my gosh what did I do with my knife I am just not with it today folks know I'm a little out of it I had a good sleep though come on okay there we go - dreams of cherry we're gonna stir this baby around you can see the smoke that's okay it's just the oil you can smell it it smells amazing so I'm gonna move you over to this part of the counter so that I can show you please excuse the dishes in the sink oh no is that gonna work okay yeah please excuse this think I have a few plates in there and some stuff from doing all the baking yesterday I was just too tired to do the dishes last night but after this batch I'll do it there's no suckers gates and not prepared you are known to propose so we put the sicker sicker sicker stalks stick oh my gosh sucker sticks say that five times fast in the trays so when you pour the hot candy mixture in here that is going to push down the sticks okay so here we are oh I know something I forgot to do and I got to do it before the candy mixture goes in here you got to do this folks you have to use complements butter flavored to lubricate the sheets for the candies so I have to do that right now so that my suckers come out of the containers so there we go we're ready to pour it into the funnel got the dye today guys so there we go we got the dye in there so they look like cherry coming on folks [Music] so here's our funnel we just pour it in you're going to see the butter remain on the top some of the butter that didn't get mixed into the mixture which is fine because we just reuse that again and they pour off the SX and just put that aside so where are we at I'll go this way so he just pour it out maybe I won't get 20 suckers but that'll be alright a few is enough just munch on these throughout the day so be careful not to overflow just one enough in there sometimes I twist the stick so they get coated I think I have to do that this time too so that they stay in there sorry for the sniffling folks they still have that little bit of a cold going on oh we're gonna get 20 suckers hi mama oh wait that's Molly and because there's still so much in there I'm just gonna pour out the butter the oil I have another tray I don't know if you can see this pink one over here I'm just gonna fill that with the rest of [Music] they smell amazing you guys I wish you to smellivision love cherry so there we go that's it and then you stick them in the fridge or the freezer for about 10-15 minutes and they will solidify but with the suckers I can't move them like that I'm turning the stick so that they all get covered with the mixture and they'll be gooey and all stick together instead of this one didn't even go in excuse me I'm so sorry about that everyone it's I really feel like I have a cold I should probably be wearing gloves but because I'm the only one eating these suckers so we're gonna let them sit there for about 20 minutes I'm gonna put this one in the freezer and there you have it so I'll just let these solidify I might even put these in the freezer and you see if the Train will fit there we go good thing I didn't go shopping and fill that freezer full of stuff yeah so it smells amazing in my kitchen smells sweet and there you have it folks and in one of my videos I will show you the actual suckers but there you go just let them Harden in the fridge and I don't know about 10-15 minutes maybe 20 minutes if you want and pull them out and enjoy so enjoy everyone have a great

overall overall what do we give the lollipops these dum dum lollipops limited edition flavors what do we give this like from like a 1 to a 10 again to be honest I would give it a 6 point to just because the flavors were on point they were really good the disappointing part out of it was that I couldn't find three out of the flavors out of three flavors out of the eight flavors that they had in one of the bags so that's the only disappointing things do I recommend these dum dum lollipops at the dollar trees you bet your butt I do these look so good and they taste so good and they are screaming holiday season everywhere so if you guys see these at your local Dollar Tree pick them up don't be afraid to this is fun for you and your kids to do doing the holiday season and just taste

open it oh so this side it's like green apple and this sides like chili i'm gonna get shot of this it looks pretty good i just hope it's not too spicy okay i'll try it hmm i really like the green apple flavor it tastes real really good and then let me try the chili it's not too spicy but you do feel like the hit when like it hits it like in the back of your throat overall i give it like a like a seven out of ten it's not bad but in my opinion i just don't feel like the chili kind of goes with the apple but that's my opinion you guys can like it but i'm not the biggest fan of it but it's pretty good thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next video bye", "iJwdqt7ebmE": "yeah here we go here we go again what's up yo back with another review today Oh edible gummies Mira Mira specifically Rob hots sour flavors I believe this is a relative new relatively new flavor for them I'm not a million percent sure even close to sure if it's on the REC side if it's not now I would imagine it will be soon so diving in the flavors we got inside here blue raspberry grape and green apple I don't know I had to look at it I actually know the flavors of jelly me anyway that's pretty much my favorite flavors enjoy ranchers and other candies so that was a super big plus for me I'm not really a huge tower fan so I'm really hoping they're not especially a sour yeah I was gonna enter a picture probably already did or I am now so we're gonna dive into what one thing to keep in mind is the brain all right we go is that the milligrams posted on the bottle or on the container are not necessarily the exact amount that are in your specific bottle your specific bottle will have a separate location where it is located exactly how many milligrams are in there I will insert a picture of it but it's I just keep smearing it you cannot see it at all anymore but I know that this bottle says 500 milligrams and it has 467 point 6 4 milligrams in it meaning each piece is not 50 milligrams but 46.7 6 milligrams per gummy it will always tell you the specific amount of THC that is in and milligrams that is in your container but it's not always exactly what's on the bottle sometimes it's more though I had another bottle of greens but I ate before I could review sometimes it's more the greens were 500 and something milligrams so each milligram or 5/10 I think or anyway doesn't matter because it was 51 milligrams per gummy i remember that specifically so sometimes you're getting more sometimes getting less if you're really a budget conscious person and you want to really maximize your bang for buck check out the different flavors and see what milligram is the highest of the actual bottle that you'll be purchasing we're gonna move on to the scent also it doesn't say whether it's a hybrid or indica or sativa so that means it's a hybrid most edibles are pretty much hybrids anyway I'm to get a edible specific video posted so keep an eye out for that because I'm gonna give like tips tricks all kinds of different information about edibles specifically that you can apply across pretty much all edibles sauer sorry I'm getting a little bit of the grape but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys these two are the two that I'm gonna be eating and one of them is great the reason these are the two that I'm gonna be eating is because I licked the [ __ ] out of them getting the sub nail photo and specifically the purple one is the one that I started with so it got the most saliva on it so I'm not sure if that has affected the scent that I'm picking up the most in here I'm like rotating something like the blue raspberries up on top I still kind of get great more than anything else behind this hour cuz this hour is the first thing that I smelled so that's a little bit concerning for me but when I was licking them I didn't taste a lot of sour however in the photo you can see there's a lot of like more there's a lot of rocky material that's only on one side from what I can tell because the green one too it didn't have any on the bottom I'm thinking that's the sour so I would imagine that you could dust that off and they wouldn't be sour but tact tactically they are I'm gonna grab one that I haven't wet because that they're more sticky Wow they're mean Wow I'm having before but they are they're very soft and compression they're definitely gummies cuz they're a little bit sticky but let's see yeah they're a little bit sticky my fingers are a little sticky after that but I could be because I was also handling the ones that I licked so we're gonna let see my fingers do not feel sticky at all or the like least amount like to smile if anything so now we're gonna squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze it is sticky yeah it's sticky and that's one that was not licked but it's not super bad cuz now after I've done it a few times it's pretty much not sticky anymore so a little sticky but you'll be able to like dust it off and no big deal as long as you don't like continuously looking and grab it and grab it and grab it that makes it sticky alright let's ride let's ride so I'm gonna be doing actually 150 because I'm gonna try all three well I was Jenni myself so harshly I'm like oh you're not getting quick enough that I couldn't actually think about adding up the numbers so it actually may be more like 135 levi's I am going to put the sour directly on my tongue with this one and then the other way on this one and whichever way I like the most I'm gonna do for the blue raspberry because that's my favorite and the apple looks like it's not got a lot of stuff on it so [Music] okay I push the gummy off to the side to just deal with the sour but it's really not bad like you can see my face with like a little bit but when it's really sour it's my faces all kinds of you know I am definitely getting a great flavor I would say that there is a mild earthy flavor to it I mean hash has a very very attached distillate has a very mild cannabis flavor to it but I'm picking that up so it's not but I I mean any edible honestly any edible is gonna have the slightest flavoring whether it be hashey or earthy which this is a little bit both I'm getting it's interesting you know I'm getting the earthiness of the you know cannabis component but which is in distillate but I'm also at the end getting a little bit of the tang or the dryness maybe that's it of the hash flavor if you have smoked hash or gotten it on it and like licked it and stuff you kind of know what I mean you the smell like honest if you know what the smell is you kind of know what the taste is so they're green apple oh and as far as I continue to talk the flavor I'm left with is a very mild grape kind of a again there's it's not really necessarily earthy at this point it's an off great like it's great but just like a little okay solid metal that straight-up tastes like Ukraine Apple the end part I got a little bit of sour and as I was coming out of it it tasted like a sour green apple so that was really nice not quite as much earthy flavor in that one I just think maybe the green apple complements or goes with the cannabis ever slightly so more than the grape so more I'm not really tasting the green apple anymore it was strong when I was eating it but it doesn't really have a leftover flavor and blue raspberry [Music] whoo Smiley's an idol I ate a boy okay that was delicious it honestly reminds me of a blue Slurpee but I I honestly don't think I've ever tried a Slurpee ever but it's what I imagine a blue raspberry a Slurpee tastes like blue raspberry otter pop that's the closest that I can relate it to cuz it's not quite blue raspberry Jolly Rancher but it's blue rounder blue blue raspberry otter pop so it's a little duller than a Jolly Rancher but still nicely blue raspberry we're popsicle I swallowed unexpectedly during that so some sour got in my throat so it's not the best feeling and I did just eat on three so I'm imagining the flavors gonna be a little ol kooky but I kind of maybe I just want it I feel like I have a remanence of blue raspberry in my mouth but I might just be wanting it so much that its existing you know for the placebo effect so flavors oh dude I didn't get any hash from that no earthy no hash maybe because I like that flavor so much or it goes better with it I don't know but it tasted delicious so that you know as far as overall experience I appreciate that the sour is not super sour I almost think there's gonna be people who are disappointed but it's not super super sour but I thought it was a nice mild level of sour what yeah I still get the grape more than anything in that particular whip waft I wonder if it's because I was also thinking it was gonna be so much more sour that I smelled this no I smell sour but it's not as strong it has before that's so funny anyway I love Rob hot gummies I've had them pretty consistently there's definitely other companies that make really good gummies but Rob hots from what I've experienced so far seems to be the best thing for the [ __ ] and having good quality like great quality gummies however I did want to mention gelatin and glucose syrup is in here I don't know how that relates to either vegetarianism or veganism all right so the milligrams are definitely affecting me at this point I'd say I'm Spacey relaxed [Music] I'm frontier I was more minute early and now I'm more relaxed and I think when I get to doing the video editing it'll be easier to focus than trying to pull thoughts out of this brain it's more just do versus think which is wonderful my hands are so dry my knuckles oh my gosh I need to get more lotion I have to go okay I just needed a quick thing yeah yes I would recommend rabbits gummies I would say pretty much overall at this point different flavors you you're gonna like and not like so that's gonna be a personal thing but overall I think that Rob Potts does a good job with their gummies and the sours were delicious and not super sour and I really like that I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day", "itXy4bjeQPY": "hello hello and welcome back to my channel my youtube family okay today we are going to be doing fantasy the you spot for I have already popped a bag of popcorn I am placing it in my oven on 200 degrees so it will stay warm so that's what we're going to need we're going to need a small aluminum fan from your bike I am using Hennessy Cognac and I'm using just the great values of popcorn I am going to place my other two bags of popcorn into the microwave and get them all popped and we will get started okay you guys I am back I have placed my Carmel bikes into my small pot here and started them to melting down I have my popcorn and my oven and it is warming and what I added to start my caramel to melt down was a small amount of French vanilla coffee mate I have a 1/4 cup measuring cup here I added a very small amount just to cover the bottom of this measuring cup of Hennessy and I add it into my caramel and I started to melt down and they are melting down and they are almost finished I want it good and flowy with no lumps okay so once this is completely melted down the way I want it I will come back and show you the next step okay so we have our caramel completely melted down I am going to remove my popcorn out of the oven and place it on the top of my soul and I still have my stove on a low setting I just want to keep your popcorn warm and I am going to start to add my Hennessy so I am going to use my 1/4 measuring cup I am going to add my Hennessy I am going to take it all the way up almost to 1/8 of a cup and that's just to give it a little kick so these are going to be some very boozy caramel popcorn okay and all I am doing is stirring it in until it is completely combined okay okay so I have set my caramel to the side we are going to add our whole we're gonna add it a little bit at a time if you have any seeds just try to get rid of them so I added a little bit I am going to pour some up my caramel over okay so what I'm doing here is just coating until it is completely coated and I'm going to add the rest of my popcorn and completely coat it as well okay so I am adding the rest of my popcorn and this is a short and easy recipe it does not take long to make okay so that's gonna be all my popcorn I have some seeds left here that I am going to throw away and we're going to add the rest of our caramel and add it back to our lumina pan okay so we are going to add the rest of our caramel or however much that we need I'm pretty sure we're going to need it all and make sure it is coat it really good I'm trying to get all of my caramel out now we are going to mix it up and make sure you get it coated as much as possible we're going to add it back to our aluminum paint and place it into the oven for about five minutes five to ten minutes okay so what I did was coated it as much as I could I am going to spray my pan here just a light coat of spray we are going to add our popcorn back to our aluminum pan and we are going to place it back into the oven and we are going to place our oven on 250 and we are going to get our pots on brown a little bit and we are going to remove it so I'm going to place my oven on 250 we're gonna pop her back in the oven until she Browns and she will be finished okay so we are going to check our pop one so I am going to take it out of the oven because I want to make sure it's not burning so I am going to stir it a little bit and what I do is stir it up a little bit and I have a spray bottle with a small amount of Hennessy I am going to add some more Hennessy to my popcorn with my spray bottle stir it or try to flip them over as much as possible and we're going to spray again and place it back into the oven and let them sit for about eight more minutes okay okay we're gonna paste it back into the oven and let it sit for about 8 more minutes and they should be finished okay so here is my popcorn it is brown enough for me so I am going to pop it into the freezer for about 5 minutes and then we are going to bag okay you guys so here is the finished result of the popcorn and I have some bags here that I have labeled with Hennessy labels and I am going to start bagging hands in the window so you can see your popcorn you", "ljgPnV90PGA": "okay i am trying to try this even though i don't like green apple jelly winter i'm gonna try this kit three two one tastes like the green apple i sees okay guys um so that's the end of the video i was just like trying that thing and it kind of tasted good the first time but it didn't anymore so i'll see you guys in the next video bye", "2k7dVLr0Zio": "hello everyone I've been making candies suckers for a couple years now I usually make them real spicy with either habanero pepper or ghost peppers from the garden but today I wanted to do something different I'd like to try to make some bourbon flavored and another batch with absent won't follow me in the kitchen and see how these turn out all right I'm back in the kitchen now I'm gonna do the Bourbon first and I'll put all the ingredients and measurements down in the show notes below I'm gonna start off with a quarter cup of bourbon here punch get that on the leg then I'm gonna add 3/4 cup sugar and 1/8 teaspoon salt I don't have a heat all right the second I'm gonna go ahead and turn it on but I got it put in three tablespoons of corn sugar all right that's in there and then two tablespoons of water so you can get the jar open or the bottle open there's one and there's two get that out of the way now let me go ahead and turn this guy on it's a little noisy but I set it for right what is it for 25 see if that'll do it we want to keep stirring this until against to 300 degrees when this thing gets to 300 degrees I'm going to go ahead and shut it off and then add one more teaspoon of bourbon and then pouring in our sucker molds so we'll just let that sit so it comes the tongue and I'll be checking the temperature with one of these the thermal meters then infrared thermal meters they look pretty good we can actually shoot it in then out and it's 99 we're locked on 99 degrees [Music] okay we're about 240 but another sixty degrees that go and I have some food coloring that I was gonna put in here but I'm only gonna do it to the absent just maybe one or two drops so for a lesson Green nothing for the burger looks like there's a nice brown haze hood anyway we're past that 3-headed marking go ahead and shut it off not only about 1 teaspoon of bourbon there we go and do that just that an easy stir there okay we're ready to pour our mixture in the a molds all right let's see if we can't do this without messing up it's a little foamy [Music] a little bit more [Music] I didn't add in the food coloring like I said so they got a natural amber color which is perfect and I'll have to wait till these cool all the way since I don't have enough molds to do the absent flavor now absent I think it's going to be really good it should be able to get that nice licorice taste along with extra sugar huh all that foam went away not getting a lot of bubbles so when I tried the absent I'm gonna let it cool for a couple minutes maybe that was my problem in the beginning it was too hot all right this is gonna be it [Music] okay we made 24 suckers with that recipe there all right I'm gonna do some accent suckers now so just like before the store quarter cup of absent the pre-op Davis was a Pharaoh corn syrup all right let's start his night and last time when I did the burden I was stirring it the whole time I reread the directions on the Loran oils you know like peppermint cinnamon they used in regular candy I reread the directions and they said don't stir it I just let it come to a boil at 300 degrees or until it reaches beyond their degrees so I screwed up the first time so now I'm just going to stir it until the sugars melted and then leave all alone and this time I am going to use the food coloring I'm going to put a couple drops of neon green in there this induction cooktop here is pretty good it gets the temperature pretty quick okay looks like all the sugars are melted so I'm just going to leave it alone so it gets the 300 and now it's 170 508 if about 260 and I know if we're just doing the regular suckers with that no alcohol soon as he gets around 260 and jumps right up to 300 pretty quick okay we're getting close we're up to 90 the whole spots in there 300 okay go ahead and kill the heat for another 1 teaspoon of absent the cheese spoon and then okay and here's our food coloring I just put two drops in there that's it make sure this rule we put a total of five drops in by having three drops just in all right these guys in the mold now there's that foam again now I make a little mess a little bit [Music] [Music] I don't think I'm going to make as many as I did last time last time the Bourbon we've got 24 suckers looks like we're gonna get 24 all right we're done I tasted both of them had a lot of defects so I had to eat all the defects the Bourbon I definitely would not do again you can't really taste any of the Bourbon so that was just that that wasn't a big waste there's only a quarter cup but I would not do it again and absent definitely gonna do it again it doesn't have a real strong licorice taste but there just a subtle but it's really good so definitely gonna do the absent again but not with any type of bourbon and remember on that bourbon I was stirring it the whole time don't do that I can see a little bit of bubbles in the Bourbon once and I think that's what was caused by me stirring it or constantly stirring it with absent I didn't like the directions said stir it until the sugar dissolves and then leave it alone until it boils and then just keep an eye on it to against the 300 and pull it add your food coloring and one other teaspoon of absent or whatever you're doing you know if you're doing brandy bourbon the absent cherry yeah a cure whatever it is at the very end take it off the heat and if you're going to add some color go ahead and do that and add one other teaspoon of that liquor to it all right hope you enjoyed it and if you like this video go ahead and subscribe right up there the round one is

balled up and sticked up I got some more sticks coming in today colored one so we'll go ahead and use these white ones up so hopefully you'll be able to see how I'm going to do this we've got two sizes on it I'm going to use the small size and I found that if I press it in there flat and then go around in a circle before I scoop it out and scoop it out I get a perfect little ball with the skin on it so it's a half a ball three quarters of the ball then I'm going to take much stick in there through the skin there you go that's all there is to it we'll just keep doing that find another spot on the Apple I can use pretty easy once you get the hang of it took me a while to get the hang of it let's see if I can do about a hundred of these huh there you go I've run out of sticks I got some more coming from Amazon today but God knows when that will come this account though to see how many I got I'll put some limits on those 57 I got 57 hours put some lemon juice on that okay so either I'll get some more sticks or we'll go with what we got we'll see what happens countdown here I ended up adding another 12 hours of final dry on this because the strawberry we're still frozen in the center and let's take her out and see what we got okay looks like we're doing pretty good on this one there's a nice thick strawberry there god I hate to bite into it but you've got to check them they're dumb and I might add that strawberries delicious so what we got a hundred over 100 miniature apples which is basically a tip from a melon baller and made little balls from the Apple my leftover strawberries so what I'm gonna do because we're gonna cover half of these enough candy coating half of the apples and half of the apples and a caramel coating and the strawberry so that's a lot of work going on and obviously I don't want to leave these sitting out absorb room moisture from the air so I'm going to bag these up and these pre-made that I did earlier just playing all the FoodSaver tight bags although I don't have a food saver I have a back master which I'll show that in operation here in a second so I'm gonna put these in real quick so they're going just absorb no moisture I'm going to show this process on the last bag but for quickness I want to get these done [Music] I like this bat master because like there I'm backing it out and when it got as tight as I wanted it I can automatically press seal and it stops vacuuming and that's a sill from there on you don't end up rushing it too much let's see look at that I love that bat master way much better than the other brand I'm not sure I should really say that Brandis everybody knows what there is what they are now I can put that away and at my leisure I can open them up and dip them when I'm ready now I'm gonna count out 50 of these that's 55 58 okay so I'm going to go ahead and bring the camera around and show you me vacuum now this does use the FoodSaver type material which is quilted can't do smooth bags with it you can do like seal the mylar bag and it's got an adjustable heat on it you can put it as hot it's pretty hot it'll fill it 7l bag but you can't vacuum it so with this vacmaster you just flip it up like that lay that in there in the chamber plant hold it shut the door hold it fresh start it'll suck the lid down then you don't have to hold it no more maybe I will have to hold this one and would it get to where you want it you go ahead and press still yeah I don't want to crunch it too much so that interrupts the vacuum and automatically goes this hill I love it there you have it beautifully still package I can put those away and when I'm ready I can just open them up and start dipping them just really want to demonstrate you how swelled up that vacuum work supposin ain't nothing in there I'm really happy with this worth everything and these this is a light commercial grade I mean the last years if you take care of it I would imagine and the parts are all replaceable so I've read online I bought it from Amazon that customer service with back masters is fantastic they'll work with you I'm really happy and I think I bet that's well not well spent money I really do believe that so I'll put these aside and get cleaned up I need to run to the store and get a few things and I'll come back and we'll start making the candy coat and I think I'll do the candy coat is first see you then okay they say third time's a charm so we're going to try it again so first time I burnt it second time it got too frothy wasn't happy with that so this time we're gonna try it again three cups of sugar one cup water I'm getting a pro with this I'll tell you in Africa or corn syrup okay get my candy thermometer out again the heat on medium-high [Laughter] and we'll bring that up to 300 I think what happened with my getting it frothy last time was I put those gold and silver sprinkles in and when I stirred that in it really frost up so this time I'm not going to put anything in it other than food coloring and we'll go from there I think it'll work this time okay we are at 300 now this time I'm going to put just a little drop of cherry a hint to cherry and some red dye and stir it gently last time I stirred it too much and it got too much air in it it bub just bubbled up bubbling now but you don't want too many bubbles okay let's see if we get away with looks like third time's the charm knock on wood I'm doing really well here these are looking really pretty [Music]", "-LJbTRZHAPs": "hello hi it's ritzy I'm in the Apple store and I'm charging my

ingredients but the key to successful candy making at home is having all of your ingredients set out because caramelized sugar waits for no one combine the sugar corn syrup and water in a small saucepan over medium heat you want to bring the sugar to a boil until it reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit which is the hard crack stage and then using a pastry brush dipped in water wipe around the sides of the pan to loosen any sugar crystals once the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit and immediately submerge the pan in a bowl of ice water and this will stop it from cooking and this is the point when you want to work really quickly because the sugars gonna harden almost instantly pour the sugar into two to three inch circles on your lined baking sheet and then immediately place the lollipop sticks and sprinkles on top and there you have it homemade lollipops just switch up the sprinkles to match your holiday for more recipes and tips check out just to taste calm [Music] you",

today are bringing some more kids mania candy this one's called grab pop and looking at this box it looks like we got grape strawberry and green apple flavor these candy toys are always fun so I can't wait to play with them you let me take off this plastic wrapper move this to the back right here all right one two three four five six we have two rows of six so that makes 12 grab pops here's a closer look at the green and yellow grab pop I'm gonna take a wild guess and say this is green apple let's see what happens when we press this green button Oh while it extends to club pinches it's like a jab claw here's a different color this one's pink and purple this flavor could either be great or strawberry we'll have to check out the other clocks if I down these things are so cool hey guys look I have claw hands now don't make me pinch you our last color is blue and purple I think this one's the great one and the other one strawberry hmm I wonder if it's easy to pick things up with this we'll have to try it out later let's see if I guess my flavors right there's a plastic that's wrapped around the middle here but I think we could just pull it out you gotta use a little force there we go now let me just peel this wrapper off I got one right this is green apple if you can't finish the lollipop in one setting you can just put the cap back on and you can always grab something too I was a little confused at first but let's see what this labor is I guess strawberry nice I'm two for two I forgot to mention earlier but these tastes really good put the cap back on for this one claw jab so it looks like this one's the grape one YUM I've that too many lollipops already I'll save this for later you guys ready to test out these claws let's give around the club floss for our volunteers get it hey juicy orange oops sorry yes I grabbed Twilight Sparkle easily put you back down but oh don't worry i'll pick you back up these things are actually hard to use you can't really

pinch of salt swirl it around so everything gets absorbed cook on medium heat your sugar syrup will begin to pop clear bubbles then eventually turn a caramelized bronze amber color your candy is only ready when it registers at 300 degrees or when you dip it in cool water it hardens it should be set and never sticky lastly with the heat turned off swirl in a half a tablespoon of rum eaten either

alright so that was pretty much it for this video thank you for watching and I will see you guys later", "lIOaYPbhjcc": "Valentine's comes so soon it seems like after Christmas I mean literally about the day after the Christmas decorations are taking down the store I think the Valentine's display are put up I know it all seems too soon to sudden everything comes too fast but I do love a reason to celebrate and you know what if it can be a little bit more of a homemade celebration I think all the better that's why I'm gonna help you make amazing homemade Valentines suckers this year what you're gonna make the suckers I know it's so easy to go to the store and just buy a bag of mom and give them out to people give them to your kids to take to their class but come on making my home is actually so fun and I think you're going to be surprised how easy this is because it really is easy but as a word of caution before we start working with sugar is dangerous you can actually burn yourself and I'm just gonna tell you now I've done it I am telling you from experience just the other week before Christmas I burned myself pretty bad on a batch of peanut brittle so you want to make sure to have a bowl of ice water by the stove ready to go plunge your hand into it if you get sugar on it so be careful and do not let the kids help do this because it can be a little scary but put that aside don't worry if you do it right you will not have a problem to start you just want to make sure to have everything ready to go you can buy these sucker molds at any craft supply store kitchen store they are extremely inexpensive and you can buy any shape you want since it's Valentine's I'm meeting some hearts but I also have just some regular round circles too just to add a little bit of difference and show you what you can do I like to put my molds on parchment lined baking sheet that way if you drizzle any of the sugar onto the counter or onto the sheet it just goes round to that parchment paper and it is really easy cleanup so before we start you just want to make sure to rub the insides of all these molds with vegetable oil once again from experience I've learned if you don't they don't really come out that nice and they don't look that nice so just lightly put a little bit of a paper towel and vegetable oil and rub the insides of the mold then you just want to put some sucker sticks which come from the craft supply store - they're usually right beside these molds so don't worry place them in with the mold and have it go about half way up into the sucker kind of just however much you want it to go up and then you are ready to go once your molds are ready to go you can just set them aside and leave them until you're ready next it's important to make sure everything is also ready to go so just have whatever flavoring you're going to use and we'll talk about that here in a little bit and your food coloring just set aside and ready for when it's needed because as you know in the past when you work with sugar once the sugars ready you need to be ready there is no time to just wait around part of making sure everything is ready I also like to have a glass heat proof measuring cup at least a two cup size ready to go to pour the sucker mixture in before you pour them into the molds if you try to write out a saucepan you were gonna have the stuff all over and you don't want that so just lightly oil the inside of this measuring cup so it comes out easier and cleanup is easier and then set that aside okay to start in a small saucepan you just want to put in some sugar yes these are suckers so of course they have sugar then you just want to put a little bit of water and some corn syrup now the corn syrup I like to take the measuring cup and just lightly rub it with oil too that way it will just come out a little bit easier you don't have to that is just a nice little tip that I love to do once all your ingredients are in that saucepan you just want to set it on the stove over medium to medium-high heat stir it just a little bit to make sure now the sugars sticking to the bottom and then once it is starting to get warm you can just turn it up to high yes remember I said this gets really hot so it turns up to high have that ice water beside you and be watching it it's going to come to a full boil and remember that a boil is about 212 degrees so once it starts boiling you know that it's about 212 degrees but we are taking this all the way up to hard crack which is about 300 degrees and that's quite a ways to go so once it starts boiling you just want to start watching it closely and then after a little while you want to start taking the temperature to see where it's at usually I find that once it starts boiling it stays around 225 to 230 for quite a while that temperature is usually where the water starting to boil off and evaporate and once that's done it really starts to climb so watch it carefully make sure to have your candy thermometer fitted on your saucepan if you're using a traditional candy thermometer I use an instant-read thermometer which I love but you may not all have one so use whatever you're used to once your temperature reaches 300 degrees turn off the stove and take the pan off right away this is where I said it's great to have everything ready to go you want to pour in your flavoring now you can use whatever flavoring you like I do a mix the traditional old recipe that my grandma used to make mushy made candy was just cinnamon candy which I know in today's modern times a lot of people don't love cinnamon candy I still kind of like it i no big surprise but you can also go the more modern route and do cherry I love to use whatever flavoring and usually these flavorings are right beside these candy molds in the aisle so you can just pick and choose right there and then put in your food coloring red obviously it's Valentine's Day and then stir that up it is going to bubble kind of vigorously at first so be careful and then pour it right into your prepared measuring cup you do want to work rather quickly because sugar does harden fairly fast so once it's near majoring cups start pouring it into your molds I like to pour it directly over that stick that's going to be in the middle of the sucker that way you make sure that's coated completely and if it starts to bubble quite a bit in your molds just move on to the next one and then you may have to go back and fill them back up if they weren't all the way full as you can tell as I keep going along it gets a lot thicker because it is cooling down so it is becoming harder don't worry you just have to work as quick as you can but don't rush yourself you could always make more you don't want to get in a hurry and either burn yourself or make a huge mess once you have all of it out of there and in your molds you just want to set the mold aside in a little bit cooler place until they harden completely that's all there is to it I told you this was easy once they are hard they just pop right out of the mold because we oiled them make sure you all them or they are not gonna pop right out they're gonna break out and then no one's happy with that once you take my out of the mold you can put them right into one of these nice little cellophane bags they're clear they look perfect on these suckers then they won't stick together either and then just twist them off with a little twist tie I mean these are so fun because you made them it is so much more meaningful and you can tailor them to whatever flavor you love so this Valentine's I hope you make your own sucker candy because they are absolutely delicious fun and easy if you agree in like this video make sure to click like below

we help you transform the ordinary home into an extraordinary home yes and today we have got a fun project for you we do we are going to be making some yarn lollipops these are so cute they would be really cute on a christmas tree in wreaths and just in any kind of candy themed decor for christmas yes you could even just put them in a vase put several of them in a little vase and have them on a side table or something they'd be so cute yes i think these are so adorable so let's go ahead and tell you what we're working with today to make these lollipops you will need two different um colors of really chunky yarn so this is uh some yarn that i got from hobby lobby and we've got a few different colors that we're going to be using today you also need these discs they're foam circle discs from the dollar tree yep and they come two in a pack yeah and you're going to need a pair of scissors then you're going to need something to use for the stick now what we have chosen to use for our lollipop stick are just straws decorative straws that you can get from walmart they may even have them at the dollar tree i'm not sure about that but these actually came from michael's that we're using today yes and they make it so festive and cute yeah you'll also need your glue gun yep got to have that and we're going to be making a couple of little bows to go on them so we've got some um just any kind of thin wired ribbon yes all right so let's go ahead and get started yes let's do the first thing we want to do is find the center of our disk so you can actually use a tape measure and find the exact center but i'm just going to eyeball it and just make a little mark with my scissors just a small little place so that i know that that's the center now you also want to go ahead and make your hole that your uh straw is going to go into so just use your scissors and just push it in and make you a hole just like that now we've got it ready so we're going to now use our glue gun and right where you marked in the center just put a dot of your glue and we're just gonna put these two down we've got them together we're just gonna put those down right on that dot of glue now just be careful you will burn yourself so be very careful well hopefully you don't yes hopefully not but if you need to just mash it down using your scissors just like that yeah but you can any time you're working with yeah you can certainly definitely okay now you want to go ahead with your glue and make a ring right around where your yarn is going to go so let's go right around there and we're just going to twist just like this we're going to just twist it right around you do want it to be right up next to the one so you've got to do it a little tightly but not too tight and if you see that you don't have enough glue just go through like this and glue some more just like that we're just going to continue as we go around continue using our glue and we're just gonna continue to wrap it right around and the really great thing about these they don't have to be perfect no they don't you can do them any kind of color combination you could even use three colors if you wanted to but i like the two like this i'm just going to keep coming around and i just go back and make sure if i lift up on it and it's not glued then i just put a little glue right there because you do want it to hold so just go back and make sure that you've got it glued just like that and we're just going to continue on around and i kind of use my hand just to pat it down yes it'll take you know a little bit for that glue to dry but exactly kind of helps yes it does these are already turning out so aren't they cute and yes your yarn will get twisted a little bit but you just untwist it just like that and we're just going to continue using our glue to stick it and make sure that it's glued really well all around and you can kind of tell as you're doing it if there's a piece that's not glued it will kind of be up a little further so uh just go ahead and put a little glue right there now we're going on around i've got to get another glue stick okay i'm actually doing a candy thing for christmas oh yes i always do one in my dining area and kitchen so i'm excited to use these yes this year and you know you can spend a lot of money going just by trying and it does you know i get that you know it makes things quicker to buy things but it's not nearly as fun as making them yourself right not and this is a great project that you could do with the kids uh you could use actually elmer's glue to do this it's going to take drying time so it's going to be a you know longer process now when you get to the side you just want to continue on around you see how the side is and i'm still going to continue on around and make sure that i've got them together going up my side just like that because you do want to make sure it's all covered so we're just going to continue on around i'm running out of glue yeah a little bit there we go make sure i get my pink one glued really good on the side just like that whoops got in the glue okay and you're just going to keep going around make sure to get around the top because you don't want to leave a place around the top at all so you want to keep bringing them around just like that until see how the whole complete top is done now and we've got part of the side so now i'm just going to continue on the side adding my glue and actually one or two if you get two um things of the yarn it will make several of these yes it will if you get two rolls it'll make i don't know how many but a good bit yes it will and you could even you know if you've got get four rolls then you could make several different combinations and that would be so cute okay now i'm still just going on around and you see it's automatically coming towards the back as you come around so i'm just using my glue i'm going ahead and putting the glue on there make sure it's up around the the one in front of it just like that because you don't want a single space oops i gotta get some more glue too now the good thing about when you do use the white yarn like i'm using if you do have a little bit of a space it's not it's not going to show as much that's true and don't worry you see i did get some glue on my yarn don't worry about that you can cut that off and it's not even going to be noticeable you just want to make sure it's really good and tight all the way around okay now before i go any further i'm just going to go around and make sure i see a little spot right here that didn't get enough glue so i'm going to put a little glue there so that i don't have any places that it's not glued well okay now we're all the way around to the complete back and you she's way ahead of me look at there you are ahead i mean these really are very simple they are simple it's literally just wrapping it around and it is extremely easy but like i was saying about the kids just make sure that if you do uh do these with your kids or your grandkids that you use a different kind of glue because the hot glue is gonna you're going to get it on you yeah i would definitely either use a low temp what we're using is a high temp with this you can use either one yes so whatever you have on hand is fine but definitely if you're doing it with kids um yes i mean i'd stick with elmer's glue i think i would just maybe a project that i do with my kids yes you can certainly do that they would love it oh they would they would get a kick out of this they definitely would because i had shown them these yesterday when i finished one and both of them loved it yeah well they love lollipops yes and really i'm not even going for perfection here because they look so cute and they don't even have to be perfect no they don't they absolutely don't i'm just going to continue to go around until you get it completely covered so i'm gonna go ahead and put enough blue on the last part to get it finished okay once you get to the end i'm a little bit ahead of her you just want to cut that right off yep but you see how simple and adorable this is now that i've gotten to the center goodness how cute now these i'm just going to put another little dab of glue in there and i'm just going to put these right in the inside just like that okay now how adorable i've got it all over my fingers too cute yes aren't they adorable they don't even have the sticks out what guys would be so cute you could actually make these into ornaments oh yes and hat just clip some of the little you know um yes fishing line a little fishing line certainly make them ornaments for your tree wouldn't that be wouldn't that be so cute yes so they're cute like that but we're going to now make them into lollipops yep so i'm just going right now and just mashing again just to make sure that i've got it good all the way around mine is pretty secure yes and now i've got to find the hole that i made i found my hole yeah i'm not going to use that color yeah there's mine so let me go over here and get a stick and let's see now i lost it where was it i've got to find it again there it is yeah they're you just want to make sure you put that little hole first just because that styrofoam is pretty it is tough to get this through and that just kind of helps it and it's going to keep it really secure in there yes it will and i am having a time trying to find where it is you found it and then and then i lost it i should not have moved should i make another one yes i certainly can it doesn't matter that's exactly what i'm going to do i bet it's right down there i think so but somewhere yeah i thought it was but i can't find it but if you forget to make the hole or anything like that you can simply do it after you have made it just use your scissors again just like that and then put some glue around the end of it and that just kind of extra and just stick it straight in just like that is that not adorable yeah and like i was saying that just kind of makes it extra secure because really i mean you could do it without even gluing it in there mine was in there pretty good yeah so really just kind of makes it extra secure it does now i said i was going to show you uh there were several places that i got a little bit of glue on my yarn just take like this and just kind of clip it off any of the glue try don't pull on it because if you pull it's going to unravel the the yarn so you don't want to pull on it but just kind of clip it off and i see i didn't get my end down in there good so let me go back and get my end in there these are so cute they really are and you see how easy they are it takes just a few minutes to do that but oh so easy and so adorable and if you wanted to there's a couple things you could do to kind of dress them up even more you could sprinkle some glitter on there if you wanted to you could spray some glitter um this diamond dust glitter blast i think would be so cute sprayed on it yes i'm not going to spray it right now just because we're not in a well insulated area when you do it that you are in a well-ventilated area you can just spray that just do it outside spread do a couple sprays on there it's just going to give it that nice little glitter yes because we love glitter and bling yes got to have that got to have it so but see and now we want to put a little bow on these and you could use you know any color that you wanted to anything like that uh or you could not have a bow right so we'll leave one without and we'll add you know you can just do the different ways you can do it yes you could just tie it right around that way do you see the wire the floral wire over there what i'm going to do is i'm just going to uh get a piece of floral wire now um you could use pipe cleaners or anything like that uh but i'm just going to make a quick little bow by making a loop you don't want a big one so we're just going to do a little loop like that i'm just going to make my loop i'll leave the place right there and then i'm just going to twist my ribbon around and make another loop just make sure they're about even just like that and then i'm just going to cut these off and i'm just gonna take my wire you could use anything that you've got a pipe cleaner uh anything like that would work but i'm just twisting it around the center and i've got a cute little bow and then i'm what i'm you could actually wire it here just like this to the back but what i'm going to do i've twisted it several times so it's not going to come loose so i'm just going to cut the wire off just like that and i want to dovetail these ends to make them pretty so to do that i just fold them over in the center and take my scissors at the corner and cut upward and i'm going to do the same thing here fold it in half and here where the corner is i'm going to take my scissors and go upward just like that and that makes those cute little dovetails and then i'm just going to put a little dot of glue right there and dot it like that and now we've got our cute little bow see how sweet those are so you can as you can see different

actually wasn't sure that would work out but it worked out perfectly so I thought it would be cool to use a OS capsules to move Jolly Rancher I don't know ring pops you can cover I don't know what you want to call them cos ring pops so I bought a bag of Jolly Ranchers I have four different color cos capsules here so I'm gonna try to make green I guess green apple right there I matched up with the three EOS it will be delicious then we're gonna have watermelon blue raspberry and grape dee-licious so before you do anything you want to make sure you have your capsule ready because once you heat up and I use the microwave your candies it hardens very quickly you want to make sure that you snap it back and then I'll keep in okay and I used five or six candies you can probably get away with five maybe before if that's all you have but for sure it's better to use a little bit more than a little bit less obviously and then I put them in the microwave for 10 seconds at a time you could probably go over 20 the first time if you felt comfortable but just really really watch it because it does melt quite quickly actually maybe a total of 30 to 40 seconds so watch the ball might be hot here we have melted Jolly Rancher green apple flavor carefully carefully carefully pour it into your capsule and again it does hard it quite quickly the stuff in the bowl is already getting sticky it's hardening is you want to make sure you try to go as quick as possible if it does harden you can always microwave again and then put the remainder in your capsule so once you have that put it in the fridge or freezer and you should be good to go so when I went to go make the purple there was only three grapes my package which I tried to make work but it didn't so what I did is I melted the grapes so the three grapes that I had I poured it in and then you'll see that it actually melted two of the cherries because I had about 20 cherries that I wasn't using I guess Jolly Rancher things with everybody likes cherry I don't know so I put two extra cherries on top of the grape and then you'll see that I have to do that for the blue raspberry as well because they only gave me three blue ones so again I use some extra cherries and put them on top [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I am so happy with how this turned out it's still the perfect POS shape just like hope for [Music] the feature the extra little plastic that came off supposed to be but that's fine just pops right off put it back on the lid and breathe out back here awesome a Jolly Rancher gos repot can you see their face [Music] thanks for coming to watch our video you guys this is super easy and it's really quite dummy at the end of it so I hope you guys can try it please come back to watch more of our videos make sure you subscribe like and share and if you leave a comment or get back to as fast as we can right [Music]", "Pv58NamFqz8": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I am super super excited because we are reviewing a product I love a lot loved in my entire life love de ma since I've been four years old and we are reviewing Nutter Butter bytes the snack seals real peanut butter edition you can grab them you can share them you can zip them and take them anytime anywhere that is the Nutter Butter bytes promise the peanut butter lovers cookie I'm just [ __ ] with you we're actually reviewing peanut butter another butter bytes if you like Nutter Butter bytes but I've got these here because I'm actually out of my real substance Nutella which is what I like to take before I review any remedies that's right what we're really reviewing today is T key killers what a name T key killers gummies these guys right here they're coming fancy looking little T shapes kind of cool-looking so this is a 300 milligram edible green apple flavor and it cost me $15 at my dispensary got it at a $2 discount so 13 bucks if this is really a 300 milligram edible great deal I gotta admit I'm already a little apprehensive because one gummies rarely work for me outside of flourish and occasionally cookie or cushy punch and too rarely do you get these edibles that are cheaper that have a lot of milligram \u00e4j-- that actually seem to pan out it works sometimes sometimes you really do get good deals but often especially when they have sort of suspect packaging like tiki killers here which is just a ziploc bag and a couple of stickers they can be misleading because they really have no there's no regulation there's no reason that they can't about their mill agreement so why not outside I've screwing their customers I'm not suggesting they're doing that let's give them the full review here first and make sure and and and you know give them a fair shake but I'm just letting you know I'm a little apprehensive okay so as I said this is the TT killers 300 milligram apple green apple flavor if you've never tuned in 2 weeks before their way our reviews work is I'm going to eat this product maybe not the entire thing in front of you but I will eat this whole thing over the next couple of minutes and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling or I'll just edited it through and you'll see me in a couple seconds and I'll say guys I'm super high or guys I'm super not high okay so here we go we've got one of the little gummy pieces right here it's actually a quite a little handsome gummy I like the sculpt on it quite a bit so let's go ahead and plop her in my mouth this is a very cool looking gummy well tasty no real cannabis taste good green apple tastes good get me taste some nice sugar coating on this outside good gummy um like the taste is that got me quite a bit help a lot better than like the infused creations or a tap here or any of those kind of gummies um but what it's really gonna have to come down to oh I could eat some Nutter butters I always like to have a little fat before I consume any gummy edibles just because the THC is fat activated so or as fat soluble normally I have Nutella but I'm out okay well I'm gonna finish off these Tiki killers and I will see you guys in two hours or through the magic of editing just a couple of seconds to let you know I'm feeling thanks for watching weights guys and I will see you in just a bit peace alright guys it's been two hours since I had the Tiki killer or killers Ikki I can't really remember which way it was to be honest than 300 milligrams which might be a good sign for the product because I am rather pleased with it I'm very surprised I was I was a doubting Thomas and Here I am in accepting Andrew it's not perfect I would say I'm at like a 6 right now but it tasted great I am hi I am unpleasantly hi and and for a dummy it was it's it's it's almost up there with flourish in terms of quality again it tasted really good no cannabis taste whatsoever I really like the design of the becoming I know that doesn't really mean much but hey I like it and it you know I tasted really good and I'm unpleasantly high I wish our maybe were just a little bit higher for a 300 more for an edible but you know I can't fault it too much because it is still one of the best companies I've ever had outside of flourish and so guys I'm really pleased with TP killer or killers EE I'm sorry I couldn't remember their name but I'm looking forward to reviewing some more of their products to see if they're gonna say nice and consistent and with that guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeks I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on a later review peace", "25EEBT4WV6g": "what is up people mr. father here bringing you another video it's time for another family article food review so yesterday's video was probably the healthiest thing that I've reviewed so far this month this is one of the least healthy that I that I will review this month and that is Tootsie you know tootsie roll caramel apple pumps aka caramel apple flavored lollipops obviously lollipop have no nutritional value whatsoever but here are the nutritional facts for you and the ingredients not many ingredients which is usually a good thing to be honest you're gonna have something unhealthy you probably want that ingredients list to be as short as possible anyway I got one out and here we I didn't open it I didn't take the wrapper off but the wrapper is already coming off as it is there it is I don't know how well you can see that kind of looks like crap but we'll see what it tastes like [Music] [Music] you know now nope that that's not real caramel that is fake caramel right there that's that's the fake or cheap caramel no I don't recommend this product at all I didn't even get to the the Apple part I don't want to know no I don't I don't like it this is not something that I'm going to finish no I'm sorry about that I am NOT finishing that new I mean probably still slightly better than the KitKat but no I still no no do I recommend this new Tootsie you did bad no heck no no if that tasted like your actual tootsie rolls and sure I would have definitely recommended this product so I did wind up finishing it I felt the need to have to explain it actually is good I'm pretty sure that those first few initial tastes were the taste of the plastic it was in because after getting that first layer off but still tasting the caramel the caramel actually tasted really good and the green apple actually tasted really good so I am pretty sure that that really bad taste that I did not like at the start of this video was the plastic that seeped into the product it's at it see if you can fix that then you have a good product right now that initial taste was horrible pretty sure was the plastic now see you guys but", "88RUTFPqS7g": "[Music] [Music] [Music] hey you guys welcome back in shade from stars for days I don't have my shirt unfortunately but check me out on instagram at styles for days and also on facebook as fast as it as well and as usual my tutorials are long because I like to give a lot of detail that's usually left out one tutorials once again they usually give you the ingredients and how to do it but never really explaining all the other questions you may have so today we are having the long awaited teeny pop tutorial and as you know I am dropping free tutorials I'm getting to getting to them as soon as I can but the editing I did not realize how much editing is involved plus I have a pop-up shop coming up on Saturday of this week this week it'll be June 1st so I am like super inundated so I apologize for the long wait but let's get right into the recipe so this was because for 10 cups of popcorn and I have buttered popcorn because this sauce is caramel based in like what's better than butter popcorn or caramel so can you use plain like that absolutely that's fine that's the butter I just like the taste in the flavor of it and no one's not a big huge difference so since some of you who are like more conscious about adding more butter and things like that and you can use either okay so then we have 1 cup of light brown sugar as you can see and note it is not packed so don't worry about packing it it's not causing for that is just calling for 1 cup of light brown sugar then also we have one stick of unsalted butter so we reason being for the unsalted is because one we have a salt on the popcorn even if you have plain there's an ingredient for salt you know who I think should be so salty that it's overpowering one the intended alcohol and then to the caramel and I just always cut my butter up in these smaller chunks because it's easier to dissolve and even when I make cakes and stuff they're usually small pieces like that because most cake recipes require you to drop you know one bit at a time as you go and add in or you know you want to make sure that it's consistently room temperature so you know that's what that is and in this case it does not matter whether it's room temperature or straight out of the fridge so that's one stick of unsalted butter then we call for a 1/2 teaspoon of salt which I have here in my little measuring spoon then also a 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and I'm looking at my notes so you guys who are following me and that will change follow me when I'm looking off I'm looking at my notes because like I said I want to be very detailed so I wrote every little big thing down and I will say that if you guys want principal versions of these things please go and DM me at either of those handles I gave you Facebook or Instagram and I will get that to you it is a fee for that these are completely free before the printed version it's a small fee not not going to be completely picked out about so you know hit me up if you need that so again this is a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and this is 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and I'm going to get into why we use the baking soda towards the end who will like what I do the review then I also have 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar and I'll get into why this is a great ingredient as well not all of them calls for the cream of tartar I like to use it and the reason why will be at the end when I do the review and then last but not least 1 tablespoon of white corn syrup and like I told you guys before I always add just a little drop more because it's almost impossible to scrape every last little bit of the corn syrup out of whatever container you're using and therefore I want to make sure my recipes are complete in the event that your recipes fall short of certain ingredients that is why you guys will experience a different result these ingredients matter having them exactly as their state so be very careful when you're measuring you want everything to be exact to the amount otherwise you don't have all those results where you're like oh watch I know that I did everything but it didn't come out the same well that's why so with that being said that's all the ingredients now some things you will need is something to start with I like these whoops bachelors or whatever your spoons whenever you call them so you'll see me with these all the time I just love them especially with caramel and then a saucepan as usual you guys probably seen this this will be one of our close friends and also parchment paper and then as you guys know what's most baking or any baking some degree they'll need a baking sheet and in this case you want to have to my other one is over there but you don't have to baking sheets so I am going to pause right here so for those of you going to follow me go ahead and pause and grab all of your ingredients and we're going to meet back over at the stove and the ingredients you want to take with you it's basically everything except for the popcorn everything else is going with you all but I'm sorry I have this container that I'm going to be using along with some other bags because this is actually a for order so this is just just to show that yeah you do need something to store it in to keep it fresher as well so yes I'm going to go ahead and we'll walk to the stove and I will meet you guys back at that point okay guys then we're back at the stove and what I added in the pot was the brown sugar the butter the corn syrup the salt and then also we're adding the cream of tartar and I'll explain to you what all those ingredients do including the baking soda again at the end for the review so now what I'm going to do is turn my stove on and as you guys know I wear gloves for sanitary purposes not that you'll even be touching the the palm way at all but I just like wearing gloves I'm a germaphobe so what we're gonna bring this up to a boil and at this point we'll just be fast-forwarding so I'm just going to stir this wish this thing this recipe does require for you to stir it the entire time reason being the sugar can stick to the bottom of the pot and cause it to burn so with this particular sauce we would want to constantly stir you so you guys at this point this is the boil that you want to go for but you also want to keep stirring so that it does not stick go ahead and set your timer for four minutes and keep stirring this for four minutes and then I will be right back to tell you the last step right before we coat the popcorn okay how are y'all meet you this is what it looks like it looks kind of frothy this is completely what it needs to look like this color is fine keep stirring because it will stick now you're turning the heat off and move it off the heat so that's what I'm doing I sit in my pocket and then you just kind of let that cool down a little bit and then the last step would be to add the baking soda again I'll explain why that's needed and a caramel sauce and then also last but not least the whole reason why we here the Hennessy and then don't be alarmed it's gonna look like like it's seizing up but just start keep going it keeps going and then at this point I did put a note that your oven should have been preheated to 250 with your baking sheets line with the parchment paper and so now we will allow this to cool maybe about a couple of minutes which would be enough time for you to get your bowl and your popcorn and everything to where it needs to be and then we're going to drizzle so we'll meet back at the counter all right you guys already removed it from heat as you can see when we come a little closer this is the end result of the syrup so then you basically just take this and you pour it over the top come on this is always a part that everybody gets a little nervous about in your life this is one make the popcorn soggy because it looks to be like a wet a wet ingredient so then all you do is just stir and you keep stirring to coat all the popcorn side note you guys don't get nervous I know how this looks you're like it's not gonna cover it it's not enough just keep stirring and I promise you it will coat all ten cups and again if you feel like you wanted to take some of the popcorn out that's already heavily coated to get it out of your way because maybe you don't have a big enough bowl then you're more than welcome to do that to ask for me I'd like to just continue to stir the whole so everything is completely [Music] [Music] [Music] normally should reach I believe it's in the 200s I'll look that up so maybe below where I put the recipe and other notes and so also so I told you guys about a few ingredients that I will let you know the wise and at the end of the review so the baking soda is for brownie and texture baking soda reacts with the acid which is usually found and relaxes brown sugar corn syrup to create tiny carbon dioxide air balls pista foaming so you guys seen when I added that in there not only did you see like the steam and stuff come up but it actually looked like your foamed up that was because of the baking soda but it is very necessary because once it cools down all the trapped air bowls they create a softer texture and that makes it where it's soft and pliable versus hard like candy so that's why caramel popcorn and things like that is not hard like suckers and stuff it's because you add the baking soda and it gives more of a creamy texture then also the cream of tartar that's added because it will prevent the crystallization as the caramel cooks in the oven so it stops it from drying out and basically we need disintegrating like one beyond this sheet here it's like little crystals and stuff like that little small crystallization but that prevents it so some recipes you may see does not call for it's them do I prefer this one because I'm it really does matter also any brown liquor you can use any brown liquor for this when I say brown liquid I'm not talking about like beer or anything like that but any of these the tequila's the Brandy's this is also the one that I'm used for the Crown Royal all those just substitute it out also once you taste it if you feel as though it's not you know the taste of alcohol it's not enough for you you can take a spray bottle like a regular spray bottle that you would get for about a dollar that you would scream like your plants or a water fair here or whatever you would use it for but like the spray cleaning models make sure you sanitize it properly though and then you can take some of the liquor of choice put in there and you can spray it over here popcorn and pop it back into the oven and you can do that you can also tweak with it to you know play around with it and see if you add you know a couple tablespoons at a time until you get what's desired if you add too much it will not come up correct so that's why I'm saying just kind of play around with it and see to your liking so the whole purpose of this is to have a a Hennessy infused taste but not like you're drinking a straight shot so that's the difference also last but not least you have to stir this the reason why you have to stir this this particular caramel this is my no such guy that wrote everything it's because you it'll it'll burn the sugar asila to the bottom and it'll begin to burn so that's why some caramel recipes does not cause for you to start if I could tell you do not stir because of a cause aeration which will mess it up and make it even turn heart and seize up so make sure that whatever other recipes that you're using for combos based type things you follow those recipes exactly if this case you do want to cert and as you can see this is my half gallon size so half of that tin cup batch which means is about five cups fill this up to about well almost to where I would I probably grab another another few pieces so that it's level and flush here so I'm gonna add that other than that check the bottom for the recipe my notes everything I'm very descriptive in the bottom leave a comment subscribe send your friends over here again check me on Instagram south for days face book sales today's as well and I have plenty more tutorials coming you guys I have this pop-up shop so after this weekend I still have a lot of orders however I will definitely sit down and get into the the editing for the rest of the tutorials so and the next one I'll do actually which will probably a real short maybe 5 to 10 minute tutorial will be the caramel pretzel rods they're so super easy people make it seem like it's a lot to it it's a very easy thing to do unless you wanna make your own caramel so I will do it both ways one with the caramel squares and then I'll do the other one where I actually make my homemade caramel and I'm not sure I will release that recipe or not because it's like a family thing so I was definitely going to me making my own caramel and cutting that up and then getting it to twist onto the pretzel rod so again thank you guys for tuning in this is Shea at spouse today and I will be back for another tutorial thanks you guys for watching and see you", "CTj0rWbNLDs": "[MUSIC PLAYING] It's so hot.

last time I have food I had to eat out of here that was really craving it alright bye you guys see you later", "gNWykIf6GSw": "hi and welcome everybody I will be making prison lollipops today so here's what you need to make prison lollipops first of all you'll need the fold top bags or as you know I used to like to call them the baggies these are the ones that just fold join any fold over you look for the sandwich bag you'll need some of these also you will need some q-tips okay and then you will need a bag of Jolly Ranchers or two if you want to make more the other thing you do that we did in prison is that we had a stinger which is a coil that is wrapped on a cord it's like it's a coil and then it plugs into the outlet and you heat up water so what I'm doing is I'm heating up water on the stove because we're gonna have to boil this okay so what you do first of all is I already have another bag of Jolly Ranchers I'm sure you guys wanted to see me hammer out these Jolly Ranchers I'm sure there's another way to crush them but I actually used a hammer and what I did is I open the box and I took them in I kept them in this okay because then I put a piece of plastic down and then I just smashed them inside this so what we're gonna do is once then they're smashed yeah I have already smashed ones over here they don't want to you watch me hammer forever that's horrible so I'm gonna get my baby out okay and I'm going to put well what I like to do too is I'm making two different colors of lollipops I'm gonna make the green ones with the green apple and then I'm going to make the cherry and watermelon together so we're just open them up and put them if I can get it open rights you know in so many ways I made my pajama it's like super hot in my apartment oh and then I made it go everywhere okay so let me pay attention while I'm doing this because this is the obviously notice the second video I did and the very first one I got Jolly Rancher stuff everywhere so this one's gonna be a little bit better I mean I didn't hammer in the bag so that's that's the smart thing so anyways like I said my apartment is like super hot right now we have in this department we have those old-time heaters so you know radiator ones so it's not like I get to change my heat you know what I mean so when it's cold outside they turn on and it's like super duper high you just turn this down yeah so all I'm doing is supporting the Jolly Ranchers I know you guys can't see this they really need to get a better setup um yeah I wouldn't like the picture that's a me and my mom and jab now when Jasmine was a little baby we did the old-time photos in Wisconsin down it's pretty cool it's sad to put something up there you know I think it looks a little bit better okay so see I got all the green ones together okay and I hope that's enough um and what you're gonna do is once it's in the baggy you're just gonna dip it in there because what you're gonna do is mold these what happens is the Jolly Rancher candy starts to melt it's very hot so it starts to melt and you might also want to grab a towel so then you can like instead of burning your hands you can kind of just kind of mush it together see houses like turn to mush but if your pieces are smaller it's a lot faster than lot easier to actually wash together Marsh what a great word um so what I'm doing is see there's a lot of clumps in this one you can see a lot of clumps is not mushing that well so again I'm gonna keep it in here this don't surprise little velvet oh there she comes the queen bee herself what are you doing my little love book something to you okay so I'm doing is trying to mush this so you got for Mom and into anything you want right now it's looking like a big green blob okay and this is great for the kids too they would have a lot of fun doing this you know melting stuff kids love to melt stuff and if you just let it sit in there it should have crushed them a little smaller it was like the smaller pieces when you have the smaller pieces it's so much easier and they're more finer and a lot easier to form yes so oh yeah this is going good now now it's getting smoother so again you can make any shape or whatever you want I'm going to try and make like a heart shape so you just mold it that's what you're doing so I mean right that's pretty cool huh okay so now I'm old with it right now the fun part about this is you got the molding and when it's hot so it does look like a heart right okay so when it's hot I'm gonna put this back in but right now I'm gonna cut my stick so cuz in prison we didn't have anything to make a stick with so we used a q-tip you know and just cut off to the ends of the q-tip like so this will probably go flying someplace I don't want to go but yeah there you go so you got the little stack all right cut another one you know or you can even peel this little q-tip back right here and cut closer again probably gonna go look went flying okay so now I have it one hold it so I'm gonna open this up okay kind of push that together and the thing is what I want to do now is I want to get this part right here the bottom part heated up so I can slip the stick in okay here we go this guy and you don't have to heat up too long but you got to make sure water is boiling and then what I'm gonna do now to make sure I grab my towel I'm gonna put the stick right inside there okay so you get it in there like that like so I don't if you do sticks there see and now I'm going to kind of just see I lost the shape of my heart so I'm gonna kind of mold it around the stick make sure it's covering on all sides and again I left a little bit of shape of my heart okay so now this one's the first one I'm gonna open it up and see what we got okay sometimes they stick to the bag sometimes they don't but usually you can just fill it right off this one's gonna be a little bugger cause he's sticking because it's still worn so kind of lopsided the heart kind of so it's still one it's still more maybe you should just let it uh kind of cool off a little bit more and don't come off I hope it'll come off there we go there there well that heart didn't turn out right it's a little lopsided mmm what happened well I got another one I'm gonna make two so okay so there's the first one in the lower row okay we set this right over here on the bag okay I let them cool off a little bit so then it can come off easier so the next one is gonna be the pink one so I'm gonna make the pink one and again you can mix the colors you can use any colors you want you you know you don't have to use separate colors that is kind of fun you know you can have two different colors or three different colors you know they don't give you much blues in there that kind of sucks on the Jolly Ranchers you know but I like the blues maybe I should mix in a blue with it ones that look cool sure okay so this one think this Easter maybe I'll make this into an egg so again what we're going to do is going to soak this in here and these are a lot of fun to make I mean they are what your joint huh oh yes my little daughter thing mine is a dark no you can't have candy no you can't sweetie no this is one treat you don't care I know no no no mama plum is cooking okay you just behave and don't jump anymore you're not supposed to know yes it wouldn't be a video of velvet embalming right yes okay so let me get on my towel again you're not going up there no no it's not for you not for you honey okay and as you can see what no you know my little darling okay so this one as I said I'm gonna make an egg shape so we're a circle again again you know what it's much easier to melt um if you're you know if they're like not to see how the chunky that is on a fuse and see that it's like really really like chunky in there so you know it's gonna take a while to melt definitely going to melt this a little bit more and I have my stick ready okay now this okay there we go okay Circle Circle look at that I'm gonna get circ okay now when we do here so open this up real quick at the bottom because it's still warm and gooey stick that stick in the middle and then this is the coolest part so what you're gonna do is make sure okay that when you got the stick in the middle and if you can see that stick right there make sure you kind of tuck it in there and smoosh around it because otherwise what's gonna happen is your sticks gonna fall out and you don't want your stick to fall out I'm just saying okay so this one's nice and pretty look at that okay so I'm gonna let this cool for a minute okay if this one cool for a minute well I definitely take a bite of this one and there's real amazing doesn't look like a heart anymore so sorry about that but oh good so this is how you make prison lollipops I

and crispy drain it and then Pat it dry with some paper towels for a batch of lollipops you probably only need one slice of bacon because we're only using a tiny piece the lollipops themselves are made with one ingredient maple syrup that's a cup and a half of maple syrup in a large saucepan bring the maple syrup to a boil over a medium heat give it a swirl a couple times at the beginning but once it starts to boil you don't have to stir it anymore continue to boil it over medium heat for about fifteen minutes or so until the temperature reaches 300 degrees of Fahrenheit now the best way to measure this is with a candy thermometer and you need to reach what's called the hard crack a candy stage this can be determined by using a glass of cold water I'll put a link in the description box if you want to use that method instead of a candy thermometer continue to cook it it will foam up quite a bit that's why we need the large saucepan keep an eye on it because towards the end when you get to about 275 degree range it will the temperature will shoot up quite suddenly to 300 so keep an eye on it and also if you start to smell burning sugar turn your heat down to medium-low because it does start to get a little bit Brown towards the end at 300 degrees Fahrenheit once it reaches the correct temperature immediately remove it from the heat now you don't have to take it out of the pot I'm pouring in mine into a glass container because it has a little spout that's gonna make it easier to pour but you can also use a spoon to remove it from the pot and put it into your candy molds I let it sit for about 30 seconds just so that foaming action could go down because I don't want too many bubbles in the lollipops and then you're gonna pour it into some candy molds if you have them these I bought online and they are specially designed for high temperature candy making do not use those clear plastic ones that are made for chocolate molding so I put a little bit of the maple syrup a piece of bacon a lollipop stick and then more maple syrup on top until the mold was full and then you let it beat I did spray these molds with just a little bit of cooking spray prior to adding the maple syrup you don't have molds you can do them freeform on a silicon mat or on a piece of greased aluminum foil on a cookie sheet same idea I put a little bit of the maple syrup a little piece of bacon the lollipop stick and in a little bit more maple syrup on top as time goes by it'll see your mixture will start to harden on you if this happens and you can't pour it anymore you can pop that glass container back in the microwave and heat it for about 10-15 seconds until the the maple syrup starts to soften up and gets liquid again and it's pourable once more when you are done let them sit at room temperature until they are nice and hard it takes about 15-20 minutes or so happens pretty fast pop them out of the molds or take them off of the silicone mats and they are ready to eat now as far as all your pots and pans that have all that hard sugar on them just put the whole pan into a sink of hot water or fill it with hot water and within a couple of hours all that sugar will just dissolve all by itself it's quite easy to clean up so I made some with bacon you can see the bacon in the center of the lollipop when you hold it up to the light and I made some without like the one over on the right hand side on your screen these lollipops taste very intensely of maple syrup and it also has a little bit of a caramelized sugar flavor to them they are really really good and very addictive and of course when you get to the center there's a little piece of bacon please see the About section below for some storage instructions thanks for watching what kind of candy do you think I should try next if you have a suggestion please leave it in the comments I've also put all my candy making videos together in a playlist if you want to see those videos go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link in the About section below", "M3d2G8uTMRA": "hi baking buddies I'm Jen Jones welcome back to the channel today I'm going to be showing you how to make two different types of candy apples now the first way I'm going to be showing you is more of a traditional way when we're going to use sugar and we're going to dip them into it but to make it a little bit more interesting we're going to be using tons of color so what I've got here is a beautiful black one I've got a beautiful blue and a nice light purple and in the video I'm gonna be showing you how to make the pink one now you can use any gel paste color to make any color of the rainbow that you want to with this technique now my second technique I'm going to be showing you is how to make Jolly Rancher covered candy apples they're amazing and on top they've got rock candy and they're filled with glitter as well so what I've got here is the purple one the grape flavor I've got the red and it's like the watermelon and the cherry colors you can find and then I'm gonna be showing you the blue raspberry in the video and you can use any of the Jolly Rancher flavors let's get started on this tutorial to make our candy coated apples we're going to be using one cup of water we need half a cup of light corn syrup you can use regular colored corn syrup if you only have that but it does add a little yellow tinge we're going to need nice red juicy apples I like red better just simply for the coating and the coloring now we're also going to be using some rock candy to kind of decorate the Apple and you can also use sprinkles to decorate the Apple if you're going to use a different color of candy coating change up the color of these we're going to need some apple candy sticks and we're going to need three cups of granulated sugar and then for our coloring we're going to be using some white coloring and then like I said pink but it can be any color you want so the first thing we want to do is prep our apples so make sure your Apple is washed and cleaned and completely dry then you're going to take your Apple stick and you're just going to insert it right where the stem is right directly down into the Apple just like that so you want to repeat that for all of your apples so I have sugar placed in a pan here and I'm going to turn my element up to medium-high I want it to be quite warm and I'm going to put the water into the pot as well and into there and then also the corn syrup and then I'm going to let it heat up until it is around 300 degrees or about between 250 and 300 Fahrenheit once your sugar mixture has come to temperature what we're going to do is squeeze in some of that white coloring sometimes it does kind of like bubble up so just be careful and we're just going to stir it gently there's the bubbling happening and so you want to be careful you don't want to over stir because you want to do your best that you can in order to try to avoid as many bubbles as you can there will be bubbles at least I found it extremely difficult to get rid of them all so once you've got that white color mixed in and I'm wanting to work fairly quickly here I don't want to waste I don't want the temperature of the candy to cool very much so it's bubbling again if you want a flavour add it in at this point that you could do that any candy oil or like a traditional flavour would be cinnamon that sort of thing so I'm just mixing in the pink coloring in here so again it's just a beautiful nice bright pink we've got going on here stirring that in so the temperature of the candy is dropping as soon as you take it from the heat it does start to drop i heated it to 250 Fahrenheit and that's gonna give a tiny bit of a more chewy rather than like one of those crack your teeth hard ones so once I've got it mixed in I'm just going to take my pot and I'm going to turn it on an angle like that and then with my Apple I'm gonna place my apple inside and I'm just going to roll it inside the candy and I'm just going to coat the Apple completely then you see I've got a piece of silicone mat here down and I'm just going to take it off let it drip off a little bit and then place it on to the silicone mat to cool and harden completely once your apples have cooled completely and the candy is hardened you'll know that there because you'll be able to lift them up off your parchment or your silicon mat without them sticking that's kind of the indicator so now I'm just going to take some piping gel if you don't have piping gel you could also use corn syrup for this and you had corn syrup in the recipe so you might have that on hand so I'm just painting over the stem here I did fine or around the stem I did find that if the candy completely filled in the hole and touched the stem I found that the it kind of started to bubble from there so I would try to leave a little bit of space around the stem if you can sometimes you kind of control it that candy is doing and it's so hot that you have to be super careful and work fast too so I'm just getting these little sprinkles added on here and then I'm going to repeat the exact same thing for the rock candy around this one and just take that piping gel again or you can take the e corn syrup it's nice and sticky the corn syrup is a little bit runny ER so it doesn't work so well with with rock candy but it does work fine with the little sprinkles and again just pile on some rock candy in here to make the Jolly Rancher candy apples we're going to be using Jolly Ranchers you want them separated by color here I have 50 blue raspberry ones pulled out you can use about 50 of them gives about three apples in total that will it will coat about three apples so we're also going to be using some rock candy or you could use sprinkles or more edible glitter and we're going to be putting edible glitter in the side of the Jolly Rancher mixture as well I've got a recipe for the edible glitter in the description box for you we're going to be using apple sticks and then of course we need some apples so I have my 50 Jolly Ranchers unwrapped and placed into a cake pan you can also use whatever kind of like ovenproof Bowl that it will be safe to put the Jolly Ranchers into I'm going to put them into a 350 degree preheated oven for 15 minutes while the candy is melting in the oven you can prep your apples wash and clean them and remove as much of the stem as you can and then insert the Apple stick into the top right straight down after about 15 min you can take the can out of the oven and then you want to sprinkle the glitter on top doesn't matter what order you do it and I just went with glitter that's of a similar like shade to this one and then obviously minus the gold and the silver and then with a oven mitt on I'm going to stir that in and once I've got it stirred in and incorporated I'm going to pop it back into the oven for about five more minutes once you've resaw Fionn door real iqua fide your candy you can pick it up with a mitt and then I'm just turning it on its side here letting it kind of gather there and then I'm going to twirl the Apple into that like that perfect this is a little bit thicker than the other one was with just the regular candy mixture but this comes out really really cool so I'm going to just roll this and then set it on to either parchment paper or a silicon mat and you can let that harden completely once the Jolly Rancher is cooled you can take some piping gel and place the piping gel over top of the edge there and then all over where the Apple is exposed and this is just you're using this for just like a glue instead of it being it's just an edible glue here basically it's gonna help the rock candy stick to it and you can use edible glitter you can use sprinkles you could use whatever sorts of little thing up there you don't have to use anything at all it just kind of seals it up and I think it looks it adds a little nice to be touch to it so there you go baking buddies how to make two different ways to make candy apples now I changed up the sticks a bit just to add like a little bit more excitement because like Jolly Rancher glitter is not enough so over here on my black one what I did was i just used a straw paper straw and i put it over top of the apple stick and it worked perfectly and it goes so well with the black and then the blue one here i've just got the regular ones so you guys can see the contrast and then here I went to my mother-in-law's apple tree and I cut some of the branches and I've used those as the stick for these apples so it's totally up to you definitely not something you have to do but it kind of makes it a cooler presentation let me know in the comments which type of the candy apple you think you would like the best and I will see you guys all again next time bye", "y1yoxvTyn6c": "hey guys welcome to gingham and grit also part of twisted grapevines i'm kim beckmeyer and it's friday night in august in texas here i'm gonna go ahead just hit the glue gun and i'm gonna go ahead and make sure i'm sharing the right link with my other social media so hang on just a second i think i did it right it's been a while since i've done youtube live so usually i'm uploading to youtube so i just wanted to make sure i was doing it right um it has been a long long long week so we just started back at school and we just heard that from our school board this week that they've extended virtual learning for another two weeks so we're going to the 21st of september which is a good thing but um high school and virtual learning is it's a challenge it's a challenge for everybody it's a challenge for parents it's challenge for kids challenge the teachers so we all just have to give a lot of grace but i tell you i'm wiped out today um so what i have been promising to do i did a youtube video on the lollipops and the yarn balls using the chenille yarn so we've done these and then i started looking and i started seeing these other sweets and lollipops and candies out there the fakes and i've been really impressed by them all and haven't had a whole lot of time to get to delve and because some of that stuff out there i think is truly artwork some of the donut i saw someone had made some fake donuts today and i've seen the sundaes and other things in just quite beautiful pieces and um i'm not anywhere near there yet but i did watch probably about six or seven videos and i've kind of adapted my own own way of doing these so um laura with um she did a video and she used uh actually i did this candy based on her method she cut single strips three-fourths or i think hers were an inch i did mine three-quarters of an inch so i cut two colors strips three-quarter inch and just rolled them and you get this kind of and then i did the ends and i'll show you how to do the ends and you get this kind and i brushed it a little bit with some glitter i don't think i decoupaged this one i was just kind of playing with it but i really like the tight swirl of the two colors now mind you one side of it's really pretty the other side has a little bit it's not quite so flat and perfect and that's just because how you cut and that's okay and this was my very first attempt there's a little bit of glue on here plus it fell on the floor so it picks up a lot of the dirt off the floor unfortunately sorry that's kind of embarrassing but um so there's that right there like that so there's the good side and i just put with my pick i just put this and then i mounted this so it'll pop up in a room so that's what i did with that one and then i was watching another one and i started looking at it and i was like gosh there their things are a little bit thicker and so i sat there and i started digging through some of my supplies from last year that i didn't use and pardon me really quick i came up with this one so i found these candies that i had bought at wreath makers live and this pack of six was 12.50 and i think now after i figured out how to make these i think this is a really good price because let me pop this up but i'm going to show you unless this is craft foam that is striped i think they made it this way and i have to actually feel it i haven't i can't tell i think it might be yeah maybe it is that way i can't tell i can't tell if this was glued like they just cut half inch strips this way and glued them all together and then cut their strips the other way to get these stripes but if they did all that work then heck yeah this is worth 12.50 for six of them because oh my gosh that would be a ton of work so i don't know if they did that now if you look at this piece right here there's a curled edge on this side a rolled edge and a rolled edge on this side so i was watching i think it was scott waterman who did it and they cut their piece say like this and they folded both ends to the middle so i guess they cut this one wider and they rolled this up no i think they did about one and a half so they glued these down i think he might have used double-sided tape and i even bought some double-sided tape but this stuff didn't want to stay down mine didn't this was stronger and maybe if i was using the glitter stuff the glitter stuff is thinner and maybe that might have worked i'll have to try that i just got the glitter and i didn't realize it was thinner but it's thinner but so this was they folded inside like this to create a folded edge here and a folded edge here and then they would roll it up this way which is what i think this one did so you would have a rolled edge on both sides so if you were putting it in say for instance a centerpiece or something like that where both sides were visible i would understand the need for the double edge however if it's going on a wreath i made an adaption so i just took mine and instead of folding both sides in i just folded them in half so i cut these one and a half inch wide and then i just folded in half and so i have a rough edge here and the folded edge here which i really like this method and so if you look at this side i didn't treat this side actually use a cable mount tie to tie this onto your wreath we put this in our witches wreath um you'll see this side it's kind of a little and even a little rough this is the non-rolled side and then this side has the folded edge on it and then i dusted it with um the shiny the gloss modge podge and then i used the um extra fine iridescent glitter on top of it so be careful you don't og don't over glitter because i did that on one of them and it it doesn't change the color but it alternated it it went as vibrant as i wanted it to be it didn't pop like i thought and also i'm thinking i want to make these a little bit bigger too i want to make them these were two by two squares and i think i'm going to do three by two tonight we'll play and see because i like them if you'll see right here they're a bit fatter i like the fatter ones on those so it's a learning process it's me deconstructing and trying to figure out how to do all these and like i said i came up this is my way of doing it i just fold it in half but this side will never be seen because it's going on a wreath so my stuff is usually going on a wreath and so therefore i can you know shortchange a little bit and make it go a little bit faster because as laurie jacob says time is money and so we want to be careful and mindful of all that so as i was saying i cut these at an inch and a half wide and so i bought these right here from hobby lobby and i think they're what are these i think they're 18 by 12 maybe yeah these are 12 by 18 pieces of foam and you get them in all sorts of colors they're 99 cents you can buy them in packs um so just however you want to do it and then originally i didn't buy the sparkle because i was thinking i was gonna just single cut them and i was like well if i'm rolling them this way there's no sparkle on the edge so why would these are extra 50 cents why would i spend the extra money if you're not going to see the sparkle but if i'm folding them in half like i did right here you see the sparkle so um i went ahead and bought some the other day the only thing is is i wanted this green color and i haven't found the green and the sparkle yet that's what i really wanted because i wanted to do these three for this um gingerbread thing we have i wanted to do those three i still may do it and use this one and just you know do the decoupage the mod podge on it but um but there's a lot of pretty colors like i thought this would be this emerald's really big this year for christmas it was a really pretty involved like look at this red this is just really cute look at that red and green beautiful you could do a lot of fun candies with that you can even pick a white with it too you could do a three that's her um my business partner rivet um other part of twisted grapevines she i was going okay so do you want me to do you know green and orange orange and purple purple green she's like yes i was like okay look at all three so we did all three on this one and i think it came out really really cute all right so here's this guy right here okay and so um that's what we're gonna do so i'm gonna pan down i did just get um a new thing uh i or a new cordless um glue gun or ryobi for my birthday this week and if any of you guys i haven't even looked at my my facebook or anything all week i kid you not it has been so crazy at work this week with this virtual school stuff that i haven't even like to see anything but anyways my sweet husband got me a cordless uh ryobi glue gun and he got me two battery packs for it rechargeable battery packs but he forgot to get the charger so the charger is on its way and so anyways i'm still using this one and every time i feel the the cord on this i go oh i'm getting ready to get rid of that i'm so excited so anyways i'm gonna pan down and show you how i cut these and then how we build these so here we go so you can make all your own sweets for this holiday season all right so if you don't um can't see or you need a better explanation let me know so and i apologize my work area is a hot mess um so i'm gonna put this i'm gonna just line up this in and this in here and then see that and it's not gonna be perfect i tried to get these perfect and i was using a ruler and everything and it just doesn't go perfect put my phone over here all right so i got this really nice metal ruler i was wanting the quilter's ruler that was 18 inches can i want to so i probably need to order one i just didn't have time so i'm going to measure up from my baseline one and a half inch i'm going to put this side here and i'm going to do it on this side here all right and then i'm going to use my rotary cutter and then just glide it right along and i'm pressing down i tried cutting two at once and i really need to replace my rotary and blade and so two just wasn't cutting it now yeah the one cutting up that so i need to do i need to get new blades in here i hate putting new blades in though because i always cut myself when i put new ones in because it's so sharp and i've been dealing with the dull one for so long all right so i'm going to go up another one and a half inch so when i fold one and a half inches it'll give me three quarter inches all right oops but of course it doesn't get as clean okay so there we go all right so then what you once you get these cut one and a half inches you want to take your edges right here and we're gonna use glue or hot glue and we're just gonna run a thin bead i love this kind of glue gun because it's got that really thin point right there and then we're just gonna match them up and just hold it for a second the foam um it dries pretty quick so you don't have a whole lot of time to play with it and i kind of hold it there for just a little bit and i've got pretty calf's fingers and i just kind of pull the excess glue off okay and i've already glued these two together so i'm gonna do four pieces together because i made this one and just a smaller one it was three colors and i used four pieces all together and i got two two candies out of it so i had to reverse the colors on them because you'll use more since the purple's the outer color you'll use more of the purple so i reverse it on the other way these matched up pretty good sometimes you glue them together and they don't match up so bright and you're like whoa what happened to that cut job okay so i'm gonna glue and hold these here real quick and those of you who are joining in if you have not subscribed i would really appreciate if you could do that for me that would be awesome let's see here okay so i've got four strips right here and once you get the strips on there that one's looking i'm going to start on the other end just because it's going to be a little bit there all right we're going to run glue and like i said you could fold them if you wanted the the folded edges on both sides you could do it this way you fold this side in and that side in but um that's kind of long so i'm going to run glue right here toward my edge and i'm just folding mine straight in half you don't want to be right on the edge because then the glue is going to seep out and it's okay if it seeps out because it's on the cut edge it doesn't matter but you might burn yourself and that that does matter i'm not a big fan of burning myself even though my fingers are pretty i don't know we all say we don't have fingerprints anymore crafters because we you get the glue guns kind of burning off the hot glue does okay now the craft foam is pretty darn forgiving so if you mess up you can usually pull it apart and fix it so i'm just holding it down just kind of smooth it over and if it pops open just put a little bit more glue right there yeah i was going to wait till tomorrow afternoon and do this live and i was like i'm awake i've been wanting to do this you know how sometimes you just have things that loom over your head and it's like if i don't get this done i'm not going to rest like i said i've been wanting to do this always and they're just buzzing at time and i'm not for sure i think tomorrow night we're going live i'm not for sure it might be today's husband's perfect i don't remember if it is i'll go live um i've got a what i want to do i need to do it i want to do but i've got a real pretty cheetah print [Music] sorry brain just totally locked up there um awareness cancer breast cancer awareness week that i'm going to be so i had cassie who paints a lot of signs for me she painted and i gave her a picture off of the ribbon and i said can you make a sign out of this does that of course because i wanted the colors reversed now and so of course she did it splendidly all right so we're just going along this like i said i did it some where i put the glue out kind of in the middle and that didn't work out super great because it tends to pop open if you put it your glue too close to the middle so you want it a little bit toward the edge but not super close to the edge where it'll spit out if that makes sense because that's you know an official crafting trim spinning out all right yeah we're all starting to get the hang i teach high school math and so we're all starting to get the hang of the virtual classroom it'll be interesting monday nights are open house and we have to do it virtually so we were having to make you know introduction videos we're going to be doing zoom meetings for parents and they get a google doc to sign in on and i'm just like oh my gosh that's just crazy all right and part of my lights just dimmed i just noticed and i taken my other light source afterwards because i had to do my video for the parents but i tell you what is exhausting is looking at like three computer screens and a phone and just constantly all day long of just being bombarded with messages and oh goodness and i know it's got to be just as crazy for the kids having to find where everything is and we're all trying to do things real similar so the kids don't have to look in a million when places but big gracious think it's so confusing i know they gotta be confused their parents are confused it's just it's just hard and you just miss seeing your kids face to face i can't learn their names real well because i can't see them i mean i see you know a tiny screen but not very much of them so it's hard to it's hard to really remember except you know like if they need tutoring and they hang out afterwards with you and then you get to kind of talk a little bit because high school kids are so much fun to talk to and they break down the walls and kind of show who they are okay so i've got i'm gonna do one in the third power that dripped on the thing that drip glued down onto that there you go sorry about that so this part of my hand doesn't is it couched all right so i'm gonna do two different ones i'm gonna do one in threes and then i'm gonna do one in the glitters i haven't done the glitters before so i'm gonna do this way um so i've got the purple folded i've got the orange and i've got the green now when you start these so you want to make sure all the folded edges are on the same thing and i'm going to start with one first and i'm going to put just a little bit of glue right here in the center like that and i'm going to just tuck it over super tight and i'm going to hold it cinches there getting the very beginning super tight because you don't want to have gaps in it uh that's probably this is the hardest part is getting it tight and it's really kind of tricky with the three i didn't have so much problem with this one as i did with the other one like this okay so i get that one in and now i'm gonna come in and i'm gonna butt the i'm gonna bet the orange right up next to that curved end right there and if you want to put a little drop of glue to kind of help it hold it in place make sure you just put it in the middle because you don't want it spitting out i hope i didn't get too much right here yeah i'm good all right so see how i kind of just put that right there i'm gonna hold that and let it go down pretty tight okay and then i'm going to take my green and i'm going to stack my green in here too i'm going to just pull it yeah i'm going to just move it down about it looks like a quarter to an eighth inch right behind it so i'm gonna put a little drop of glue right there to kind of give me a little bit maneuverability i'm gonna hold it and see if you can see right there a little bit better so i'm gonna hold it right there as well see if i can pull this down just a little more nastier work area sorry guys okay so let's see start rolling like i said you want to keep it tight here at the beginning you're going to keep it tight for the whole thing okay i've got a little gap right there so i'm gonna go backwards a little bit and i'm gonna try and kick that a little bit tighter like i said this is the hardest part right here all right so i'm gonna actually put it down here on the table so i can have my rough edges are up so the fold side is down so it's all even down on that side because this is the back okay so see what i have right there whoops can you see all right so real tight so it actually works better to start on the bottom of the table i mean turning it upside down so i am just carrying this out here and we're just spinning it around and you're keeping it super tight you're holding it down on your flat table and like i said you'll feel your uneven cuts back here that it's being flat on the front and like i said i put mine on wreaths some people put these in plastic so i don't think the back would show either if you're feeling more sorry there's more of those if you're putting it in plastic you know like a plastic bag a decorative type thing and then tie me that i don't think that would be bad either if you have the the rough back it just seems like it would take a lot of time to to glue two sides down because you saw i mean that wasn't like super long to do that one color but it could it could start making it okay so we're just spinning eat some good music okay so that looks like a good size i mean you can make it bigger if you want to i mean just wherever you're putting i mean it's going to make a statement wherever you do it so just kind of you know wherever you want to finish it i'm going gonna go i'm gonna i'm gonna stop right here so i'm gonna you're gonna cut it in stages so i'm gonna cut the green one the one closest on the inside first and then i'm gonna put a tiny drop of glue right there in the middle okay and just kind of like we staggered it in the beginning we're gonna stagger it here as well so and if you keep this really tight you don't need to put glue anywhere in the middle as you roll all right so i'm going to cut this about it looks like oh let's say about a quarter of an inch longer than the green and i'm gonna put a tiny bit of drop of glue right there as well in the middle and we're gonna push down and hold it for a second and then i'm going to come with the purple the final color right and i'm going to make it just a little bit longer than the orange like i said we're staggering all of these about a quarter of an inch oops i didn't stagger that one very much probably should have done that one a little bit more it should have been a little bit longer oh well we're gonna put the candy tie right there anyways so it's not gonna i usually like to pull it a little bit longer so that way it's not quite so breast of a end right there i like it to taper a little bit more but that was me sorry a big old finger was in the way all right so that's what the three does so that's what you get it looks really pretty all right i'm gonna hold that just a little bit longer i'm gonna kind of mash it here in the middle make sure it's all flush to the front okay so once you're here you have a choice you have a choice of whether you want to make a lollipop or whether you want to make a candy so if you want to make a lollipop i use um i use my ice pick right here and right here where this piece is i would insert you know drill a hole right here and then i would use these guys right here you get these um i found these at walmart bamboo skewers in the um what is it the kitchen utensil area and right where you drilled that hole i would take the pointy end and put a drop of glue on it and insert it in there okay so that's how i would make a lollipop um and then i bought i think it was cindy who taught me this trick let me grab this really quick i found these on amazon because i was making a lot a bunch of lollipops for one of our reef kits and i got tired of wrapping ribbon and she's like look you know you can buy straws so i got this box 200 straws from amazon and it's got eight colors in it so you know you pick your color and i just put a drop of glue at the top and i just and i put it up to where it meets and then i cut the bottom and then i just put glue right there and look how cute that is i mean like if you have that inserted right like that that would be so cute and you don't have to wrap a shortcut so really like that trick so i've been using that trick a whole lot i like that one okay so i'm gonna do the candies on this one so i'm gonna use a piece of craft foam and like i said when i did this one right here and all the videos i watched they made these two by two squares but i like i think i want this a little bit wider so i think i'm gonna try a three by two tonight and i'm gonna get pinking shears as well so you know the ones that cut the zigzag all right then i'm gonna cut three of my four sides using those so let's see here we're gonna do all right i'm just using my scissors so one two three and then we want to do two i was like what is that and it's the tag that's weird feeling okay so on these right here i'm gonna go ahead and cut i'm gonna leave one edge long because that's going to be where we fit in i'm going to go ahead and paint the others so whatever color is on the outside that's the color on the little wrapper all right so we're going to fold this guy in half so fold it in half and i'm going to put just a little drop of glue right there at the end you don't want to carry your glue too far out because then it's going to be real long and skinny and i like them short and fat like see this one i made it too long i took my glue too far out i like them where they're just short okay and then i'm going to put a drop right here on the back and then we're going to follow this piece down we're going to do the same thing on the other side oops stay and put a drop right there we're gonna fold this piece back so you're gonna fold it in half and then fold it each side in half again so it's really in force all right ooh i like that a lot better yeah i like it wider so you can either put your curl this way or you can put your curl that way it just depends on which look you want um i kind of like it with the ridges up so i'm going to take this one i'm going to put glue on this end right here and where that was you know that sharp end right there i'm gonna put it right there a little hot not too bad but a little bit i use um multi-temp so i try to use the the cooler not the super super hot glue i accidentally i ran out of glue and i had pulled from an old bag and it was hot high temp glue and this is a multi-temp and you know i just assumed it was still oh good gracious it took forever i had a burn right there it took forever for that thing to heal that was not fun okay so that's what we have right here so let's do one more of these so i'm gonna once again i'm gonna pink the one one long edge and the two short edges and if you want these you know shorter you can always trim them i've trimmed some before so we're gonna put a little bit of glue right there in the middle i'm gonna need some more glue that's the thing i gotta get for my new glue gun too i gotta get some glue because this is these use those little mini sticks and my new one uses the big ones so hopefully i won't have to be refinishing blue quite so much so where always herpes is always like okay some more glue yeah oh shoot i stuck my finger right in there i tried wearing those little finger fingertip cards and it just doesn't work for me i've got to feel it which means you can feel all of it unfortunately all right so i'm pinching this and holding it or as rhonda says pin to it okay and i'm gonna put some glue right here and then i'm gonna go straight across this one and hold it in place make sure that they're both going the same direction both of these have the crimped edges going up like i said you could have made them go the other way it's just personal choice so there we go there's our little our candy for tonight that's using three and like i said if you're putting this on a wreath so here's what the back looks like so see i don't think that would be bad if you packaged it in plastic like right here so like say i had a clear plastic bag say this was a lollipop or something and you were to put it in the bag you know and tie it at the string like i don't think that would show like here's this side with the thing i don't think that would show it's so much faster to do to do just the one fold and the two so i mean it's just kind of like i said personal choice all right okay so i'm going to do and i tell you what to if you if your um craft tabletop is as dirty as mine gets it will pick up every piece of bread in your your table so um the pick the ice picks really good for picking out the stuff so let's go ahead while this is here and let's go ahead and um let's decorate it for modules so i don't like to use my super good brushes with mod podge because modge podge is like a glue so in case i forget to go wash it right away or if it gets crusty you know these little cheap ones you can get these at the dollar tree now which is really nice all right okay so i'm just gonna like well there you go we might need to put a little glue on this one to hold this guy on there i haven't had that happen before it's alive so it's going to happen right it seems to thank you all right so we're just gonna i'm gonna actually do my sides so i'm gonna go here on my sides you know get ready because you're gonna get it on youtube so it just and i try to go in here and if i have any of the the crevices or whatnot i try to fill them up it just adds a little bit reinforcement so it doesn't come undone and go in here and do this as well like i said can you really over glitter i don't know and you can glitter the back you want to if it's going to show on both sides this is only going to show on the front so i'm going to probably not do the back just because i don't have to put this glue on the back except we require you doing two different things all right so we're just going to cover this in mod podge like i said i got the shiny and i didn't even know they made shiny i think it was lara who mentioned the shiny lara jean and i was like oh didn't even know they knew china we're just used to the mod podge from the 70s where we would cut up calico strips and put them on plaster do i remember some of those who are all i'm old um old as me and we used to oh that was a craft we used to do with our moms all the time and it was um you cut old calico scraps and i remember we had this dog and uh you cut them up and you use pinking shears to cut them and then you would decoupage them on there or mod podge i think i got one of those in a white elephant gift one year for christmas when i was older when sam my husband and i went to a white elephant christmas party and here i am now you know playing with decapod or mod podge i always call it decoupage it's hard to call it mod podge all right so i'm gonna put this aside so i kind of did it lightly i didn't do it real you know real thick i don't want glitter snowballs okay so i'm gonna take this and i'm gonna just dust it like i said i have this real fine um it's real fine glitter dust i have this iridescent dust and the fine i have it in a not fine the not fine ones i use on what do i use on the chenille lollipops get the edges here you know just put on something that you can collect the glitter because i do reuse but falls off i'll get crafters reuse so here we go so it looks really light right now but when you um when it dries this is going to dry the mod podge dries clear and the sparkle shows so i'll show that right here so that's what we have so far okay so this is what it looks like when it dries so it goes from this too so the colors become really vibrant when it dries i really like that about the and that's that's because of the shiny that and the iridescent makes it pop a little bit too okay i feel like i'm in class and i say all right are there any questions that's what i've been doing all week okay does anyone have any questions before i move on all right so i'm going to go ahead and collect some of my glitter right here i want to do one more with the already glitter material because i haven't used that yet so that'll be this will be made in voyage with that stuff okay so let's see here and i was going to tell you too with these leftover pieces right here i think the green one fell down over here this one so now the green is the longest you can repeat the procedure fitting the green on the outside going this way and you'll finish with the green on the outside and you can get a whole other lolli i mean candy out of this one so oh hi angie oh thank you so much i have made and i actually did a tutorial with the yarn as well so like i did the balls and like here the lollipops so i did those too and um i i was watching something and i was like okay those are different and i was looking at them really close and so i go what are those made out of and i sat there and i looked and i go i think they're made out of foam and so i um i ended up watching like six or seven videos and i kind of came up with my own little method of how to do this so that this one right here was done on a single cut so this is three quarter cut three-quarter inches two colors and just rolled tight this was cut on an inch and a half but it's folded so this inch or this edge right here is um a folded edge and then the back side is a cut edge so because i use all of mine in wreaths i just use a cable mount on the back and do it like that if you want a lollipop you know of course don't put these ends on and you know put the stem right there but i use the shiny mod podge to give it that that really bright it really makes it pop and then use that iridescent fine glitter so that's what i do on those now this one right here i didn't make this one i actually bought this one this one the fold is on front and back so you could use this on something that you were going to see you know 360 all the way around like a centerpiece or something and so on that one i watched someone do a video and i'm looking for a strip of folded online but what they did on theirs was you would fold it in on this side and then you would fold it you know in on this side and then you would roll it that way so that's kind of what that one how that one was done right there they folded like that which to me is a lot of folding and a lot of glue and a lot of potential to burn myself um i saw one where they they put double-sided tape in the middle and then they folded it there but i couldn't get this stuff to hold it was i tried but i went having a lot of success with it so anyways i i just like the single fold because the rough side i won't it won't show on what i use it for and then you know and i do i did three colors and i'm getting ready to do one with two so this i haven't used before this is new so i cut i think three strips on this one the long strips and this already had the glitter on it i really wanted to do these three colors for something a project i'm working on but this one i haven't found yet in the glitter so i've got to check one more spot that may have it so i'm gonna just do these two tonight so let's see if we can get these going all right so when you start these you want to stagger them so you want one a little bit longer than the other all right and then you're going to start rolling and you want it super duper tight so i'm going to put it down here on my table because i may have not cut them super great so i want the part that's facing down on the table to be all the same length so if there's any parts like my glue for my fingers is coming off so if any parts are uneven they'll show up on the back not on the front we've got a new kit coming out soon we just got the gingerbread we have painted for us and it's in pink red white and the green and so that's why i was wanting to put the different colors i was thinking of putting the red with this too but i don't like the red with the white and the pink maybe the oh i bet the red and the pink yeah okay that's what i'm gonna do next so this one i don't think i'm gonna make it on this one i think i'll make a lollipop on this one i don't know let me do it so when you curl it you just want to make sure it's super tight as you curl it and um so you don't have holes in there and like i said we're keeping i can see i see my little bumps all back here okay so i think i only cut two strips of or three i think i cut three strips of the white i don't know why i didn't cut four probably i got distracted because that's where my head is today after a long week at work okay all right so that's how far we got like i said it picks up a lot of stuff off your table so i'm going to flip it over ooh that looks cool i like that look how pretty that looks right there that came out cute and it's already glittered so i don't have to glitter it okay so i'm gonna my white one ended right here so i'm gonna cut this about half an inch longer i may not need it a full half inch it may go more like three eighths and i'm going to put a little drop in the middle of glue you don't want to put too much because you don't want it to seep out both sides like that right there might okay and then we're just gonna hold it now so angie when you made your yarn and lollipops did you use the big yarn or did you use just the regular yarns or did you use that big chunky yarn i've done them both where's one right here i did um like i did this one for halloween these are in the little the little yarns i like the big and like here's the ball in the little yarns i got there's that double-sided tape so i did those and then i love mixing the the jude with it that'll really like doing because i've got a real retro halloween wreath that has a lot of the muted colors that i was going to put these two guys in but i like but i really do love the chunky the chunky's just just so bubbly okay look i have blue from that i think that's the mod podge all right so there's that guy right there so i'm gonna take this my i'm gonna just go in right there so i'm just jabbing it in and then i'm gonna take one of my um bamboo skewers from walmart the kitchen section and i'm gonna put hot glue on it and i'm gonna just kind of twist it in there we're going to let that dry and then i was telling them that i bought sam's club this box of 200 and it has eight colors in it let's see if my pink smells like they match okay so so then i'm gonna take this guy right here i'm gonna put a drop well let me put it on here first all right and i'm gonna put a little bit of glue here at the top of it and then smash it all these great verbs to not smash jab sounds so violent and then i put a drop of glue down here too if i need this to um mount in a wreath i keep it on there but more than likely i'm cutting it off but it's there all right so i'm going to go ahead and put the glue and if you wanted to you could put a real pretty bow right there as well where the straw meets the edge that's so cute oh my gosh and i got the cutest ribbon i'm gonna get that from i got a trendy treat but it's white with crimped um pink it's cut with the pink shears oh it's so super sweet but is it white it might be cream it may not work maybe you may just have to get a pink oh darn i've got to go look for ribbon you know i hate that so anyway so there's that one so this is done with the fold both of these were done with the fold that i made tonight and um that's just something i kind of created from watching all the videos i watched but you can make them also like i said in this singular these are pretty too but you could do them with the candy i like it with the wider so i do i do like we did these three by two so i like the wider cut and then this is with the the lollipop all right so that's what i got for you guys tonight i'm going to do another one tomorrow so let me lift up real quick so nice so there we go i guess i can squat all right so tomorrow i'm going to do one during the day i've had a lot of people ask how i make my pumpkins so i'm going to do tutorial i have i did a pumpkin and i love mustard so and this has kind of it's almost like a sear sucker because it's got the puckers on it so i'll make one of these i've got an order for some cheetah so i will make a cheetah one i'll make a couple different sizes and use some different types of fabric so you can see how they work and then i use real dried pumpkin stems that i got on ebay so i will do that tutorial tomorrow and i think tomorrow night we are doing a breast cancer awareness wreath so that when i think summer facebook live but i'm gonna do another youtube with the pumpkins so anyways lots of fun of the i've been having a lot of fun making all these um attachments for wreaths so i think they're just so fun and plus it you can do them really quick and it's like you've got something you've accomplished whereas a wreath sometimes takes a while to do so it's kind of fun to have something all finished so anyways oh you use chunky yarn too yeah i love the chunky yarn i think it's really cute and it's hard to find right now so i ran out of um wife the other day and oh my gosh i had to go to so many stores to find white it just nobody had white everybody's using it so um i really like the chunky one i think it's plus it goes so fast because when you do the little yarn oh my goodness it takes a long time but the big one you're done you have to make that sound too when you do it um so hope you can come join us tomorrow and like i said i'll do it on youtube the pumpkins and then tomorrow night we'll be doing breast cancer witness so hope to see you then y'all have a great friday night rest after year long week i know i'm going to and it was 107 degrees in texas today in the metroplex dallas fort worth it was so hot so i'm escaping to the roof room and just it takes it out of here so hope y'all have a great weekend and pop by and say hi and i'll see you later all right good night you", "tp3pKeXOkZg": "today I'm going to show you how to make lollipops but not just any [ __ ] lollipops these ones have got vodka written and if you have enough of them it's going to be a good [ __ ] night but before we begin I just want to say a huge thank you to everyone I'm ready who shared my video I've got the word out there that means a hell of a lot to me so thank you very much anyway vodka lollipops first of all you're gonna need some vodka about quarter of a pint and a tablespoon of powdered food coats followed by 450 grams of sugar add the vodka to a measuring jug with a little bit of water and then put a pan on a low heat and add the sugar a glucose and lastly the vodka next year stir it until it dissolves and then crank it up to a high heat and put the lid on then just put grease proof paper onto a baking tray and get you all these sticks out after about three minutes just get the mixture and pour it onto the lolly sticks the shape might come out a bit weird if you're not very good at it as you can see like I am but it doesn't matter because you can still eat them anyone after you've done that just let them call until they pardon oh these are delicious I know that the shape came out a bit weird but nonetheless it's a sugary lollipop with [ __ ] vodka in it what gets better than that make sure that you subscribe make sure you tell your friends since that's the only way we can get this [ __ ] show out there and I really appreciate you guys talking about talking about how you're going to do your recipe so leave a comment below I'm off to get drunk on sweet", "T3xgRZfAEak": "how to make sea salt caramel lollipops [Music] hello everyone starting off with a medium-sized saucepan and in the saucepan you'll place one cup of white granulated sugar activat 2 tablespoons or an ounce of water a teaspoon of lemon juice a teaspoon of sea salt and a quarter cup of white or light colored corn syrup the addition of the corn syrup will help keep it from crystallizing too quickly and will make mixture smoother now stir this together over medium-high heat until it starts to boil once this starts the ball you're gonna add in 1/4 cup or four tablespoons of butter a little bit at a time so what I did is I took some cold butter cut it into cubes and then I'm just adding one one or two cubes at a time and stirring until the butter is melted and I continue to add the butter until it was completely combined in there and then you're gonna cook it on medium high boiling it until it reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit which is the hard crack candy stage and be careful when it starts to change color that's when you know you're getting close to the correct temperature and if you start getting some scorching you may have to move it off the heat a little bit but chances are it'll coincide almost exactly when it starts to get the caramel color as the time it'll be at the right temperature once it gets to be the right temperature take it off the heat and stir in a teaspoon of vanilla extract now you're gonna spoon your hot caramel mixture into some candy molds these are special molds just for high temperature candy making do not use those clear plastic ones that use for chocolate molding because they'll just melt they'll lose their shape make sure you get the hard candy ones I actually found mine online so just to Google hard candy mold you probably get quite a few buying options if you can't get them at your local hobby store i greased these molds very lightly with a little bit of cooking spray prior to filling them in I put in the candy sticks and when you're filling the mold make sure that you cover the stick with caramel so that it's nicely put together I did some heart molds I did these happy face molds these ones are probably a little bit too big for caramel cuz the caramel is a little it takes a little long time to eat compared to regular hard candy I get some little round ones which I think are the perfect size for this type of candy let them Harden and then don't pull them up by the sticks flex the mold a little bit and if they should just pop out quite nicely now if you like and I recommend it sprinkle on it's just a little bit more sea salt on top of the lollipops when they're done that salt will stick to them and you will have a really nice treat sweet and salty together is a amazing flavor and these are absolutely delicious they taste a lot like the Werther's original caramel candies if you've ever had those now store these in between layers of plastic wrap and make sure that you lay them flat I found that you stand them up oh after 2 or 3 days especially the large ones like these happy face ones they will start to droop over a little bit because all the caramel is hard it's not super hard and will Bend with gravity over a couple of days but I doubt that these will last this long because they're really good I hope you give them a try now if you don't have a hard candy mold or don't want to buy them or don't have the money to buy them there is another way and I've made lollipops without a mold in the past so here's the video on your screen right now if you want to go take a look this would work with the caramels as well but the finish on your candy may not accept that extra little sprinkle of salt after because of the cornstarch go and check this out if you're interested thanks for watching", "7_McJKG1Zm8": "hey guys today's video is on how to make hard candy I'm I'm going to make lollipops for Christmas and the only need a few ingredients you're gonna need 2 cups of sugar 2/3 cup of corn syrup and 3/4 cup of water you're also going to need some kind of flavour I'm going to do cinnamon and then yours you want food coloring then you're going to need food coloring so let's get started first you're just going to need a pot this is a small batch so here is my pot I want to go ahead and put in my 2 cups of sugar 2/3 of corn syrup you're not going to get all that out so just do the best you can and then I'm gonna go ahead and turn this on medium-high then you're gonna add your water and you want to stir that up I put it on medium-high for a few minutes so this sugar can start to meal you just want to mix that up all we do now is wait just a few minutes and let that melt just a little bit get warm and I'm gonna turn it up to high heat and insert my candy thermometer okay now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and turn it up on high and you're gonna need a candy thermometer and when you put it in the pot you don't want the bottom to touch you just want it down in the sugar mixture and what we want to do you don't want to stir it you want it to get up to at the end it's going to get up to 300 degrees Fahrenheit but at 260 you're gonna add your food coloring if you want to add food coloring I'm going to add some red food coloring since I'm doing cinnamon and want to put in maybe three or four drops of that and you don't stir it up you just let it do its thing it's going to be a rolling ball and I'll show you when we get there okay while we're waiting on the sugar to bowl to get to temp I'm going to put sticks in my lollipop molds and this is the only part that I'll let mommy help me with because this is very dangerous that sugar gets up to 300 degrees and what little bit I got on my hand the other day you know it doesn't feel good so this is the only part that I will let her do because I do not want her to get burnt I don't know how many it's gonna take this candy mold works good except the the cut out part where the stick goes it's just not quite deep enough and whenever I put the sugar in there I have to turn the stick a little bit so it gets coated but that's okay that background noise is not chocolate tempering machines and they are noisy so sorry for the noise the sugar is starting to bowl so we got to wait for this to get up to 260 it's up to 200 right now and that is hot so when it gets to 260 I will put my food cart in and right back okay the mixture is about to 260 and I'm going to go ahead and put some food coloring in here and be careful it will steam do not stir it up it will mix around and then when it's done balling when it has gotten up to 300 you're gonna add the food care line and mix it up so it's gonna stir it up anyway almost 280 right now wrap for 300 just win put in this flavor right up to 295 so I'm gonna get ready and add the food coloring or shake the flavor all right open up my cinnamon hall take out the thermometer and shake it a little bit that's a pretty read or in the OL during it and be careful this is really hot it's pretty now I'm going to turn you around - all right I'm bad - pour too much it's hard to tell too much strong never done cinnamon I've just been doing fruit flavors would see that's what happens I can salvage that one on that before in his notes to me here too much the whole gram in there woof stick I didn't step to hurry times already starting to some of those need some more my toast cool and then I'll show you what they look like that is so strong my eyes are burning [Music] background on man and put it on there and just break it up into pieces [Music] I might pull that into little pieces for Billy but what I do next maybe insane I just have to put water back in the pot to clean it and put it back on stage to bowl get it from the old miser Burton and let it melt roll it that waste not some heart you consider oh and then there's some places that I can't get out hard to pizza water is really hot and let it melt too but this is what I do I might call it in two pieces but really because he said he wanted to summon some wax to make them just to put these it I don't know if they like school night spots Oh I cut it into pieces I'm not gonna do it perfect over there just getting old which is not always a perfect at all it's not for anybody been really hard it's so strong he's very emotional but since it's for really I don't care what it looks like [Music] just don't care my eyes nose still burnin so what I'm gonna do when that calls I'm just gonna wrap it up and wax paper for Billy to put in his pocket this is boring so I want to get that clean they're gonna have to clean the side on the sink so we're still waiting on these to cool they might be a couple here we go simple lollipops these are cinnamon and when you purchase in when you you cinnamon be sure to have a good ventilation I do not have that in here so there you go that's how to make hard candy most of it still shiny and we'll let it cool but I hope you enjoyed this video and got a good laugh of me coughing and hacking I hope you guys have a great day and stay tuned for more candy videos [Music]", "lHmmYIezXvo": "oh hello and welcome back to my channel my YouTube family today I am going to be bringing you the peach Ciroc infused candy popcorn these are the materials that I am going to be using which will be my popcorn my lawn and pan my popcorn bags that I have already place my labels on and our peach Ciroc okay so we are going to get started so make sure you stay tuned okay so we are going to get our mixer started and in my pot here I have four cups of sugar I am going to add 1 cup water 1 cup Cairo and a half a stick of non salted butter and we are going to place our mixture on the stove okay so I have added my one cup Cairo one cup water and my half a stick of butter to my sugar I have mixed it and combined it I have my stove between 6 and 4 so basically on 5 I am going to pop this on the stove and let it start melting down and once you put it on the stove and let it heat do not stir just let it do what it do once it comes to a boil you are going to let your mixture cook for about 5 minutes and we are going to take it off the eye and I will be showing you the next step ok my mixture has started to boil and this is how it's going to look once it starts to boil once it reaches a boiling point you are going to let it boil for 5 minutes and remove it from the stove okay so I have removed my mixture and what is very important is that you do not stir your mix while it is on the stove the colors we are going to use is going to be my creamy peach from Wilton's and we are going to use our white gel food coloring to make the color of the popcorn pop we want a solid color so I am only doing one color so I am going to add my gel food coloring and just make sure you add a generous amount because you want your peach to really show okay we're just going to mix it in so now I am going to add in my peach color and I have a butter knife so I can get out a good amount or you can use whatever you have now we are going to stir and turn it a peach color and make sure you got all your gel food coloring sturdy in it really good so really pretty color okay so I did add a little bit more of gel food coloring because I want my peach color popping okay so I have removed our popcorn that has been sitting in the oven I have my bowl over here I also have a measuring cup and you don't have to pour it in a measuring cup if you don't want to but I'm pouring it in a measuring cup if I need anymore I will use some more so we're going to add some of our popcorn and I add it a little bit at a time because that way I can coat and come back and reco if I need to so all we're doing is stirring in our pot for turning our mixture until everything is fully coated simple and easy I'm going to add a little bit more and I did let my mixture cool just its head so my popcorn he'll be fluffy but don't let it pull too long we're gonna add some more cuz I want him fully cold it okay so what I did here was coat it hats my popcorn I have some left i coated it with just the regular mix that I had that I colored and for the rest of our popcorn we are going to add some more mixture and we are going to add in our sarong okay so I have my mixture here and I have a 1/4 measuring cup I am going to add 1/8 of syrup because I want it boozy okay and what I'm going to do is stir it together I'm just mixing it together okay make sure it mixes well and make sure your other mixture that's sitting to the side has cooled down and we're going to add some more mixture and we are going to coat the rest of our popcorn okay so here is my syrup mixture okay we're going to add it to our popcorn and the key to making sure it's very boozy is to let your mixture cool down a bit and then add in your syrup so we have someone at the bottom that we are going to mix in this out-of-the-way and I want it fully coated so we are going to fully coat our popcorn and if you need a little bit more you can pull in a little bit more mixture okay so I have taken my time and coat it all my popcorn as much as possible I am going to spray my aluminum pan lightly cope and we are going to add our popcorn back into our pan and we're going to pop it in the oven turn it on 250 and let our candy harden and remove it from the stove you okay so while our popcorn is in the oven and gardening I have pineapple that I am going to cut small pieces because we are going to add some of our dry pineapples to some of our popcorn so we are going to have some that are going to be peach and pineapple and the other will be the regular peach Ciroc popcorn okay so I have cut into small pieces we are going to remove our popcorn from the oven and spring with our Ciroc and place it back in the oven okay you guys so there's I always popped my popcorn in the freezer for about five minutes every time I remove it from the stove whether it's regular popcorn or infused popcorn because it helps it set faster so they are ready to bag we are going to bag them up you", "xlpYyBNhl6M": "what's up guys here pumping gas and ready to go through Georgia to the Walmart in Georgia because they have their milks for like

Halloween I have two great treats for your little ghosts and goblins ultimate caramel apples and caramel apple nachos so to start let's make the caramel apples so I have 5 really nice-looking apples here and I'm going to add to the center wooden pop sticks so just remove the stem and insert the Pops stick inside just push it right down now the trick to remember is that you have to really wash your apples really well you want to remove any wax that might be left on the Apple and then you want to make sure that they're really dry because caramel won't stick to a wet apple melting craft caramels is really easy so I'm going to give you a couple of quick tricks first to open a caramels squeeze them pinch them really hard in the center and then the wrapping will open right up the other option you can do is you can put them on a tray pop them in the freezer for about 15 minutes and the wrapping will come off the other one is get your kids to do it so now what you're going to do is take the 1 package and put it into a microwavable bowl and I'm going to add to it 2 tablespoons of water it'll pop this in the microwave and cook it on high power for 3 minutes I'll take it out after one and a half minutes stir it put it back in finish the time and then when I take it back out I'll stir it again to make sure the caramels are completely melted you can also do this on top of the stove in a saucepan over low heat and make sure you continuously stir to make sure the caramels are melting perfectly now for the fun part dipping the apples so I have my melted caramels here my apples I'm going to insert the Apple into the warm caramel moving it around like so making sure that the Apple is evenly covered and then you pull it out doesn't that look great now I take a little a knife or spatula and you just wipe the excess off in the bottom and I'm going to place this on top of a baking sheet that I've lined with wax paper or parchment that I've really well buttered and that's the key you have to remember to butter the wax paper because that will prevent your apples from sticking to the paper as they set now this is a great time to that you can decorate the caramel apples if you wish you can top them with some chopped peanuts or with some baker's semi-sweet or white chocolate melted drizzle the chocolate on or even some crushed Oreos now we're going to make our caramel apple nachos so what I've done ahead of time is melted 18 Kraft caramels in two teaspoons of water and i microwave them on high for one and a half minutes and I took it out every 30 seconds and I stirred the caramels to make sure that they were melting nicely so that's all done I've also sliced two apples and I've arranged them nicely on this plate and just overlapping you can do it in a circle as well if you want so I'm going to top the apples with the melted caramels just drizzle back and forth all over just like you would your regular nachos and then for the topping I'm going to top with one cup jet puff miniature marshmallows and just price them all around - crushed Oreo cookies and a quarter cup chopped dry roasted peanuts and there you have it these caramel apple trees are so easy and they're fun to make at your next Halloween party you're going to be a hit for more great recipes and videos visit us at craft canada.com [Music] you", "IKbCbUcvZxc": "hello and welcome to my cooking show for today I'll be showing you how to make your own homemade Zahle pops these are fun and easy to make and they're really good okay now let's get on to the story all right so the ingredients that you'll need are sugar Cointreau blue Jolly Ranchers red green and purple and also you will need four appliances lollipop sticks and silicone molds the first step you will need to do and to make these is we need to crush up all of your power Jolly Ranchers except for purple this is because you will need those later on for your dark background then you put your different color matches into your molds separately randomize them for different and cool colors then you want to pre-heat your oven to 275 and then you want to put the Jolly Rancher molds in for 15 to 18 minutes and then when you take out let them cool after these have cooled you want to set these aside and go get your sugar and your corn syrup for this next step you will need a bowl to put your mixture in boil your mixture you will need one and a half cups of sugar 3/4 cups of chords are [Music] and 1/2 cup of water and then you will need to mix it around till it's a big mush and it looks sort of a brown color now you want to boiler your mixture until you get to 300 degrees Fahrenheit stir frequently for good texture and smooth surface for your lollipops now with your mixture you pour some and take each of them home that you'll be using so fold them up next crush your grape Jolly Ranchers do you have a a nice big shake now put the pieces of your grape Jolly Rancher into the molds as you had done you earlier make sure it's good and tight Cicotte whole mold filled up after your grape molds are done put your sticks in and then take your previously made candies and push them on top [Music] next

howdini and today we're going to talk about chocolates chocolate and kids first let's talk about chocolates dark chocolates has a lot of good things for your health and lately we talked a lot about 60% 70% 80% what is that percentage basically what that means is how much are our chocolates from the cacao beans is into that chocolate this chocolate is a 60% cocoa contents 60% of that come from a cacao beans the rest is sugar and a little bit of licit in perhaps sometimes some milk also for milk chocolates so now I tempered that chocolate and I'm going to show you how to make lollipops kids can do that with you it's a fun thing I have some mold that came from a company called life of the party you can find that into the internet I put some chocolate bottom into those mold let me show you a more little bit closer here this one so those mold are almost disposable they are not very expensive and what we do we put chocolates in here and the battle in here we don't put any fat or anything into the mold chocolate will crystallize and shrink out of the mode naturally so just keep your mode very clean that's the most important so I put a baton like that the next step is very sample take a piping bag and if you don't want to use a piping bag you can use a spoon take the chocolate with a spoon and drop it into the cavity of the lollipops you go little bit faster with those piping bag put the chocolates into the bag just like that then squeeze the top of the bag and the last thing that you have to do is to put the chocolate into the cavities here remember to put a little bit of chocolates on top of the bottle just like I do remember to temper your chocolates all the time otherwise the chocolates will never come out of the mold then you have to give the lollipops with the mold the next step for that going to be going to tap those molds so take them all on your hands by tapping those mold very slowly like that the top became very smooth okay so now I'm going to put those mold into a rack and then are going to leave them into the refrigerator for about ten minutes so ten minutes pass and the chocolates are ready so the first thing that I want to show you is when you turn the mold you will see here a little place where the chocolate doesn't retract yet you see it's a little bit darker but I know that by pulling the the bateau here they will retract completely you see it opening in front of you here up that's it now the mold is coming out so basically what's going on here is that the chocolate crystallized the chocolate shrink a little bit and how that happen is when you male chocolates the molecular fat will break down and then you have to put them back together now remember that you can do different color you can put white there this is a gift this is a little snowflake so you can do a lot of different things with it then you can put them into a little bag put a little ribbon around it and those are beautiful gift to give to the family to the front of the kids to the school and they are pretty fun and easy to make eat a lot of chocolates is good for you I am Jacques Torres for howdini thank you", "wnHEErptRfc": "when I was a little girl I was\ncompletely obsessed with candy I remember constantly begging my dad for\na dollar so I could get on my bike race as fast as I could to our local\nconvenience store where I would purchase as much candy as I possibly could for\nthat dollar and at that time you really could buy a lot for a dollar so in\nmemory of my younger obsession I figured we would switch up a few things and\nwe would make some liquor lollipops in this video we are going to make some\nmargarita flavor so let's go spice things up so on medium heat I'm going\nto add 3 cups of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and now 3/4 cup of the tequila mix okay so now stir this until the sugar\nkind of dissolves and then to add a little bit of color and a little bit of\nflavor I'm going to add the strawberry syrup and then one more teaspoon and\nthen stir it real quick and as you see it has started to bubble so now that it\nstarted to bubble we will want to stop stirring this and just let it bubble up\nand you'll want to take your candy thermometer and just check the\ntemperature and once it reaches 320 degrees we can add the liquor okay so\nin the meantime while your mixture is reaching a high temperature you want to\nget like a pan and line it with parchment paper or you can get some\nsilicone molds and just spray them with some cooking spray because you are\ngonna have to work really fast and so you want everything prepared and then\nyou want to get some sucker sticks also you can use skewers if you want and just\ncut them down alright that's looking pretty good between 300 to 310 is the\nhard crack stage that's why you want it to reach 320 okay so for the last\ningredient so now that this has reached the hard crack stage now we are going to\nadd some tequila this is just cheap tequila it doesn't have to be anything\nfancy and you'll want to add 1/4 cup of tequila and then I'm just gonna give\nthat one last stir to mix the tequila in and then I'm gonna check the temperature\nreal quick and you want to make sure it reaches 310 again alright guys if you\ncan see it's pretty much there at the 310 mark and just in case you're\nwondering it is kind of a long process it does take a while for it to heat up\nto the hard crack stage and then once you put the alcohol in it takes a\nlittle bit for it to heat back up to the hard crack stage as well but once it\nreaches 310 you can go ahead and just turn your burner off and then this is\nwhen you will want to work really fast so that you get perfect little\nlollipops because it definitely hardens really\nfast so I'm just going to pour mine right into the measuring cup so it'll be\neasy to work with okay so we're going to try really fast to pour it into the mold and then for the parchment paper you can\njust go ahead and just try to make little circles and then I'm just going\nto take some margarita salt and just put it on the top makes it a little pretty\nand really gives it that margarita drink taste and then you can take your sucker\nstick and just put them just kind of twirl it around like this and make sure\nit really gets into your syrup and then I'm just gonna lay my sucker sticks like\nthis because obviously these aren't real sucker candy molds but you can always\nbuy those at the store they actually do sell sucker molds but the whole point is\njust showing you you can really use whatever works for you or if you just\nwant hard candy you don't even have to add the sucker sticks it can just be\nhard candy okay so you can just leave it on the counter for about 10 to 20\nminutes until they hardened or if you want it done faster you can just put it\nin the fridge for about 10 minutes Aiden what are you doing getting a piece\nof candy see my boys have my same addiction of when I was a little girl\nwith loving candy my boys have candy jars alright so I actually put these in the fridge\nfor 20 minutes just so that they'd be nice and hard and if you can see they\nare done cuz you can hear it's nice and hard and then these ones really turned\nout really cute too so a little circle one and a little star and then these ones\nturn into like little cute hard candies so they all turned out really well\nI'll show you again so you can hear it so they did harden nicely and so they are done I hope you guys enjoyed making this\nrecipe so let's give it a try this is my broken one mmm this is really\ngood and if you guys have a favorite candy\nyou can send it to me and my boys and I will open it in an upcoming video where\nwe will try out all your guys's favorite candy and you can find my

literally hundreds of years they're incredibly simple to make but they're actually pretty expensive to buy their shops so why not just make them home they're just as delicious and you can make any flavor color that you like so join me today as make my version of lollipops okay so to start this off I have a pot on the stove on a medium heat so it to the pot I'm going to add two cups of sugar then 2/3 of a cup of glucose or corn syrup know as a hint I've just warmed it up in the microwave it just makes a lot easier to work with and finally a quarter cup of water and I'm also using a candy thermometer now we want to go for the hard crack stage which is about 300 degrees Fahrenheit or about 150 degrees Celsius give or take but if you have one of these candy thermometers they're actually very cheap to buy you can get them online they're only about ten fifteen dollars but when it comes to candy it just makes life so much easier so over the medium heat we're just coming to give this stir just until the sugar is completely dissolved now you can also add some for example coloring if you like then you could also add some flavoring it's completely up to you I'm just keeping this as a basic recipe so I'll leave any coloring or flavoring that you choose to add up to you a lot of people like the plain should be a taste but if you want to add like say peppermint essence or raspberry or it's you know completely up to you and to the colors that you choose so it's gonna start to get to the stage where it's going to bubble now as you can see we've got some sugar crystals just on the inside so which is with a wet brush we're just going to brush them down which is basically dissolving the sugar back into the mix and this will just stop crystals from forming on top of our sugar mixture which basically ruins of the whole thing so just keep on doing this all the way around whenever you see these sugar crystals forming so puffs and keeping an eye on the sugar crystals forming on the outside just keep an eye on the temperature until we get to the hard crack stage which is again 300 degrees Fahrenheit or about a hundred and fifty degrees Celsius now you may be tempted to turn the temperature up to make it rise up faster to get to the right temperature faster but slow and steady is the only way to do it because if you do it too fast you can actually going to burn that sugar and it honestly doesn't take that long at all whatsoever probably about five to ten minutes to get to the right temperature so take your time don't do it too fast and you'll get some lovely candy and also my best advice is apart from the occasional watered down of the sides what have you do don't stir it because I should make things worse you just want it to cook by itself let it do its thing just let it slowly come up to the right temperature so all you have to do is just occasionally Pat down the sides and that's it it's very very simple okay so it's just about to hit the hard crack stage now I've had the tilt the pan just slightly because the thermometer was in 100% under but it's just hitting the hard crack stage right now so take it straight off the heat okay now quickly I've got a bowl here with some ice an ice bath we're just going to place that in there and this will stop the sugar from cooking just don't let it touch the glass sides because if we leave it by itself it's going to continue cooking so we just want that to stop straight away [Music] otherwise it's going to get too much of a caramelized look and it's got a slight caramelized look but that's okay doesn't have to be perfect as long as it's each her when we've done some just poured it into a another pan this is a milk pan but I'm using this because it has this whip on it and this one doesn't so it's going to make a lot easier when we want to make our popsicles now this is a part where we have to work fast so I've got a baking tray here line with non-stick baking paper that I've also breezed with some more oil just to be on the safe side so we're just going to pour in small amounts like so okay that's enough and we're going to add a popsicle stick now these are a new one I found they're like a paper based one so no more plastic and while this too wet just decorate them any way you want that's going to be done now while the mixture is still fluid so just continue on making up all about popsicles so you can find those new paper base ones fantastic for the environment if I just use what you've got and this is what I want to go with a clear one because this way I can add some decorations to it so again you can still use color it's completely up to you and you can use a flavor that hopefully it's a flavor that doesn't have a color to it if it does well that's again that's okay this is so versatile you can do anything that should like with it [Music] okay so that was more than enough to make a few batches now it depends on the size of the lollipops you want to make so I made up another couple of sets of these so we're gonna let these sit here for at least two hours to completely set so they'll be nice and hard they're going to be wondering what am I gonna do with the pot cuz it's obviously gonna have some pretty hard sugar in it by now it's very very simple all you do is just fill it with water leave it for a few hours then simply pour it out because the sugars just going to dissolve into the water and it will disappear like magic so don't worry about any hard scrubbing or scraping just simply fill it with water set forget it come back a few hours later it's gone and now would you look at those delicious candy lollipops that turned out nice and clear and pretty with those extra sprinkles and let's be honest it's a hundred percent sugar so you know it's going to be a hundred percent good so they really have turned out very well they're incredibly delicious and also incredibly simple to make and again who doesn't love lollipops especially when they're nice and colorful and fun with sprinkles you could choose any sprinkles that you like see in Australia we call those hundreds and thousands or you can go for the stars and honestly I never know what these ones are called but they look great they're like little mini pearls and you don't even have to use sprinkles you can use any color that you like any flavor that you like they're incredibly versatile and no matter what flavor you choose they're going to taste simply delicious [Music]", "VvrMMmsAHOw": "hey guy in the back of a magic video this video's a box right

"poall-18jUs": "what's up guys and ghouls welcome to another episode of 31 days of vlogging today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make caramel apple bites as someone who really enjoys caramel apples but like can never bite it properly I just I don't know like it's something about biting into the caramel on the Apple and getting stuck everywhere like it's just not fun so I found this recipe and I thought wow what a great idea to like have caramel apples but like as a bite sized thing without having to do with like the apple core and like getting the caramel all over you so let's make them we're gonna try them out okay guys so all you're going to need for this recipe some sort of fruit core for apples some sort of skewer or stick and caramel bits that you can actually melt right in your microwave so after you've rinsed dried and removed the stickers from your Apple you're going to take your melon baller and we're just gonna go into the Apple and start creating little circles I do recommend going back and forth with it to get more of a round shape I'm noticing that if I only go one direction it does actually break the Apple off into a shape that's not necessarily a circle this play of apples came from three which I feel like it's more than enough to save this Apple for another time so I've taken a tray with wax paper and I'm going to start taking the apples one by one and sticking a long toothpick down inside of them and just laying them flat this is actually a good example of why it's okay to not have an apple that's completely perfectly circular because it gives it a platform on which to sit so all my apples are ready to go so at this point I just need to prepare the caramel so just kidding about the microwaving of the caramel I actually read the back of the bag here and it says to make caramel apples you're gonna add a package with two tablespoons of water to a medium saucepan and basically melt it that way now I'm just going to stir it on low heat I am going to place it in this microwave safe Bowl we're gonna work very quickly and we're just going to dip our apples in it in the caramel until the excess falls off and then place it back down where it originally was sitting I don't know if you can if you can hear like the crazy children screaming that's occurring at the pool I apologize it's so annoying I almost forgot this is an extra step that you can choose to do if you want but I really like caramel apples that have enough on them so I'm gonna take the nuts put on a bag and use something heavy kind of smash the nuts I'm using this thing you can take the crushed nuts put them in a little container I'm also gonna roll it in the nuts YUM so I don't know if you noticed but a lot of the caramel is actually dripping off of the apples so I'm just gonna kind of take my time and let the caramel kind of sit on the Apple before I actually lay it down okay so as you can see most of the caramel is actually like melted off of the apple I did look it up online and apparently this is a common problem it mainly has to do with the fact that the caramel is so hot that if you don't hold it and spin it for long enough it will actually melt off of the apples however I really don't think that it's gonna taste any different at this point I'm gonna put them in the fridge they do have to stay in the fridge for an hour and then I will try to peel them off the wax paper and hopefully they will look okay are you guys so these have been in the fridge for about an hour now as you can see the caramel did melt towards the bottom but I was able to

auntie CooCoo and today I'm sharing with you guys my Christmas in July DIY so the summer is a great time to get some crafting done before the busyness of the holiday set in this year out front I want to do a whole gingerbread candy land theme and summer is also the perfect time to pick up pool noodles so let me show you what you'll need for this project first I picked up two of each color of pool noodles from the Dollar Tree as well as some colored duct tape I also picked up some of this clear wrap now out of this one roll you can wrap 2 of our giant lollipops then you'll need a plunger yes a toilet plunger from the Dollar Tree one for each lollipop and I just pulled out some white paint I had on hand to go ahead and paint it to look like a candy stick you'll also need lots of hot glue I also figured out rubber bands came very much in handy for this project let's get started the first thing I did was remove the sticker from my plunger and I left the plunger portion on as it made a handy stand for me to paint it I went ahead and gave each plunger two coats of paint letting them dry thoroughly in between and after and now we'll just set it aside and get started on our pool noodles remove your stickers from both then we're going to glue them end and I used my hot glue for this and once I had held them in place to stick for a few minutes I went ahead and added a layer of duct tape to secure them now let's go ahead and take our duct tape up to the top and get started on striping our candy so just start at the top winding it evenly removing any bumps and then it became quite easy to go ahead and tuck in the top portion doing this on a large flat surface definitely made it more easy I would just pull the tape out and then roll my noodle continuing all the way to the bottom before I snipped off my tape and tucked it in now I found where both the duct tapes met and decided which side was going to be on the outside and which part I was going to hide inside of the Roll I did find out that doing just about two or three passes of hot glue is more than enough it's most important to hold it in place while eight dries so for that we're going to go ahead and pull out those rubber bands I mentioned after you've glued it together and secure it so that it can continue to dry for at least 10 or 15 minutes now it's time to attach our candy stick once your noodle has dried it's time to remove the rubber bands and get started attaching our stick so you can do this with either a razor blade or scissors I just poke my scissors in twice to make an X and then go ahead and start cutting to connect those little triangles and then you can remove them then you're going to want to stick your scissors through to sort of puncture the next two layers and sort of carp it out now it's time for our hot glue I filled it up with quite a bit before 6:00 my stick pushing it down through three layers and letting it dry now we're going to do our clear wrap you may want to have on hand a rubber band or a zip tie before you get started on this just measure out the amount that you like go ahead and cut it and then it's time to wrap it around your lollipop gathering it around the bottom before securing it with either a rubber band or ribbon you could stop here I decided to pull out some white ribbon I had on hand and use it as a bow so I'm using two zip ties removing that rubber band and some ribbon I had on hand just securing the first zip tie and then snipping off the bottom to create the bow turning it over and tightening the second zip tie and again snipping off the bottom and that's all there is to it I just love them and I know if I were to go to a store and try and buy them they would cost me so much more they only cost me 450 apiece I'm really relieved to know that I've already knocked out this DIY and they'll be waiting for me to decorate the front of our home come December I hope you guys enjoyed seeing this Christmas in July DIY

"4GVAGmaSmXs": "okay so today we're going to be making lollipops it's very simple and easy way to make lollipops using things that you can find in the shops and around your home so the basic ingredients are as follows to make this the equipment you're going to need is the first step is to put our sugar and our cream of tarter and our water into a saucepan then we simply heat it up and stir until all the sugar is dissolved now the cream of tartar is an interfering agent that will stop sugar crystals forming and hopefully leave us with a nice clear glossy lollipop at the end okay so our sugars are starting to reach a stage where it's bubbling at this point we want to pop in our sugar thermometer and turn the heat down slightly we don't want our sugar to get really hot and burn the temperature that we're looking for is hard crack and it's approximately 152 degrees Celsius now if you don't have a sugar thermometer just heat it for around 10 minutes and take little spoonfuls out as you go along and drop it into ice cold water what you're looking for is the sugar to set very hard very quickly and then be snappa ball and that's when you've reached the correct temperature odd crack what I'm going to do is take a spoonful of the mixture out and drop it into cold water now the way that it behaves once it hits the water will tell you what stage you're at if you don't have a sugar thermometer okay so just going to take a teaspoon out and drop it into the water at the moment we're not even at softball stage so it just forms a blob at the bottom and if we then stir it you can see take some of that out it's kind of just a gloopy soft sugar syrup okay so it's now reached the temperature that we're looking for and I'm going to demonstrate that by taking a spoonful and just dropping it into this cold water okay so we're just going to pop that straight into cold water and what we're looking for is for it to set hard and basically crack and it's setting in the water and when we take it out it should crack so I'm gonna take some this out it's set nice and firm you can see there and if you try and break it you'll find that it just breaks down to lots of little pieces so I'm going to pop in my yellow food coloring now a couple of drops should be more than enough try not to stir it too much at this stage because it can cause the sugar to crystallize and set very hard very quickly and then you're not going to be able to make your lollies so we're just going to get some oil onto our piece of freeze proof paper just to make sure that our lollies don't stick so we're now at the consistency we're looking for it's runny but it hopefully will hold a bit of shape when we put it straight onto our sheet you get a spoonful of the mixture just going to pop it on to our sheet there making a circle as we go just repeat this mixture should make about twenty dollies now before your mixture sets you want to make sure you take your lollipop stick just press it down as the back your lolly with a little twist and that should make sure it gets completely incorporated into a mixture so I'm popping the stick in pressing it down and just gently twisting it from side to side until the sugar covers the whole stick you can keep your lollies for two to three weeks off the day you've made them and for storing them you can need to put them making sure they're not touching between layers of greaseproof paper and airtight container and that's how to make one pops", "aAmf9iP6uGc": "[Music] what up YouTube you might say I'm back in the building [ __ ] 3 nothing

perfect timing for Easter if you follow me over on Instagram you saw my stories that me and my kiddos were working really hard on coming up with this recipe it took us several different tries to finally nail down a sucker that would pop out of one of these molds and it tasted good when it gets close to holidays I like to think of things that I can kind of recreate so they can stick to a more clean eating healthy lifestyle even during the holiday time but I don't like them to not be able to have all the fun things that kids have and so I know in a few weeks when it's Easter time there's gonna be a lot of candy and suckers and things like that and so I thought I would try to come up with a recipe where they can still indulge in suckers but not get all those food dyes and refined sugars to make this sucker we are going to be using coconut sugar and honey as our sweetener so because it's still going to be really sugary it's not something that you want to give your kiddos all the time but more for a special treat but at least it isn't refined sugar and it's a much healthier option than giving them store-bought suckers so to get started we are going to turn this on about medium heat and then we are going to bring the ingredients that I have here which is coconut sugar honey and apple juice to a hard crack stage which is 300 degrees Fahrenheit so I am going to pour in I have 1/2 a cup of coconut sugar and I talked all about coconut sugar and the different benefits of it over on the blog if you're interested then I'm pouring in 1/4 of a cup honey and then I'm going to use two tablespoons of apple juice now if you don't want to use apple juice you can just use water that will make the suckers turn out just fine I just thought if I added in some apple juice it would add a little bit more flavor okay so I'm going to let this come to a boil now I'm going to stir it a few times and check it with my candy thermometer until it reaches 300 degrees now this part is crucial if you don't stir it often enough or if it goes over that 300 degrees then your sucker will taste burnt and if you don't get up to that 300 degrees it will not solidify and turns hard like a sucker and believe me I know we messed up multiple times so make sure that you have a trusty thermometer and now you keep an eye on this because the temperature that you get it out is definitely crucial but other than that this recipe is foolproof and it's really easy to make while this is warming up I'm going to prepare my sucker molds and by preparing I just mean putting the stick in you don't have to grease it at all or spray with anything once they are hardened the suckers pop out really easily I found these sucker molds on Amazon and they are adorable these are two of the molds that came with it actually has three more designs that it came with and it has little circles with swirls in it and flowers I think there was smiley faces stars and hearts so these are super fun because it makes the suckers and all different types of shapes which the kids love and the other thing I really liked about these molds is that they came with reusable sucker sticks so these are little plastic reusable sucker sticks and they just popped right into the mold and so I'm going to push these in now and then we'll be ready to fill these when our liquid is ready [Music] [Music] after you remove it from the heat and kind of stir it a little bit let the bubbles go down I like to add in some essential oils for flavor so you can do citrus oils are really good we are doing wild orange today you can do lime I have tangerine we've done lemon all of those kind of make a fun lollipop for the kiddos and so I am doing about 15 drops here of wild orange and that just makes it taste super good now we're just going to pour it into our molds and then you're gonna let these sit for about 30 minutes or until they are completely hardened and then you can pop them out and let the kiddos enjoy them [Music] [Music] last week I shared a recipe for some healthy Easter jello so if you guys missed that video I will link that down in the description below and if this is your very

after eating some lollipops yeah these weren't any old lollipops though police say they were laced with marijuana and now that girl's mother is demanding answers news 8's Bob Wilson live for us in Hartford tonight with more Bob you know her mother is a drug and alcohol addiction counselor and so she knows what she's talking about she says you know it's a lollipop you've heard of pot laced brownies or cupcakes but lollipops she says she wants to get the word out there about what happened to her daughter they're very dangerous and they mess with their hearts and they hallucinate even knows what she's talking about her daughter became very sick at Enfield high school on Monday and ended up in the hospital her mom says she ate several candy Pops given to her by a friend they were laced with marijuana a bad batch of cannabis pops and she didn't know what she was eating because she's never been introduced to any drugs and she ate three of them and got a bad reaction to it and the toxicologists that a lot of kids are getting sick behind it this afternoon police detained a student at the high school for distributing the lollipops they have made their way through the high school and Eva is speaking out so other parents can warn their kids a lollipop is specifically for kids they're targeting kids yes and we're too close to Halloween so please be careful with these lollipops police say what makes this so dangerous is that the suspect they talked to the juvenile who admitted to having these lollipops had them flown in from California police say they say when it comes in from out-of-state especially like something like that that's untested you don't know what they're putting in it and it can be too much too little or something contaminated the FDA is not overseeing the the strength of this stuff the the cleanliness of this stuff so the puts this stuff in your mouth tonight you know it's just a really foolish thing to do tonight police are still investigating to see how many pops are still out there parents who have talked to their kids about drugs once before will have to do another talk about lollipops you just don't know what's out there you say don't accept candy from strangers don't say don't accept candy from your friend you know it's just very strange very scary for parents and the pot lace pollen lollipops in Enfield were green but we did find them on the Internet we did some digging in some research and found them they come in all colors they're for sale you can actually no order them over on online and police are saying it is illegal and they will follow up on it I'm Bob Wilson reporting live in Hartford news8", "MuxjpnmqeI4": "it's time for your your bank's 12 hi everyone today I'm going to show you I'm going to call it a demonstration rather than a tutorial because you need these particular molds to be able to do this and I know that some of you may not be able to find them these are for Halloween they are witches fingers and there's some eyeballs and what you do is you fill up the little molds with the candy melting wafers and then you can put a sucker stick here and then you have little suckers when you're done so I'm going to show you how to make these and what I would suggest is you take a look at your local craft stores if you have a bulk barn which is a bulk food store in Ontario then you may be able to find them there these are the sucker sticks they come in I think there is a hundred in here and they're from the bulk barn and these cost two dollars and forty nine cents which is fairly reasonable so there are the sucker sticks okay we're gonna do the eyeball first we need white red much Brown and I'm going to make blue eyes so we need blue these are candy melting wafers they taste a little like white chocolate is what they taste like and they're especially designed to be melted and when they harden in a mold they're nice and shiny I bought these at the bulk barn however I know you can buy them online under the brand name merkins or in Wilton or Wilton and you can also get them at craft stores so I bought these at the bulk barn and I store them at room temperature in these little plastic containers now you can melt these in a ziploc bag but if you have some concerns about Ziploc bags and the fact that they may release chemicals into the candy and don't use them um I'm going to be making a couple here to show you so I'm gonna put some candy melting wafers in a glass microwave of a bowl and we're going to microwave and I'll show you how to do that so I'm going to put the candy melting wafers in here now the secret to melting these is to melt them at 50% power or if you don't have that on your microwave melt them on defrost mode so I'm just going to show you my microwave here I've got power level and I'm going to go to power level 5 which is 50% and we're going to start off with 30 seconds and we're going to do start and after 30 seconds we'll take a look if they started to meld we'll give them a stir if not we're going to do another 30 seconds this is after 3 30-second intervals you can see they're starting to melt a little so what I'm going to do is just take a spoon and just give them a stir because once they start to melt it doesn't take long give them a little stir just like that that's enough I'm going to put back in for another 30 seconds ok and we're good and once they're melted as you're working with them if they start to harden up not going to take long to get them melted again they seem to retain heat for quite a long time this is actually perfect consistency for dipping or for whatever you want to do sometimes they get too sometimes they're too thick if they're too thick and you need to add a little bit of vegetable shortening to it stir it around and it will thin it out and still be perfect for candy making so there we go they're melted in this bowl but I like to use them in ziplock bag I find it's just easier so I'm going to transfer the melted white into a ziplock bag and then just hold onto this bowl with a spoon and use it again next time you have to melt some if you have a whole bunch do go first thing we do start off with the very center of the eye which is going to be just a little bit of chocolate we'll just let it drip and then we'll just tap the mold a little bit and let it spread out and do the same thing with the other one okay now for the color part of the I'm going to do that in blue now I could let this brown harden first but I'm not going to because I'm just going to be careful like so and I know it doesn't look smooth but all you have to do is give it a tap and it's just smoothing out now what I've done is I put some red in a ziplock bag and to get the veins this is going to be hard to see but to get the veins I'm just going to fill up the little veins with the red like so and I'm going to go put this in the refrigerator not for long I'd say for 5-10 minutes to let it harden before we go on to the next step but before I do that actually I'm going to do a witch's finger might as well do a witch's finger I think we'll do a finger nail and read so hope you can fill it the nail bed now we're going to fill this with green and what it's just about full we're going to add a sucker stick we want to make sure it's further enough into the candy melting wafer so I give it a little turn to coat it and then put it in just like that and if you think it needs a little bit more to hold it in there we'll add it and then just a little tap you'll smooth out and you're going to put the refrigerator to harden so now that the center of the eye and the little veins are set we're going to add the white to fill it up so it's almost full and then we're going to add a sucker stick and I usually give them a little turn just to coat and you want to make sure there's enough of it to hold the sucker in place and then I add a little bit more it will even up and all the bubbles will come to the surface as well that's another reason why I'm going to tap it some light Tufts bubbles will come to the surface and then refrigerate again so once there's the really chilled you're just going to pop them on the mold and if they're cool enough they should come out quite nicely and they should be nice and shiny there's the eyeball eyeball and another witch's finger now to serve them you just put them a container and hand them out or you get these little treat bags they also sell these at the fall form and you put your little treat inside like so and then you can put a twist tie around here if you want or a piece of ribbon I mean I don't have any orange or black ribbon which would probably be best for this because during it's Halloween but just so that you get the idea tie it with a piece of ribbon and you can curl up the edges if you'd like and there is one little Halloween tree for somebody next one I make though I will let the chocolate ice enter Harden before I put the blue you can see how it they've kind of bled into one another the colors so I think I would let the chocolate harden before I put the blue that's the only thing different I would make I would do with these same thing with this one that the blue what you wouldn't see the blue going into the mid Center like that if I would have let the brown chocolate harden first but they're still cute and I'm still just as edible so here's one where I let the brown part of the eye harden before putting the blue and you can see how it's a lot nicer a lot nicer and there's no bleeding into the brown into the blue you",

great ones out there cannabis quenchers awesome Jasper's amazing there of course some Dead's out there but on the whole I do like the drinks so I'm really looking forward to this Dixie elixir half and a half a pretty cool little bottle here it's got a wrapper on the outside I kind of like the idea is that the cap there at the top if you want a dose the cap is designed to help you dose appropriately helps you decide like you know oh what's 10 milliliters blah blah blah blah blah what's it what's a dose of course we're going to ignore that and just drink the whole bottle in terms of half and half I love me some Arnold Palmer's which is what a half lemonade half iced tea is love love love them so I'm hoping like this the drinks in terms of taste are all over the map sometimes they're really bad like as Aspen but that means they can produce excellent rewards like zest and sometimes they're not too bad but they often have this really bitter aftertaste and I find that to be pretty often the case with the drinks I'm having trouble getting it off which is you know par for the course for me we're almost there keep peeling this plastic layer off until we eventually get to the goods oh boy there she goes okay there she is all defrocked there's a little cap that you can pour it in so on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition information I sadly don't see any lab and testing results but that's okay we're gonna hope that it has 100 milligrams in here it says shake gently before consuming which is what we shall do I assume this opens like a childproof lid it does handsome looking bottle there down the hatch hmm it's okay definite cannabis taste to it more tea than lemonade taste it's not too bad um it's only eight and a half ounces so I'll be done with it in no time again there is a slight cannabis taste to it it's not as bitter as the cannabis quench reserves ASP but but it is there so if you really hate that cannabis taste you might want to pass on this one but for me I'm uh I'm I'm I'm David it's again it's not as bitter as some of the the other brands out there hopefully it means it's still gonna be nice and strong so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I'm gonna come back to you in two hours like all of our reviews to let you know how this Dixie elixir has landed thanks for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] Dixie elixir half and half and it's pretty good it is in the oh it got me to about a six I'm about a six right now 400 milligram edible that's not bad and one that only costs eleven bucks which I think I neglected to mention the first half I'm pretty pleased with it the taste was good for a drink it wasn't outstanding tasting and it didn't get me crazy high but overall it's a pretty good little product one that I'm pleased with if you pick if you see it at a dispensary near you and you're looking for a drink and they don't and you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the Dixie elixir might be the product for you I think I might try another one in the future see how it goes for me but overall this is a it's gonna give them my own thumbs up for me not a not a ringing endorsement but but far from uh from a negative review so uh that's gonna do it for this review here guys a nice short and sweet one but before I go and share with you a little cherry on top something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily we'd really did something I just love that I want to express to you guys and hopefully you will dig as well and this week uh it is going to be Silicon Valley yay there's a little Dinesh in a little guilfoyle now normally I'm very much against these little pop vinyls I think that's what they're called these things just seem like capitalism gone amok but well here becomes capitalism run amuck I think I got in flight two for $5.00 at Gamestop and I was like well III have to have a Dinesh and Gilfoyle so Silicon Valley uh-huh on HBO great great show by the legendary Mike judge of beavis and butthead and king of the hill and office space the movie so it's a great show about that Lampoon's Silicon Valley and I just culture hysterical in its fifth season right now on HBO check it out if you haven't I'm sure you've heard about it from people other than just me and that guys is gonna do it from the cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat thank you so much for sticking around to the very end guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "7Q9f7rpc8Rs": "I have already washed and scrubbed these apples and I'm going to use skewers here as my sticks you can use chopsticks if you want you can use popsicle sticks really whatever kind of stick will go into the center of an apple and just try and get it down through the center of said apples like that and then I have some boiling water here that I have used to test my candy thermometer because I'm going to be making the caramel from scratch and to help the caramel sit or set or stick stick on the apples you want to dip your apples in this boiling water for maybe 5 10 seconds or so and this removes all the wax that is on the apples just go ahead and dip them in there for 5 seconds or so and then dry them off and that gets all the wax off like that now that the apples are dipped and are off to the side I've got some wax paper here on my cutting board if you have parchment paper you can use that whatever you use you want to liberally butter with a lot of butter if you think you have enough butter on there put some more and this will prevent the caramel from sticking to this and you just want to make sure that this is liberally coated with butter all right now let's get working on the caramel for the caramel I'm going to add my brown sugar into a heavy-bottomed saucepan you want the heaviest pan you can possibly find that you have available to you I'm going to add in my corn syrup and I'm just doing a half a recipe here for demonstration purposes I will put the full recipe down below process is the same corn syrup in there and my butter and finally my sweetened condensed milk and I'm just going to bring this up to a boil over medium-high heat and once your butter is melted all the way go ahead and put in a candy thermometer and make sure that the bottom of the candy thermometer does not touch the pan that will give you a false reading and I'm going to turn the heat down to just above medium here and be sure to keep stirring this you do not want this to burn and every once in a while scrape down the side that's why I'm starting this with a silicon spatula scraping down the sides will prevent your caramel from becoming grainy so I'm going to bring this up to a boil and I'll be back this is nearly at a boil and I'm continuing to stir this and scraping down the sides moving the thermometer out of the way so I can get back behind there and underneath it and you want to bring this up to the recipe says 248 degrees I find that to be a little hard for caramel apples so I'm going to bring it up to 245 degrees and just keep stirring this even walking away for five seconds is enough for it to burn so you definitely do not want to burn it so I'm going to keep on cooking this until we are at 245 degrees looks like right now we're just approaching 210 so we got a little bit ways to go all right this right here is right about 245 degrees so that's what it looks like when it's done again just keep stirring because you do not want this to burn I'm going to take this off heat and over here I'm going to let this sit for just a few minutes before I add my vanilla now I'm going to add my vanilla like that throw this in and now it is time to dip our apples now you want to get your apples dipped before this has a chance to cool too much so I'm just going to roll the Apple in like that let most of that caramel come off like that and I'm going to roll these in crushed peanuts chopped peanuts if you don't want to do peanuts you don't have to I just kind of like the way they look so and taste so I'm going to dip them like that and set this off on your buttered wax paper now let me get the rest of them finished and for the rest of the caramel that you don't use for dipping your apples sorry about pumpkin bumping you there I just sprayed some nonstick spray there on this granite slab and I'm just going to pour this caramel right out like that and just let this cool slice it up wrap it in wax paper if you so choose and there's some thermal candy for you so that's how you make caramel from scratch and candy apples caramel apples sorry hope you enjoy thanks for watching you", "BmgZ-UlguNI": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm Vaughn chewy strawberry kills our countrymen will kill the

And welcome to another\nNerdy Nummies! And, happy Halloween! Halloween is one of my favorite holidays,\nso I decided to do something very special, we are gonna be making candy\napples, because it\u2019s perfect for October, and the fall, and we are gonna\nmake them look like Spiderman! Because that\u2019s kinda creepy spiders for\nHalloween! So let\u2019s get started! The things you will need, will be: 2 cups\nof regular white sugar, 1/2 a cup of oop! Got some sugar on my finger! 1/2 a\ncup of light corn syrup, 3/4 cup of water, 3 apples, I\u2019m using Granny\nSmith. 1 teaspoon of red food coloring dye, a bunch of these wood skewers,\nbut they kind of look like wooden stakes that you\u2019d stake a vampire with!\nThat\u2019s OK! You\u2019ll also need a piece of wax paper to\ngo over your cookie sheet, and, a wooden spoon, a spatula, a medium sized\nsaucepan, and a candy thermometer! Let\u2019s get started! Now you\u2019re gonna take your little wooden\nskewers, put them right in the middle and push them in there. These are a little bit\neasier than lollipop sticks, you can also use lollipop sticks, but because they\nhave a pointed edge, they go in a little bit easier. I don\u2019t have the most upper\nbody strength, so I\u2019m gonna be using a hammer. You want to put them in about 1/2 way\u2026 Nice! Once you got your apples assembled, you\u2019re\njust gonna stick them off to the side, da-dew, da-dew. da-dew! And we\u2019re gonna put together our candy apple\nmixture. In your medium sized pot you\u2019re gonna add\nall of your ingredients and then stir them up before we head over to the stove. So first you\u2019re going to take your 2 cups of regular\nsugar, yeah, yeah, pour him in! And your 3/4 cup of water. 1/2 a cup of light\ncorn syrup, ooooh! It\u2019s really goopy, it\u2019s really sticky,\nso this is where you\u2019re gonna use your mustach-u-ler! To scoop out all the extra\non the inside. Because otherwise it won\u2019t be 1/2 a cup. Now you\u2019re just gonna take a teaspoon of\nred food coloring dye. Now you\u2019re gonna take your wooden sch-poon,\nand mix it all together until everything is consistent. I feel like this is a witches brew! Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee! Boil-babble-boil-boil and trouble! I just put the pot on the stove, you\u2019re\ngonna turn your burner onto a medium heat, I like to put it on a 5, and then you\u2019re\ngonna stir your candy syrup until it starts boiling. Once it start boiling,\nleave it alone, don\u2019t touch it, just let it boil, and you\u2019re gonna watch\nyour candy thermometer until the heat rises to 310 degrees. Once it\nreaches 310 degrees, remove it from the heat. Now you\u2019re gonna wait until all the\nbubbles stop popping, and then you\u2019re gonna take your apple, dip it into the syrup candy,\nand slowly spin it around. Then you\u2019re gonna pick it up, wait for the\nexcess candy to drip off, and put it onto your tray. Now that we've got our apples dipped, we are\ngoing to decorate. I\u2019m going to be using big marshmallows,\nyou can also use regular marshmallows, these are just the ones I had handy, they\nwere in my kitchen. So what you\u2019re gonna do is take baking scissors,\na little bit of Pam spray, we\u2019re gonna spray our scissors before we\ncut our marhsmallows. Helps them not stick. Ready? OK, there we go! Take your big marshmallow, or your medium\none, and we\u2019re just gonna cut off the end to look like a slice. And we\u2019re gonna be\nusing these marshmallows for Spiderman\u2019s eyes! And then what I like to do is cut it\nin half, Then you\u2019re gonna take half of it and cut\nkind of the shape of his eye, it\u2019s like a diamond or a tear shape. Pew! Now you\u2019re just gonna take your 2 marshmallow\neyeballs and stick \u2018em on the front of your apple! Da-nuh-na-nuh-nuh, da-nuh-na-na-na. Now that you\u2019ve got all the little marshmallow\neyeballs on our little Spiderman Candy Apples, you\u2019re gonna take\nblack icing, and I\u2019ve got a number 3 tip, here at the top, and we\u2019re just gonna draw\nthe design of the web of the Spiderman mask. And then I\u2019m gonna take a number 5\ntip later on, to outline his eyes! Ta-da! Here are our Spiderman Candy Apples! They\nturned out so cute! Thanks for suggesting something Spiderman!\nAnd, Halloween is in a few days, so have a happy Halloween! And don\u2019t, try not to get bit\nby any radioactive spiders! Or any spiders of any kind\u2026 Yeah, OK! If you have any other suggestions for any\nother Nerdy Nummies please let me know, Leave me a comment down below and I\u2019ll do\nmy best to make it happen. Also you can follow me on Facebook and Twitter\nbecause I\u2019ll post tons of Nerdy Nummies pictures and cool stuff. OK, bye-bye!", "3V4wLZjxwY8": "what's going on you too so I made a video last night and I had some technical difficulties so be sure to hang out you can see it you guys really didn't miss too much but all you really missed is me talking about my ingredients and watching me putting it in and all that stuff but other than that you guys are good and check it out additive you're gonna add to your base very very strong you don't want to kind of make do all this and have it just you know you have to eat 10 candies to do whatever you're trying to do you want to make it worth it spend the money put the effort in and I assure you it'll be well worth it in the end so it's been about four and a half five minutes now and we are just crossing 240 degrees so I like I said this doesn't happen super fast it but once we hit around 270 degrees it will start moving a little bit a little bit faster so when you're flavoring with this recipe you want to use one of these kind of bottles you can get them at a Seymour Michaels any arts of crest or you can get them at Walmart when I went to Walmart they only have peppermint cinnamon and that's not my thing but right here I have cherry and I have an orange oil that I like to add so usually if you're going to say if you're going for lollipops or like life savers or anything like that flavor to get that exact flavor like they come out like it comes out of their factory you want it for this recipe when you use a half of one of these bottles and a half of orange oil bottle and it'll taste just like you bought some lifesavers what the orange oil does adds a little citrus and it just gives a little brightness to it but you don't need that I did a batch with just watermelon and you know I loved them they tasted great it wasn't super watermelon flavored and to be quite honest with you I hate the flavor of water now so these these oils then they they taste great but I know you're probably wondering why you don't add it now so you have it all incorporated it's all said and done well this is a different kind of liquid than what we got going on here obviously so if you added this to a 320 degree sugar base and this will probably burn out see they want you to wait till 250 degrees to add your additives if your flavoring but I feel like that is just way too late of a weight I like to do at almost 275 degrees you're gonna deal a little more heat when you gives you a little bit more time because once you add this stuff this is going to cool down drastically and fast so and one thing you don't want to do with this is mix it around a bunch because if you think if you live in New Jersey you walk along the boardwalk what do they make in salt water taffy so you keep stretching the sugar adding air adding air what's it gonna turn into a taffy it's not going to be as much of a hard candy it's gonna keep out again it's gonna it could turn into a candy corn which is honestly not a bad texture in itself either but it just now we're done for right now well what I like about doing these little candies and gummies and stuff like that is these molds there's so many damn cool molds that you can pick up like a robot dude here it got lollipops dinosaurs and it's like pixelated dinosaurs are pretty cool I seen Super Mario Batman ones like Legos you can actually take the Lego ones and build with them so there's like really cool stuff you could be doing with candy and if you get really good at it you know pull your kids aside and you can do a day with the kids and show them how to make the favorite candies and kids blown away that you can actually make this yourself it'll definitely be way more impressed with this than a batch of cookies that Pillsbury makes just don't have any funny business to it so we're crossing about nine minutes now it's a nine 10 minutes and we are hitting 250 degrees so in about four minutes we only went about ten degrees so once we're all mixed up and our basis set we add our additives we add our flavoring the name of the game is speed and just I don't want to say steady hand because if if you know me I am the last guy to ever have a steady hand you can people will hand me a 2 ounce ladle got a 2 ounce souffle cup and say fill up some butters just the laughs at me because I shake but for some reason I can do this pretty well but you want to almost come down and just go in a line 1 1 1 1 1 if you're just all over the place you're going to lose quite a bit of what you're doing here and nobody wants that but I would say 1 to 2 ounces for this batch usually I do a 2 cup of sugar 1 cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water and so I'll do it it's basically a double batch of this that I would do 2 to 4 ounces but this I think 1 1 2 2 maybe 2.5 ounces will be good all right it's been about 4 4 minutes later and we are just hitting 290 degrees so I'll check back up at the end a couple of minutes all right it's about 3 minutes later and now we just hit hard crack we're at 300 degrees so most people will want to go to 310 but we're going to 320 so I'll check back when we get there well it's about 30 seconds later we're at 310 so we're almost there so get ready all right so we hit 320 degrees so now what we're gonna do is so now this is a so now this is a hard Canyon and it's going to be very hard it's not going to be questionably hard and it's not going to be and it's not gonna lose its hardness from what we had so now we wait until about 270 degrees and we're gonna add about one to two ounces of whatever additive you're gonna add and your flavor so we'll check back in about five minutes when we get there so what I like to use to make my my tinctures or if whatever I'm going to make the most is I'd like to use either a leave o or a magical butter machine the the two of them it's it's perfect the you can perfectly adjust the temperatures and you could really make it long and really strong or you can make it really fast and get you get it done fast so if you're looking for a way to do it without having to you know use mason jars and stuff like that look into buying a leave out or a magical butter machine those two things makes the process so much easier and not just easier but it makes it stronger and enough of talking we're there so now that we're at 270 degrees we got to move fast so speed and accuracy is the name of the game now do not let any sugar touch you so first get all your stuff ready because you're gonna add at one shot so I'm gonna add my flavoring to my additive half I want of the cherry I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do half of the orange oil now people like to do food coloring and all that you don't have to I don't like it because I just don't like the I like the natural color that you get so this part you don't mix too much the more air you're gonna add the worse off it's gonna look so you got to be fast go okay so we're all mixed up don't know what to do let's go and then we pour accuracy now look guys I have super shaky hands and I'm go it's all about accuracy if you tried to reheat this it would still work but it's not gonna be as clear its goal is is clarity and just like I said if you reheat it you're gonna be mixing it again so you're going to add more air the more air you add the different the texture is gonna get try some of these but a nice steady pour and you could if and when we look you're going to tell that we didn't even have that much waste so this a little bit I got here and the rest I got here I can reheat and I can make other candies so what we'll do now is we're gonna is we'll wait and I'll give it about it don't take long about three minutes five minutes and these things will be rock-hard and check them out so check back in a minute all right everybody we're all done so let's take a look at what we got just like that all you gotta do is pop them out and move and look these things they're rock-hard they don't stick together nothing and you're really that worried you can get some powdered sugar and you're good look at that perfect so I got these little robot guys so many cool things you could do and I got these little dinosaurs so what I like to do is I like to have little ones and I like to have full-size ones because a lot of ones honestly where you're gonna find yourself like in these little small ones the best at least the parquet knees but like I said guys super easy super fast and anybody can do this you've got to get yourself two simple ingredients throw it all together and you're home free you can take these out in the lake with you and your fish and boom you're good but if you guys like what you saw today leaving a like subscribe don't forget to check me on instagram at the edge a chef and a lot of big things happening this week with medical edibles calm which I will be announcing later in the week so definitely be on the lookout for that because there's some big things happening I appreciate you guys watching and as always smoke on", "P3-EteSrz3A": "you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey it's Lucky Penny shut up I don't buy the thumbnail you realize we're going to be doing some hammering some cutting in dissecting of candy and this candy is we actually did a video this that I didn't eat it I didn't do anything in the video but there's been a ton of comments there on that video so it's time to finally get some more and break them open because I want to see what's inside this candy so I bought a little screwdriver set because I'm going to use those as a chisel and then there's four kinds here in regards to flavors but only to bugs we have the Scorpion and the worm and unique flavors here what do we got banana tequila blueberry and strawberry so I'm going to open up one of these first so these kilo one and then probably not all of these but one of these maybe the banana let's just look to see where the bugs are placed how's that this one here is right near the edge so I should be able to break through this pretty easy now the scorpion that's a nice big scorpion and the blue one this one here seems a little disheveled and then this one's pretty nice too mmm I might want to break open a disheveled one but we'll decide I hope you're prepared I guess people have headphones on so I'll be doing some hammering as you can tell I should need to warn you that it's not a normal video it's a little sticky it's gonna be a messy video obviously almost out okay let's take a good close look at that it's gonna be hard on the brown kind of blends in so he's right at the edge so I should be able to chip away enough to get in here I'm going to use one of my finer little screwdrivers and just chip away a section here let me try this flavor okay so I rounded out right by Oh super sticky that's your different shot but sticking to my teeth I'm trying to isolate it or her or it whatever this bug is the stickiness I realize how sticky was gonna be Wow now I need to come down this way we're just getting right into this whoo look at him he's somewhat mushy he broke a little bit there be a little more careful well little bug pieces just fell out I think for the most part most of them is intact there's the front some kind of bugs spine in there is it a rope he just broke he's so brittle I thought we had a tact worm close it was a close dissection you get another little tool in here and see if I can take my worm apart it's very dry the worm it sure does look like a real bug I hope you're running well there's no way that's a real bug well this piece looks challenging to eat it had a very well I've never had bugs before but I'm thinking that I just ate a bug the flavor on this not too strong this hmm interesting I'm not sure I'll do that again it does look like a crystal or a piece of glass doesn't it when I break it now it just tasted like sugar really there's no it's hard to die dissect digest I mean to pick out different flavors when you're biting a chunk of sugar um but it did have some kind of I guess bug flavor to it like the dryness of that hmm kind of piece stuck in my throat let's check out this guy here let's move this worm yes this is gonna be one of those videos that will go down in Lucky Penny shop history bug pieces everywhere strange dissections but you know that's what everybody wants to see so I'm just going on with what everybody wants to see they wanted to see me eat it they wanted to see the inside okay this one's gonna be much harder I think if I break off half it's very chewy that's better last Oh strawberry flavor much better than tequila work on my hair I'm not this one I'm try everybody I don't want to use we broke his front piece off see here look on this side I took that candy out of my mouth because it's very wants to stick to my teeth let's keep going I want to get to the body and we're working our way in oh look I put a little hole in my cutting boards oh man all the name of dissection I guess oh we got some of the body exposed hold on see it there let's get in it looks like this is just gonna be one of those cool look his leg came off right there see it's exposed now and here we go getting closer there's another body piece now here we go I'm going right into the main body chunk look at that it almost got them fully exposed now I'll hold this here and split them right in half oh there we are we are in come on bug show yourself it's okay don't be afraid I'm not gonna eat you oh there we go there's for sure bug pieces here now this is not as easily to get out as the UM the worm who would eat this now let's go let's hear it in the comments oh now you're all gonna think I'm crazy here okay I think that's pretty much the main piece this is just not a normal video Oh something saying eat it but then something saying don't eat it there maybe I should reconstitute this in a little water a little warm water let me do that I'll be right back I'm gonna get some water all right here we go I got some water you know when I started this video I never thought I'd get to this point I never have any real plan these are like a forceps that I found in a collection of tools that I had and it's warm water so I'm hoping it just melts off the the sugar which it is let's put too much pressure let me just let it sit in there basically almost hot water yep that there is a bug and the forceps are or if I call them forceps let's see now most of that is melted off yep that's some kind of bug matter well I don't know what I've resolved here this one's really tasty that's for sure what I eat the whole thing that's a good question I got bug skin everywhere what a mess uh I'll leave it in the comments eat it yes or no and what did we solve hmm it's gonna think about that well maybe I'll leave it in the comments and then uh if you want to see the other video we'll have a link there and I just show it I don't even open it touch it lick it nothing and that's about it if you want to see other candy dissections we recently did a giant jawbreaker smash that was fun lot different in this one this one's a little sounds a little weird but thanks for watching later if you're looking for the item you

sour patch kids a lollipop with sour candy dipping powder there are 25 individually wrapped packs in here it says each pack includes lollipop and dip these were 3.99 at target and honestly i saw them there and i would not have thought a thing about them but ashley our daughter is absolutely crazy about anything sauerkraut and she is very very familiar um these are all raspberries she is very very familiar with uh the what they offer from sour patch and she said i've never seen anything like that before and so she bought and some for her uh i think to give away to her kids at school and uh or to eat maybe to eat because when you go into her house her uh her place she has a ball like welcomes you when you go in the door and in that bowl is all kinds of different sour patch things bags and and she just loves stuff like that and so when i told her i said well i'm gonna buy she bought a bag i said i'm gonna buy a bag and uh because she really wanted two bags uh to have enough for all the kids and i said i'll buy a bag and we'll review them and i said then i'll give you the rest of the bag so that's what we're doing um this has pink raspberry and it has red berry there are it says one pack 25 servings per container one pack 15 grams is 60 calories so 60 calories for each of these if you eat the whole thing um includes lollipop and dip so this is like um a different dipping stick is that what it's called or which and you could you have a place on the back to put two in from um i've got the red there you go okay so so you get the the pop and it's shaped like one of those children around the front with the hair it's already got powder all over it [Music] i like the red berry flavor i don't really get sour from them made in mexico okay okay now all the powder in the bottom is white so and you get a little tartness from it but it's not a lot it looks like it's got hair oh i can dip his whole head and make maggie mustard hazel yeah that has white hair that is actually really really good no it's not bad i get a little bit of sourness to it but but not much it um frosted the frosted tips um a little bit of sourness but um it has a really nice flavor for me personally i would much rather just buy this in a candy form than buy it on the stick yeah i'd rather have like a gummy or oh it has his face on there too oh see i was looking i was looking well i thought it was just the shape of his head i was looking at the back of his head the whole time and i turned him around he actually has eyes and a snake it looks like a tiki uh a tiki face yeah liking gilligan's alan yeah um okay these are pink raspberry i like the flavor of that one's a little stronger oh that's really good i like that one better i mean it looks good this one seems to be stronger it's really nice raspberry um oftentimes when we try candies i'll compare i'll say these remind me of something else whether these remind me of a lifesaver starburst jolly rancher these don't remind me of any of those these are in a category the flavor the flavor is in a category all on its own these are very distinct sour patch kid flavors that don't remind me of other candies do they you no but i'd still would rather have just the gummies the gummy candies oh i would too the sucker is just more to deal with you got to have the stick you could take somebody and you when you grab a gummy and just stick your mouth and start chewing well or um if if sour patch kid made these in like little hard candies i would totally well i mean they they would that that would be something really cool um for me i'm not going to eat it and we've said this about other things about dum dum suckers that we've got i wish they sold these in hard candy because they sell some really good good flavors um but a stick is is not something that i'm going to walk around i mean these are great for kids i think kids will love them adults will love them too if you don't mind eating suckers i would just rather not have a sucker right i would think ashley will eat a couple of these but i'd say she'll be sure because ashley's not i don't i can't imagine actually sitting around on the couch eating these i just can't but you don't know so uh but they're out there they were new to her and so i don't know if it's a new thing or not uh but i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "VfFmaCwmaBY": "hey guys today I'm going to be making a lollipop bouquet but this time it's not going to be a topiary it's going to be in a cool ice cream sundae dish so I got this in a set of four it's a six inch tall ice cream sundae dish it's a glass like a cobalt blue glass really pretty you can get these in clear I also saw some in like a light pink and some other colors but I really like the blue and I'm going to be using some the silly straws I think I'm going to do the yellow because I have the yellow tissue paper but you'll want to get you some foam balls unless you've got some styrofoam leftover from some packaging that you can cut down to size to fit into your your glass dish and you'll need some dum dum lollipops I've got this huge box I've also got some fit zero pops that we're leftover and I'm going to use those for the top to make a sort of like a cherry on top type of a look and some ribbon I've got a little bit of this happy birthday ribbon which is good because this one is for a birthday and then some that have the the blue and yellow balloon this is a three inch foam ball I got a package of six can see that this just plugs right down inside of this particular ice cream sundae dish that I have it may be a little bit too low into my dish because it really needs to be about like this in order for you to properly put your suckers around however I didn't have a four inch foam ball the other alternative I have is this five inch but as you can see it's going to be way too tall for me for what I want to do so what I am going to do is just work with this 3 inch ball I'm going to wrap it in this tissue paper and be pushing that into my ice cream sundae dish so that it actually will help my foam ball sit up higher but the yellow paper will go down in here into the dish to kind of offset some of the blue you don't have to have anything into the dish or an alternative is if you really want to get crazy with the candy you could put some Hershey's Kisses or whatever their favorite candy is down here in the bottom but you want to be sure that whatever you're using it if it's styrofoam or if it's these little foam balls that you wrap this in the tissue paper so that if you do have candies down in the bottom of the ditch you don't contaminate it with any kind of styrofoam or foam shavings that may flake off now wrap the styrofoam ball in the tissue paper and I have just set that down into the glass dish by putting this tissue paper on this 3-inch fall now this sets up high for what I need and it also fits nicely in the opening so I don't even have to shave anything down for this I've got some multi-flavored deliciousness going on here with my first tier of the dum dum lollipops so I've just put a first row of suckers here on the bottom but where the glass dish and the foam ball meet I poked them in to the side there they they have a little bit of a an angle going into the foam ball and you don't have to do that you can have them going straight in like even some of mine here are not perfectly straight or sloped I have them differing because as you put these suckers in this the stem of the sucker for the lollipop when you stick that in there you're going to be fighting with the rest of the sticks as you go along because these are you know it's a small area to put all these suckers in so you just have to kind of work them in however you can but for the most part I try to make them as uniform as possible now for the second row I'm going to take the dum dum lollipops again but everywhere that I have a space like right here I am going to pop another sucker and then go all the way around doing that with another row of the dum dum lollipops here is that second row of suckers and this is just some more dum dum lollipop like I said I was spacing it to where this next row of suckers would go in between the bottom two so that you have an even coverage it just makes it look a little bit better and then also alternate your colors as well because you don't want to put the same flavour right side by side and if it works out as you're going along that maybe you have you know two root beers diagonally then you can just change that out if you want to unless somebody just really likes root beer suckers and then you could just load it full of them on this open area here you can do a couple of things a video that where I got this idea to put this into a Sun a dish she used blow pops for the next row so that they would then kind of stick up more because the blue pops are large in size just like the Tootsie Roll pops and then her Center on top was these cherry flavored tootsie rolls I don't have any blow pops so I'm just going to make more of the center with filling in with some dum-dums and then I've got several here of these red cherry to SeaWorld Pops oh you can mix that up however you want to do it I'm just going to use a third row of the done dubs and now I'm going to put in my red 2-0 pops here in this area and then put the raspberry in the very center so actually what I'm going to do I'm going to go ahead I found the very center of that I'm going to go ahead and push this down and notice I left it really tall because that is going to be my cherry on top and to further the cherry aspect I'm going to fill this in with the red Tootsie Roll pops so that it looks like just one big massive mound of cherry the only other thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take some extra suckers and just go around and anywhere I've got holes like you see I have a little bit of a little baby hole right there I'll pop another sucker in I did wind up going ahead and making a fourth row the dum dum lollipops since I don't have any blow pops I'm just going ahead and using those up so I wound up with it was 60 dum dum lollipops and all because once I made the additional rows of the Dum Dums because I didn't have any blow pops I then also went around and filled in any little holes which I did have some holes around on the bottom so I filled in those holes I grouped my red 2-0 pops and the raspberry tootsie roll pop I grouped those closer together so that it would look like a massive cherry on top the other thing I'm going to do is take one of my silly straws and I'm going to use the yellow one since I used the yellow tissue paper in the center to cover the foam ball I'm going to put the silly straw into the suckers and it will color coordinate with that yellow tissue paper I have now put the straw into my sundae you could actually do it at more of an angle if you wanted to I'm not going to I think that looks cute and I'm going to put some ribbon around the bottom you don't have to I've just got some birthday ribbon and some celebration ribbon some with some coordinating balloons that match the tissue paper and that blue dish this is the final item here I made with dum dum lollipops and some tootsie roll pops a silly straw that has a little squiggle and then I put some finishing touches of some happy birthday ribbon and some ribbon that's got the matching blue and yellow balloons and if you get those jumbo bags of the dum-dums and you only want to use dum-dums then you could actually just do the entire thing with them domes you don't have to worry about trying to make a cherry on top I think this turned out really cute and I also put the link to the lady's video that I got this from I think it was right out cutlery I don't know if I'm saying that right but anyway she did a really cute or actually two too cute ones using those blow pops that way you can see what it looks like but anyway this is my version of it with sometimes n20 pops she'll also be able to keep Sunday class and have some ice cream later so I think that's a really great idea and so cute to do for one person it's also you know if you're going to have like a candy buffet table this is still a cute idea to do instead of the dumb dumb topiary trees if you just want to go with like an ice cream social type of theme you can also if you have a themed like baby showers and things in certain colors you can go to Oriental Trading calm and get suckers that are in specific colors and then do an entire candy bouquet a lollipop okay in that one specific color if you want to I like to have it all mixed up I think that looks really cute and it's something happy you can do this for someone who's in the hospital this is a great Getwell gift and birthdays it's just do anything that you want to do with it for tonight's sunday bouquet of suckers I'm going to try something different I thought it would be cute to use marshmallows to be the whipped cream on top of the sundae and then put a lone cherry Tootsie Roll pop in the very middle for the cherry so we'll have the the sundae the whipped cream and the cherry on top in order to do the marshmallow suckers I already had some in stock but they're these 6-inch sticks that I got at Joanne's and I just popped a six inch stick into the base of one of my marshmallows and then I add some little love some little Silla Fame bags these are the kind that you do the pretzels in or so I just use that and cut the bag off to the size that I need it and then just put the twisty tie on it so this is going to be a little bit taller and that's what you want because you want the whip cream to be on the top bye guys thanks so much for watching and have a sparkle rific day you", "gUO0yhiHUvg": "the Neapolitan singer glitter stickers bilkul free with routine Jolly Roger lollipops", "x6yyR6PMV3I": "Kevin and I are going to try these Jolly Rancher lollipops these are the normal Apple I'm sure they've been around for a while they don't say no but we haven't tried it before each sucker yeah I call up cyclers and our lollipops that's just what we call them in our area suckers each one is 50 calories and you get about 20 sectors in the bag so it's not a good happy this is how the packaging looks and I didn't know it till I read on the back these are made by the Hershey Company I just think that's interesting well Hershey's you know you always think of chocolate you don't think of hard candy or at least I don't drumming yeah I'm giving more driving salads we didn't review on them we didn't review on the shoes the Jolly Rancher shoes were there hard on the outside and they have a soft center so we're kind of trying to see if these tastes different or if they taste exactly the same Kevin for job I think it's more comely and I can't get my open so we will be back when I can get my number hey Soph only got mine open and I quit watching traffic I was watching traffic too I'll have to admit we're in the car but I couldn't get it open either it took two hands to get the thing else it's a paranoid passenger well you can talk until what you think well I'm getting my first leg I don't wanted to persuade your I think they're good they definitely have an apple caramel flavor you kind of got a like eight says but you got to like lick all over it to get the flavors mixed together but they are a pretty good snack I mean it was last year little waffle Owens you're not biting it it would last you a while for 50 collars it's not too bad for for like a sweet it would probably lash in 15 minutes or so if you're just just not biting on chewing on it I think they're pretty good I think it's very very good if I don't know if they join makes just caramel suckers but if they don't they should because very good caramel if they don't make caramel they should consider it and but that is really really good a lot of times though adults it's just not professional to walk into some place with a sucker in your hand you know you just don't do it it's not something you do you put a mint in your mouth or a piece of gum and then even then you try to be discreet and you don't want to pop it in your mouth and all that so but for a nighttime snack right for a nighttime snack or in the car for keeping in the car or something like that and this would be great they're very very good they have a really good flavor so I would recommend them definitely so thanks for watching", "TUBqEBRAUcs": "hi happy valentine's day i'm kayla and today we're gonna try sour patch kids lollipops we have two flavors pink raspberry and red berry you see it comes as a lollipop and a dip now i'm not going to try both of them because that would really mess my teeth up so i think i'm going to go with pink raspberry okay so includes a lollipop and dip i think it's kind of like fun dip okay this is gonna be really hard to open apparently there we go hope the dip doesn't get everywhere so i really like sour patch kids i'm sure these are going to be pretty awesome so let's see yeah that's really good basically just tastes like a sour patch kid got turned into a jolly rancher um yeah if you know what sour patch kids taste like this is pretty much you know what you're getting if you know what sour patch kids taste like this tastes exactly the same except it's a lollipop it's got the um sour candy dipping powder when i saw these on the internet i figured these were going to be really good i think most everybody really likes sour patch kids except if you don't like sour candy yeah it's pretty sour you just taste it let me just try it without the sour on it without the sour dip on it yeah that's really good i really like these a lot out of all the things i've tasted so far in the show except for maybe the detroit style pizza this is probably the best thing i've tried i know traditionally for valentine's day you want to get your you want to get your partner chocolates but i think these would be really good for for valentine's day i actually have a big pack of them that's how i was able to get them the packages the packages the package has hearts on it so i presume that they made these for valentine's day since they're putting out valentine's day candy now valentine's day comes sooner every single year like christmas and halloween but the thing about halloween and valentine's day is the candy's not going to keep for very long i guess everybody wants to try it wants to try the candy wants to have it for a while yeah i'm sure the red berry tastes great too i mean again this isn't one of those things where it's like sour patch kids sometimes are good they're good all the time um you have you know like sour patch kids you have the sour patch watermelon these are really really really good i would be thrilled if i got these for valentine's day and if your partner likes sour candy too they probably would love these for valentine's day they might not even know these are out but i got them on amazon i'm sure you can get them at target walmart whatever yeah these are awesome anyway as always thank you so much for watching have a safe and fun valentine's day and please like always likes and subscribes are always appreciated thank you so much see you next time", "kiyU7x_H1YY": "[Music] hi guys I'm Jen John's welcome back to the channel today I have another episode of my amazing homemade candies for you now this is probably the one that was absolutely most requested out of all of the homemade candies that I've been receiving and it is homemade Jolly Ranchers I'm gonna be showing you how to make homemade Jolly Ranchers there the little rectangle ones you can also do them square if you prefer and I'm then I'm going to be showing you how to do them in lollipop form so kind of like two videos here and you know like at Christmastime when you have gifts that you have to give to people that are like not always on your list but you want to come off as like this really cool person that gives gifts to like everybody but you don't have a lot of money and you kind of want to be cheap with your gift or is that just me but anyways I think that making these homemade lollipops and giving them away to gifts for Christmas time to like anybody that you meet is a brilliant idea so let's get started on this tutorial to make our homemade Jolly Rancher candies we're going to be using one and a half cups of granulated sugar we need 3/4 of a cup of clear corn syrup you can use dark corn syrup if that's all you have but it will affect the color and it may affect the flavor of slightly we need 1/2 a cup of water and then the secret to Jolly Ranchers is in the citric acid we're going to be using 1/4 of a teaspoon to a half of a teaspoon you can even add more if you want to now citric acid is a natural occurring fruit acid and what we use it for is to enhance the flavor of the candy we're going to use a gel paste to add a bit of color to the candies you don't have to but if you want that traditional Jolly Rancher look you do need to add a little bit of color to it and for the flavoring that your original flavors are watermelon grape raspberry apple and cherry my favorite is a blue raspberry so I'm going to be showing you guys how to make the blue raspberry but all of the flavors you would follow the exact same procedure that I'm going to show you up next and if you're looking for the candy flavoring I find mine at bulk barn in Canada and you can also get them at different times of craft stores or cake decorating stores and I'll also put a link in the description box to everything that you need here so I've got my sugar here in a saucepan on top my element I'm going to put it on to around a medium heat and I'm going to add in my water and the corn syrup and these are the only ingredients that we put in at this point so what I'm going to do is just stir it until the sugar actually dissolves and once the sugars dissolved I can put my candy thermometer in to the pot and then we're going to heat it to what's known as hard crack which is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit once your candy has come to temperature we're going to add in our other ingredients so I'm putting in my coloring and it's going to bubble and hiss for on us here and I'm putting in a 1 and a half of these little gems of the color of the flavoring you can do that adjust it to your flavor to your desire whatever you want it to taste like I just found that one wasn't quite enough to get that real Jolly Rancher flavor so while it's still nice and hot here I'm going to add in half of a teaspoon of the citric acid so again if you actually like when I was testing this recipe I kind of I had a real jolly rancher went you know what it's way tartar then I remember it being so you could even put more of that citric acid in if you so choose so I've got this nice blue color here you just want to keep stirring it until most of those bubbles are kind of gone it's kind of working them out here if you leave the bubbles in it's really no big deal it just gives a little bit of texture to the candy and you might want it to be a little bit more smooth you can see it happens quite quickly now I'm going to pour it into I've just got a bread pan here with a parchment paper lined in here I'm just going to let it cool in here now I'm going to let it cool for about 20 minutes or until I'm able to start cutting it and then I will show you how to score it after we've let it cool for a bit once the Jolly Rancher mixture has cooled we can remove it from what we're going to do now is for it so I'm just taking a sharp knife that I've got I've sprayed it with some nonstick spray and I'm just making the places where I want the candy to be able to break or cut once it's cooled completely so you want to do this while it's still relatively warm because that's the only time once it gets really hard you aren't able to manipulate it like this it will just crack on you so if you wait too long it doesn't work but if you do it too soon you actually will find that it's really difficult to cut and that your cut lines will disappear and that it will just melt back together so what I'm doing is I'm just starting at the center and then I'm working my way towards the outside here and once your knife starts to get a little bit sticky you can reapply the nonstick spray or vegetable oil whatever you've got handy so once I've got it going that direction I'm going to turn the other way and I'm starting in the middle both times because what I found is like when I'm working it does press the Jolly Rancher little area here it changes the shape of it and I just found that working from the middle and outwards towards the outside had the least impact on the shape it still does change it as you can see but it's kind of the easiest rather than starting at one side once the Jolly Ranchers slab has cooled you can start you can either break it with your hands here or you can use the knife or something to to actually cut it in half it's quite easy to break into these little pieces so I just kind of prefer to do that and if they just have they end up like together like that you can take a sharp knife and then just help it along like that so I'm just going to finish breaking these all up and then you can wrap them up in like little pieces of plastic if you want to and you could put them in a little jar and give them to your friends makes a cool little gift so I'm going to show you how to do the lollipops next so to make the lollipops what I'm going to do is use this sphere mold it's just got nice little round domes on the other side now you're going to take the lollipop or the Jolly Rancher pieces that either you didn't like or you just have extras if you want to and you want to really squish them into the mold it's going to miss shape the mold to start with but what you want is that to have enough inside of it when it goes to melt it fills up the whole thing or you'll end up with like kind of a weird wonky looking a little like sucker there so I'm going to pop these into the oven it's preheated at 375 degrees and I'm gonna put it in for about 15 to 18 minutes I want to make sure that all of the Jolly Ranchers have melted completely so once the Jolly Ranchers have melted in the little mold all you have to do is take a lollipop stick and insert it into the center there just pressing down to the bottom and it will be a little bit wobbly if you try to do it while they're still super super hot so you can let them cool briefly before trying to put the sticks in so you can see that a start kind of starts to tilt over but I've got some ones over here that I have already finished and I'm just going to pop them out you just have to like play with the mold and cuz you have them like shoved in here quite hard you got to pop them out so there we go a little Jolly Rancher lollipop so there you go everybody how to make homemade Jolly Rancher candies it's a totally easy and I hope you guys thought so too don't go easy on the citric acid because that is definitely what makes it a true Jolly Rancher or you just made yourself a plain old lollipop now you know that I love the blue raspberry like I told you guys and the watermelon though mm-hmm it's delicious too totally amazing if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and leave me a comment about what homemade candy you want to see me make next and I might just pick yours and thank you so much to everybody who suggested Jolly Ranchers because this was a delicious tutorial see you guys all again next time bye", "GAShBDghjYE": "[Music] [Music] okay guys welcome back to my channel we are going to be connecting these pool noodles to pool noodles together to make one really long one we're going to use these to make lollipops and this one I have already done but basically just for extra stability instead of just gluing them together I put some hot glue on the toothpicks and inserted them now I'm going to put hot glue on this end pretty well saturate it so that when it goes through there's going to be glue also around those giving it just a little more stability alright once we do that we're going to use the white duct tape and we're going to stripe this like a candy cane but once we get that done we're actually going to be rolling it into a circle to make the lollipop alright so we'll be right back alright so we're gonna come right up here at the top and I like to kind of stretch it as I go to make it fit fairly tight to be perfect this is gonna be rolled up and it's gonna wrinkle the tape a little bit anyway but we just keep rolling the pool noodle just keep going until we get the entire thing done as you can see here it's striping it quite nice alright I won't make you watch me do the whole thing okay so we have it striped and we're ready to roll it up into the shape of the lollipop and if you'll notice those little white dots that is some double stick tape I forgot the brand it was something like super glue or something that made them that is just for a little extra insurance if you will because this is plastic and it has that sheen on it and when you start rolling this up I mean it's hard to glue plastic anyway but when you start rolling it up it starts putting that pressure to unroll so I just wanted a little added added stickiness if you will so now we're ready and I'm just gonna put some glue here at the end first you can see that but we're going to start down here at the end and then we're just going to fold this over and hold it tight and let that glue set up just a little it's comfortable okay now while I'm holding that I'm gonna go ahead and put some more glue all the way up to the sticky thing and in between these two and so we're just gonna roll it then I'm gonna hold it again [Music] you so you can see what it's looking like here now one side is always going to look better than the other so once we're actually ready to put it together will determine which is going to be the front and which is the back I do want to grab a rag real quick this is what I did with the other eye rubber bands were not big enough so I tied it off and I'll let it cure for a day or so look can you see that this is why I want it to cure I don't know how they do it on the other videos that they don't unroll or if they're editing so that you don't see where they're trying to enroll so this I'm going to let that sit for a few days and we will be back when we're ready to put the dowel rod in and put the cellophane on with the bow but this at least gives you an idea of what you're going to be looking at looking like and I wanted you to be able to see how tight that is and that it's not as easy as it's made to look on some of the videos you're definitely gonna have to fight to keep it rolled while that glue cures and if you can do anything to give it a little added help I would say do it and as you can see I'll sipping bring it up close see where it came apart in the middle there's a lot of pressure when you're rolling these things up because they're not in that shape they're meant to be straight so anyway just wanted you to see the things that can go wrong as well as how cute it can turn out we just need to let this cure so I'll see you in a bit okay just a quick look at some of these that are rolled the green one there as you can see I just did solid color and that one has the flat edge shaved off to make it roll a little easier and and I do like the way it turned out its tapered there at the end where I was able to pull it in tight here's one of the the red and white stripe that I put some glitter in the crevices just to see what that was going to look like there's one that's already under cellophane that one I don't know if you can tell by the video but the tape is coming off of it that was used that was made with Dollar Tree tape I won't get that anymore and then there's the one that was actually in the video that I rolled up and I have it under the cellophane here is one that has been cut in half wrapped in the tape and then rolled up just to show you what that would look like it's definitely an easier roll but it's not as big lollipop there's another solid color this is one of them that was cut in half and rolled so you have that flat edge that you're rolling this one I would use less glue on the next time because I don't know if you can see it in the video but you can see glue dried on it see there in the crevices but that was the first one that I had done and I was using a lot of glue so I would back off on the glue a little but I do like the look of those that are cut in half it's just a little different so if you're mixing these you know I think it would be a fun look now because they're made with pool noodles and duct tape plus wrapped in cellophane you can put these outside easily I'm going to try that this year I do want to see what the weather does to them as far as the heat and then the Sun that's out during the day I want to see if it loosens any of the glue that's my curiosity but they're made to be outside of course you could also put them inside and now I did make something really cute whenever I shaved off the flat edge on the lollipops I took that flooded flat edge and rolled it up and it made these cute little lollipops so you could put a dowel rod in that and either put them outside on a flowerpot or you could even put them on a tree these were the two I did though I hadn't made any others yet with the red or anything but just to see what they were going to look like before I threw the shavings away I do think they're adorable so I'll hang on to those as well so nothing's wasted so anyway guys hope you enjoyed this video and it inspires you to make some yard decorations and I think this will be the last Christmas decoration video at least for a while I just wanted to have these up early enough in case you wanted to do some crafts before the holiday decorating started so have a great week but bye

"hi everybody it's me Alicia Bunn thank you for coming back today and joining me we are going to be making some of this delicious kool-aid candy this is so fun and it's so good so let's get right into it first of all we're going to take a cup and a half of sugar and add it to a pan make sure you do not have your heat on just yet next I'm going to add a tablespoon and a half of cornstarch and I'm going to give that a stir and make sure my ingredients are mixed together pretty good you want your clean starch and sugar mixed together really good next I'm going to add a half a cup of light corn syrup and then I'm going to add 3/4 cup of water and give all of this a stir until your sugar is almost dissolved next I'm going to add 1 tablespoon of butter and then I'm going to turn my heat on medium and I'm going to let this slowly come to a boil you don't want to make this come to a boil too fast because you can you can burn where your sugar will burn a clown why's so I'll just let this slowly come to a boil you're going to need a candy thermometer I got this one at Michael's for about $4 and after your candy starts to boil you just want to stick it in and you want to let your sugar heat up to about 250 degrees Fahrenheit this is very important because this is what makes the consistency of your candy so you don't want to overcook it and you don't want to undercook it so 250 degrees Fahrenheit once it's reached 250 degrees Fahrenheit then you can turn your heat off and we're just going to move it off of the heat and I'm going to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract I'm going to stir this really good until my vanilla is completely dissolved and then since I'm making three different flavors I'm going to separate this into three different bowls so I'm going to try to get it close to an even amount in each Bowl if I don't know well but my three flavors as you can see our orange blue raspberry lemonade and watermelon so after I have my bowls all distributed evenly then I'm going to pour my package of kool-aid into each one I use the whole package here but my candy turned out really really sweet it was really good but it was really sweet so I actually recommend only using half a pack for this amount of candy if you were going to do one full batch of what I did instead of separating it use a whole package but since I divided it into three separate parts I should have only used half a package of kool-aid so after you have your kool-aid in each Bowl then you're going to start each one until all of your kool-aid is dissolved completely you want the color to be bright and pretty and you want the flavor to be evenly distributed so all of your Chanti has that really good taste so I'm just going to mix this together really good and then I'm going to mix my blue one in my orange one as you can see here it's already starting to thicken up but you want to let this sit for about 15 minutes before you actually try to touch it because it is hot and it does cooled down but you don't want to burn yourself so here's a third of my flavors mixed together and they've been sitting for about 15 minutes so you can see on camera that even they look thicker now - so I'm just going to move them on to the side and place down some wax paper so that I don't make a mess all over my cabinet because this stuff gets really sticky so have to have my wax paper down I'm going to take some more butter if I'm just going to coat my hands with this stuff because this candy like I said it gets really really sticky and really messy so coating your hands with this butter is going to make it to where it kind of slides off your hands where I won't be sticking to your fingers and everything so give yourself a generous amount and cover your hands then I'm going to take my spatula and I'm just going to stir my candy and you can see here just how thick it is and after I see that it's thick enough to actually play with and give it a little touch and if it's cool enough to touch then go ahead and dig on in there and I'm just going to pull all this out and just start working it now I wish I got to show you the pink candy on camera but my battery died without me knowing so here's the blue one and the pink one looks exactly like the blue one you'll see it later but the consistency is really good I was really happy with the way it turned out I just have to keep adding a little bit of butter until it doesn't stick to my hands and I'm just working it and working it until it's firm and have to not drip all over the place this is a lot like the slime if you haven't seen that video I'll put it in the description below on how we made slime but it's a lot like the consistency of that here's my orange one and this turn got really good too I really like the colors it smells so good in here and I can't believe the taste it's just so so good incredibly sweet but really really good so after I got done with all my candy just for experimental purposes I had a few candy molds that I used and here are a few little flowers and I just stuck my Jandy down inside here and I stuck it in the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes just to see if it would hold its shape so here they are cooled off and out of the freezer and I'm just gonna pop them out so you can see here how they turned out and I have to say I was really really excited and bummed that this picking time because they held their shape really good when I popped them out and I was so excited I thought they were gonna stay that way but sitting just in room temperature after a few minutes they started to turn into candy blobs so did not hold the flower shape but it was pretty cool to see that they did maintain the shape for a little while I think after a couple days if you would let them sit they'd hold their shape here my lollipops I did the same way in the mold refrigerated and then popped out then I actually kept these in the refrigerator and they stayed they held their shape the whole time until they got eaten behind my kids and then here are the stones I'm the same with them they really didn't make it past 24 hours but the time that they did sit in the refrigerator they held their shape pretty good so if you're not going to eat these right away I recommend keeping them in a cool nice and cool place but after a couple days this stuff does stiffen up and become like a real taffy candy so I hope that you enjoy it if you liked this video don't forget to give it a big thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already if you want to see more videos like this later

Tallahassee Florida for pouring our hot sugar today and it's already flavored with strawberries and cream flavoring today we're going to do something a little unusual we're going to make spiral lollipops but instead of making them in the traditional round shape we're going to make them in a hearty shape we have the color and then we stir carefully to boil all the water out we don't want any water left because this will make the candy stick while it may look like we're adding more sugar here or not we're adding citric acid most fruits have an acidic content to them and our flavoring doesn't so we need to add it back in the citric acid may only be added after a certain point where the candy will be too hot and the acid will burn leaving a lousy taste in the tasters mouth the candy that was against the table and the bars is now cooled down a lot but the bits of the center is still scalding hot wave to mix the candy together to make it get to an even temperature so we can work with it as the candy changes states it goes from liquid to semi solid to more solid and eventually it gets solid enough that we can put it over a hook and fold it again and again until it becomes white the sugar starts as a deep amber but as we fold it over and over we trap millions of air bubbles and it makes the candy become a brilliant white each one of those little air bubbles acting is a mirror to reflect the light it's time to assemble the candy and we're going to move the candy to a temperature controlled surface that will slow down the cooling of the candy to give us time to do our assembly we're making red and white stripes the white stripes are there to reflect the light through the red stripes to make it look more jewel like if you want to order our candy you can try it for yourself and get it at our website WWE Network now that we have a big log of candy we need to get it down to the size of a rope so we can spiral our lollipops we do this by pinching off one end pulling out a log slowly and then pulling out rod by rod until they all are right to turn into lollipops we twist the rope making the pattern go around it and then we take the rope and we make it into a spiral the heart-shaped lollypop starts as a traditional circular lollipop then the lollipop gets passed on to the second candy maker the second candy maker takes the candy and puts it into a steel form which they press it into the shape of the heart they then take a wooden stick and insert it into the candy making it into a lollipop if you ever make it to Tallahassee to see us make our candies

either candy melts or tempered chocolate and to learn how to temper chocolate view our video tempering chocolate easier than you think use a ladle a squeeze bottle or even a spoon to fill the cavities of your mold don't overfill them because then you will have to scrape away the excess chocolate from the sides of the cast place the lollipop sticks into the stick channels and give them a 180-degree turn to ensure that the chocolate adheres well to them tap the mold on a flat surface to smooth out the chocolate and force any air bubbles to rise out of the melted chocolate place your mold in the freezer for about 10 minutes until the chocolate sets and hardens when it is set the chocolate will shrink away from the mold the back of the mold will look gray ish rather than brown when the chocolate has shrunk away turn your mold over carefully and your chocolate lollipops will drop out", "zNXqRA8CWWs": "hey guys i am here today with the UC drop pop it was only a month ninety three

California we're right in the midst of flu and cold season so I wanted to show you a quick and fun remedy you can make at home for those persistent coughs today we'll be making honey lollipops these can be used for stirring into tea eating on their own or as a little Getwell gift I especially like these if you have little ones as a lot of cough syrups are not safe until age six let's get started here are two tools that will help this project go a lot easier first I've got my candy thermometer this is really gonna help you gauge when to stop boiling the candy so it is just the right texture for the lollipops the second is my favorite measuring cup for measuring sticky things like honey what's great about this product is that when you pull the cup down you just fill it with the sticky liquid and then pop it right out no mess start with adding 1/2 cup of sugar 1/3 cup of honey and two tablespoons of water to a stainless steel or aluminum saucepan with a wooden spoon stir ingredients gently so there are no splashes on the sides of the pan turn burner on to low heat and stir until all sugars dissolved about 5 minutes now attach the thermometer to the pan and let sugar mixture boil on medium low heat until temperature reads 295 degrees Fahrenheit or the hard crack stage while candy is boiling place a sheet of parchment or wax paper on your preping surface to help with any spills when pouring the liquid place the sticks in the molds make sure you are keeping a very close eye on the boiling liquid as you do not want it to burn or scorch as soon as it hits the correct temperature take the pan off the heat and add the lemon juice or extract ginger and cinnamon and stir well pour the liquid into the mold slowly there may be bubbles so you can go back over the unfold once once it has bubbled down once the molds are filled push the sticks to make sure they are fully coated and leave to cool at room temperature once lollipops are fully cooled you can decide if you want to store them or give them that way as gifts place parchment or wax paper on work surface peel lollipops out of the molds and place on the paper if there was open flow gently tap the lollipops with a butter knife and it should flake right off lollipops should be kept stored in the airtight container to keep them from getting sticky layer parchment paper or wax paper between each layer when storing if giving us a gift is clear good fats as rappers [Music] tie your ribbon around the bottom to keep the wrapping airtight incorporate a fun lug to give with the gift add some tea bags to the mug and a piece of wrapping paper for color [Music] all done [Music] are you silly huh [Music] [Laughter]", "lxflM5wk9xQ": "hey guys um well what I've got here is something a little interesting different if you will it's jolly rancher soda I've never seen it before until the other day when I picked it up I got it at big lots I got this one and the blue one now I'm not really going to be reviewing this and I sounds I'm mostly going to be telling you if it tastes like the candy because that's what it's supposed to so yeah I really i mean i could get descriptive with it but i don't think i'm going to i think i'm just gonna lay on a simple yes or no and then give a little detail as to why um but anyway I picked this up and I tried it I swear to God I picked it right off the shelf brought it to the cash register the lady put it in the bag there was no shaking so we get to the car I opened it up and it explodes so I took like a sip of it and that's why I like the top part is gone um it didn't make the car smell pretty good though for about a half hour but anyway let's get down to the review nitty-gritty it's the same color as the candy which is pretty cool let's see if it tastes like candy it does and then it doesn't it does in the sense that it captures most of the taste of the candy but at the same time it's got more of an app will taste to it that I feel the candy doesn't have and it's a little more sweet than the candy is I mean I'm sure that's because it's you know liquid where's the candies solid and you know the two different things so I'm going to give it a guess for as close as it is because that's I think as close as it can be to be yeah a liquid and then I candy um I'm trying to think now i don't think i've ever seen anything like this where it's where they take the candy form and turn it into like soda or something I mean they're obviously are have been like butterscotch shows and like that but I mean like a specific brand marketing its own candy and its own soda um I can't I can't think of anything nothing comes to like the top of my head so yes I was kind of cool that they have this and I never really saw it um until the other night like I said so I I thought it was interesting enough to pick up and review and try so I hope you guys I was interesting too I'm going to try and have the blue own up really soon I don't know why cuz I'm a little busy right now if you had a lot of to catch up on and I gotta go do a couple things so that's why there haven't been as many videos and I don't have people to think that I don't have a life and all i do is these videos because realistically it takes me about as long as it takes to record this video to do it I don't edit anything I don't cut parts I don't we watch it I literally review it click the button that ends the video and then i hit the send to YouTube button type up a little title a description and like two or three tags and it sends that's it so it really doesn't take me that long to do these videos that's why I have some money just wanting to clear that up for anybody but uh yeah so I'm just going to end it here stay tuned for the blue one I've got a ton of other crap to review too so I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you later", "pay7jhELXhs": "hi everybody welcome back to playtime treasure and today i'm going to be doing drama please trying these

probably let me taste this some of them again but i don't remember how what they taste like that's a good apple let's taste this oh it's sticky i'll try to pull that off got it that was blue raspberry um that the one i mostly like we see and the one i mostly like the most has to be the green apple the green apple is so good and they add a lot of flavor to it it makes it has the most flavor and the other one does the other ones don't really have that much strawberry or blue raspberry kind of taste to them so green apple and i should say strawberry pretty good strawberry is actually pretty good on that one that one has a lot of taste but it's hard to taste them when you eat a lot of other flavors and it mixed up it tastes kind of weird but i loved the strawberry and green apple and hopefully you guys can try these ones because they're super duper good well thank you guys for watching playtime with treasure bye", "xUpGTvPrCG8": "welcome back to unwrapped I'm Marc summers exploring the candy we like to lick that would be the lollipop the original lollipop machines were invented in the early 1900s and their output was 40 lollipops in one minute today's machines make almost 6,000 lollipops a minute and one of the biggest lollipop producers is the Spangler candy company the 1920s were all about great invention cars radios television and the birth of the dum-dum lollipop the best thing since sliced bread which was also invented in the 20s people have a wonderful nostalgic feel about dumbness the Spangler Candy Company bought the dum dum brand in 1953 today the fourth generation of Spanglish produces 8 million puffs per day the original sales manager of the Akron Candy Company which developed the dum dum pop thought that Dum Dums was a name that children young children could both say and remember weighing in at only a quarter of an ounce this tiny pop packs a punch after more than 80 years it's the second most popular lollipop in America at the Spangler candy company in Bryan Ohio it all starts with equal amounts of corn syrup and sugar get in a copper kettle in about a year's time for dumpling pops we used about 20 million pounds of sugar and about 20 million pounds after comes out of the copper kettle we add flavoring and coloring and mix it up citric acid from sugar and malic acid from Apple's add sweetness or tartness two different flavors there are ten core flavors in each bag but new flavors are added and old flavors returned every few years so a root beer dumb-dumb might be replaced by pink lemonade butterscotch or a primary mixer needs the candy for five minutes in order to blend the flavor and color throughout each batch then an elevator carries the candy up to a press to flatten it out roll it into a cylindrical shape and then insert the sticks the Pops hit this order where they get ready for dum-dum signature sashay wrapper it's got a little flat four fold on it and one of the nice things about it is it makes it easy to rap there were seven original flavors lemon lime orange coconut pineapple cherry grape and butterscotch but today flavor specialists create new pops based on their list of four hundred potential flavors this is spicy citrus and then we have a dragon fruit and here's a cinnamon bun but how about that mystery flavor that comes in every bag of Dum Dums do you think you know what it is what is this flavor what is a mystery flavor a lot of people say I love your mystery flavors the truth is the mystery flavor is different from batch to batch so they don't have to stop production in between flavors all of our dum-dum lines are continuous and a one batch of grape is followed by a batch of sua say strawberry so there's gonna be a portion of the candy that's gonna be a mixture of strawberry of grape or both mystery solved you never know what flavor combination you're going to unwrap producing two billion dum-dums a year the Spangler lab continues to explore a growing flavor frontier this one is a noir chata flavor it's a Hispanic flavor that's real popular it's a cinnamon creamy type flavor but one flavor in particular generates both complaints and compliment buttered popcorn which is one of the most controversial flavors we've ever had it was hugely popular and hugely unpopular that chocolate dum-dum didn't get a lot of praise either sort of have those flavors that you like or maybe your favorite flavor and it's like going on a little treasure hunt every time you open a bag you know it's just a little sweet moment in the day in a world that's you know not always so sweet",

The difference between the two is that Candy Melts is set at room temperature, they're also called Mercken's, and they stay hard at room temperature. You don't have to do any extra effort. Other chocolate, or more pure chocolate, because candy melts are\nkind of compound chocolate, not really actually\nchocolate kind of thing. Some people love the taste of them, I personally don't but\nthey're very pretty candy. (laughs) and they're really good\nif you are new to this. But if you prefer the flavor of real, traditional chocolate, there\nare some other steps for you. So you can either temper your chocolate, which I've tried so many\ntimes and I have failed, and where you bring the chocolate up to a certain temperature\nand then cool it slightly, and then bring it up the\ntemperature again, I think. And either way, it gives\nthe chocolate that beautiful glossiness to it and it makes\nit snap when you break it. When you melt chocolate\nit gets untempered, so you have to re-temper it\nevery time that you melt it. So yeah, that takes a lot of effort. You can buy tempering machines if you really want to invest in it. But usually what I do at home if I want to actually use\nchocolate instead of Candy Melts is I just pop it in the fridge and I store the lollipops in the fridge, and they will stay nice and firm while they're in the fridge. But they will soften a little\nbit at room temperature. So the Candy Melt option allows you to kinda handle it a little bit more, and they won't melt in transportation. And you can keep it room temperature. If you're using real chocolate, like just a chocolate bar that you get at the grocery store and melt down. You're gonna want to\nkeep it in the fridge, and keep it in the fridge\nuntil you give it to the person and have them put it back in the fridge. So it's totally up to you, but those are the two differences. All right so today I\ndecided to use Candy Melts because we have the cutest color. We are using pink Candy Melts today. And if you want to pick some up, I'll link them down below. Wilton makes a ton of them, this video isn't sponsored by them, but everything I used\nwas actually from Wilton. So all the products that you use will be linked below if\nyou want to pick them up. So I'm using pink and brown Candy Melts to get my desired effect. But again, you can use\nwhatever you'd like. So first things first, you\nwant to pop the Candy Melts, or your chocolate, whatever you'd like, this is the same for either material, into a microwave safe bowl. And microwave it at 30 second intervals, stirring each interval and just keep going until it is fully melted. The reason why we melt\nthem at 30 second intervals is so that you don't burn the\nchocolate or the Candy Melts. If you heat them too much, they can burn, and they can get all lumpy. I remember someone commented\nsaying that happened. And that's what happens,\nchocolate can burn, it's really frustrating. So you just want to gradually\nheat it and melt it. Another tool that I have\nthat has saved my life, it changed everything for me, get a little melting pot from Wilton. What it is, is basically\na little silicone pot that you put in another little thing. And when you turn that\non, it gently heats, you know the Candy Melts or the chocolate. And so it allows them to\nmelt without burning it. So this is more of a fail safe option, if you want to use it. If you're melting chocolate\na lot of the time, get this, it's so much\neasier, oh my goodness. So once your chocolate or\nCandy Melts have melted, pour them into any kid\nof mold that you'd like. So for lollipop sticks, you want to get the molds\nthat have the little spot to put the lollipop stick. I'll link a couple down\nbelow for Valentine's Day, since Valentine's Day is\ncoming up pretty soon. And then after they're in, grab a little lollipop stick, again these are also from Wilton, and just kind of swirl it\nin the chocolate a little so that you coat all sides of\nthe tip of the lollipop stick and then just set it into the little space it's supposed to be. Coating it on all sides just makes it a little bit more secure and so that when it's completely hardened, the lollipop stick will\nstay inside your lollipop. And now what you want to do is carefully transfer that to the fridge. Candy Melts do set at room temperature, but they set even faster in the fridge. And they set a little bit firmer. If you're using pure chocolate, I usually put it in the freezer because it sets much\nquicker in the freezer. You can put it in the fridge, but you'll be waiting\nmaybe like an hour or so. Whereas the Candy Melts it's like 15 minutes and then you're done. So then just un-mold them and you can get some more Candy Melts to\ndo a little drizzle effect. I like that effect because it makes them look like chocolate truffles. I melted some brown Candy Melts. And I popped them into a piping bag and I just snipped the end\nof the pipping bag off. So that will create a really beautiful and consistent drizzle. Sometimes you can drizzle it with like a fork or a knife. You can just dip it in your chocolate. But if you want it to look like more natural, and professional, and cleaner, and you want the drizzle to have kind of a consistent weight to it, put it in a pipping bag, or a Ziploc bag, and just snip a little hole at the end. It'll make your life so much easier. And then pop them back into the fridge for that layer to set, and we are done. So thank you so much for watching. I hope that you like this video.

take a look at these a Jolly Ranchers lollipops again vegetarian haven't I seen these flavors before this is a green apple course around the fire bees these are locally manufactured very close to over a loo so these are eco-friendly too and I haven't seen a green apple in a lollipop form before so looking forward to tasting it cause around fire rupees are around 15 cents or so so let me open it and I'll show you green apple our usual is little bit sour so I don't know how this one Oh taste color is a pretty spot-on and it tastes really tart not that sweet but now quite tart and quite like and green apple this is the watermelon again usually you don't see such flavors usually it's a orange or mango or something of it so it's nice to find the different flavors again that this one also tastes a little bit sour not that sweet I really like both of those and the third one is a mango flavor which usually you for finding lollipops quit nice to grow", "lebH2Dxc2KU": "hi hello okay so now we're going to talk about our recent food purchases from the vending machine and Terry house flash gene weapons all this so our first feature ad was going to be skittles skills were what at depending

gotten to but um yeah those are our recent food purchases by", "ggWmhhXK1eI": "what's happening YouTube is jaylee thanks for tuning in once again guys I got another Alegre view to bring you off the squeeze line and this one's going to be on the fresh green apple so let's not waste any time let's go get it [Music] [Applause] [Music] sorry guys sort of squeezed green-apple was sent over to me by squeeze for purpose of this review that of course will not change my thoughts or opinions on this e-liquid so I do get a little skeptical but at the same time excited when I get Apple flavors they're not really the flavor I go to the most when it comes to fruits although Reds apple was fantastic probably still my one of my top favorite apple flavors so I was excited when I got this one in considering how much I've enjoyed the squeezed liquid so far all right sighs you look at the box here nice and classy nice and original I love that about it just has the green apple on the bottom on the back here it says crisp sweet juicy tangy fresh picked green apple all right comes in a zero three or six milligrams nicotine 70/30 VG PG blend 100 mil attending chunky gorilla bottle it's going for about $29.99 30 bucks that's when it's going for you now 30 bucks again I always state $30 for a hundred mils if it's a good flavor if it's good premium flavor I'm definitely okay with that so here's the bottle guys it looks exactly like the box all right really nice looking there very nice clear eliquid here so it looks like it's not going to be too harsh on the coils again this is another flavor that I just literally opened right before the review so I'm giving you my first thoughts and impressions like I always say if anything changes I will come back in a week or so and post in a description if the flavors start to change or if I'm haven't any different experiences with the e-liquid alright so let's go ahead open it up will smell let you know what I get from a smell will vape on it will go to vapor production throat hits flavor on both the inhale and exhale if it's an all-day bait for me I'll let you know if I recommend it to you why I wonder why I would not go out and buy this and we'll grade each category a being the best F being worse and we'll wrap it up so here we go let's have a smell definitely a tart green apple and I'm basically getting like a fresh green apple combined with if you guys had like to blow pops a green apple blow pops pretty much like that almost like a sour apple I'm getting from I do smell that tartness and the tart is what's bringing out that sour apple flavor in my opinion so it smells absolutely fantastic so I do get the fresh picked apple but I also get that um sweetness of the lollipop place of Apple combined with that I'm going to get the smell on a rail to that it absolutely smells fantastic in my opinion yes smells really good guys we already got it ripped and ready to go here on the goon 24 millimeter RDA I got a a few classes in here oh man out at point 1 1 ohms 90 watts let's have a vape as you can see for a 70/30 blend it's pumping out the vapor doing exactly what a 70/30 is expected to do it's go ahead and drip a little bit more in here throw it on a scallop middle with the hard I am going to say that the throat it there is a mild throat hit there but it's not harsh it's not from the nicotine or anything like that I believe it's more or less from the maybe tartness of the Apple I'm not going to say it's like a like an icy throat hit but I do get a little bit of a throat hit there but again it's not harsh whatsoever so if you're if you're used to vaping 2 3 I don't think you'll have any issues with it alright so on a scale of I'll say minimal to hard I'm going to say it's in between in between what's to say it's about medium it's about a medium throat hit but again I don't think it's going to be too harsh or overpowering for you whatsoever that's just my opinion anyway so I enjoy it I think it actually entices it a little bit more it makes for a more enjoyable thing to me I like when I get just a tad bit of a throat hit there so I do enjoy that all right let's go ahead make it a little bit more and we'll get into the flavor and guys want to backtrack I'm not sure if I actually said it or not but vapor production is going to get a solid B so I might already said that but just in case I just want to reiterate on that one let me go and do a few more so only in how you definitely get that tart tangy miss you absolutely get that you get that crisp green apple flavor you get that that partners to it it's not a sour belt it's just more of a tart like kind of reds apple have that tartness to it that's exactly what it reminds me of the tartness that I was getting from the Reds apple flavor from seven days that's exactly what I'm getting from this although I'm not getting the red apple flavor I'm getting the green apple flavor so on the exhale I'm picking up on that fresh green apple absolutely following up with that um you know that blow pop lollipop flavor so it's almost like a I kind of get like a little bit of a like a sour apple candy sour apple Jolly Rancher you can say or you know something in that nature followed up with that crept with that crisp green apple and green apples have a targis to it anyway so that's where that's coming in at I'm loving it I think it's fantastic am I going to say it's better than Reds not sure you guys will find out when I do the Battle of the apple flavors as well I got the great one coming up to I know I keep saying it but that will be coming soon go ahead and say flavor I'm going to give it an A and in the description it doesn't say nothing about like a hard candy flavor at all it just says a fresh green apple so to me I think it gets extra points just for having that that extra little you know effect to it but you guys might just pick up on the green apple you might just pick up on a fresh green apple some of you might just pick up on the candy flavor what I'm definitely getting a candy plus a fresh green apple all combined in with this flavor I think it's a fantastic flavor guys I think if you're in this sour apple or if you're in the green apple flavors you will enjoy it so what I recommend it to you I just said that yes I would if you're into green apple flavors if green apple is not the flavor for you you're not going to enjoy a plain as simple would I go out and buy this I would I would go out and buy it for several reasons number one it tastes fantastic it's another good apple flavor I can keep in a rotation because there's not too many I'm fond of number two it's a 100 mil all fennec trouble gorilla bottle 30 bucks I think that's a fair price for some good premium liquid and it's an all-day vape I'm gonna go ahead and say it's definitely something I can easily vape on all day and I don't think that's really going to change over time I like fruit flavors in general so I definitely think I can keep on faith in this I will of course come back and touch touch on the I will come back and let you guys know if that changes or not so I'll come back and touch on that if anything changes in the near future that's it for this one guys smoking cake slides vaping saves lives I'll put a link down below where you can pick this up at and where you can find all the other flavors off the squeeze line alright so you guys have a great day don't forget the like comment subscribe and I'll see you on the next one", "0eK9TUOyEoU": "[Music] how about an untraditional spin on a traditionally sweet treat [Music] today I'm going to show you how to make these beautiful and tasty flower and herb studded lollipop so to start we're gonna spray some silicone lollipop molds the next step is you're going to add your flower petals your herbs you can get creative here you can make patterns you can combine them in a saucepan we're gonna combine one cup of sugar with a half cup of light corn syrup and a quarter cup of water we're gonna stir it until the sugar dissolves and we're gonna let it simmer for about five minutes the goal is to get the temperature to 300 degrees you really need a candy thermometer in order to determine that so one alternative if you don't have a candy thermometer is to use an ice bath you take a spoonful of the sugar syrup liquid and you drop it into some ice-cold water and you see what it does you want to get that candy to it until it's really brittle once it snaps in half and it's ready to go now we're turning off the heat and we're gonna let it cool slightly until all of that simmering stops then you can add your flavoring elements or even some food coloring I added some cinnamon and flavoring just for a little kick but you could add coconut you could have vanilla extract almond extract it's really a chance to experiment you could also add some food coloring if you want to add some color there but I'm leaving mine clear so we can really let those flowers and those herb shine so now this is where we have to quickly add this candy into the mold so that it doesn't start hardening up on us so you're taking a spoonful and you're adding them into each mold and if it does start to harden up on you you can actually put it back on the stove top and let it soften again and then try again [Music] once the molds are full you simply set them aside and let them cool for several hours until the lollipops are fully hardened then you can use these as a party favor put some plastic wrappers on them put a little bow around the bottom these are also are great for the holiday they're super simple and very whimsical and festive [Music]", "cFwlIAzxTGc": "[Music] hi welcome back to Diamond delight animals my name is Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "iUbjVbsjeWY": "[Music] hello friends today we are going to be trying zucca green apple here is the cool thing about this juice it is synthetic which means it is tfn tobacco-free nicotine so what you need to know about tobacco-free nicotine is this it is not derived from a natural source the nicotine molecule is created by scientists in labs to completely recreate that nicotine molecule nicotine can come from anywhere it's in tomatoes it's in eggplant it's in tons of produce but where it's richest is of course in the tobacco plant and the problem with that is we as vapers don't want to necessarily be associated with big tobacco and when we source nicotine through you know tobacco we are somewhat still contributing to big tobacco and with all the new laws and everything a lot of companies are turning to tobacco-free nicotine as an alternative like we're not i'm i'm not here to like talk about science and laws and stuff but all you need to know about tobacco-free nicotine is it's made in the lab it is a almost complete clone it produces all the same effects as naturally derived nicotine but it does not promote big tobacco so you're gonna see a lot more tfn juices a lot of more synthetic juices on the market so we're gonna be trying green apple it is kind of like a sweet sour green apple flavor with a little bit of zing a little bit of zest we're gonna try it out now oh it's been a while since i've had like a green apple juice and this is really really getting all the nice notes that you want in an apple juice it's like tart it's a little sweet also kind of refreshing and just kind of tastes like a jelly rancher i'm enjoying it yeah this stuff is good [Music] yeah if you like sweet fruity flavors this is fantastic i always forget that green apple actually is really good like it's really satisfying and you don't notice any taste difference between synthetic and regular e-juice like that we've come to know this is all around a really good flavor i would highly recommend it i'd give it like a geez like an eight out of ten i could definitely have this be like an all day babe for sure i really like it zuka is uh gosh yeah just really doing the right thing by making a fantastic line of yummy juices that are synthetic oh good for them and good for us too actually because we get to enjoy it we get to enjoy their hard work really love it you", "sYO3qcsiyDE": "hello welcome back all to cream lux tv [Music] oh [Music] you", "ZCo1nr4_8hE": "uriah Ozzy IV don't touch the force oh my god did not give your Tyler blueberry lollipop we're gonna go to the shower don't touch the walls don't touch the walls", "maO2R4jmnYM": "hey guys today I'm going to show you how to make a super simple strawberry lollipop now I know a lot of people get really nervous or scared or think oh my gosh I'll Ollie pop how do you even make that and I know when I started making lollipops I was nervous to be handling molten-hot sugar but I promise it's really really easy it's so simple and as soon as you learn how to make a really basic lollipop you're gonna be hooked okay so the first thing you need to know about lollipops is everything all the ingredients get measured out so right here you can't really see it but I've got my measuring my food scale and what I'm gonna do is take my pot and set it on the scale and turn it on and that's going to bring it to zero so then what I'm gonna do is put my ingredients directly into the pot so the first ingredient in lollipops is glucose or corn syrup now when I'm making lollipops at the shop at Fiddlesticks I don't use corn syrup we use a non-gmo glucose that does not contain corn so we're not using corn syrup but this is the easiest thing to find if you're looking for your ingredients at the grocery store or at a craft store you might find glucose that's in a little tub but today we're going to use corn syrup and so what we're gonna do is pour this corn syrup directly in the pot and we are looking for 200 grams of corn syrup or glucose so I'm just watching it go up okay so we've got 200 grams of glucose or corn syrup in the pot so we're gonna tear this back to zero and then our next ingredient that's going in is pure cane sugar and so we're gonna put in 300 grams of sugar on top of our glucose so that's 300 grams and then the last ingredient in our lollipops is just water so I'm going to do 112 grams of water onto this so the key with the water is to pour it in really carefully so it doesn't splash your ingredients your sugar anywhere as long as you don't get sugar granules splashed up onto the side you're good to go you don't have to touch this again so what we're gonna do is move this on to a cooktop and turn on the heat and let it go okay so we've got our ingredients onto the cooktop I'm turning this on and so we're just gonna let this go we're gonna let it come to a boil you do not stir lollipop syrup so at this point everything is meshing well we're just gonna leave it alone that's probably the hardest part and also the easiest part of making lollipops just don't touch it I know it's so tempting to stir it so once this comes to a boil normally I would put in my candy thermometer but today I forgot my candy thermometer at the Fiddlesticks candy kitchen you don't have a candy thermometer hanging around you might have one of these this is a thermal thermometer it's one of those things that you can like point at the wall and see what the temperature is so this works for candy as well so you can just point it right at your syrup and it's gonna tell you what the temperature is so that's really important when making lollipops because you're going to want your lollipop syrup to come to 305 degrees or about 310 so on your candy thermometer typically it'll show you the hard crack temperature and that's what you really want when you're making Molly pops so once this comes to a boil if you've got a candy thermometer you're gonna put it in there because everything will be bubbling up nice and beautiful so while this is boiling I wanted to share with you how we're going to add our strawberry flavor into the lollipop syrup so you basically have three options my personal favorite way to flavor lollipops is using a really good Jam from a local jam maker so if you've got somebody in your town that makes really super yummy Jam go to them first because their flavor is going to turn up in your lollipop the best now if you don't have that handy like I don't today your next best bet is to use a flavor emulsion this can be found in the baking section of any craft store you'll see on the front it says bakery emulsion this is a Lorien gourmet brand now your third option if you don't have a an emulsion handy or you don't want to use an emulsion your last option is to use these tiny little candy oils it's from the same company Lauren and it's just a strawberry flavor oil so the biggest difference with the oil versus the jam or the emulsion is when you're going to add it to your lollipop syrup so if you're using a jam or any mole j'en you're gonna watch the temperature on your lollipop syrup and when it gets to 290 degrees that's when you're gonna add your flavoring in if you're using the oil like this you're gonna wait till it comes to the hard crack stage about 305 degrees or so and you're gonna pull it from the heat and then you're gonna add in your oil so the reason we do that is because the emulsion and the jam has some extra water that's gonna need to cook off whereas the oil doesn't okay so while our lollipop syrup is boiling remember we're not touching it we're gonna go ahead and prep our lollipop molds so you can find molds at any local craft store sometimes they'll be silicone like this one that's my favorite or sometimes they'll be those white plastic molds either way it'll work no big deal but if you've got a plastic mold you're gonna have to spray a little bit of nonstick cooking spray on it if you're using silicone it'll pop out really nice and easy no big deal so what I like to do is take a small baking sheet about this size and I put my lollipop mold on top of it because when we're pouring our lollipop syrup into the molds we're going to want to fit to get all the bubbles out and the easiest way to do that with these silicone molds is to have a baking sheet underneath so we're pretty much ready if we were gonna put any sprinkles in our lollipops we might put some sprinkles in now before we start pouring and then otherwise all we have to do is put our sticks in so we're going to prep our sticks into our molds and I put the top of the stick about halfway into the middle of the lollipop shape and we're just using a basic 2-inch lollipop today so that's it we're ready so as soon as that syrup is done boiling we can go ahead and start pouring our strawberry lollipops into the molds oh one last thing so one last tool that you're going to need for pouring your lollipops is a good glass measuring cup with a handle and a pour spout this makes it really easy to pour your lollipops and also reheat the syrup if it starts to get cooled down too quickly so make sure you have one of these handy and a little spatula would be super handy as well alright so our lollipop syrup just came off of the stovetop so it's still bubbling I'm gonna go ahead and pour in my oil my flavoring oil and you've got to be careful when you do this because sometimes it lets off a bit of steam and you can see it rising or you might be able to and some fumes with it so kind of keep your face away and I'm just stirring it in remember we didn't stir anything up until now don't stir the syrup until you add in the flavor so I'm just gonna stir it and let this steam roll off and keep going until all the bubbling stops alright so our lollipop syrups stopped bubbling all of the flavors mixed in really well now I want you to remember this is molten sugar it is so hot it looks really not scary but it is really hot believe me trust me I've accidentally burnt myself several times with a lollipop syrup and it hurts it is over 300 degrees so it's basically like sticking your hand in an oven that's liquid so just be careful don't let your kids do this part we're gonna be super careful but we're going to transfer the syrup the lollipop syrup from inside of this pot into our really helpful pouring measuring cups so we're going to do that now so here's the thing about lollipop syrup it's sticky it's sugar it's gonna make all these little strings it's gonna be messy you've just got to embrace the mess I feel like that's good life advice in general just embrace the mess just go with it you're gonna make a mess but it's actually surprisingly easy to clean up and as long as you take your empty pot and put it right into the sink with some water on it it'll actually be really simple to wash out as long as you get water on it before it starts to harden okay so at this point if you were gonna add any coloring to your lollipop syrup you're gonna want to do it right now I'm not planning to add any extra coloring I just kind of like it when it's the natural color but it's fun to play with color too so if you're gonna add color you want to use gel food coloring not regular food coloring because it's water-based gel food coloring will mix in better you only need a teeny tiny bit a little bit goes a long way with the color and the lollipop syrup so you would add that now mix it up with a small spatula or a little popsicle stick would work really well but for us we're ready to pour our super simple strawberry lollipop so we've got our mold we've got our sticks in there we've got our syrup here we're just gonna start pouring I like to use a spatula to kind of balance my my measuring cup and we're just going to pour very carefully into each mold let the syrup come up over the top of the lollipop that's where this tree three okay and then do a few taps to make sure that all the air bubbles come out okay so our strawberry lollipops we let them sit for about thirty minutes they're totally cool so if we touch them they're definitely cold cool and so now it's just time to take them out of the mold it's one of my favorite parts so all we do is gently lift and pull them out of the mold and you have yourself a lollipop now you could get really fun and creative and maybe put on a little freeze-dried lollipop on top of this to give it a I'm sorry a freeze-dried strawberry on top to kind of let your guests know it's a strawberry you could add all sorts of sprinkles or colors or anything but this is just your basic strawberry lollipop remember if you used Jam or even the emulsion typically there is some color that would come through so you might have a little bit more pink or red definitely use jam it'll look way more like strawberry but there you go you've got your hard candy lollipops", "3M0GXjgLU6A": "what the hell are you eating I have scorpion lollipop scorpion sucker I'm a sucker for these stupid gags but my student found this for me and he knows that I liked the crazy foods he found it a little shop in Palm Springs but you can find it online in a website called hot licks calm I'm going to have a link to them down below hot licks it's a very very suggestive name huh they actually do like chili pepper suckers they do chili suckers they do lots of like bugs lots of like candy covered bugs so I'm curious and try them I can get some more stuff from them and this is banana flavored with a nice scorpion in there now when I was a little boy my grandfather actually got me a sucker I can't think he was either in Texas or he went down to Mexico or and he got me a sucker that had a baby worm in it Noah

flavor kind of will done that banana to get to the score old Scorpio down that my student told me he actually just broke through the candy to get the scorpion who's going to take a while to suck through this how many licks does it take to get to a scorpion in the center of a scorpion pump the world may never know I wonder if it's possible to actually enjoy this knowing that there's a damn scorpion in there am i working my way down not sure if I can bite through that without no totally breaking my teeth that's really hard candy hot licks calm for all your weird sucker needs watching the guy lick a lollipop nothing weird about that that's not awkward at all man I'm getting tired of that banana flavor got a little break going on the end of candy easy does it don't have no I don't wanna bite into the old scorpion well that actually hurt the hell out of my teeth doing that little bite starting to realize that slowly pop eating contest would be a terrible idea I think I just bit off his legs this really tastes like anything though crap regression develop my student didn't actually just like use the hammer just to break him out of there go scorpion there let's just peel mr. scorpion out there he is that's the main body of the scorpion right there Wow it's meaty beer well I wanted to use any specialist core pian shell that tastes like either like really burnt chicken a

how to make lollipops at home using three different methods store-bought candy molds free form on a cookie sheet covered with a silicone mat or parchment paper or how to make your own mold using cornstarch making your own cornstarch mold is actually pretty easy all you need is a shallow container I'm using a baking dish that's kind of small but I was only making a few lollipops in there put in the cornstarch you're going to smooth off the top using a spoon or maybe something like a like a popsicle stick just drag it across the top to smooth it out you don't want the cornstarch to be compacted because you're going to be using a some kind of object in this case I'm using I'm going to use a juice bottle cap I'm going to press that into the cornstarch to make the mold cavities now I made a mistake here I dumped the cornstarch in what I should have done was sifted the cornstarch into the container and it would have been kind of light and fluffy and I wouldn't have the problem I'm having here when I was pressing the bottle cap into the cornstarch I had to press pretty hard it was sticking to the cap and made the bottom of my cavities uneven so sift the cornstarch smooth it out gently and then press in whatever object you want to make as your candy these are hard candy lollipop molds I bought these online because I couldn't find any locally I'll put a link in the description box if you're interested to prepare these you'll need to spray them a little bit with some cooking spray just so that the candy releases well now these are specially made to withstand high temperatures and are for hard candy making you could also make chocolate lollipops with these as well but do not try to make hard candy lollipops with molds the clear ones that are designed for candy melts or just for chocolate because they will melt nd I bought two kinds I bought just the plain round ones and I bought flower ones but there's a whole pile of different ones available okay so here we go on to the actual candy making in a large saucepan place two cups of white granulated sugar a quarter cup of water and two thirds of a cup of light corn syrup you can also use the golden corn syrup as well it'll just affect the final color of your candy if you can't find corn syrup where you live you may be able to find a candy recipe that doesn't use it you just might have to look around a little bit now to flavor this candy I'm using some orange extract I put in one at teaspoon they actually sales specially made candy oils for candy making you only have to use a little bit and if they have intense flavors I didn't have any in the house at the time so I just used the orange extract now you're going to begin to heat this mixture over high heat at the beginning you're going to have to stir continuously because you don't want it to scorch or stick to the bottom and at this point you can also add some food coloring if you want to change the color now I wanted to match the orange extract so I added some yellow and some red to make a nice bright orange color I'm using paste food color but you can use the liquid food coloring as well now you're going to need to stir this continuously until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you can stop stirring now I've seen some candy recipes that ask you to add in the coloring and the flavoring after you're done boiling the candy either at the beginning instead of the end and it still worked out okay so I don't think it matters so I'm a mixture has come to a boil now you can stop stirring and you need to continue to boil this until the temperature of the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit now in order to be able to tell you've reached the right temperature there's a couple things you can do you can use a candy thermometer these are relatively inexpensive if you're going to make candy often go and buy one because they're really really useful if you don't have a candy thermometer or don't want to go buy one you need to heat your candy until it reaches the hard crack candy stage I'll put a link in the description box that shows you what that means now I turn the heat down just a touch from high to medium high I just made sure that the candy continued to boil until it reached 310 degrees once it reached the right temperature I transferred it into another container that had a spout on it just so that it would be easier to pour once you're done pouring the candy out of the pot into the other container do not scrape down the sides of the pot or the bottom just leave the residue in there and I'll show you how to clean that pot out in a minute now at the beginning you'll notice that your candy mixture will be very runny and I'm going to fill the hard candy molds up first with it you just pour enough in to fill the mold and try not to add so much as if they leak out into the handle or where the lollipop stick is going to go the lollipop sticks I'm using are actually paper and I purchase them at the bulk barn but you can also buy them at candy-making supply stores or baking supply stores so I just push them into the candy and there was a bubble there so I just burst it and push the candy onto the stick now I'm going to fill the cornstarch mold cavities with the mixture same thing just gently pour it in there now I'm very intrigued with this cornstarch method and I think I'm going to try maybe another video and try to make different shapes and this time I'm going to sift the cornstarch in to see if it makes a big difference but you can imagine how much fun you can have with this so I filled in all of the mold cavities and then I added the sucker stick or the lollipop stick I just put it in there gave it a little bit of a turn and then just gently press down on it to sink it into the cornstarch so that it was in the center of the lollipop now another variation that I actually saw on Martha Stewart website was it you can add sprinkles and decorations to these while the candy is still hot these are little fall leaves sprinkles different little maple leaves different colors and while the Candy's hot just sprinkle it on and just gently press it into the candy and let it harden and you've got these little decorated pops you can decorate for absolutely any occasion as you can imagine I had these little pumpkin sprinkles as well so I press some of those now for the freeform lollipops if you're making them freeform without a mold I suggest that you allow your candy to cool a little bit when it cools it won't be as runny and if it's not as runny it'll be easier for you to control the flow and to make nice little round lollipop shapes if the candy is really hot and are really runny it may leak all over the place and you'll get very very thin lollipops the Martha Stewart website actually suggests that if you're making them free freehand like I'm doing here you take your pot when you're done boiling it put the pot into an ice water bath to cool it down a little bit more quickly but since I filled all those other molds first by the time I got to the freeform method it had cooled down quite a bit so as you can see it's a bit harder to get the same size of same shape but it's the same idea you pour it on and then you add in your lollipop stick and you can see here just by looking when I was pressing in these sticks that they had it had cooled significantly and you can even add candies in this case I'm pressing in some candy corns because it was near Halloween time that I was making these and the cool candy had cooled quite a bit so I had to press them in but it still worked quite nicely now as far as cleanup goes when you're done with the pot put it immediately in the sink and fill it with hot water and just the hot water sitting in the pot will dissolve any of the candy that's in there the same thing goes with the rest of your utensils like the this measuring cup that had some candy left in it and any measuring tools you have like a spoon or maybe your candy thermometer put it in let it sit in the hot water and the candy will dissolve all on its own or you can even take the pot and put it back on the stove filled with water and just let the water simmer and you'll simmer away all the candy as well so you can see it's sat there for about an hour a lot of the candy has gone out of the measuring cup and all the candy has disappeared out of the pot as well so it's nice and clean so cleanup is not a nightmare if you just are patient and let it sit in some hot water so I refill but measuring cup with hot water and let it sit and give it a stir every once in a while and the candy will just dissolve right off your container so you're going to let those candy molds cool completely and then you're just going to pop them out of the mold and they should come out quite easily I did spray these a little bit of cooking spray first and they popped right out and they are just gorgeous I was very impressed with this first attempt using these candy molds so there are some flowers the candy stick is cold white adhered to the can you don't have to worry about it falling off and here are some of the ones with the little sprinkles on them and the lollipops are nice and clear so you can see them from this angle which kind of looks like they're floating in the ambi or you can look at it from this side as well pretty cool these are the ones I did free form and they should come right off the silicon mat you'll have a little bit of an imprint from the silicon mat on the back of the lollipops and here are this cornstarch lollipops just take them out tap off the excess and then you can wipe them down with a clean dry towel to get rid of more of the cornstarch and the core starts in the container you can reuse that for baking put it back in the container or you can use it for more lollipop making as well it's completely reusable now here are some of the completed lollipops it made about two dozen of them and they tasted great they tasted just like orange now these this is one of the cornstarch ones and you can see the back of it is not smooth and it actually looks a little like the surface of the Moon it actually holds details quite well which is kind of interesting here's another cool recipe it is for candy apple chips this video will be going live on November 4th 2013 so if you're watching this video after that

to make them because Thanksgiving is coming and this is the perfect time to make these cool desserts so if you want to know how to make these Apple lollipop chocolate sticks now please continue to watch the things that you will need for these chocolate Apple lollipops will be two apples or more depending on how many you need some coconut oil chocolate candy melts caramel wax paper popsicle sticks chunks of Heath bars sprinkles and a squeeze bottle the first step is we are going to slice up our apples careful not to cut yourself we wouldn't want an accident to happen then with your knife you're going to poke the middle part out get all the seeds out because I mean if you like seeds then we're gonna take our popsicle sticks and we're going to push them inside the apple slices to make the Apple lollipop yeah now we're gonna melt our chocolate we're going to take take a measuring cup and put it inside the boiling water we're going to add two scoops of coconut oil and then start mixing mix until all the chunkiness is gone now we're gonna dip our apples inside the chocolate before our chocolate gets hard we are going to add our toppings to it and once you add your toppings just drizzle a little bit more chocolate on top and bam you are left with this delicious chocolate apple lollipops wait wait wait not yet because we still have to add our caramel drizzle put some caramel inside a squeeze bottle and drizzle some caramel on top of your lollipop and bam this is the resolution to our chocolate apple lollipops and let me tell you that these lollipops were very very

don't nice", "P-KL9AFGtMY": "Hi!  It's Gary Dinstuhl again here at\nTweetsie Fudge Works and today we're going to be making a crowd-pleaser\nour world-famous caramel apples. Caramel apples are something that have been\naround for a long time. I like to use a tart apple like a wine sap or something\nlike that to contrast a little bit with the sweet caramel.  Today we're going to\nbe using Granny Smith apples one of my favorite apples.  The first thing we do is\nobviously inspect all the apples. Whatever Apple you buy has\nbeen coated with some sort of wax to make the apple shine.  We've got to get\nrid of that wax or the caramel won't stick to it.  So each apple is washed then\nit's hand dried.  After the apples have dried we go over the apples and we pull\nthe stems off all the apples and the reason that we do that is because the\nnext step is putting the sticks in the Apple and so you remove the stem so that\nwhen you set the Apple down it will sit flat. Then we go through the caramel preparation.  Caramel is basically just sugar and milk.  It's boiled together and that's called the Maillard reaction the\ncaramelization.  After we have that then we dip the apples in the caramel and we\nspin the apple to remove the excess caramel and then we set the apples down\non sugar.  The reason that we use sugar is that it keeps the bottom of the apple\ndry that way the caramel the sticky caramel doesn't stick to the tray and\nwe're going to put them after that they sit for about 20 or 30 minutes for the\ncaramel to cool and and we move them to a clean tray and move them into our\ndisplay case then they're ready to sell! Thanks for watching and please come back\nand watch more tips from the Fudge Works here at Tweetsie and remember we have\nlots of free samples so please come and visit us.", "e4vR9VI6fjk": "what is up

back when the aunt what Oh or not okay let them what are we reviewing Oh oh sweet aunt jemima alright well this is something called a scorpion pop and it happens coming a blueberry flavor of course because when you're actually eating a scorpion you don't want that tricky poison to come kill you that would be now you don't want to taste the poison this is the first time I've ever actually had to put my life in danger for a can you review I don't know how active the stinger is or if I'm gonna have some sort of allergic reaction to this thing but I do it all for you I do it all for the people this is from a company called hot licks and they're notorious for making all sorts of weird candy infused treats I mean from chocolate-covered maggots to barbeque crickets yes barbecue crickets they don't seem to have a filter as to where to stop so alright I'm kind of afraid of eating this thing one thing I should note is that it's really heavy like I don't know what this scorpion ate before he died was really weighing this thing down alright well let's go ahead and crack this bad boy in half oh boy there it is and then it looks a lot more terrifying and light than it did in the packaging actually this reminds me of this old SAP candy I used to get back in the pic back in the 90s basically what they would do is they would take the sap from trees which I know comes naturally and just court of occasion and sell it it was like maple honey this is like maple death alright here we go now let's go ahead and okay let's go ahead and now let's go ahead and say good take a dirt oh why is it so crunchy why does it taste like I'm eating a giant cheeto oh okay this is the one thing I truly regret eating at the same time I don't regret eating because for one thing the blueberry flavor sort of tastes like cotton candy surprising that's for one thing but the Scorpion it tastes like a toenail clipping that's been sitting on your desk for the past two weeks if I had to compare it to something scary well you know that big ball of foil that sits in the back your fridge you know the one your parents ain't never ever to touch yeah well I imagine that's exactly what this tastes like

series I'll be creating these for you all throughout the month of December so I don't know about your family but in ours we like to exchange homemade gifts so I hope that this series will provide you some inspiration and ideas to share with your friends and families and loved ones throughout this holiday season today's video is going to be for a super fun and easy 5 minute lollipop video and this is really customizable you can put in whatever flavors extracts colors you can make it really unique and sparkle with different sprinkles or candies so I hope you guys enjoy it and you can check out my other glass candy video it's a very popular video on this channel I'll link that in the description box below if you want to check that out as well and if you want to see more DIYs like this please give this video a big thumbs up I would love that step one is to combine 1/2 a cup of sugar with a quarter cup of light corn syrup for this particular recipe I recommend that or Lyle's golden syrups only step two is to give it a stir it will be crazy thick but that's what you want step three is to cook your candy in two minute increments and you can find the recipe link in my description box there are two very important facets to consider when creating this candy and number one is to be very careful the sugar syrup will get very hot so you don't want to walk away from it you want to keep your eye on it and number two is a very important factor as well probably the most important and is that you want your candy to reach 300 degree Fahrenheit this way your finished product isn't too brittle or too soft and gooey and that it's just right but beyond that you can really have fun and have creative Liberty and inject in some edible glitter or whatever your heart desires step 4 is to pour and decorate and I'll link in my description box the lollipop sticks amusing I hope you guys enjoyed this video there are a ton more DIYs coming at you this month between more edibles and beauty

and so well peace", "ZqsIT_mGapI": "hi everybody my name is Sonny and you are in sunny days kitchen sorry for the shaky camera but I just had my silly cat max jump on my shoulder Oh Manny way we are going to show you how I make my canna chocolates I make it with my half a cup of can of oil and it's coconut oil infused with cannabis I make it myself and a cup of chocolate milk chocolate for flavouring this time around I'm going to use raspberry laron oils they're fabulous I use them all the time I make heart candies as well and I use these flavorings in them too so sorry I'm gonna stutter a little bit I'm a little nervous this is my first video I'm gonna put up on YouTube but anyway so and this is my little spoon that I use with I used two of these this is half a teaspoon of measuring with the oil and then in these is what I used as my moles so I'm gonna pause it so I can put my half a cup of kind of oil in to the chocolate and then I melt it that way melt it down slowly in the microwave some people use like a double boiler or whatever but I don't do that I do it slowly in the microwave it doesn't take too long especially if I'm pouring my kind of oil over top of that and it helps the mixture actually it's probably good to go but I just put it in there I'm gonna have to put it in the microwave just to melt it a little further but dying out and then I melt it down mix it together and we'll be right back okay so we're back I melted down the chocolate and it's just a little bit shy of one cup but I'm not too worried about that because um that amount right there will probably make 45 chocolates so I've set out my molds I have my small these are half a teaspoon each these are a full teaspoon so this is a full dose one of these is a full dose you'll have to take two of these depending on your tolerance level some take two three four depending on my pain level my tolerance level is quite high so I switched from smoking to edibles and back and forth so anyway this is what I do I take a full teaspoon of the raspberry flavoring I put it in there stir it around and because it's just me doing this I'm gonna have to pause it again sorry okay so we're back so I've got a tablespoon of the raspberry oil in there flavoring mine if you're wondering within my little box it's all my Laurent oils she's fabulous I loved her oils I use them all the time there's the raspberry but I've got because I make hard candies too I've got different flavoring in there I have a green apple caramel butterscotch root beer creme de menthe and orange I believe so anyway here we go this is pretty well good to go just scrape off the knife it's kind of hard to do when you're looking at it through the camera all right the whatever so then I take my little half a teaspoon and I just measure it out obviously you just take whatever because it's going in the mom like I said it takes two of these because they're half of teaspoons I just find that the smaller spoon goes better into the molds without making too much of a mess so here we go we're gonna go in one of the malls takes two it is to get it falling up as you can see it's pretty level oh don't have it so we just keep going and going and going and going you have no time lapse so I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna get these done and then they go into the fridge and they sit in the fridge I don't know about 10-15 minutes you can check them after ten minutes because but because my molds are fairly thick molds I keep them in there probably about 15-20 minutes just to be sure that they're all solidified and they're not going to again max jumping on my shoulder on you jerk ball just to make sure that they're solid enough that I can pop them out of the molds and bag them and put them in the freezer so I am going to pause it and fill the molds and put them in the freezer so we'll just end it here but this is what we do and I will pull them out of the molds next okay so there are linear molds and I'm a little medicated because I went licking the spoon after I filled all the molds up it's very good taste yummy that's why they call them edibles because they're so good anyway I'm gonna put them in the fridge now and the next time you see them they'll be ready to be popped out of the malls so instead of waiting for the other ones to solidify cuz it'll take 15 minutes anyway so I'm just gonna cheat here anyway so these are ones that I already made that I put in the freezer and I find that these chocolates I've had them in the freezer not these particular ones but some of my edible chocolates in the freezer for just over a month and they still taste great so I've never pushed it any longer than like maybe five six weeks because sometimes they might get that freezer burn taste so just keep it to your personal preference anyway they might not even last that long but me I don't always eat edibles so I just make them and put them in the freezer so that they're there when I do want them anyway so this is all I do is just you just push on the back of these silicone molds and they just pop right out and then I put them in my bag ease I put about a dozen in each bag and then because they're little freezer baggies they don't hold a lot anyway and then I just seal them off right okay so I got everyone's in there these are crime to match and the ones are in the freezer they're our raspberry so that's it so I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please put them down below and I'll try and answer them as as soon as I can I'll try and keep an eye on it I don't anticipate too many people watching it because I know there's a lot of videos about edibles on the internet but I just thought I'd try my hand on it and on my channel so again this is flower child and I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please post them below and I'll try my hardest answer them okay smile have a great day be true be honest be respectful stay true and stay unique bye", "DGIe1XpRQfI": "hello everyone today we're going to be making kool-aid dolly pops and so this is a recipe that I have made a couple times and I truly like this recipe because it works for me and it's easy to find the ingredients so basically all you need is water cooking spray corn syrup or honey sugar and one pack of kool-aid so I'm just gonna start off by taking my molds and I'm going to spray them with cooking spray just so when I put the lollipop sear up into the molds they don't stick so just like that I'm going to put that to the side now in a on a small saucepan I put half a cup of water in it with 1/3 a cup of corn syrup okay I'm just gonna pour the corn syrup and with the water you always want to make sure the water goes in first well that's what I always do just so I make sure I think sticks to the bottom of the pan okay oh I'm just gonna go put this in the sink okay so now I'm back um and I forgot to mention you're also gonna need some other supplies if you want to wrap it you're gonna need some pops I mean really pop sticks you're gonna need some cellophane bags and some twist ties and you can find the twist ties anywhere it's like you can game at the grocery store and this last thing is a little bit harder to find but you can find it at any craft store it's a candy thermometer and we're going to be needing that and so what I just did was I put I'm 1/3 cup of corn syrup into the water in the pan and I'm also going to add to that one cup of sugar white sugar and so this is a four sided four were these right into the pan so one two three four okay and we are just going to turn that on to high heat and let it boil um and stir it once and every once in a while real quick I just forgot to mention um once it starts to boil you want to turn it down to medium medium heat okay so I let this reach 300 degrees and I'm going to take the kool-aid and I'm going to put it in with the syrup that has been sitting for about five to ten minutes now and you want it to sit because the kool-aid will not be will not flavor it you don't let it sit long enough it'll actually um evacuate evaporate okay so I'm gonna pour these in time old okay everyone so I just poured it into my mold so that is what they look like and I prop them up normally stay up without a paper towel and just to ensure that the sticks are actually into the zero up and that's what I do I pop them up with a paper towel and so I'm gonna share with you some cleaning methods for this because this can be really really messy and it's hard to get up clean so I'm going to fill the pot with water and I'm going to put this on the stove again and this helps the syrup um sort of get into the water um I'm just gonna put that on um heat again so the syrup actually goes into the water and it makes it a lot easier for cleaning um Wow our lowly pops sit okay so I took a pot of water and I'm putting on the stove and I just did this method because it takes about two times for it actually get all of it off and so after you get some of it off the first time just put more water back in it until um it's clean I guess and so I'm gonna go call the cops right here and I'm just going to take out these little things then I put underneath them I'm staying up because at this point your lollipops should be pretty solid um I wouldn't touch them yet because they're still in their hardening stage so this is what it should look like when your water oops when your water is boiling it should be red or whatever color your kool-aid was and that's the sign that the kool-aid is actually wearing off on the from the pan into the water and so in a couple minutes I'm going to take this pot and just going to dump it down the drain and I might have to do this method one or two more times but this is the only way that I've used to get this off so I know it works so I'm just gonna turn the heat off I'm going to go pour this into this thing and at this point or after the next time you boil your water it should be easy enough to scrape off the side and so I'm just gonna let this sit with more water in the pan on the high key again for a minute or so just so we can get the last little bit off of the pan okay so oops sorry for that um I finished cleaning up my pan um now I've made this only times that I have designated a special pot for me to use because some of it doesn't always come out and so so I still have like a little bit of syrup from every time I've made all it helps in it which is fine by me because it was a small pot that we don't use at all and so I'm just going to take my molds at this point this should be hard I'm just going to flip them over and I'm going to gently pop them out and so it shouldn't take too much I hurt to get them out just so this is one of all the props that you know and it's a dragonfly a little son I think so a bumblebee and so my molds are like just molds that I got from joining fabrics and I got them and say oh I think they were like $2 but um they're only like four but you don't need to keep buying new molds if you always clean them and stuff so yeah and I'm gonna show you how to wrap them actually so I usually take these um let me see if I can find it um I can't find the wrapper for it but um there are like little old bags and they're like I think there's so things it's all the thing Thanks but they work really well for my lollipops because they fit really nicely inside them but I think they make different sizes too so you can choose which size fits through all the tops best but basically I just put it in and I wrap up the end just like this and I put it this high round it and I got gold twist ties um this time so that's what it ends up looking like and I think it looks really professional and I'm actually going to start selling these because I've made so many so I'm just gonna show you some my other products that I made and these are my honey lollipops and I'm actually making these for my grandma because she has cancer and her throat is always sore and Scratchy and so the honey actually really helps my mom was sick once um a couple weeks ago and she had a really sore throat and this helps for like in it it helped coat your throat so she could eat right after and it yeah she said it helped for about 30 minutes after you you're done eating it and these are some of my other kool aid lollipops and I made this with the mixed berry which are one of my favorites with and yeah I haven't tried this flavor yet so should be interesting so I'm just gonna finish wrapping these real quick I'm going to be starting a new series and this is gonna be in the new series on my channel and I'm it's gonna be a food channel because I love baking and I love anything to do with baking so I'll be filming all the things I make and all the recipes so you can turn making onto and maybe you like baking as much as I do after you watched on my videos but yeah I'm trying to think well um I will list all oh like the prices of the products down below if I have a chance but I'll mean the right now just so you know the solo fan was about two dollars for a pack of 15 the twist ties were a doll or something for 50m and you want to get the same um same amount of the twist ties and the bags so that way you don't have to twist ties or too many bags and not enough of one of the other um throw a lollipop sticks want tips fun too and I got all my supplies at dry and dry hand fabrics so I'm just going to finish wrapping them and I will show you the finished product this is a finished product of the kool-aid lollipop now I would really like to see if you guys make these lollipops so if you watch this video and if you have an Instagram or Twitter do hashtag cooler the light pops with Maddy and so that way I can see all of your lovely creations with this recipe because you can do so many things with them and yeah so I'm going to try it this is definitely my new favorite", "X8Jr9AEAVW8": "hi

machinery-DF200", "52D0J_lwpy4": "you review the film bill how do you think you did um you know film is never as bad as you think and never as good as you think so there's things to correct we played average on offense we can get a lot better and that's the scary thing that we dominated a really good team we can get a lot a lot better you use a lot of different personnel to do you like that that's a quarterback getting a lot of different guy yeah I really mix this up looks for defense we can go to tight ends one fullback and pounded up the middle and then we can put forward series in the game and air it out so that's a really really good changeup for the defense but they have a lot of different things to prepare for you know I didn't feel that way the first half we moved the ball really well the second half not so much our defense was playing so well and we already had so many points that it didn't really matter and we kind of just eased our way into the first game yeah that's a big hit for us ok Levon one of the leaders of the team big pass rusher off the edge that's that's gonna be a tough hold of Phil but I think we have have some guys that can step up into that role how do you feel about playing entire stadium I'm excited for it we had a couple scrimmages in there but you know the the atmosphere is gonna be I'm excited to see how excited these fans are to watch us you know but both my brothers are gonna be there my aunt and uncle are gonna be there my mom's coming my girlfriend's coming too so that's gonna be good you and Nick bro said are kinda same in the terms of waiting a while to get out there and really perform have you gotten to know Nick and how happy were you for him yea  I like to think of him as a close friend of mine he's kind of an odd guy like me you guys probably saw the video that some of the some of the guys posted his hand dancing in the mirror so that was pretty funny he's a really good player and excited for him going forward yeah we're still working it's the first game kind of some some early game jitters early season jitters but I'm excited for where we're at and I'm excited moving forward I think those guys are gonna make a lot of plays for us that gives me a lot of confidence you know have have a lot of people behind me gives you a lot of push going forward and I'm excited to try to prove some people right oh gosh um you know that's a hard one to answer I don't think there is a most memorable conversation we talk about a lot about football so that kind of all just runs together for you when you're talking about football 24/7 you know I mean he puts a lot of confidence into me he never never really yelled at me we had some mistakes and I kind of just said no on to the next play and that really gave me a lot of confidence so I eat a caramel apple sucker before every game on the bus and then I always wear one sock inside out and the other one right side in so those are the two kind of weird things that I do I really like caramel apple suckers and one and in one time one of my socks was inside out and the other one was right side in I forgot about it I put it on and just kind of became a thing for me that same day no it was just it's kind of happened and I just kept going with it doesn't matter usually the left side but I don't feel weird if it's the right side yeah started in high school no not really I should just those two things and hmm just kind of happened I have no idea but caramel apple suckers look Google pretty good so my senior year I got asked to prom with like ten bags of caramel apple suckers I'm still kind of going through those and then my mom always gets me gets me a bag for Christmas so I have have a lot of bags coming off the suckers that's an NC double-a violation right there my girlfriend that was just prom date um I listened to a lot of kid cudi kind of relaxes me I'll listen to some John Mayer he relaxes me I try it so at the hotel I kind of hype myself up with some loozy maybe some Meek Mill and then when we get to the stadium I'll listen to Kid Cudi and John Mayer kind of relax myself yeah very different have you seen a Twitter look-alike stuff yeah you know I've got a lot of Kevin Bacon before Macaulay Culkin home alone that's a popular one those are two main ones I don't I don't see it personally but a lot of other people do the comedian yeah see I never really knew that guy so I was never really big on that comparison just kinda begin game yeah the game plan wasn't complicated it was it was easy for us to learn and therefore easy for us to make adjustments to it I think it was the right game plan for the for the type of defense that we were seeing in the type of game that we had the fourth and one did you have to did you say hey let's go for it oh that was all the coaches saying we're gonna go for it that was all them we just stayed on the field and run play you know we thought we were gonna see a lot of press man just because we have some a lot of excuse me new faces on offense didn't turn out that way in the first half so we started running the ball more and it was effective for us", "V11F9BA64JI": "girls what I'm showing to you today is great it's here let me see let you guys see it it's just like it's like Apple but it's like it's it's a candy but it's a lipstick and I really like it how it goes on my skin because all you have to do is wrap it in and there you go not try lips anymore go away drive go away you guys will get that and show it to your parents it's your tooth", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "yktud3osBkA": "drinking how much of this likes including those spray to spray them off on

two different kinds of cancer pain most patients experience persistent pain and breakthrough pain and why it takes two different types of medication to manage them if you have pain that lasts all day we call that persistent pain your doctor has prescribed a long-acting or around-the-clock medication to treat this type of pain and he or she has probably already adjusted your dose to reduce side effects such as sleepiness or confusion however no matter how effective your around-the-clock medication is you can still experience sudden severe pain flare-ups pain that breaks through the around-the-clock medication this is called breakthrough cancer pain and traditional medications for persistent pain are not designed to treat these sudden flare ups if breakthrough cancer pain is treated by increasing your daily dose of around-the-clock medication you may suffer the typical side effects of traditional medications called opioids constipation sleepiness and confusion the goal and managing breakthrough cancer pain is to give just enough medication to manage the pain as soon as possible while minimizing troublesome side effects when your prescribed medication for breakthrough cancer pain remember that it is important to continue taking your around-the-clock pain medication every day for your persistent pain acting is a very specialized medication it is to be used only by patients with malignancies who have breakthrough cancer pain and who are already taking on around-the-clock opioid medication such as Sturridge eASIC dilaudid methadone morphine MS Contin

showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe also let me know do

right up [Music] hi guys its mark from the simple vapor back with another e-juice review for you guys again today and as you seen in the intro this is bazooka sour apple sour straws yeah by bazooka vape e-liquid I just realized looking at the website that I ordered just from that this is actually made by kilo of a liquid sand I didn't know that before but I do now um a little bit about this if you're a sour vapor you like sour kind of stuff sour candy salary anything then you may be a fan of this um I do like sour stuff from time to time mostly the little sour patch kids candies that's usually what I like when I'm talking about sour I also like lemons I like limes so yeah I am a fan of sour however for some reason sour e-juice just sometimes make me coffee and I don't know the reason why but they do but anyway guys let me give you a little rundown here of the information I got this from eight vape calm a 60 ml bottle the size like this will cost you ten dollars and ninety cents there that's what I got but little did I know which if you if you actually want a bigger bottle for a couple more dollars you might as well go with the 100 mil bottle they got that right now and at 8-bit calm for $14.90 so a couple bucks more get a lot more juice out of it but it comes to zero three or six milligrams of nicotine this is a 70 VG 30 PG blend and yeah let me read the description for you guys here pretty much doesn't really need me to read it but I'll read it for you guys anyway it says sour apple sour straws by bazooka vape you could share this candy flavored vape juice but once you get the taste you may want to keep it all to yourself this perfect combination of fruity apparat apple and sour flavors in the premium vape juice is blended with the essence of crisp green apples sour candy tart lemons and juicy pairs all dusted and sour sugar crystals this yummy vape juice packs a big flavor and even bigger clouds so yeah pretty big description there but yeah guys I don't know I'm I'm a little up in the air when it comes to sour he juices I don't know what it is but there's a lot of them out there I haven't had a whole bunch of them to really tell you the difference in taste to me this definitely has a sour taste to it but the sourness I don't know had to wear on me this bottle again 60 milliliter bottle I probably vaped not quite half 25 mil maybe 28 something like that close to happen but now I have been vaping on this a while since I took the weekend off I baked on it all weekend on and off in my rotation that is and it's okay I actually if I'm glad I I'm glad I gave it the weekend before I made my damn mind up and made this review because early on I didn't care for it I almost made myself like it because I made myself vaping and it's not so much that I liked it as soon as I'm done with this review and this tank I probably won't even vape it anymore so I guess I could say I don't like it not that it's bad but I like I said I'm hoping I don't choke up on the camera because there's a lot of times where I'll take a hit of this and it just does something and makes me cough and I don't know why I do get a very good green apple taste and green apple are kind of a bit on the sour side as well but I definitely get a sour taste to it it's not extremely sour but again there's something in there that makes me call something that I don't get along with I don't know what it is though it definitely has real good cloud production the taste is there it's very very flavorful I'm pretty sure I probably won't be able to run another juice in this coil I'm gonna try by the way I guess I should have said I got it sitting at 0.15 ohm coil and the vaporizer revenger kit with the NRG tank vaping at 70 watts right now with this but uh yes I would say if you're a green apple Fanning you like sour then I really think they're absolutely love this because it's definitely packs a lot of flavor to it you can definitely say that they're you know buddy gonna say you ain't getting no flavor out of this because you're getting a ton of flavor out of it but will i order it again now because it's not for me it's I don't know I like I like apples and I like sour maybe it's just the the combination of them both there I guess I don't know but there's something about it that doesn't agree with me is it a baddy juice no I won't say it's bad vapor will definitely make the bowl cause I've been vaping on it but yeah I don't know what it is but the price is definitely good 8-bit calm guys if you're interested in this again 60 ml bottles for 10 dollars and 90 cents couple bucks more you can get a hundred mil bottle alright right there maybe call that's what I mean sometimes I'm good other times it just chokes me up for something I don't know why but anyway guys that's about all I got to say this is bazooka vape sour apple sour straws alright guys thanks for watching and I will see you in the next review [Music] you [Music]", "BCZcESDfgbQ": "that's not usually a brother knife yeah i can't wait to see it what i see apple pie pumpkin pie and smear lollipops i can't wait to eat all of this uh i don't know which one is this

"1PTvRxfVKKE": "[Music] hi guys and welcome back to my channel so today he is gonna be a voiceover because I'm calm at feeling my hair today so right now you see me porn in very blue gelatin that I got from Kerrville you can use any jello this is what I had in my pantry so you're gonna go ahead and pour it into your pot you can also pop this in the microwave and just pour it on a cup if you're in a rush so right now just pour it in and that cuz I'm going to get two packets of gelatin and pouring in my pie also if you're putting is microwave you can do it the same way you can just use a measuring cup or a regular cup so right now I'm just pouring in my packets of gelatin you can use 3 if you want to be more firm next I'm adding a cup of water and HR that painting so you can add more and sages make sure you add another packet of gelatin so it could be firm and not you know mushy negative you're gonna do is you're gonna turn your stove on to medium heat and basically you're gonna store every store ha you're gonna stir everything together until you know all the clumps from the gelatin and the jello is mixed and melted together so right now you just see me stirring it around and so it's nuts together you can also you know put this in the microwave I keep stressing the microwave because I used to salt on that dish out you could just put it in the measuring cup in a microwave for like 2 minutes and you're done but make sure you watch it because if you don't watch it it's gonna bubble up and you're gonna have jello everywhere so yeah right now you just see me stirring it together and you can see everything is starting to melt like how I like it so next I'm going to add a teaspoon of Hennessy right now I'm just stirring it together you know how you make noodles and like it's not coming to a boil but it's not cold anymore that's where you wanna you know start stirring it a little bit more and putting that extra shot at Hanasi in there because sometimes when you're cooking it it can I guess burn out if you want to use I'm Anna use noodles but I'm black Gardens there I'm talking about so right now I'm stirring it and about to put it in my measuring cup this helps me pour it in and not spill it everywhere got my stove looks so dirty but I don't care you're probably like why are you mentioning your stove but YouTube trolls be on it and I just want to let you I know I had cooked a whole meal for me and my fiance and it kind of got messed up it messed up the whole kitchen but it's okay I'm gonna clean up after this video so right now you just see me pouring in the gelatin and after you pour it in you're gonna let it cool for ten minutes you're gonna see me motion in ten minutes and the reason why are you gonna let it cool for ten minutes so it won't spill when you put in the frigerator after it cooled down place in the fridge for ten more so after you take it out the fridge it's gonna be easy to pop out so this way it looks like it's all pretty and whatnot so right now I'm just popping out all about a little blue hearts you know that's a gang all that you know oh no I'd be saying I'm on voiceover done by me so right now like I said I'm just placing it on my plate to make it look pretty excuse that blue stain I made a drink like three weeks ago and I cannot get it out if you guys have any tips on how to get like food coloring off of your tables and shelves and stuff please let me know so right now you just see me showing off my little beautiful creation and next I'm going to add some sugar on top or you can add some citric acid that's what I used to add sorry now I'm just adding sugar to make it look pretty and there you have it some infuse gummies thank you guys for watching make sure you like subscribe to my channel bye", "dNfrNTZ5Sz8": "[Music] okay today we're here to review these uh three um they're kind of unusual jelly beans they're flavored like uh normal candies so this is jolly rancher uh jelly beans this one's sour patch kids jelly beans this one is nerds jelly beans let's try this one first this is jolly ranchers i'm not sure if they're the different foods will taste differently really for original flavors this is a purple one red pink orange green purple light blue i think nope i think they do taste all the flavors taste different i mean the colors taste like the flavors and they're all colored like the outsiders colors like the inside not quite as um um the flavors are not quite as prominent as like the jolly rancher flavors but they're pretty close [Applause] actually as you chewing more the flavor comes out more this one's supposed to have five flavors let's see one two three four five so there's red yellow orange green and blue blue raspberry you gotta get past the sugar first and then the sour comes in that one was a lime one that one wasn't as bad as the blue one was red one's pretty sour too that was red berry orange is not as bad [Applause] nothing's not as bad either no they're stuck twicky [Applause] okay these are nerds big chewy nerds let's see only three colors nope that's the same thing i think there's only three colors all right orange four cups these are crunchier on the outside i'm trying to remember what things did i used to eat them all the time what was that one the red one was a little sour yellow's a little sour too nerds are a little sour so yeah these are a little sour these are more sour because they are sour patch kids and then these are just kind of a normal rancher type flavors [Applause] and each of the colors are different flavors so it's not like i don't know you probably could just grab a handful and stick it in your mouth they're they're not that weird flavor is not like uh jelly bellies or sometimes you can get some weird flavors in there but yeah these are all good if you're kind of tired of all the the normal jelly beans where they all taste the same every color tastes the same try getting these instead because they're different and i bought these probably actually i think two of them i bought at uh five below i don't remember which two and then the other one i bought at i think target or something so if you find them they're probably only here for easter so get them all you can or wait till after easter and get them for 75 off so anyways let me take another break with this one i like the sour ones and i'll see you in the next one", "gsp17MQ6yqU": "[Music] the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "WbB_dZb1IWs": "[Music] okay you got your apple what do you do with it now well here's an idea you can make them into a caramel apple these things are gobbled up all year long but for some reason they're even more popular around halloween so let's go behind the scenes to watch as apple experts turn this into this we all know an apple a day keeps the doctor away but hey no one said it couldn't be a caramel apple right these fruity treats are the perfect combination of healthy snack and decadent dessert all ready to eat on a neat little stick there's some arguments over the history of caramel apples but some would argue that chicago is the caramel apple capital of the world well then let's head to the windy city to take a look at how these snacks get from tree to treat affy tapple of chicago makes millions of taffy apples each year it all starts with the apples themselves the best apples to use for caramel apples are a nice sweet tart and firm apple the ones we use the most of are granny smith and jonathan apples the apples are unpacked inspected and any bad apples are picked out the reject apples actually go to a local juicer who creates apple juice out of them then things get a little sticky the apples are picked off the conveyor belt carefully centered and then a stick is inserted through the core this part is a little tricky so it's done by highly trained apple sticking experts an apple is a product of nature and it's not a perfect sphere so in order to really make the best caramel apple you need to put the stick directly through the core next the perfectly speared spheres are slotted onto this special machine that takes them for a ferrous wheel-like ride to the dipping area the apples dive into a pool of hot gooey caramel but it's not the common kind you'd buy at the store some people think that we have people sitting in the back unwrapping wrappers and throwing little pieces of caramel melting them that's absolutely not true instead aphey tapple makes up big batches of its own special caramel coating we have a secret recipe that we've used for 50 years we we have not tweaked it but sorry we can't reveal exactly what that recipe is it's a secret there is some secret stuff but the basic ingredients are corn syrup milk and sugar mix together and heat it up the apples dive into the caramel dip and then are twirled around to shake off the excess after the apples do their dip they are wheeled around a tray of peanuts so that every side is consistently coated workers give the apples a final look over at this point hand dipping any that are maybe a little nude into the nuts so they're completely covered then it's off to the packaging area where each apple goes into its own little plastic pack the demand for the apples peaks in summer and fall as caramel apples are sold as both carnival treats and halloween goodies on a busy day affytaple can turn out a quarter of a million apples over the course of a year we'll run in excess of 11 12 million apples and there's even times where we tap out a lot of the orchards in different parts of the country and america's craving for these caramel treats is growing caramel apples as a business have grown every year over the last 10 years while some of the other candies have actually dropped and decreased part of their popularity is that they are seen as both yummy and healthy kids love it and parents love it for kids because it's a fresh apple it's a good healthy snack not just a fun carnival item caramel apples can also be made at home if you don't want the factory having all the fun and what about caramel apple's close cousin the candy apple well that's a whole different thing made with hard sugar on the outside to give a crunchy not chewy coating candy apples are traditionally on the east coast and on the west coast because caramel apples got their start here in the midwest you really don't see candy apples too often anywhere in this area so don't expect anyone at affy tapple to help you make those you", "Dc3HLWXnjLg": "[Music] rock and roll bye bye",

hit that occupation bill so that you're notified whatever I didn't drop but right now I will leave all of these on this channel and eventually ever use them to their own channel anything that I have to school related here so yes today is the pocket infuse and I have very detailed notes here so that I can give you guys a full tutorial most orioles do have a list of the ingredients for use and how to do it but none of them really goes into depth and explain why you do and why you use what you use but if there is something that's not covered you didn't understand or you have any questions please feel free to drop those in the comments also share like this video and all that great stuff also if you want to see my creations you can tune in to my Instagram at Styles for days and check me out over there so let's get into this recipe I'm going to go over everything that you need first so the recipe calls for four to six cups of popcorn so this is for crepes and this is another two cups and I also always have an extra amount of popcorn because popcorn pops to different sizes and you don't want to waste your syrup and you know wears products so always have extra and we'll get into why when we get into the mixing part that's why you what but sometimes you may have a little more syrup than you do popcorn because if you have popcorn pop some different sizes so we have that then we have two cups of sugar which is here and this is regular granulated sugar it's not a specific blank sugar is sugar the only time it gets tricky as if it needs to be confectioner sugar or certain different granules that's the only thing that really matters and yes that it is true that more expensive brands they are more expensive because some of them are a little more refined in their process is a little a little better than just you know like regular sugar but you don't need to worry about what brand it is okay so we have the two tablespoons of butter here and if you see me looking to the scientist assigned another but the to several schools of butter this is unsalted and the reason why this has been salted is because of my popcorn has natural its natural with sea salt added so I didn't want to make it too salty salty and overpower whatever we're going for so that's why it's unsalted however if you pop your own popcorn and it doesn't have any salt or anything like that and it's not butter then feel free to use toxic butter and it does not have to be low temperature the only time room-temperature butter comes into play is when you're doing it for like butter beans and icings in case that's when it becomes critical to know which which butter you want to use and how soft or if it's room temperature or respect for the frigerator but in this case it doesn't matter because we're going to heat it up into the syrup anyways so then we have the 1/4 cup of vodka which is it we're using this one which is the summer wine I'm going by there's a really good watermelon flavor by the way and then 1/2 cup of the corn syrup which is here and then also a half a gram of flavoring this bottle is considered a dram and a dram is 3.7 milliliters or what 1 to 5 pulip ounces and I have it turned backwards for the flavor is watermelon so that it can help illuminate the watermelon flavor of the bucket so only 1/2 the DRAM which is a half a bottle of that and I don't know the exact measurements I can't do that for you guys that maybe put that down in the description but I just I've done this for so long just kind of eyeball it so my apologies for that but just a half a dram then also you need a 1/2 teaspoon of food coloring you may need more or less enough depending on how since you want the color and also just a word to the wise which I have red to match the fleur-de-lis a word to the wise is when you do use like dark colors or colors that you want to stand a pop out add white food colouring in first and it's generally sold everywhere I've even seen it in raw but use white food colouring and then add your color and it'll make the color pop and stand out so that's how we get the big bright bold colors we start with the way and then we have in our colors awesome just to go back to the flavouring I did what I want you you know that I'm using again the watermelon cuz this is watermelon but I've also done a pina colada popcorn which is a coconut flavoring mixed with the pineapple flavor and then use one of the Amsterdam's either was coconut vodka so just use whatever flavored that matches with whatever you're trying to get because you can either just use plain vodka and then add your own flavoring so it doesn't have to be a flavored vodka I just wanted to mention that too it could just be a plain one but in the event that you do use alcohol that is not flavor you can use the whole [ __ ] so if it is a non flavor alcohol or vodka use the whole bottle not just happy no reason why we use in happen because to give this type of flavor in it and so that's pretty much for the ingredients now what I do have here is you'll need a rather large bowl I have a wood spoon and it doesn't matter in the material I've used them all I've used metal bowls I've used plastic balls I've used metal utensils with utensils and plastic utensil this is just one of my favorite and I just prefer wood utensils which I'm a lot of candy makers actually say that using wood is better anyways but if you want to use the metal bowl that's fine too metal disc holds temperatures so when you pour the syrup it it'll be kind of warm which is a benefit slightly because in the candy doesn't cure that's quickly and it gives you a chance to really get it all mixed in a coating but it does not matter what you use then also you will need a medium saucepan which this is what I have and you can see it doesn't matter this either it doesn't matter if it's nonstick steel or even copper that doesn't matter either and I want you guys to know that I don't have we'll get into that later also we have wax papers you need this to mind your cookie sheets and I have these as storage options and these are fellow bags disposable cell bags and fill these at Walmart comes with 20 but that's just a plain back then also I have these season-ending right now and these are like a flat shape settle back and these come fifty to account for only four bucks at Hobby Lobby and no this is nicer than anything if you're watching my blog shows then I have this 2 quart canister which is also from Walmart and no I did not so this is an option and then also I just found this which is a gallon option so yeah you have a bunch of different stuff you can use and I also wanted to let you guys in on a little secret of mine there are cookie sheets and most of those people buying new I like to use these are oven rack liners you actually can buy these the place on the bottom of your oven to catch anything that falls them in they're disposable because they're aluminum which means you can throw them out and they're recyclable this again they're aluminum but if you notice these are huge when we come back after I go ahead and Stephanie to set everything up I'll get one of my regular sized cookie sheet and show you what the difference is but because it is meant to fill up the whole bottom of your oven it gives you a lot more space to work in so I like using these even when I'm doing my treats to set my treat because I can just put more on there and then like I said I think it bent and flexed and stuff like that and then I could just respect and buy more there only $3.00 you get a 2-pack and I usually use these I don't know a multitude of time and I always align them with parchment paper or wax paper stuff like that so yeah they're very durable and they last for several several times but so anyways I am going to go ahead and pause this here if you are following along with this is your Indians ingredients you can pop it here and then what I'm going to do is remove my ingredients over here the sole and get all that stuff and I will be right back but the ingredient we need to take with you is sugar the corn syrup the vodka the flavoring the color and the butter the only thing that you don't need at the stove is your popcorn and we're going to tell you what to do with that everything over there so what we're gonna do now is take one of those baking sheet - I've shown you take the popcorn spread it out spread it out easily and I'm doing the four cup and the two cups because like I said I always have extra just in case you have more of a syrup leftover so then what I'm going to do is place this in my oven you can turn your oven on to 200 and the purpose of this is to warm up your popcorn and the reason why you want to keep the popcorn warm and if you just popped it still put in the other [ __ ] stay warm but the reason is when you put your candy mixture on here you one you don't want it to start seizing up really quickly because the popcorn is cold or you know not at room temperature so gives you time to saw the syrup in so I'm gonna do that and then I'm you guys can meet me over at the stove for the next step okay as you notice I have gloves no not for a real particular reason because I will be physically touching anything is just a pet peeve of mine that I use gloves especially when I'm working with orders and stuff like that for sanitary purposes and Here I am in order to get your license to be able to cook in the home you have to go through a health environmental class and so they teach you things but I'm just a journaling in general like I'm a kind of one that wipes down knobs and everything like that so I always have boxes and boxes of gloves I don't even touch the meat with my hands I use gloves so that's why you see these so it's your preference but it's just something I do so then I have my um this I guess this would be like a spatula little spatula that I'm going to be using nothing is on yet and then I have the part that I've shown you guys this is so simple you guys there's nothing to this very major all you're gonna do is pour your sugar in I just tap it to make sure I'm getting all my ingredients you pour your corn syrup in and there's no real real reason that's why I'm putting this in any type of particular way I just have my lovely assistant hand me a special everything a lot of people don't realize but when you don't get all of your ingredients that you've mentioned out you're actually altering the recipe so for some of you who do follow a lot of these tutorials online your life but I did everything and it still came out wrong or something it could be even slight things like this you know like not getting every last bit of your ingredient they can really alter a recipe so also I do know that corn syrup is a very thick so it's always like a residual amount that you really can't scrape all the way out so I always put just a tip bit more so that I get my whole amount that's required for the recipe so did you take your vodka and you pour that in and it smells really good guys then your so that's all your ingredients the only thing that you have left to worry about is flavoring and color and so you turn this on to a medium heat medium it doesn't need to be high but medium and then we're just going to stir this until it starts to boil so at this point you guys I'm just gonna stir this as it boil what you guys will see it's a fed-up version of it until it gets to the next stage and then I got I will be queued back in but yeah so this is just stirring it until it liquefies and oil and again it's no real reason why I put things in in the order I did it doesn't matter how you do just it's a one pot thing so just put everything in there you okay as you guys can see it's boiling now and so what we will do at this point is just set your timer for five minutes and then let it just boil again this is the part where you may wonder well there's no thirst that how will we know what temperature that it is well all we're trying to do really is just allow enough time for the mixtures to all incorporate so this is not a candida situation where we're trying to make it hard as well so when you're doing candy apples and things like that of course you want things to be at a hard crack stage another various type of candies you want at different temperatures to get the type of texture you're going for but in this case we're just simply boiling this for five minutes in order to get all the ingredients incorporated and get the sugar broken down from the granulated state into a smooth syrup and so that usually happens with sugar when he gets to the five-minute mark everything should be completely smooth and it'll be clear liquid so at this point you guys I'm just going to pause here and roll for my voice anyway and then I'm going to speed this process up so that you guys can see how this goes so if it's looking really bubbly like this this is completely normal and this is what you want and if it's not bubbling up as much then your temperature could be a little down on your stove eyes so you can turn it up a little bit just to get it to this rolling boil state and you don't have to worry about stirring this because as with sugar cookies cheating on sugar cookies in my bad guys candy apples you don't stir sugar does not burn in sports until it gets to a certain temperature and we won't even touch that temperature here so you have to worry about the only thing that you stir continually and that will be on another tutorial is the brown sugar syrups they will burn and scorch and stick to the bottom and that is because of an ingredient in that and we will get into that on another tutorial but you don't have to stir this you can just let it ride okay so we're back and I have turned off the heat so there's no heat and what you're doing is waiting for the bubbling to subside so I'm going to remove it from the stove sitting here on my trivet and then you want these to be completely stopped before you add other ingredients because candy is very temperamental or syrup it's very temperamental and it can bubble and it can boil over or blow over and then that makes for a very dangerous situation because if this gets on you you can get very bad burns because one of the main things is it's candy so it's not something you can blow and cool off it takes a while for teddy to slow down and cool off so we have our here's where we'll you see it's not bubbling anymore and it's slowly subsiding I did kind of I'll just do this like this but you guys can see that it is clear under here so there is no sugar granules those are just bubbles and as you can see as I'm moving it you see how it is bubbling and boiling back up that's why you want to the bubbling to subside before you start messing with it but I'm going to go ahead now at this point which for most of you if you're not comfortable you can wait until this is completely gone I mean you'll just see the clear liquid that I pulled back for you to see and then you can add the rest of your stuff but here this is what I'm going to add my half a dram and I'm measuring it by eye okay that's my half a dram of a watermelon flavoring and then I'm going to add my food coloring I bought a teaspoon of it and then we're just gonna stir and mix this all in by the way you can either put your flavoring in mix it in stir it and then put your color in and mix it in stir it me I'm just doing it all together because it doesn't make a difference it doesn't change a consistency it's no real reason to that so it's up to you if you want to do it together or you want to do them individually that's completely your call and then as you can see that it did kind of smoke up a bit and that's fine that's just the ingredients marrying together and nothing to be alarmed about and as you can see the teaspoon of the red food coloring which this is a gel I don't use liquid liquid takes more inky so I use the gel as you can see it has a really good red color to it all the bubbling has subsided and now you guys you have syrup you have vodka infused syrup by the way this does not work on apples and other things because it is not at the hard crack stage which is the 300 degree temp so little not sticking home this is just simply for this kind of method it will not form hard enough for suckers either so again this is just for sur purposes not for candy so the popcorn that we've had in the oven warming up this whole time I'm going to grab that leave this here for a moment and then I'm going to grab my popcorn okay this pan is out the oven and I'm touching it so it's never intended to go in there [Music] I'm going to take my popcorn and pour it all into my bowl and again this is the whole six cups you guys start with the four cups and then add the two cups I'm doing this because again I kind of can I'm all these things at this point but start with the four then do this next step of mixing and then see if you need to add more [Music] we need that to coat our baking sheet it was usually I will use the baking sheet that I just had the popcorn on and just throw this up one here but for tiny purposes and because I'm using this huge one two pieces the reason for this is because you don't want the popcorn to stick to the actual pan so now we're going to grab the candy the syrup and I'm going to just pour this all over the popcorn don't be afraid you guys gonna be afraid and I didn't pour all the syrup yet because I like to mix it in a little bit there bad boy but don't be afraid that it's going to make your popcorn soggy it's not so now you just stir and you mix and so everything is completely coated you just stir in you mix and you stir and you and so I'd be telling the rest of my my syrup so I'm just gonna come back over here and then I'm going to scrape the rest out of the pot and then I'm going to mix it all in you do want to work fast because time minutes of an essence it can sit but you don't have to work so fast that you're crushing the popcorn trying to to get it all mixed in it's completely okay and then if you want to stop and take some out that are completely coated to give ourselves more room because maybe you don't have a big enough mixing bowl then you can always stop you know right here in the process and take some of the popcorn out and go ahead and lay it on the cookie sheet but again I'm can kind of eyeball these things and I just kind of like to do it all at once you guys will come to see I'm Michael one pot person let's just get it all done and so as you can see with the recipe that I gave you and popcorn that I had the six cups of popcorn was pretty sufficient there is a few little popcorns that may not have a hundred percent coverage this is not a perfect science but this is fine and I'm comfortable with it and you see it's like a big clump don't worry you still have a little bit of time so now just pop it all down on your cookie sheet and then at this time the the syrup has cooled now so you can't touch it it's not so hot that it's going to burn you so now what you're doing is just spreading this all out laying it flat evenly over the whole cookie sheet you want a flat and even as possible but if not that's fine because you're gonna break these apart anyways so then I'm going to take this and place this back in my oven that is still at 200 from 5 to 10 minutes so 5 to 10 minutes but you're gonna be checking it as you can see it's really really glossy it's really glossy and you can tell when it's getting to the done part because it won't be as glossy what we're doing is putting in the oven so that it can dry it outside and bring that back popcorn punch so that's the purpose of the oven and again you can see it's really really shiny right now and then I'll show you in the oven when you're done how it won't be as shiny and that's one of the ways you can tell again don't do ours or worry if it's in clumps and stuff cuz you're gonna break this apart anyways they do not have that extra glossy Sheen which means if they're driving they're pretty much ready but they still really work so I like to allow miles to cool all the way off and then it'll allow them to get a little more little more firmer but I did just want to like pick some up I don't know if you guys can hear this but as you can hear they are hard and then once I let this cool cool song I will actually like crunch into some so you can see how there's talent that I'm going to package them all I think this is enough to fit into the gallon size but I'm just gonna put it in here anyway so I'll be back with that momentarily okay you guys so I'm back it's cooled off as you can see it's a breast apart you hated crunchy like pok\u00e9mon would be so how you do just kill this little wax off this shouldn't stick they won't break into little fumbles and stuff like that so but I'm just going to sports a story over get you guys going so you can enjoy this at your next event or if you're providing these to people but here are still now just a bunch of breaking it up and putting it into the container again if you were able to lay all your popcorn out individually then you shouldn't have to break it up so much and this stuff back here doesn't have anything to do with this I'm doing the order for a gender-reveal that's the best boy so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and continue doing this and then I will be right back with the review okay and so in review I have my notes here so this is how much that back yielded I can probably fit to another cuff in here to bring it all the way up but yeah so I got just about a gallon sized container um this is how I sell it and a label on there and it basically says at the bottom made from for the grown and mature just so people are reminded these are not for kids it does have alcohol it is an ingredient you can see I did a red and green to symbolize a watermelon so my point of that to get this green is that I had to use the white first the white before first then I added the green to make the green stand out in his bowl so in review as you guys know this there was no thermometer needed because why we're not trying to make candy we were making syrup so we weren't even reaching those temperatures to need a thermometer have I ever used one absolutely not has the serving up King out correctly he's gonna use one no problems it's always been the same consistent always have a little extra popcorn because popcorn comes in various shapes and sizes therefore you want to yield the most and not waste your syrup so always have more popcorn if you want you go ahead get two trays we warmed up just in case as you guys seen if I went along with the original four cup I'm gonna have more surplice but I added in the whole six cups and that's what produce this amount so always have extra on standby anymore aw stop the pack the bowl even the utensils that you used does not matter and will not vary your results whether it's aluminum plastic copper nonstick t no it doesn't matter it will the same results only thing I will say is that aluminium it holds heat as far as your mixing bowl so so it'll give you a little more time to mix but it doesn't make like a huge noticeable difference I just got from experience that using the metal bowls they used it they conduct heat so you can keep things warmer just a little bit longer not warm like heat and then also when you're using it for mixing icings and things like that you can put them in the freezer and they'll be super really cold and chilled to try to pour like them like a whip like a would I say now say so yeah any new also you can keep this for like a week that's depending on packaging I don't know if it lasts longer because I never have tried it I make these things I personally don't drink so this is not nothing iron gold handle consuming so I'm usually making them and giving them out so people usually buy them to eat them right then so I just know from experience that it'll be about it week I did keep this one for reference I made this about matte effect on Mother's Day so I think there has been two weeks now so you can hear and then when I did bite into it it is not as crunchy this what is still very flavorful and it's not still so that's the difference this is about a couple of weeks out I know that it's not a little bit longer and I know that this can last for a week and again that's depending on packaging also you can use any pocket so I'm going to ask can you use anything else any pocket you can use I have not tried any other type of clear liquors but I tried the different pockets so you're very well open to do that just remembers this recipe calls for watermelon because we were going for the watermelon stir up whatever flavor vodka you use remember to use that same flavoring or also if you don't want to use a flavorful pocket but you just want to use a certain specific pocket like velvety or anything like that but you want it to have a flavor you can go ahead and do that as well pick any flavor you like or you don't have to add any flavor what that would taste like is basically like the sugar-coated popcorn it just won't have a taste it'll be sweet like sugar but it won't have like a real flavor more like a candy apple flavor is what it would have so if you guys remember how that tastes that's the kind of flavor and a half and then as far as the color go I said half a teaspoon but do that by eye if you feel like you want your colors a little bolder and more as you want them to stick out at the white don't forget to add the way also you can make this non-alcoholic take off the 1/4 cup of the vodka and add 1/2 cup of water and then any color you want and there is the non-alcoholic version which I made for the kids bubblegum flavor watermelon flavor kind of candy flavor all of those so yeah if you want to do it that way you're not an alcoholic you can not just for kids there's some of us adults it though alcohol so yeah everything does the alcohol cookout no it does not this is not the same as making like a steak or something on the sole where you have alcohol because if you notice when you're cooking with the alcohol and those type of um recipes you burn off the alcohol that's what the bluish color flame that comes over the food is you're burning the alcohol portion of that liquid off in this case you did not see that so no it does not burn off it is infuse it is an ingredient in the cops'll so that's why I put made for growing in the chart only so that concludes our tutorial and yes don't forget to Like and subscribe I do have this tutorial currently for sale I will release it eventually to the public so that's why I'm telling you guys to tune in and subscribe I also put all my links and stuff like that below or somewhere on the screen I'm still figuring out the ending so excuse me on

bye bye friends", "3NLn-IEFGNE": "I get to make a melody with my melody pops watch the rest of the video so he can learn more about this camp you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey its Lucky Penny shop and I made a totally different angle than I normally am because this hopefully was going to be the thumbnail so a lot of times we have to set them up and snap a quick picture before the video before I actually open them up and destroy them so let me zoom out a little bit cuz normally I would not be that way and that close these are the chupa chupa chups chupa chups melody pops i'm not sure what that is to be honest with you I see strawberry flavored that is a weird angle isn't it hold on a second I'm almost straight down this is all I would normally start a video so I can hold him up like that to you all right let's see who can read this I can't there's tons of information here and I can't die I don't know it's just such tiny tiny print and the camera will only focus so well on this tiny print then enough for you to help me out I just want to make a whistle that's all okay just want to whistle I feel like whistling with my whistle pop all right so the first layer has been removed from my whistle pop and now there's a second layer now my whistle pop appears to have a crack so let's see hopefully that's why we have to just in case Shh not a very good whistle on that one hopefully this one's not cracked and this isn't our first whistle tinea think we've gone 3 or 4 leavin at the maker lever there make it I used rules of it this one's not cracked so let's see Shh much better now this one said strawberry - so now I'm thoroughly confused because color wise I see two completely different colors again let's try the broken one Shh got a leak and the good one so it works pretty good oh yeah was the tooth sweet maker that we did I'm gonna just give it a taste maybe I can put it back together it almost has like a waxy coating on it Shh a little better hold on trying to fill in the gap Shh yeah it is a straw strawberry flavor and it's tasty it's good it's nice that you can whistle but you know of course if they're broke you're not gonna get a good whistle let's see if I can open this up a little bit better here while we we gotta look all at writing here look at how tiny that writing is I can't make out really any words there okay basically this will help something let's see if I could read any of this now this looks like chupa chups chupa chups chupa c hup ACH i ok nothing there helps me UK IC UK strawberry flavor lollipop ingredients ok so I can read that well it's tasty it works when it's not cracked so you can see the kind of design hole here and then travels through this and then out this area there's no other holes that I see anywhere unless the lollipop handle itself is a solid plastic so it's not used for thee noise oh wait it does look like it goes all the way through so I'm guessing then I'm not sure if it stops it or what hard to see inside hold on yeah I don't feel any air coming out of the side that's pretty secure so that's it that's all I can tell you and if you like this kind of stuff candy and related products look at the description for a playlist or search our chilli it's a melody pops in strawberry and look how happy that pop is singing and whistling and having a great time and thanks for

Woah, dude! This sh*t is crazy! What up, Internet? Corinne here, and you're watching Corinne vs The Galaxy! Yes! Today, I'm trying a project that's been suggested a gazillion times. The galaxy lollipops. \"Stuttering Noise\" Hold on. Let me fix this real quick. *Banging Noise* Phew! That should do it! Are you ready for blastoff? Let's get started, shall we? *Engine Noise* *Cartoonish Sound Effects with Darth Vader's Breathing* This video posted by 10 Minute Crafts, makes it look pretty easy. So, I'm gonna follow their instructions and dive right in. The first thing we have to do, is crush some Jolly Ranchers. F*** yes! This is a major stress reliever right here! *Clanging Noise* Actually, this is pretty damn hard. Some of these little suckers do not want to break. Oh, yes. A mallet. *laughs* This definitely works a lot better. This process alone took me more than thirty minutes. So you're a f***ing lie, 10 Minute Crafts. A lie! Also, what the f*** are these things? This is not Jolly Rancher. And it seems pretty important for the final outcome because of the white. No mention of this candy anywhere. What is this candy? Ugh, now I'm gonna have to go to the store, and find some stuff that will work. Yes! Candy melts! That's the ticket! Okay. Now we just separate our candies, into little sections on this lollipop mold thing. But, *laughs*, they're all stuck together now. Yeah, I just have to chisel it out here, I guess. Alright, now separating the candies into the lollipop mold thingy. And then adding some of the white candy melt pieces. Wait, does this go in the microwave or the oven? Rob said to try the microwave. Don't know why I'm listening to him, but we're gonna do it. Yeah, this doesn't really fit in here. The little spinny plate can't really spin. And only half of them are heating up. So, that's a no. Great, now we know. That's why this show exists. Isn't it awesome? Okay. Let's try the oven, then. Wait, maybe this is good? Maybe if I mix things around a little bit? Sure, okay. Yeah, I don't know. The candy melts seem a little curdlely? I guess that can represent some star clusters? Yes. We have to let those cool and prepare our sugar mixture. Just add in sugar, water and corn syrup. So now you're supposed to cook that until it reaches 300 degrees. To be honest, this takes a while. Once you reached burning stage, you're getting pretty close. Actually, I don't know. This kinda looks pretty yellow. But little things like that wouldn't stop God. Right? God? Are you out there? Can anyone hear me? Yeah, now you have to pour your melted sugar solution, into a measuring cup. And then pour that, into one side of a cake pop mold. Now we're supposed to sprinkle some edible glitter, on top of there. To create some cosmic star dust. Yeah, that's that star stuff. Maybe I'm God. *MWAHAHAHAH* The power's in my hands! Then you're supposed to place your colored piece, good side down. Into the melty sugar substance. Now if you're smart, you'll already know that this sh*t is really hot. And it's probably best that you don't try to touch it with your bare human flesh. F*cking dumb-dumb! This sh*t burnt my finger and it hurts like a mofo! F***! *Sigh* Okay, now we have to let this cool. Great. I guess they look okay? You know what, I still have faith. You just have to melt some grape Jolly Ranchers, in the cake pop mold, which is easy enough. And then add a lollipop stick to each one, like this. And place the other piece on top! This is a little bit of a messy process, so be patient. Um, okay. I think these are gonna work. But this, this is when the real magic is supposed to happen. Got my blow dryer and here we go. The big reveal. Yeah, this is definitely not what I was expecting. I mean, I guess if you want to keep things positive, it kind of looks like Mars? Which is in a galaxy, I guess? *SIGH* Okay, um, we obviously need to try this again. And I'm thinking we need this candy. Right here. Actually, you know what? It kinda looks like one of those candy sticks that the Cracker Barrel sells. Okay, Cracker Barrel, here we come. Ooh, I wanna play checkers. You go first. Random person: Oh. they're here. Fine, I'm gonna leave now. Bye. Ooh. *Laughs* Look, here's me. Triggered. Mhhhh. Rob: Oh, Jesus. Corinne: It's the peacock section. Do you need anything from the peacock section? \nRob: *laughs* There's no black and white ones but I think these should work. Sour green apple. That's a big bag. That's heavy. Can you get this for me? All righty. Here we go again. Luckily, I also got some of these peppermint because these ones are mostly white. And the sour apple ones are mostly green and that is not what we were going for. Why you gotta let me down, sour apple? I thought we were friends. The only problem I foresee is that the lollipop is gonna taste like peppermint now. But honestly, that doesn't really matter to me because I don't plan on letting anyone eat any of these. Yeah, okay, here we go. I'm just randomly adding all the different colors to my lollipop mold. And you know what? I'm feeling really good about this round. Into the oven, we go. These are already looking better. Not all curdlely and what not. Let me get them a little mixing. I think we got something here, kids. Now time to retry the sugar-water-corn syrup situation again. And I think this is also looking a lot better. Meanwhile..Yeah, um, my measuring cup is currently occupied. So I'm just gonna use this other little vessel here. And yeah, sure. Now we pour this into our cake pop mold again and let it cool for a bit. Now I'm just adding my cosmic star dust and my galaxy disks. And now we wait. For like six days or something. Let it marinate. Now that shit didn't take billions of years. It only took six days and only rest on the seventh. Yes. Alright, we're just gonna pop these suckers right out of there, and I'm thinking it's looking pretty good. Not as yellow as the other ones, so that's a good sign. Now we melt the grape again. Hehe. Add our lollipop sticks which I was much more organised about this time. And then just stick our other half in there. I think my grape was a little too hot. When I did it this time, because things started spreading out a little more than they did previously. Also, this made it a lot more clear without the need of the blow dryer. So I'm gonna go ahead and say this was intentional. They look pretty dang cool. I actually did hit them up with the blow dryer a little bit and this just brought them to a whole other level. It's honestly quite the process, though, so you want to be a little careful. Those people, they can shove their ten minutes right up their ass. Right down their black hole. No? Too far? Okay. To keep it 100 with you, I would probably rethink some of the color combos if I were ever to do this again, But since I'm planning to never, ever do this again, I think they look f***ing great. Really like this one, but this one is my favorite. I mean, all of them are pretty cool and kind of out of this world. From this moment on, you can now refer to me as the Galaxy Queen. I'll also respond to Guardian Of The Galaxies. Yes, here I am, your new galaxy queen! As the official galaxy queen, I control all existence, and am the knower of all things. For instance, here, in this galaxy, there's a planet called Catdor. Home to the giant fire-breathing cat dragons. There's not many a space traveler who had found their way here and lived to tell the tale. Except for Pete, Pete's a crazy motherf***er. And see this galaxy? This galaxy here actually contains the planet Earth. And you know Earth can be pretty cool? But, there's some f*cked up sh*t going on there right now. Actually, you know what? We're just gonna burn this sh*t to the ground and start all over again. Well, uh, I guess that's it for this video. Um, doesn't really matter if you subscribe or like it up and I probably won't see you next time. Computer, set a course for deep space nine. And computer, turn up the space jams. *lit af techno music*", "nO3AHLrKq8Q": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] violence [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so she comes quickly the doctor came with his bag on the door [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] this is why the color white why-why-why this is Mike", "oONRHdBHFfY": "hey love Sistani here and today I'm going to be talking to you guys about a new company that I was recently introduced to and all about how it helped me relax more so this company is called diamond CBD and you know a CBD is and you already know what I'm about to talk about my basically CBD is a what is it it's a component that's found in green and that's the component that makes you actually relax and feel better that's than what's actually helping a lot of people with their illnesses and pains and all that stuff so this company actually just done the work to actually take the CBD out of lead and separate it and put it into different products and all of that so you can actually they have a variety of products so depending on what you prefer you can get whatever so I got this candy cuz I'm obsessed with it means like I don't know why lately I'm in love with these rainbow gummy so not even gonna lie to you guys when I first saw this company I thought it was leave like we'd have just food food and I was like don't do drugs I don't know how that's gonna work but but that company like they explained it to me and then they have a video on the front of their site that actually explains all of this so you do not make you high they don't get you high at all you're not going to be like tripping or anything like that they literally just make you relax and feel more I don't know like say you have back pain like I normally no back pain it helped with that if you have issues sleeping if you have just a problem like with anxiety whatever and you just need to be relaxed this is for you it also helps with a bunch of other things okay so you do need to be 21 to use this or to purchase this and so on the front when I got this package I actually did not review this bottom part here I just saw this and then I went straight to the back because I started reading you know the serving size and it said four pieces so I'm like eating eating and I ate three pieces right to eat my fourth and then I see on the front and it says do not exceed more than one to two pieces every six hours so I took three like I said and I'm a small person I'm only buckling and I don't weigh that much like I'm pretty small so I took that and I promise you like the rest of the day and then it was just around around like maybe four or five o'clock for the rest of the day like all the way through the night I was like I don't know I felt so tired and I don't think these are supposed to make me feel sleepy but that's just how I react to a lot of things in general like whether it's alcohol and I've never really I've never done weed so I didn't know that this is how I would react but I just got really sleepy you know supposed to get sleepy per say but and it's got really sleepy like it helps you sleep better but that means that like your body will relax it doesn't make you like sleepy it's not a sleep aid so you're supposed to be able to take these any time of day so I got really really sleepy I wanted took a nap and then just the rest of the night I was like really tired and drowsy but the next day I took the regular dose I just took one piece of candy it's like just to help me relax before bed or whatever and I didn't really feel any more tired because of it but it definitely did help with my back pain and it helped me relax so I will definitely say these work like these are like probably one of my new favorite things because it's natural one and it's just it's just a good alternative to taking pain medication all the time and all of that now I do wish the serving size is a bit more because I like eating candy but I just I just probably need to get it in another form other than candy so they told me they have it they have drops that you can put in stuff they have well so they have they have it in other foods they have they have a bunch of options you just have to go to their website and see and then you can use that to make whatever you want and put it in whatever food or you can take it directly under your tongue whatever you wanna do now these in here it says the serving like if we're going based on what the back says it says serving it's four pieces so there's about two servings in here so if we're going based on the front and there's about four to five start rings in here so I think it's that's great these cost 15 dollars that's before shipping and these cost 15 dollars this back and they have variety of products all different prices if I if you're saying like I can get like maybe five pieces out of this that's pretty good that's actually pretty good and I would definitely get this again I'm probably going to get this again because like I said I do have back issues like I'm spine and stuff and so it did actually help with that a lot I recently got a desktop computer so the flora would often work off my laptop and so I got my desktop and so a lot of times I have to use it because a storage is better and all of that I have to use it sitting at my desk and that is always been an issue for me for years and years and years because I've you know even in high school I was home-schooled and so working at home you know doing my schoolwork I'd have to sit up and then at my desk and all of that it just always been an issue because my back hurts so I prefer to work from my bed if I have to do like you know stuff on my laptop or whatever because it's more comfortable and I can prop up a pillow and all that but yeah so sitting at my desk often time really hurts my back and I don't enjoy it at all like I will do everything I can so that I don't have to work at my desk because it's not the most enjoyable for me but this definitely helps I don't know if I should be taking it every day so I'm not gonna do that but I think it's safe like to you know do it every day it's not gonna be addictive or anything like that but yeah I'm probably gonna use it again and I would suggest that you guys check them out gonna link your website in my description box this is like a really cool product that very happy I was introduced to so make sure you check it out if you have not already make sure you subscribe to my channel and also in the comments let me know

roasting some blueberries in the oven just intensify their flavor and let them release their sweet juices we're then gonna mix that into our lollipop base add a little bit of flavoring and pour them into freeform lollipops and here's how we're gonna make them we're first gonna make our flavoring for these lollipops so I have a hundred and seventy grams of blueberries 28 grams of granulated sugar one tablespoon of freshly squeezed orange juice and a quarter teaspoon of freshly grated orange zest and I put it into a little square pyrex dish you want something that has tall enough sides because we're gonna bake this and so we wanna be able to catch all those juices I'm just gonna stir this around we're gonna bake this in a preheated 375 degree oven just until all the blueberries burst I've just taken the blueberries out of the oven and they have been in there for about 35 minutes they are completely cooked down and the juices are oozing out of them we're gonna take this and carefully because this is still hot we're gonna put it into our blender we're now gonna whiz this up until it's a nice puree we're gonna get our blueberry puree out of our mixer and we will set this aside while we whip up our lollipops to make our lollipop base I have 133 grams of corn syrup already in my saucepan I measured it on my scale directly into the pan it's just because it's so sticky I don't want to waste any of it because you need to be really accurate when you are making candy I'm gonna go ahead and add 200 grams of granulated sugar 75 grams of water I'm gonna go ahead and put this on the stove over medium heat and we're gonna cook this until it reaches 315 degrees while our sugar mixture is on the stove we're gonna prepare our candy making station I have a towel to set the pot on as soon as it comes off the stove I have 20 grams of our roasted blueberries already ready to go in a container I also have one container of blueberry flavoring this is one DRAM I have a spatula because what's gonna happen is we're going to take it off the stove put it on to our towel we're gonna add both of our flavorings and mix it we're then going to pour it into a heatproof jug and then I have two trays I think I might just use one but just in case I need a second one and I have a Silpat mat on mine but you can use parchment paper and set if you like and the reason I'm using my macaron one is because it has circles already on it and it's about the diameter of the lollipop that I want to make we're gonna be making about one and a half inch lollipops I also have my sticks which are four inches ready to go in a little cup on standby once the sugar comes to temperature this is going to happen really fast that way when it's ready to go we can just assemble [Music] we're just gonna set these aside to cool probably for about an hour before taking them off the Mount and enjoying them well that's it for this episode of the gold TSP I hope you guys enjoy my blueberry lollipop give me ideas for any flavors or any other candies you'd like to see me make please leave me a comment down below and I'll do my best to make it happen if you haven't yet subscribe hit that button now and

special Lisa and if you watched my last video then it you should know that we are doing a hat ooh and if you haven't seen it make sure you go check it out in the description box today we are going to be making Jolly Ranchers suckers so the supplies you will need parchment paper [Music] Jolly Ranchers lollipop sticks and and you will need your oven preheated we repeat that 275 degrees also before we get started make sure that you wash your hands Mason has not done that yet so he is going to go and do that okay guys so now we are going to meet one of our pans and our parchment paper and some of our zombie manager if you can do five Jolly Ranchers for supper or for Jolly Ranchers for a sucker but before we begin you will want to save parchment paper down [Music] [Music] and you will also need some space so for this method you are going to place four Jolly Ranchers or five in a row any way you would like and you will need to make sure that it is pattern colors yeah yeah but we are going to time-lapse the rest of this so you guys can see how some of our patterns and some of our ways of setting in the rows of sausage [Music] alright guys for the stick process you're going to need your stick and one of your suckers so - you're gonna like place this way and you're just gonna start swirling yeah I would twirl it like twice and then just let it sit then you're gonna repeat with all the other suckers it honestly doesn't matter which way you're just [Music] sucker sticks and also make sure you don't burn yourself with the people because it can be really hot [Music] so after this is done you will most likely have a hot pan and I'm taking mine and I'm putting mine out in the garage so this is what some of them should look like this is what they all should look like and I'm going to go take these out and set them in the garage and I'll be back when they are all ready for okay so this is this one is finished I I'm just going to be using most of my suckers [Music] so there's so when you are removing since you have parchment paper you should just be able to put your hands down and just like simply and it smells awesome make it and just carefully remove but they can be sticky and if your retainer my parchment paper [Music] here's what some of my finishing and you should be good to go and enjoy your Java major suckers okay guys so if my names are about maybe two to three minutes maybe even four and this is what they are starting to look like and the bottom ones were just put in like a minute ago so they haven't really melted yet but after this if you are waiting for yours and watching this video you will need the number you will need the number of six that you have suckers I have made ten I think tend to have pretty good mouth and if it's cold outside and then I recommend and plenty outdoors to cool them it's like you can either put them in a freezer or outside to cool so it's your choice but I will be back so much for watching this video special thanks to maze and Lisa for helping me make this video you guys enjoy your Jolly Ranchers suckers and make sure you like this video subscribe to my channel if you're new it make sure the bombing subscribe button is wrong kind of down below if you have to do you suggest a nice and I will see you guys in my next video bye", "7Zq1ZrDpfxc": "hi everyone welcome to djenka toys and crafts today I'm gonna be looking at this make your own glow pops kit it's by Horizon group USA and it includes 5 glow sticks looks pretty cool and so I'm gonna see how this works ok so I opened it up and this is what it came with it has two packages of the lollipop mix one is yellow and one is red and they're actually gummy it says so I don't think they're gonna be hard lollipop so we'll see I kind of thought they're gonna be like hard suckers but I think they're gonna be more like gummy candy and then it came with ten of these lollipop sticks and two of these plastic holders and these are used to hold the glow sticks to make them glow and here is the tray for the mold and there are six different shapes on there and then also the glow sticks are in here so what you'd need to do to get started is have some warm water so I have some warm water here and then I have my mixing container just make it right here and the way you do it is you do two scoops of the mix to two scoops of the water so I think for my first one and it says you can mix them and make different colors or just multicolored ones so um I got this spoon here because I think would be easier to be scooping out the powder and also the water so I'm going to start with this cherry mix I think I will do that's so you can see it and I use this because I think would be easier to pour but actually kind of thick so I'm just gonna scoop it and stick it in this mold here okay so at this point you can decide if you're gonna make a regular lollipop or if you want to try one of the glue ones so I of course want to try one of the glow ones because I think that's gonna be really cool there so if you wanted you to just do a regular you just stick this right in there if you want to do one of the glue ones this is the special glow holder and so you just stick that in here okay guys so bad news here this is what it turned out and it actually turned out really well the gummy pop is is really smooth and it's nice and firm but when I was putting on this glow pop stick I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get it up there high enough and to be in there because you can see on the box here on the picture it has the little circle like right up there and I just couldn't understand because it just kind of popped right in there in the mold I'll show you that again and I was not understand that but anyway they realized that what I did was there are two different sides to the mold so you know you can't change the heart wound to do the glow stick on this side has actual spacing for the glow stick part so you would pop that in there and then the sucker would have been able to overcome fill that part and stayed on so unfortunately I didn't do that quite right but the way that you would use it for the glow is it has this end here and it just has like regular glow sticks you know that you buy like these that you just popped and then they start glowing and you would just do that and I'm not gonna do it right now just because this one was not didn't work out well and you would just stick that in there and it would glow and that would be really cool so the top just fell off of that so now I can show you a little better in fact if I had done it on the right side that this would have been here and the top would have been right inside of my lollipop so that's unfortunate but and the candy part turned out really well and I think it's really cool so I probably I'm not going to do a video on the glow part unless you guys really want me to if I get enough comments below that you actually want me to do another one of these and show you the glow stick part in there then I will do that but otherwise it turned out pretty well and just make sure that you use the right side of the mole so that's it for today thanks so much for watching hope to see you next time", "_vKj39kY788": "okay we are now about ready to do the pouring slight adjustment earlier hard crack stage is 300 degrees not 350 my my apologies so it is now at

good and it's so good for you it is what I call the low calorie high deliciousness candy and you make it I don't think anybody knows really about it because I made it up myself and the reason I made it up myself was when I was 21 I ate my way through South America I went there and I weighed one hundred and two pounds and I came back weighing hundred and forty eight pounds now it's lucky because I gained it everywhere but and it was the first time in my life I had boobs who I kind of liked it except when the guy started talking to me and they wouldn't talk to my face they would talk to my boobs kind of different anyway this is such a good candy I'm gonna show you how to make it it's really interesting and what you need are two eggs some almonds strawberries Truvia or stevia whatever you like and I use a little coconut oil to put it in a pan so that the eggs don't stick to it okay we're gonna get started so I just smooshed the coconut oil around so that it's evenly distributed on the bottom of the pan one more for good measure and I pour in and using coconut oil gives it a really yummy taste a better taste and if you just use vegetable oil then you cover your eggs and it just let it sit there for a couple seconds so you have to keep checking on your eggs to make sure that they're not gonna burn because I burn a lot of stuff okay and I see they're starting starting to really get kind of fluffy and by Bolivian so you just keep it covered um if you cover eggs when they're boiling when they're whatever they're doing under the flame they get thicker so that's what you want a nice little base okay now I think we're ready yes look good so now you take your nuts the almonds and you sprinkle them all around then you take your spatula and whip it right on there and I know it looks like a really good omelet - and you just let it stick on low for a couple seconds now I've taken a paper plate and a sheet of wax paper maybe omelet on there cover it you let it cool for a little while and then you put it in the freezer hi it's the next day and I just came home from the gym and I'm ready to take that candy out of the freezer so here's what we do I take this little box and I take this and I slice it into little pieces just like it's candy so what I did was I took this little box and I put wax paper on the bottom and I have ten pieces in there and then I cover it with another piece of wax paper and I'm gonna put ten more pieces on top now you've got your box of candy with twenty pieces of candy in there now if you get a regular box of candy two pieces is a hundred and sixty two 180 calories and that's just two pieces of candy and you ten times that and you've got 1,600 calories and you twenty times it and you've got 2,600 calories 2,600 calories for a box of candy and this box of candy with twenty pieces is only 333 calories so you can eat the whole box but don't do that you don't want to do that because you want to actually teach yourself to curb your appetite and you can do it with this you can do it's sweet it's delicious and um 17 calories a bite enjoy I'll see you next time", "SdxGCXy2NE4": "this is the sour green apple okay watch it look

welcome back to the southern cyborg cooks today we're going to be making chicken lollipops you heard that right we're gonna be making chicken lollipops now we're gonna be making them into daniel boone smoker so let me tell you what we're gonna have to do first of all i've made a brine and what i did is took a gallon of water and just took a little bit a couple of cups right here what i did was mixed in one half cup of salt three quarters cup of brown sugar and one quarter cup of apple cider vinegar and just mix it up on a burner medium low until it melted and i've set it to the side the rest of the gallon of water is in this big pot right here once it cools off and we got all the chicken put together like we want it we'll put it in the brine we'll leave it for a few hours and we'll be back later on today to put it in the smoker but what we're going to do is we're going to cut it off about right here and we're going to peel it back we're going to take off all these tendons and fat skin whatever's there and we're going to stand it up like this just like a lollipop but if you notice this don't stand up too good right now so in the video they took and they cut it right across here to make it stand up so what we're going to do is figure out how you do that and we're going to give it a try so there you go just like that then you're going to repeat the process over and over just cut around peel all the skin and ligaments back pull it off use a paper towel it'll help you to get a grip on that stuff just keep on doing it you'll get real good at after you do about 12 of them you'll have them all standing up before you know it what i did earlier i already told you about is i mixed up the brine solution in a little pan to melt everything and put the rest of the gallon of water in this big pot so all we're going to do right now is mix the two together and give them a stir everything's cooled down you don't want to put chicken legs in a hot brine solution so i'm gonna do now is i'm gonna put them right in here just like this okay so what we're gonna do is put this in the refrigerator and leave it for about five or six hours or something like that and before you know it it's been five or six hours we're taking them out patting them dry so that rub a stick to it that's why you do that just get you some olive oil and spray them so you'll have something to stick to and i put raging river rub on these chicken legs for this cook okay now we're gonna mix up a little bit of sauce this is what we're gonna make the candy on the lollipop with this is three quarters of a cup of sweet baby raise and to that we're going to add one tablespoon of pineapple juice and last but not least we're going to add a tablespoon of honey i'm just going to have this on medium heat until it starts to simmer and everything gets melted together smoker's up to 325 degrees so we're going to put the chicken on the grill and before you know it it's up to 160 degrees and that's when you want to go in and put the sauce on them and i found it was just easier and better to dip each one of them right in the sauce you get a good coat all over them and that's what you want and before you know it someone's going to be up to about 175 degrees and that's when you want to start taking them off we're taking them off they're all about 170 175 degrees and that's what you want with chicken legs so now i'm just going to take the rest of them off get them all in the house hey we're inside we just took these off the grill so let's recap early this morning we made a brine and we put them in the brine put them in the refrigerator let them sit for about six hours we took them out we patted them dry hey we sprinkled them really good with some raging river road put them in the smoker at 325 for about an hour and 25 minutes that's when they reach 175 and that's important because you may think chicken's done at 165 and when you're talking about a chicken breast that's the temperature 165 but these are legs and they have those tendons and the dark meat and they really need to go to about 175 and a smoker so that's what we did now when they reach 160 we dip them in the sauce and we made lollipops now you can see how good that looks right there so what i'm gonna do right now as i'm gonna try one and we're gonna try this little one right here so here we go hmm wow people i'm telling you these are really good now you wouldn't do this every day or every week this is something like you would do it's a finger food it's for carrying to a party it's a lot of effort but it's worth it you got to try it at least once carry them to a party somewhere you'll be the hit hey these babies is good if you like what i'm doing subscribe to my channel and don't forget to hit that notification bell so you'll know every time that i put out a video i'll see you next time on the southern cyborg cooks now i've eaten a lot of chicken like uh hey okay what we're doing today is repurposing my wife's salad spinner and so we're gonna give the chicken a good mix just like this right here hey we just took the wings off", "-2wyTOAbhLY": "[Music] what's up guys gals vapors and youtubers everybody else out there I'm Mike tagged a person back at all you guys again with another ejuice review and today we are taking a look at the finest eliquid candy shop line and number two out of that line is going to be apple peach sour rings today that's what we are vaping on that's what we're gonna be talking about yeah let's let's get into it here apple peach sour rings apple peach style rings got them right there look at that love these bottles like a cool cool little artwork there's like some reflective stuff on the bottle some of its like a matte finish it's just all-around looks pretty cool yeah so apple peach souring should be pretty straightforward as to what you're gonna be vaping on an apple peach sour ring so here's the bottle you got the finest logo right over here on the side ingredients all that stuff your warnings and state laws and everything on that side and then it's also got your VG PG read under these two little eyeballs right here 7030 so that's always good to see right on the bottle same thing with the box that it comes in you know it looks just like the bottle or vice versa got all the warnings and everything you need to know on the box there these are all hundred mil bottles manufactured in Los Angeles California let's talk about apple peach settings flavor profile basically the flavor profile on apple peach sour rings is a balanced fusion of apple sour rings on the inhale and sugary peach on the exhale the flavor epitomizes the definition of sweet and sour candy in liquid form hmm interesting so we basically have a apple peach souring so let's get into vaping it I just use this up a second ago right before starting this review buttons kind of juicy but yeah we're ready to vape so let's let's talk about the flavor profile see what we can you know get out of this here so I've been vaping on this for about three four days now I just reworked it and clean my coals this morning so they've it's it's about six o'clock Arizona time so it's had about a day's worth of vape going through it um still looks pretty good though so let's talk about the flavor here you can see really good vapor production off that 70/30 the flavor though the flavor is amazing on this one I really am a big fan of Apple vapes peach is pretty good too I've come across a couple that I liked and most of them I didn't but this one's got a really nice apple peach blend to it it's um it advertised this is like those like peach sour rings or an apple peach souring it's I get like like the last review I did to this stuff the the watermelon straw men and sour belts same thing it's the sourness is very very subtle it's it's very chill it's more you get more of a sweetness from those flavors than you do a sour the Apple I almost get the Apple directly on the inhale to just apple on the inhale and then the peach kind of comes through halfway through that inhale and comes through more on the exhale so you get kind of a mixture of both as you're exhaling really nice though I really do like this flavor on this one it's been a really good vape for me as I've said I've been vaping it three four days now just redirected again this morning for this review and I mean it's it's vaping great it stayed real consistent on the coils me let me get another two here and I'll show you the coils and cotton from earlier this morning [Applause] so as you can see coils are dark but you can still see ridges in them I know you're not gonna be able to tell too much on the GoPro but uh Cotton's looking great obviously it was just really kiss morning so that has a lot to do with it but let me tell you this even though this is new cotton the cotton I pulled out of here this morning from about three to four days ago was pristine I mean it looked great for having it for three four days worth of vaping going through it so you know two bottles of this juice so far that I've reviewed excuse me they both been absolutely amazing just amazing flavor great consistency vapor production has been great and overall the the juice is just good in general but yeah I mean the biggest thing I can take away from this juice is that it stays clean on your coils and your wicks it's not a overly sweetened juice it has tons of flavor but it's not overly sweet if that makes sense to you guys so I mean it babes great tastes great it's it's an all-around just great flavor I really I really do enjoy this one I mean hundred mill bottle $24.99 on ejuice Escom 70 VG 30 PG it's available in zero three and six milligrams nicotine you can't go wrong if you're into apple peach flavor vapes this this one's definitely worth checking out I really enjoy this one just like the last one you guys know I'm quite a fan of the sugary not sugary but fruit and candy type vapes I mean it it's gonna fall right into my ballpark with these kind of these kind of juices so I mean take my opinion as you will but it's my opinion mine alone I really feel this juice is is definitely worth the price tag 100 mil bottle the flavors consistent it tastes great I mean there's not much you can say bad about this juice if anything at all really so check it out I mean the finest liquid I'll leave sorry the finest eliquid I will leave links to their website down below in the video description as well as where you can buy it from social media outlets all that stuff will be in the description so if you're looking for it look in the description it'll be there and you know if I can say anything else check this juice out check out the finest e-liquid website you know / aus or peruse their juice and see what you want I mean they got some three really solid flavors the third flavor the blueberries is lemon swirl will be coming up within a day or so so stay tuned for that one I'm stoked to try that one here so if these two flavors have been any testament to the the last flavor that I'm gonna review then I'm sure that one's gonna be a knock out of the park too so let's wrap up this review and I hope you guys enjoyed it until next time you know I'll see you again and keep vaping and vape on", "hr52mEWJgQM": "so guys I'm gonna do

guys, I'm so excited Today I'm gonna make Janik try Mexican candy So this is gonna be round two because last time Joss tried German candy and today I'm gonna try Mexican candy I'm excited to try it until now I have successfully Refused to eat chilli candy. Yeah, yeah, he has never tried it ever! but today's the day so excited Let's start city Sevillanas It looks like caramel with paper She's more excited than me It's pretty good, it's like we could have that in Germany - so pretty normal I like it but super sweet you wouldn't finish more than one? -No -Really? don't need more than one because is so sweet I like salty candy like licorice. Oh, no we all know how that ended up next one that looks like fun Vero Tarrito, Yeah is literally a beer popsicle, Una cerveza por favor. I'm ready for the beer I'm the worst person at opening candy, okay didn't take that long Pretty good huh, but I don't know what it tastes like tastes like lemon a little bit. the top tastes different than the bottom. Let me try The top part tastes like Sugar is soury oh yeah, mmm Soury but sweetie. next one chilly. Let's start with the chilli. Oh, No Okay, we're gonna start with Pelon Pelo Rico. Oh one of my all time favorites, it is called delicious hair Uh-huh of course I cannot open it oh my god How are you able to eat anything in Mexico? because I only take it like with my mouth You have to push it down, and then the hair grows and then you eat the hair is hard. It's super hard to push I don't know if you can see it. Oh scared! Little spicy for some people I don't know it tastes good, but also weird at the same time It's ah no It's not bad But in between it's just weird. I think it's the tamarind thing, but it looks very werid when it comes out No, that's not what she said can I choose one? Pica Pepino, that means spicy cucumber yeah, is a cucumber I gotta go. bye This is one of my favorite all-time favorite Chili y'all these ones that have chili center you take a while to get to the chilli  oh, that's fine, we don't have enough time Yeah, we do Until now it's good timelapse until we get to the chilli O it Just takes too long Years later I'm getting there I can feel the spiciness tho Yeah, I can't because I can take more spicy things than her yeah the weirdest announcement of today It's not bad. Oh I'm so happy about it. Now I'm gonna take this today rellerindas Rellerindos, rellerindos, ingredients chilli? Take the whole thing out I can't it's stuck, that's what she said It's not bad, but it's also not super cool So this is dulce de leche, this literally it looks like dog poop with nuts Good yeah, i like it very nutty it looks like fun. It's so much fun my favorite Lucas mango somehow everything is your favorite You say that with everything this one is a mango flavor and the mango flavor is my favorite lucas powder. Why does Lucas keep following you around. snap off tip Oh Easygoing it has chili does it? Is it amazing or what, it's like ahoi brause No, it's not like ahoi brause with chili tho does it? This is so much better than ahoi brause It's sour sweet like me What does it have though doesn't have chili. yodada haha Is delicious but also a little weird - why? it has chili, would you keep eating it probably if we don't have anything else in the house then yes I really was hoping that you wouldn't like it so I could finish all of it myself duvalin This is like my childhood They made the packaging so difficult to open I'm not kidding, well it looks like Nutella with white Nutella This is exciting this looks like pudding in Germany, whoa even with spoons It is like nutella to me, I'm gonna try to put it on bread what tomorrow morning Oh my god the German way,  now this, look. We have a whole thing Sorry I am going to try it without further ado yeah Okay, that's caramel normal like we have in Germany pretty much the same Guayaba role It's like something that I recognize from somewhere Rollo de Guayaba Ate de membrillo,  I'm the worst at opening!  she's the worst opening I'm gonna open it Taste like the other thing that we had before, it is completely different and now  the grand finale the scary finale something that I wanted Janik to try  since forever Vero elotes That's the thing that I'm most scared of let me look for one with more chili. No you don't have to do that looks like a lot of chili ah Okay last one for today, and then I'm gonna wash my mouth This is honestly the most disgusting thing I've ever tried. This is horrible like all the other things were not bad You know, but this one is way out of line. It's so good for real Don't believe him try it you can take all the chili away. I'm gonna keep eating this okay Yeah, we can do that because it also has a chili center, what? Oh, then. No. I don't want it at all No, I don't like it Okay I have a last one, I brought us a surprise okay, you cannot see okay? German candy Chewie we're home This is good. This is good no So my summary from today. I'm surprised oh Yay, a lot of your candy even with chili is good But still this is the worst other stuff like this one is what did I say? I don't remember you say it was weird You're gonna, try it again. If you don't remember Yeah So my favorite is this this lollipop. Oh because it doesn't have Chili, of course he chose the beer I'm not surprised, but all the other stuff is alright. You know it was good. I like that I'm so happy that you liked a lot of it, I was expecting you to hate pelon, and I was expecting you to hate lucas Yeah I'm happy so if you want to see the other way around where Joss tried the German candy you see it either here Or here and if you are Mexican Please let us know what candy did I forget to show Janik and next time we'll go to Mexico and also try some more stuff.

cup of light corn syrup 1 cup of water and a pivoting spoon of salt some coloring some flavoring and some sticks ok few other things and I'll show you that as we go along ok so first I'm going to add the water to my pot and dimension if the edge of the teaspoon of salt in there and 2 cups of sugar and my corn syrup corn syrup the secret ingredient and candy-making okay I'll bring it over here and hide watch it it's going to stir it around I can't do thermometers ready to go in but it's not going to go into really the sugar tenses on so we'll wait a moment a few minutes and then I'll show you putting the candy thermometer in what it looks like okay then it's ready to put the thermometer in when you when you lift out your spoon and you look at the liquid and there's no little grains of sugar you know that it's ready to have that the monitor print okay Molly to the bulb of mom should be underneath the liquid we're going to wait for it to get to 300 I'll stir it only occasionally very carefully okay that's all okay I'm preparing the aluminum foil for the lollipops I have some sticks just little sticks I'm going to put a little teeny bit oil and shiny very very thin coat and then if when I place the lollipop sticks that I work this was one that long so I'm going to put the lollipop stick down so the part that's broken is it's going to be inside the stick okay so I'm going to do it this way so one lollipop will be here and one will be there and then I guess my homie there here that's it okay okay so this reached 310 degrees and what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a little bit of color this is red color because I want these are going to be strawberry strawberry lollipops Australia this is too and we will also add lollipop trays want to see what color this is coming out to not quite it's not going to be very bright red but strawberries are really a great red that should be good enough and we'll add a little strawberry this is strawberry oil and you can get this a cat candy supply store and I always measure first into into the lid and it's sort of hard to know if it's really going to be right because it's hard to taste it went so hot but um you can just hope so he smells good but it's better to have it be a little less flavorful thank you favorable because of the aftertaste of the oils okay and then it's just a matter of pouring your lollipop on top of your hmm I think you said this way and you just not sometimes you try to reevaluate it's going to be a pretty big lollipop if you hold it still in one place that it helps make it more help to make

those little holes then when you pop them out it will they'll break okay now what you want to do is wait for the candy to cool and then you'll be ready to turn it over and pop it out okay so this is

I have a special treat for you guys it's another relaxation product but this one has a little twist to it let's get into this review well today I'm gonna be reviewing a product that I got my hands on this is gonna be interesting - a few yeah but I've noticed lately that there's a huge trend with CBD which is pretty much extracted from the male marijuana plant there's this big high corner on it and you see all these things popping up cdb oils edibles and stuff like that so I'm gonna explain a lollipop that I got my hands on actually these two types of lollipops first off this is what was stated on the site and I will be putting a picture of it so you're gonna be looking at the screen when you see this it costs $4.95 comes three lollipops per package now I bought a strawberry and I got myself a blueberry those are the two flavors I got first off I'm gonna say it tasted really bad okay all you could taste was pretty much just ham now if you're gonna sell something as an edible this is just my take on something you want to enjoy right because I'm not paying for a shot to actually drink of alcohol which you just want to get down right pretty much just get drunk how lollipop is something you put in your mouth and you let it dissolve and you enjoy it and that way the benefits when they come on they come on nice and smooth right first off first mistake I have with this right was they never put how much CBD was in there that was a huge mistake they just said that it contains CBD in it that to me was a major flaw okay secondly I didn't notice there was a special ingredient inside there besides CBD it was melatonin now like I've said before melatonin is unique because we we produce that inside but combining this was supposedly the effects of CBD would create such a nice nice state for somebody to actually relaxing can good full rest so you guys understand where I'm going with this right I pretty much tried like I said both flavors the blueberry was a little bit more I guess you could say tolerable for I can actually eat it completely the strawberry I just throw away it was disgusting it tastes like I'm gonna be honest with you guys so as I'm eating or you could say rather yet uh letting it dissolve in my mouth I start feeling a little bit more laid-back and relaxed of course because the packaging says that it's a hemp chillax ation enhancer right because it contains the CBD so I pretty much finish it and then I just I feel tired and I just nah can't go to sleep and I get a nice power nap but this power nap was like 3-4 hours then I woke up and I felt great but you see now for me to actually say that it was the CVD cuz I don't know how much was in there I'm not gonna really judge it like that but I do know that that part of me getting tired and falling asleep and catching that good rest was the melatonin I'm a hundred percent sure on that I'm pretty sure that it wasn't the CBD that put me to sleep I'm sure it didn't contain that much of high of it you know inside there the content wasn't that powerful inside so I really don't know and like I said they didn't put the actual amount inside which I found was real real dumb for a company now what I do have a problem with I see that people are selling all these products right and they're selling it at such a high cost and you're asking yourself Wow why so much if pretty much this is legal but they'll give you the story like to actually get the plant and grow it that's the reason why so I'm guessing that when it does become legal all over the place this should be dirt cheap right otherwise there shouldn't be no excuses I mean some of the prices that you see on this is just completely ridiculous for what's it giving you the relaxation man you know it's sad that you even see this is this this component the CBD actually cost more than kratom which you know I'm gonna be doing a review on that very soon but I just find it amazing the they selling this so damn much this was the cheapest thing I found that maybe that's why you know they didn't give the amount but I still feel like you know I'm saying they should have put it but this is just my review on it I'm sharing this in case you guys ever see this brand you know like make sure that it does have the things when you buy it maybe they upgrade it or something like that or they forgot to put it just on my package but I'm kind of saying two different flavors you know saying what are the chances that both packages did not have dosage size right so whatever the case may be like I said I still feel it was the melatonin now if you guys see this comment like subscribe share back if you guys did try this or what was your experience with this let me know but me personally the I don't really see the huge hype of the CBD now for the actual healing properties if it does do everything that I say does then that's great but like I said I just bought it and see if it's gonna relax me like I said I do a lot of relaxation products and stuff like that and like I told you to me it was the melatonin everybody to the next review is your boy on told insight hopefully this was useful peace and love until the next

that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and basically that is it okay everybody this is master-blaster\nsaying thanks for watching give us a thumbs up subscribe peace and we'll see\nin the next video bye guys", "ARVSswHjBDY": "you want gummy bears I got gummy bears you want CBD I got CBD you want CBD gummy bears I got CBD gummy bears what's up guys at your boy big J coming back at you again today from big Co TV where you watch decide in vain and today as promised I've got gummy bears all right but I've got gummy bears with CBD in them alright and they are amazing I've been using these two weeks ish I mean I've been using CBD on and off for quite a while alright and it actually works wonders for me for a lot of different things but we'll go into that in a minute these things they taste good they work well and it's an easy form for you to take your CBD that's what that's all I can say if you haven't tried CBD you truly need to try alright it's not a gimmick it's not you know you see all these wonder drugs if you're one of those people like me that don't like to go to the doctor you don't like to take the prescription stuff you're not a big fan of over-the-counter of this over-the-counter that and you just want something natural to help ease what you got going on try these alright just trust me and try these so without further ado let's go ahead and check out the bottle alright so here you go we've got the Big Daddy pack of CBD FX gummy bears as you can see CBD FX help gummy bears the 60 count oh yeah the Big Daddy does contain full spectrum CBD they are gluten-free non-gmo and vegan all right which is cool you got a you know there's a lot of vegan folks out there these days a lot of people that can't do Blut inand all that stuff you can still have these alright you can still have these that's cool trust me it's cool ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners which leads to guilt-free indulging never tasted better very true these are delicious the statements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose treat or cure any disease always consult with your physician before use underage sale prohibited that's what I was talking about earlier the FDA hasn't said you know the FDA of course being the FDA says that you can't make claims you can't do this you can't do that about CBD because they haven't studied it so all I'm going to tell you about is my own personal experiences with these but we'll get to that again cannabidiol CBD is CBD FX is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced very important it is legally imported and produced CBD FX does not sell or distribute any products that are in violation of the u.s. Controlled Substances Act the USCS a hashtag feel the difference will roll around a little more supplement facts a serving size is two gummy bears so basically there are 30 servings in here 16 calories per serving so that's 16 calories for two gummy bears no fat 3.6 grams of carbs 2 grams of sugar 20 milligrams okay of hemp per serving and 10 milligrams of CBD per sir roll it around again and bang we're back to the front now for my favorite part I'm gonna go over some facts and eat a couple of these alright guys so as promised here it is got my facts sheet now just so I can make sure I'm telling you the right stuff so on the bottle you saw the CBD is legal that is used inside this product you may have looked and went well why is CBD legal you know I've heard the CBD isn't legal done it up let me go over that okay our products are exempt okay meaning CBD FX's products are exempt from the CSA and DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole half extracts as schedule one drugs because extracts from the stocks of European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice and that is where the hemp is grown that these guys use to extract the CBD it is grown the biomass is over in Europe their product does meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to contain less than 0.3% of THC in the gamete or in the product period in the CBD oil period and again they only use CBD that is derived from a European biomass so that's how it's legal it is also non psychoactive and non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 so there are your working facts now let me tell you a couple other things that are also some facts these things are freakin delicious alright the red they're my favorite color alright they taste like a fruit punch slash cherry I mean they're delicious so pop the cap you're gonna have a little safety seal I just normally yeah I just shut my thumb through here they gave me a couple bottles of these but I figured to show you your fresh bottle so pop it open and really they are little gummy bears I mean they look just like gummy bears and they basically tastes just like gummy bears except with a little pop so there you go it really is just a little gummy but I mean you know what I love these things so now that the FDA which you can and what you can't say let me roll that around so you get a nice glamour shot there since the FDA has determined what you can and can't say I'm just gonna tell you some personal experiences for me again I've been using CBD on and off three years what it does for me and in particular the CBD F FX products what they have done for me I used to be the guy that goes to bed let's say 10 o'clock at midnight I'm still up why cuz my brain won't stop okay it won't turn off I'm just going going going going going sit there flip through social media think about work think about this think about that couldn't shut my mind off I popped two of these half hour hour before bed I'm out and when I'm out I mean I am out don't wake up in the middle of the night no tossing no turning just everything just shuts down that's nice alright that's what I use it for also I work in a warehouse during the day yes that's right I am NOT the YouTube famous you know YouTube superstar I have a day job um and a work at a warehouse I do a lot of walking around you know up ladders down ladders all kinds crap I come home I am sore alright pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away okay after a workout at the gym pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away I mean it's not it's not a super drug but it takes the edge off for me okay other people you know say they use it for anxiety and stuff like that I don't really know if I have anxiety but I will say when I do take them it puts me in a just a nice mellow mood but it's not anything that you that you aren't functional you know I mean I could eat these in the morning before I go to work put in eight hours all day and still be totally fine doesn't make me drowsy even though it does help me fall asleep but the reason that helps me fall asleep like I says it just helps me turn my mind off so that being said I highly suggest you try something like I said if you're like me you don't like all the over-the-counter crap you think a lot of stuff that the doctors give is just you know blah blah mumbo-jumbo because they want you know Big Pharma wants to show some pills down your throat try these all right just try them what's the worst that's gonna happen it doesn't work for you okay sorry you know but I'm telling you most of the people that I talk to they've tried this it works for once you find out how many you actually need okay just because it says take two too might not work for you you might need four you might need six okay try it don't just write it off if it doesn't work the first time okay trust me just give me a favor and trust me on that it does work it really does I wouldn't I wouldn't I'm not the snake oil salesman all right so I'm just gonna be done trying to convince you hopefully you take my word for it and try some if you do want to try something check the description below you're gonna find a link directly to the big co website takes drinkler to the product buy it okay put it in your cart send it to your door try a couple gummy bears you know take the edge off guys just take the edge off all right so until next time it is your boy big J for VAP Co TV where you watch the side of a pan I am power

with um with a little bit of um sour grapefruit sour watermelon sour apple and sour tangerine well i'm gonna start off with with the cherry one first because in my opinion cherry is sometimes um original to be and i've already took the liberty of um of opening it already just so it could be a lot easier well here i go that one was actually i guess pretty okay and the next one that i'll be doing will be i guess the blueberry that one tastes a little more sweeter and not very sour tart yeah okay the next one i'll be doing will be the sweet mango now that one definitely had a more of a definitely a bango but also felt like a little bit of orangey taste to it yeah that one was definitely it was good and the last one that i'll be doing will be the yeah sweet pineapple yeah it's just gonna take me a while there got it okay well here i go hmm now that was definitely fine now i'll be um doing uh i guess a little bit of a uh of uh yeah see which one is definitely the one um um i would have to go well the cherry would that be the least um and i think um yeah the blue one will have to be um yeah definitely seconds this is definitely number one and and uh that what was um i

good day and see ya", "VTBhWEeslXg": "it's to how to make molded hard candy suckers i recommend parental supervision for this the first thing you will need to do is clean off your work area and wash your hands the ingredients for this prep for this cooking experience is two cups of cane sugar 2 3 cups of white corn syrup three fourth cup of water run food coloring a spatula of big rubber spoon um root beer-flavored flavoring bags scotch tape hot pads spoon rest candy thermometer wooden spoon to court pants wooden board sticks mold trays and cult and cooling racks you get Percy only to prepare the moles spray the pan with cooking spray stop softly wipe out the excess spray and then place lollipop sticks in the tray place in the separate cooking pan water you're 34 cup of water you're um Shepherd you're light corn syrup you might want to suspect you a to get it out because it's kind of like all rubbery and closed off it may be a little difficult but just try your best you may not get it all out but thats okay you and then set it off to the side next you need to UM murmur it it occasionally until on medium heat which would be too or um until sugar dissolves so basically tell it's like all mixed in really well gonna take this bomb on now they getting really wet ready and like all mixed in really good so then you put it bring the mixture to boil without stir it without stirring it anymore and put and then when it reaches put the thermometer on your pants didn't win at reach of 260 degrees in there put it on me on hi I'm six and then just let it sit there until it gets on gifts to 260 now let the temperature has reached 260 degrees I will turn the stove off next you are going to put the pan you might one geez the hot pad yes they're going to put the pan on the wooden board then you are going to take this thermometer off and set it with this oh then you are going to put up how many ever drops of food coloring you desire in there so it's the color that you want it to be stir it up pull it if you to just see if it's the right color you can stir it up a little with the rubber spin but just like gently stir be careful because a little bit of steam could come up and I'd like a little more red okay so this is rather than one you know after I do that that I put the lid back on and set it back over here then I'm going to take the root beer flavor I instance it's like the perfect amount I'm going to pour the whole thing in that's ok now I'm going to stir it up all the building but stand back because it could sting off the wall but when you do this you might want to put the rib here or whatever flavor using for taste in first because it kind of changes the color a little so just mix it 20 minutes and the like the darkness and mixed up really good like limit then when your dog that you kinda late a little bit and the mold and tell it's like to a little surface sorry I got a hair in there until again one we have to get a lot of force right stick a little so click all mixed and all but do it gently so like it doesn't splatter and try not to get it rant run over the sides and we do the same thing to all them and then once you're done doing that I will tell you the bolts are all diamond twirls we need to let them cool for a little bit and out and so you just like do this and then pop now when they it may take a little strict but they woke them out and then you take one little baggie and just put it right in there and do it all the way to the top and then and put a piece of tape or a twist tie either one around it and do that for the rest of them I really I listened to my first time making me so I hope they turn out good and that they will be delicious these guys if you like this and I we should have a cake how to make starbucks cake pops for another one so I hope beard turns out just as good mine is it may be a little hard on the first time but you'll be sucking them in well you should get a thinning of it right now where you honestly because that's what happened to me I recommend getting this applies for this at Michaels and other and then mixing stores or like Walmart and still like your this is the final step where this is how it turns out so when once you finish this me as hang up your work area and unless you make this and you can eat these later give me your friend's birthday presents whatever decorations for weddings

and i'm going to be teaching you how to make candy with honey all right let's get started so first who am i my name is bethany beck as i've already covered i am not a beekeeper yet although eventually i would love to i recently graduated at covenant college my passions are plants as you can see behind me bees and the environment i am huge on all three and how did i get the idea to make candy with honey um this is kind of weird i love to cook but i never really tried anything with candy until i started playing a certain game of dnd with my friends um if you're unfamiliar with the game basically you make your own character and then you play that character with your friends you fight villains etcetera etcetera it's all in the imagination and my character that i created she was a beekeeper which was so much fun and one of the things that she did as an act of kindness is everyone she kind of came across she would give a honey lollipop and eventually after playing for this character for about a year i was like you know what i should actually try and make these uh so i looked up some recipes i've researched some and i finally found something that i liked made them and then i brought them to my group and they loved them i brought them to bee club and everyone there loved them and then somehow i'm here and i have an etsy page so um don't like if you want to just buy my lollipops not make them then you're more than welcome to do that uh my edgy page is called bex honeysuckers and yeah it's super great all right so let's get into it what you're going to need as far as tools goes you're going to need a measuring cup tablespoons pot a basting brush molds stick and a candy thermometer if you don't have a mold and you want to try it out for the first time one of the things that you can do is take a flat pan fill it with powdered sugar and then take like a cup and make indents into the powdered sugar and then put your sticks in it kind of works as a mold i haven't tried it myself but i know it works from research but i will say the molds that i use these guys are only 2.99 from hobby lobby and there are every other week they are 30 off so it's pretty easy and they're also reusable so you can use them as many times as you want um and then i do want to specify if you're going to do this you need to use a candy thermometer there are some people that can do it without but it is very difficult to know when it's reached the proper temperature and it is very vital that you take it off the temperature as soon as it hits that so i really suggest using a candy thermometer now the ingredients you're going to need sugar which all of you should have you're going to use some light corn syrup honey and water and then additionally if you want to add flavoring that's totally totally optional all right now here's the recipe i will go ahead and let everyone write it down you can take a picture of the screen it's pretty simple 2 cups of sugar 1 4 cup of water two thirds a cup of light corn syrup and two tablespoons of honey um i videoed this because i've already done that and i just want to get into how to make it once we get there and a lot of people look at how much honey there actually is in this and they're very surprised um and i will say you can make these only using honey but to be honest it's a waste of money because honey is gold and using a lot of honey to do this would be kind of crazy so it is much better especially for the structure and the smoothness if you just go ahead and follow this recipe in addition you can also use different flavorings for the batch that i'm going to be making today with you guys i am doing one tablespoon of honey a few drops of essential oil and a tablespoon a little splash of lavender syrup which i'll get into all right so the directions first you want to prepare your molds do this before you even touch any of the ingredients because if you try and do this later you are going to regret it again i got these at hobby lobby pretty cheap you can also find them on amazon um i like the ones that are flat and circular just because they're really simple and you're going to want to make sure that these sticks are about halfway into where the lollipop will be that just gives it a good structure before you even touch the ingredients again make sure your molds are all prepped up and that you have placed a stick in every single mold because there's nothing worse than pouring your sugar and realizing half of your molds don't have sticks in them and real quick i'm going to go ahead and show you what it looks like um so i have this set up so that the edges are covering each other so that there is no table shown that's a really good trick for not getting your counter super messy um i am going to talk about cleanup a little bit later um but it is just easier not to have the mess to clean up in the beginning um and then you can use pam if you would like to keep the the mold really well greased um it's not necessary though so you know i just kind of avoid it because why why waste that money alrighty so the next step is going to be take all of your ingredients and put them in the pot i've already done this because i wanted to make it easier for us to go ahead and make them and when you do put all the ingredients in you're going to make sure you give it a nice stir because this is going to be the only time you stir i made this mistake several times but it is best once you've got your ingredients in just to let it sit and then you're going to put over medium-high heat i've been doing this for a while so i'm going to go ahead and put it over high heat the medium-high heat just to allow you the time to kind of observe and make sure it doesn't get out of hand and then one thing that you really need to do is take a basting brush and some water and then just go around the rim on the inside and use that water to kind of wipe away any of the sugar that might be on the edges this is incredibly important because the way sugar works if sugar comes in contact with sugar crystals it will start to crystallize um when it gets to the point that you're pouring and it comes in contact with that then you're gonna end up with lollipops that are really rough on the tongue and not very fun to eat so it is best to make sure that you're wiping the edges as you cook it's not gonna affect the sugar or anything it's just gonna make sure that that crystallization doesn't happen alrighty so you're going to make that sit you're going to let that sit until it starts to [Music] thicken and then you're also going to use your candy thermometer and you're just going to add it on the side and i generally mine doesn't stick very well to the pot but i just kind of like to prop it in and just let it sit there alright so you're going to put your candy thermometer in and you're going to keep an eye on the temperature as soon as it hits 300 degrees fahrenheit you have to work quickly so it is very important to keep your eye on that temperature i will say though it will take a little while to get up to 300 degrees fahrenheit alrighty it is getting pretty close to being 300 so i'm going to add a few last things i'm going to add a few drops of lavender essential oil and a few drops of food coloring i'm going to it is hit 300 so i'm going to turn off the heat i'm going to pour it into a separate pan that i used for pouring these which i'll show you in just a second there's this pan it has a lip and then i'm going to submerge it in an ice bath and i'm not going to let it i'm just kind of letting it sit there until it stops bubbling as hard just calming down quite a bit so i'm going to go ahead and wipe the rim and right now i'll go ahead and show you this is how it kind of looks it's purple because i added that food coloring and i apologize for adjusting the camera so much but we have to work quickly because again this waits for no one and you're just going to pour it into each one of the molds and as you see as i'm pouring it is quite bubbly it will lose some of those bubbles once it's cooling um but some of them actually do stay and it kind of looks pretty cute so i don't mind it and optional you could add things like glitter um or like gold leaf or you know any like dried flowers some people do that you prep your molds in the first place you can just place it on the bottom below the stick so that when you pour it in it's going to look really good and it won't mess with it you can also add toppings on top of it but because this is such a time sensitive thing most of the time by the time you're finished pouring and you get back to putting toppings on those first lollipops they're already hardened so i don't recommend doing that i'm glad i added that food coloring so you guys can see how it looks alrighty so once you saw once it hit 300 degrees fahrenheit it is fast and quick work um there is not much time to kind of talk about the directions so i'm going to do that now again once it hits 300 you're going to remove it from the heat and you're going to submerge it in an ice bath the point of that is to make sure it does not go any higher than 300 degrees fahrenheit once it does it starts to become caramel and you can't really work with it and then you're just going to leave it in there to the point where the bubbles have really calmed down and it stopped boiling then you're going to pour each lollipop as carefully as you can try not to get things to spill really give each mold your your undivided attention because it is very easy to have a lapse of judgment and overfill or spill it's not a big deal but it's just you know it's a waste of that wonderful candy um and then you're gonna let them sit for about five minutes to cool um and then once they're finished cooling you can wrap or enjoy them right there um so yeah it's pretty simple straightforward um again i would not do this with kids because it is very dangerous working with hot candy but it's still pretty fun so kids could watch i just wouldn't suggest them doing this part of the they can mix the ingredients that would probably be the only thing i'd let them do all right now we're going to talk about additional flavorings um as you saw i do have this infused syrup that i use i made it using lavender this is food grade that i ordered online so i know it's really good and pure and i can send that recipe to anyone that wants it if you just shoot me an email i will have my email at the end and then you can also use things like essential oils as far as this goes i really really suggest you only use one or two drops i think i accidentally used four in this batch but i would say that's probably too strong because essential oil is good in very small amounts when it comes to food but if you do too much it is not good for your health so please make sure you only use small portions of that and then you can also do flavoring and coloring um when you are buying these make sure that they are only meant for food um again with like essential oils it might be tempting to use the cheap stuff that you can find on the shelf of any store but really make sure that you're getting it from a good place that it knows it's for food i'm not sure what the health risks are there but i i wouldn't want to mess with them i use lori anna oils lauren's makes food coloring they make all oils they make flavorings and they they make a lot of stuff specifically for candy making so that is a really good source um and then if you do end up using food coloring make sure that you use a water-based food coloring not a gel because that's not going to work as well in a mixture like this alright then i wanted to also give you guys a little instruction about reusable wraps so one thing that i like to do just as a fun little additive is wrap my lollipops in these beeswax wraps just kind of adds another layer to the fun so your supplies for this you are going to need fabric cut into five by five inch squares that's just what i found has worked for me you're gonna need a hanger with a tiny clothespin you could probably use normal size but i use tiny so you are going to need a pan that you don't use for cooking i got this at goodwill for super cheap and it works really well especially because it has this really thick bottom so it retains that heat really well and then you're going to use some really good high quality wax shout out to harold lanier because this wax is gold it's amazing all right i'm going to go ahead and readjust and then we'll make these real quick so for this we're only going to use a very low heat again because my pan has a really thick bottom it's going to retain that heat so i'm not going to have to do i might even cut off the heat while i'm doing this just because it doesn't need it you are going to let it warm up so you're just going to melt a little bit of that wax and set that aside for later and you're going to take your fabric and just drape it into the wax let it soak it up again you only want a very thin coat of the wax you don't want it to be super thick i'll show you why in just a minute once it has absorbed all of the wax you're going to turn off your heat and this is the part where normally i have my hanger hanging on something and i just pin it to the clothespin um but i don't have anything to hang it on so i'm just going to hold it and i'm going to go ahead and tell you why you don't want to do a super thick coat of this wax so i have found that if you do a really thick coat of wax it makes this very like crinkly and the wax will come off whereas thinner coats are way more durable which you wouldn't think but that's how it is and easier to use and wash all right so it is already done it's not quite fully dry but it's dry enough that i can set it aside and i'll go ahead and show you two how i wrap them all right so now i'm going to show you how to wrap these in the reusable wraps we just made so this is the lollipop i just made it is gorgeous i might have taken it out a little bit too early because you might can tell it's a little warpy but that's okay it for now that's fine all right so you're gonna take your wrap and you're gonna center the lollipop right in the middle so it's gonna look like that then you're gonna take the other end and fold it over the lollipop and kind of squish the side down so it molds and then you're going to take the corner fold it downwards so it's going to look like that and then fold the bottom corner upwards so it's going to look like that all right and then what you're going to do is do the exact same thing but for the opposite side so again i'm bending it downwards like that and then bending it upwards like that all right now it still looks a little wonky but this is the fun part you're just going to twist it and then the way the wax works is it molds together and you can reshape that as you need and it looks gorgeous so that's the main purpose that i use the wax wraps for all righty and i'm just going to say this real quick if you do end up making these make sure that you only ever wash them with cold water and a mild soap and make sure that whoever you do give them to knows that because if you wash it with warm water the wax is going to go away all right so these are examples of some of the things that i use these wraps for they are quite small so honestly there's not a whole lot that you can use them for but you can use them for just preserving produce for covering up mugs but the main thing i use them for these lollipops all right now before i end my presentation i do want to go over how to clean up because this is a very messy task your best friend when cleaning up is going to be hot water and soap helps as well but hot water is the key here when you've got your pan that still has a pretty thick coating of that sugar on the bottom because it is going to solidify while you're pouring go ahead just add fresh water to that and then you're going to put it on high heat and you're going to add just a few dollops of soap and now you're just going to let it sit you're going to let that sit for i would probably do a good 20 minutes it takes a long time for that sugar to kind of dilute in the water that you're boiling so definitely just sit let that sit and forget about it once it's finished boiling and you've kind of can tell that all the sugar has reincorporated all you have to do is pour it down the sink it has saved so much time to do it this way and it's fantastic um same with cleaning your molds you are just going to use hot water and soap there shouldn't be too much of a cleanup as far as the molds go because i'll pull one over here you can see where i spilled a lot it just breaks off so as far as cleaning that goes you mostly just have to break off the sugar and then if you have any spots that you spilled on the counter or on the eye of the stove it is a little bit more tricky to clean that up again boiling water is your best friend here so make sure that you have boiling water and then i usually use a rag and some soap but again boiling water is the key and yeah it's pretty easy to clean up if you just kind of let it sit for as long as you can um it's not that difficult and because i use two pots there's a little bit more cleanup but it's not too bad all righty thank you so much for joining me and learning how to make these suckers i hope that you try it out and enjoy them i am so sorry that i'm not able to send everyone some for our conference i was really looking forward to that um but you can try my honeysuckers if you want by going to my etsy page which is beck's honeysuckers alternatively you can also send me a text with my phone number or shoot me an email and if you have any questions about this i'm going to be answering some questions afterwards but you can feel welcome to shoot me an email and i'll do my best to respond you have a wonderful day you", "-7RZodIe1EA": "hi to begin you will need a pen sort of like this one this is okay but prefer flee without it it makes it easier no pans like this this is really hard to do whenever you are trying to remove and stick sticks on the Jolly Ranchers after they are melted you'll need a bowl of Jolly Ranchers much more than these but I'm just showing you a couple of suckers today you will need your bags your sticks and your ties that were provided for you and we will begin first begin by covering your pan with a piece of parchment paper about the size make sure it fits all around so when it melts it doesn't stick to the tray and then you would want to stick your Jolly ministers no particular color order just however you feel necessary you can do them like this which will be a typical just normal jolly retro sucker you can do them like this which will be a circular these are a little harder so you might want to wait till you get the first ones down to do these but they turn out pretty cool and when they're warm you can even if they're warm enough you can even scroll them so they look like lollipops and you just choose whatever colors you want so let me do this and I'll show you what it's supposed to look like this is about how your tray should look mine I do a couple of inches in between each and then a little bit from the side see the way I did this I'm gonna have to cut here to here before I stick my sticks in so I can stick them in these so if you want you can turn them this way and cut them another way or just do less but let me just tell you the less you put on your tray the longer it takes so also don't forget when you stick your sticks in try not to stick them another or stick and diagonally because they don't look as presentable you'll want to place your Jolly Ranchers either on the top or bottom rack just make sure if you put them on the bottom they take just a couple of seconds or a minute a minute even longer so just keep that in mind you will want to set your oven timer to about eight minutes but keep a very close eye on them because if they start to bubble then you know it's time to come out and even they might be getting rude make sure and keep them very spaced out and good luck and we're okay guys mines been in for eight minutes but because they're still bulky and not necessarily melted all the way because the oven is just first being used it's not as hot as it does after you start a couple batches leave it in there for a couple of minutes eventually it will get hot enough where 8 minutes is perfect amount maybe even less right it's been a couple minutes like one or two minutes after the 8 minutes they are perfectly not too thin not too thick not running together so mom's gonna go ahead and pull him out for me walk over here she's gonna show you how to cut the parchment paper and stick the sticks where the scissors there's over there mommy okay she needs to kind of hurry up a little bit because the pan only stays hot enough for them to stay melted for a little while so and the more careful you are the better because if you move them too much they wrinkles so be careful like that and also get your sticks ready to the side what I'm doing over here why can't see how and you can always reuse your parchment paper do not throw it away because it is reusable so what we're gonna do now is pull it off this piece the other piece stays on while it's hot stick them in as fast as you can and roll it like this and you want to get at least to the second Cutler mom please do the second color here you can oh and here she's gonna show you how to see that's a minor swirl it's very nice it's gonna look very good and then there's the swirls in which you complete the altar where your colors were which are cool-looking and tasty double it color it up with the awesome see I'm gonna do a different hottest work here I'm gonna see when you have circular ones these even look awesome and once they've been sitting on a pan for more than a minute they don't swirl as easily so sometimes they chunk up so sometimes you just can't swirl them we gotta be quick so that is what they're supposed to look like when they're melted now this is the finished product you shall wrap them and then put a little cute little tech tie on them and then just bring them to school we will sell them all in like a day thanks girls bye", "4jjT6j8JLuw": "hi

"- Hi everybody, I'm so happy\nthat you joined me today. I'm going to teach you how to make a very simple cannabis tincture. So I'm gonna move my camera down below so that you can see everything that you'll need, and I'll walk you through the process. All right. So to make a tincture, the first thing that you're gonna need\nobviously is cannabis. I keep my cannabis in a glass mason jar because it keeps it fresh. I am going to weigh out 14\ngrams of cannabis on my scale. The reason is is that I decarb my cannabis in this awesome machine. I'm gonna talk about it in a second, and that machine only takes 14 grams. If you're gonna do your\ndecarbing in the oven, you can decarb as much as you want. I have 14 grams here. Decarbing is the process\nof taking the cannabis and heating it up to a certain temperature so that the molecules THC-A and CBD-A, if you have CBD in your\nplant, turn into THC and CDB. So they need to be activated or heated up in order to turn into the\ncompounds that we're looking for. And like I said, I do this in this handy\nlittle machine which I love, and if you make lots\nof cannabis creations, I definitely suggest\nthat you get one as well. It's called a Nova, and\nit's by the company Ardent which is woman-run company which I love. And all you do is you\nput in up to 14 grams and literally hit this\nbutton, and it turns red. In about an hour and a\nhalf, it'll turn green and I'll know that my\ncannabis is decarbed. The number one reason why I bought this is that if you decide\nto decarb in the oven which is a very simply process as well, you just keep your\ncannabis in your glass jar, take the label off, put it in the oven at about 240 degrees\nFahrenheit for 40 minutes, and when it comes out it'll be\na little bit dry and crispy. Again, we do this to activate it, so you must do this\nbefore you make a tincture or basically any edible. When you decarb in the oven, you can lose up to 30% of the compounds, and you don't wanna do that\n'cause cannabis is expensive. So this little machine pays for itself really quickly if you\nmake lots of infusions. The thing you're gonna do next is grind up your decarbed cannabis, so this is some stuff that I did earlier, and it's dry and crispy, and\nit smells a little bit toasty, and you're gonna grind it up. I bought a coffee grinder\njust for this purpose. You don't have to do that, you can just cut it up\nwith scissors if you want. You're not looking to have it pulverized, you're just looking to\nbreak up the surface area so that the alcohol can strip off more of those precious\ngoodies that we want. So this one that we have\nis called Zombie Kush. I always recommend\nreally labeling your jars with as much information as you can. How much cannabis you put in there, how much alcohol you put in there, what kind of alcohol you put in there. Fill that green piece of tape up with everything that you\ncan, it's easy to forget. So this one I am going to do in vodka. You have lots of options, you can basically use any clear alcohol. If you're in the states, they tell you to use Everclear\nwhich is really high alcohol, really high proof alcohol. And we don't have access\nto that here in Canada, but I'm gonna post a link\ndown below for anybody who has a medical prescription. There is a way, at least in\nOntario, to write to the LCBO and tell that that you would\nlike higher-proof alcohol to do your tinctures with, and then you can go ahead\nand buy that at the LCBO. So I've got my alcohol in\nhere and my decarbed cannabis. You're gonna shake it a lot, and you put this little\npuppy in your cupboard and let it sit there for a long\ntime, the longer the better. You can see that I have\nquite a bit of liquid in here for how much cannabis I have. I maybe shouldn't have poured\nin a half a cut right away. I should've checked it. The thing with making your own creations is that you never really have\na great idea what's in it, so you always have to\ntest the product anyway, you start low and go slow\neven with your own products. But if you want a more potent tincture, put in less alcohol so that there's more cannabis and less alcohol. And yeah, you let this\nsit in your cupboard. Some people leave it a week,\nsome people leave it month. Some people leave it a year, it just gets more potent\nup to a certain point the longer you leave it. And you can add in more cannabis\nas you get it if you like. You can make this a\nreally dynamic process. So the other trick that lots\nof people don't know about and I love telling them about is that if you use a\nvaporizer to user your canna-- To smoke, instead of smoking cannabis, I ask that save all the stuff that you... All your kind of spent\nremains that are in here, save them because even though\nyou've already used them when you used it in the vaporizer, this stuff is still potent. It's not as potent as fresh cannabis, but it still packs a wallop. So this is called ABV oil which stands for already been vaped. Sorry, it's not oil, I'm gonna make a\ntincture, an ABV tincture. And you can see I didn't measure this, so I am literally just\ngonna pour this on top. This one is moonshine which had a pretty high alcohol\ncontent, but it tastes awful. So I'm just trying to use up\nthe rest of it to be honest. Yeah, so that's not enough, so I'm gonna add in some vodka here. It's just a tincture however it works out. Basically, what you're trying\nto do is to get the good stuff off the cannabis and into the alcohol. So again, you shake the\nheck out of your tincture, and then you're gonna\nstore this in the cupboard. So this is called a cupboard tincture. There's a bunch of other\nways to do the tinctures, but this is called the cupboard tincture. When you are ready, and you can test this every couple of days or every week by just\ntaking a little spoon of it, and putting it in some\njuice, and drinking it. You should notice the\neffects if you drink it, let's say within 20 minutes\nup to an hour and a half. I know that's a really big range, but gosh, cannabis is hard\nto really narrow down. So once it's at the\nright strength for you, all you do is you take a strainer and put some cheese cloth in it, and you pour this\nconcoction into the strainer and let it drain into a jar. And then you have a\ntincture that you can just-- You can take it in a little,\nsmall tincture bottle with you, it's really discreet, you\ncan drop it into beverages. Some people can handle it\nunderneath their tongue, I cannot. Yeah, so it's a really great way to ingest cannabis without smoking it. The other things that\nyou can do with tinctures is you can turn them into gummies. That's how people make cannabis gummies is they use a tincture base. You can boil off some of the alcohol when you're done making the tincture so that it's like a\nreally thick goo almost. You can infuse that into honey, so just to melt it into some honey. And you can use that and just\nswish it around in your mouth so that you get the benefits\nof how quickly it'll go into your system in your mouth, but you don't have to\nhow terrible it tastes with the alcohol, the honey\nreally helps with that. So starting with a really\nbasic cupboard tincture can be a really fun,\neasy way to get into it. If you have any questions,\nplease let me know. I'm gonna link to all the instructions for you to do this down below, so don't worry, you don't\nhave to write anything down which maybe I should've\nabout before but whatever. I do hope that you enjoyed it. If you did, please give\nme a thumbs up on YouTube and write me a comment, it helps, so that other people can find me. And if you are looking\nto improve your life and you'd like to start using cannabis, but you don't know how and you'd like somebody to hold your hand, then reach out on my website which is www.revealcannabis.com. I have a cannabis consultation there. It's 150 Canadian dollars, and I walk you through the\nprocess, and hold your hand, and help you learn how to use this beautiful plant medicine for health.

but you want to pay your Apple into thick slices about 3/4 inch thick take a napkin or paper towel and happy Apple to remove extra juice this will help the chocolate to stick better to the Apple next remove the stem and the seeds from your apples make a little cut at the bottom of the apples with your knife and this will just help the sticks to go in a lot easier then take your melted chocolate and break them into small chunks and place them into your pan you could also use the heat per Pole for this if you don't have a pan I used one saucepan half-full of water and let it get hot and then I place my other saucepan with chocolate on top and slowly mix the chocolate until it's completely melted and silky then I took my apple and covered it with chocolate I found the easiest way to do it let's pour the chocolate on with the spoon so then I could manage it and remove the extra and I made sure to put some chocolate on the stick to act as a glue for the stick in the Apple and then I set the apples into the fridge and let them set for five to ten minutes next I used white chocolate melting wafers and I melted them the same way as I did with the dark chocolate and I repeated the same process one more time with the Kraft chronal bits and now is the time whenever you get to decorate any way you like I started drizzling some caramel and white chocolate onto the apples some of the apples I mix both the crema on the white chocolate some I just made for white chocolate and some I just made for caramel and then a few of them I place some crushed up peanuts onto the caramel apples as well the caramel starts to harden quickly so you have to work fast with it but I did end up having to go back and your heat it and once the toppings are all dry you can add them to a platter and enjoy them with your family and friends I hope you guys enjoyed watching this I'll see you guys in my next video bye guys", "ZM8WweZn4OE": "hello and welcome to my channel this probably isn't gonna be a long live srimant probably gonna just be a little bit I figured that you uh I live taste test just because I feel like it right whether anybody shows up or says any things completely after them don't matter anyway the blazing went to the store today and got some chips iced teas this is the tube one of them but he also picked up what you saw what some people will see in the thumbnail that I took which is sucker it is called chronic candy it was a dollar ninety-nine it's only ten milligrams high in some shop I don't think it's got THC I think it's just DVD but I really don't know I really can't say but I can show you that the receipt is from Wild Bill the last thing with chronic candy lollipop ten milligram $1.99 hey ghost like I said I don't think it's got THC in it I think it's just CBD but I figured I'd because I've had THC sucker before no biggie yeah we're in the tube top it's hot but I figured I'd do a taste test hearing a little bit I talked a little bit more about the THC one because like I said I've had a THC [ __ ] before I'm gonna point the camera down oh that's fine go don't worry about that 3i point that down a little bit more so that way you tell I'm nearing the top for anybody that pops and mumbling and forward so they don't just see from here on up and think that I'm naked okay I've had to teach this [ __ ] before and that was 150 milligrams that what my ass I don't believe this has THC in it maybe it does um I probably couldn't just call while girls and ask them but what's the point in that when I can just do a taste test for y'all and tell you if I think it hasn't if you've seen it i Cali whacker [Music] the THC one that I've had before with a pink skull you could taste the weed you can taste the granules um you could definitely taste the flavor of weed - it was overpowered by the flavored the selector which I can't remember the flavor of the [ __ ] it mostly cases like weed but it was delicious and like I said it kicked my ass it really did I was looking a half way to do that and I was [ __ ] I'd beyond belief when I say [ __ ] I'd I mean my bean I could see clearly but my eye is really really big so I figured why not do a nice little taste test for YouTube here damn slowly like this does I want to be able to taste it a little bit for this taste test and then put it back in the wrapper I don't eat it all right now so I'm assuming because it's purple hello it kind of looks a little blue so did their blueberry or grape flavored I'm assuming grape holy crap maybe you won't come smaller sucker before I start sucking on it no I can't I can't make it doesn't serve a grape I think it might be blueberry huh how do you know it's blueberry all right another isn't how you think nuts you know I like blueberry I would look at and Wild Bill's website but they don't technically show this kind of stuff on there your website um incense because I've tried looking at while bills for pipes and poles and bongs to see what their prices would be they don't even really give you prices or anything I'm not either so or have a list they just tell you that they have you know certain you know that they sell those things oh it smells good let's give it a taste George document blueberry oh my god it's just like a blueberry - my god whatever is in this is potent I mean I can taste you can taste something but the man's got ouch oh man oh you play with that money Tim I have th Tina doing this like only time Oh Graham I didn't think they'd be so mad about I know it's legal in our state now for recreational use earning Jane felon THC they had only the song CBD at Dollar General there ain't no way they're doing T C there I'm like it I could look and see if they have a chronic Candida calm I guess I will open up a new tab hmm be right back I mean you still see me but I can't see the chair real quick CBD edibles CBD oh you can get gourmet chocolate gelato OG Kush Blue Dream Blue Dream is such a good stream banana OG milk and confuses coverage or cake these monkeys a dream yeah that's EBT seaweedy lollipop you can definitely taste it Wow if you go to the website lollipops I guess they're 10 bucks apiece this was more like too much so if you get orange I guess it's creativity blue ones relaxation purple is euphoria yellow is energetic greenness focus and red is happiness with just strawberry the Green doesn't show a thing on it yellow shows a lemon purple shows blueberries grapes and oranges this one shows a cherry raspberry a blackberry and a blueberry and then creativity is it orange it's actually pretty [ __ ] good CBD nollie I wouldn't mind getting these occasional hi Megan this is really good if they have these in your state I would recommend them I don't know how relaxed I'm gonna get from this but we'll find out like I say I don't think I'm gonna eat the whole thing like right now or anything I'm just gonna stop out for a little while and then put it back that's a little low wrappers yeah opening up the wrapper in the blue my wrapper with um if it's legal in your state and they have them or even go to chronic candy calm and you can like I said you can get going chocolate with CBD in it you can get lollies like this he's in the closet like I said he likes to do much [ __ ] game you rapper demands were down in size a little bit oh yeah goes back in the rapper a lot easier than that came out so yeah I think it's good I like it um I would definitely try out some of the other flavors I would actually try every flavor just to see which one I like the most tasting and also a trial the feeling of more I mean I already know I like relaxation obviously creativity I think that would actually be really cool oh no I don't have relaxation I have euphoria relaxation would be good do I have you for you or do I have maybe I have euphoria maybe have relaxation I don't know energetic would be good to have in the morning have a energetic sucker when you get up or focus but yeah I'm sure I'll sleep fine I didn't sleep that well last night that's very very warm it's still warm today it's terrible right now but I'm gonna do joking my fan for me so I am feeling quite a bit of my fan now where I wasn't before why do you get your butt like that Domino I mean oh no are you doing I knew that you didn't you you're not getting my sucker though you can smell the wrapper you wanna smell the other side where'd the suckers kind of peeking out it there but now you're gonna be hunkered down right there staring at my sucker thinking you gonna get it [ __ ] boy it's funny like all day yesterday I told him I was like I'm not gonna touch nothing and I did I didn't bug him all day yesterday and lo and behold earlier today I was laying here and I wake up for a second to kind of turn over from how I was lean and I noticed in over on Jo side of the bed didn't say nothing tumor anything just looked at him he's seen me look at him then next thing I know I closed my eyes and I feel something on the bed no my eyes back up and look he's away from where he was closer to me and belly up like me my mission I love it huh listen my husband will miss the moment yeah so now you don't want Melvin again oh you're a jerk that's what you I call you a jerk so you start flicking your tail like a little jerk really jerk I don't know not gonna do it now a little bit of a directioner but ya know I like it I do feel a little relaxed I don't think I feel euphoric it's probably a big wall before I feel any of the effects of it I'm gonna sign him take forever I'm taking mostly because it's only ten milligrams that's the reason why it's not gonna be like an extreme experience like it was with the THC one because th Neelix I was a 150 milligrams of THC in that this only has 10 milligrams of CBD mmm maybe had about a quarter of it but I thought this was a fun and interesting taste test I will probably maybe re-edit the title of this and actually say it's a chronic candy sucker or may just leave it as just taste test I don't know yet I know I haven't been on here in a while anything new with anybody No already well I guess I will end this now Oh same ol [ __ ] same ol [ __ ] just different day yeah so that pretty much is everywhere all righty well that was my taste test um I have a two awesome thumbs up I would definitely recommend them especially if you don't want to THC but you do want something to help with like I said the different varieties of like relaxation you know to be focused to be energized like I said energy one would be good in the morning when you first getting on the focus one will be good if you're getting ready to actually go to work or because these don't have th seeing them so you're not gonna be high you're just gonna feel very uh ah hell I can't explain it I'm not a CBD oil expert or anything but or CBD expert but it it's very good the flavors nice of whatever you know um fruit flavors news they were very good man doesn't really turn your xx color like most candy

explain so you guys know how we always try taki's products right so i've made a playlist if you guys want to go check it out it's under playlist on my channel of all the takis products we've ever tasted so we're going to be um starting on that trend i mean the um series yeah that series again and we're going to be trying to get um other taking flavors online and in stores so i was just at walgreens okay whatever i was just at walgreens okay so and then i saw these we got some takis lollipops guys legit there's a lot in here i know there's street i thought there was this one um so i got two packs one for me one for my brother i wonder if the tacky powder actually tastes like coffee powder so here it is hockey suego this is how the lollipop look here's the packaging actually so yeah we're just gonna get right into it open these up so each pack contains three pocky lollipops and one taki is shaped like a sake a taki so here we go so if you guys thought this is made out of clay i made it let me know what you guys think down below i made it out of clay and i'm painting it red but let's actually get right into the video so here's how one looks looks pretty cool and then it says it comes with chamois acid lollipop with chili pepper powder if you guys don't know i've been in a cache for about a month okay so let me explain the cast situation my god no okay so i was in a cast an actual cast for about two weeks and i got this bad boy on for another two more four more weeks but i have two more weeks in this and i'm done so yeah let's get right into this thing you already opened it how did you open it oh you just went like this like a bag of cheese okay so holy okay so it doesn't look anything like the packaging i know i think the lollipop just looks like a massive dookie on a stick my guys so it doesn't work on the top not at all so not even from the bottom like on the packaging you can see that there's a hole put it on the bottom and there's no hole so here we go let's just get right into it ready three two one yup oh oh it's so hot and sour can't hop kind of just all went down my throat tastes pretty good i like it i don't like it it's too dry let's see if i can get the lollipop what do you mean like just try to get all the powder off guys i'll be back i guess it's just me now i don't like it it's too dry it's pretty yes it nasty to me it is it just looks like tahin yeah that's the powder for the lollipops that you dip the lollipop in pretty good it's pretty nasty to me where would your rating be no i'll give it a five out of ten i would give it a six and a half it's not the best it burns my lips yeah it's pretty hot for a lollipop it doesn't remind me like anything of a taki i don't know but you're just a giant blob tastes like a hot lollipop any mexican lollipop actually this is what it tastes like okay so yeah this one looks like tahin just more grounded up because look it's like finer than baking here it is and then we're just gonna dip it again uh i don't really like the powder but the lollipop's okay okay so i brought myself some water so i could try to get the powder off because it literally just started in the package

that can only be called gross and what could be more gross than eating bugs if you've ever wanted to chew on a cricket or feel a chocolate-covered worm slide down your throat don't go anywhere we're off to Southern California where they don't hide the bugs you can see them waiting inside every lollipop most people wouldn't eat bugs unless they were in candy and you got to give him some motivation more than 10 years ago Larry Peterman bought a candy store in Pismo Beach California he started making his very own bug candy and the rest they say is bug history found out that people kind of like insects and so he says let's put some in some candy and see what happens and chocolate-covered anything we even put chocolate onto anything people or eat it Daniel the resident bug Dipper dips crickets in chocolate the chocolate really gives it that get flavor like kind of when you are you chocolate dipped on strawberries or just add that sweet sweet flavor to it some people will give anything a try at least once ooh what is this chocolate-covered insects oh it keeps you jumping and wiggling the other kind of things but that's not all amid the taffy and rock candy lurk worm suckers ant candy and insect inside pops larry was the first to put bugs inside hard candy mmm just tastes like grape right now but once you get down to it then it's like crunchy at the worm and cricket making the suckers is a bug filled process the empty molds wait for the bait while the sea repeats up add a little protein and the stick now the liquid sweetness sugar and spice and everything nice believe it or not buyers are not just kids Larry says his most loyal customers are women ages 25 to 50 you know it's fun to see what people say so you can you know really get somebody something that's really disgusting if you do get a gift that makes your skin crawl remember there is an extra-special way to eat it the best way to do it is to lick around until you get just a bug by itself and then you can have the full flavor of the bug without the flavor of the candy and going along with it when you get to the cricket you bite into it but you can't really find it now I've really never seen a worm look quite like that kind of grosses me out that could be a fake one you know that this is pulling my leg making me get also a beast because I'm gonna eat a worm but don't worry these are not your ordinary household bugs Larry is devoted to quality control we raised our insects on good grains good fruits vegetables that kind of thing and prepare them in a way that's acceptable to the FDA

about treats for the sweet tooth Today I'm going to talk about Caramel Apple Pops Caramel Apple Pops were introduced by the Tootsie Company in 1995 The Penny Candy Store always has the green apple on hand unless someone wipes us out that's happened in the past but they also make two other flavors of Caramel Apple Pops, the Red Macintosh and the Golden Delicious Every now and then we'll carry those So I have to be honest with you for some candies I already have ideas or plans I just have to kind of work out the kinks to get them filmed other times I really have no idea\nwhat I want to do for certain week for a candy mainly because there's all this\ncandy, but I want to be in the mood to eat that candy Even if it's a candy I'm not going to enjoy I'll have to be in the mindset to kind of be \"alright let's see how this candy is going to be\" and other times i'm like \"I really want to eat this candy, so I'm going to have  it this week\" so eventually I'll walk around the store, look at the candy and finally I will find one that will just tell me, it's time (Adele's \"Send My Love (To Your New Love)\" chorus plays) so the Caramel Apple Pops, basically a hard candy that's green apple flavored and then covered in caramel It's a nice sweet caramel flavor Luckily some of the green apple is sticking out of the caramel Because I've already been working on the caramel for a good minute and I haven't made much progress but the flavor of the green apple, it's a sour green apple I was expecting more of a sweet green apple, but it's sour, so that's really good thank you for watching this week's video of TheCandyGuy Links for the Penny Candy Store and myself will all be in the description of this video I post videos every Friday, so I shall see you all next Friday Have a sweet day.

[Music] [Music]", "w1afa7IBcb4": "[Music] my name is Liz and oh I just hit nine thousand subscribers thank you guys so much that is so exciting next stop 1 million let's go anyway so I've had a few requests for doing a hard candy I did have one video there that kind of I did as a quick music video but I'm actually going to do one of my tutorials more in depth to give you more information and I'm also going to show you two different recipes so I'm going to show you one that if oh you only have can of butter to do with can of butter and the other one is if you've got texture how you can now make a really good tasting hard candy alright so as always I'm gonna jump right into our ingredients what we need and then get everything together to make some awesome candy ok so one of the most important things when you're doing candy making a hard candy making is humidity humidity is a huge factor if it is too humid in your home don't bother trying it it is summer in it is too humid don't bother trying unless you have a dehumidifier or air conditioner so I made these the other day and it was a little too humid and that's what's gonna happen is they're gonna come out sticky and tacky and they're just gonna melt together so optimal humidity is 35% however about 45 to 50 absolute maximum 50 is but 45-year okay at sugar alright so for our cannabutter hard candies you are going to need 1 cup of white sugar half a cup of corn syrup 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter cup of peanut butter and a half a teaspoon of soy or the other one sunflower lecithin yes you can use the powder if it is granular you may need to strain it but I believe the powder will work as well so that's what you're gonna need for your can of butter ones now if you are a tincture person you can make candy sugar & Canas syrup from your tincture if you don't already have those made up I do have the videos that show you how to make those so you can make up your your can of sugar and your can of syrup so for your tincture for takes your candy sorry gap there and this is the way the reason why I did this is so that you don't have the taste of alcohol this way the the alcohol has been evaporated off and it gives you a really nice tasting candy versus probably most you just use tinctures straightforward always have a contend with that taste of alcohol this is going to help eliminate that problem altogether so what you are going to need is a half a cup of white sugar regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar yes you can use one kind one cup of can of sugar I just prefer again for taste to do the half and half you're going to use a quarter cup of kanna syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water and again whatever flavors that you would like to use and colors to make it again this is gonna come out very green so you may not want that color you may want some other color and again the white for the solid background again more I'll go into detail now the nice thing about using this recipe is that you don't have to use an emulsifier like gore gum we're not trying to stick butter in places that has no business being and trying to make it stick so these are all natural ingredients and that's why I find this recipe works so much better all right so the equipment that you are going to need is first a pot a cold pot of water with ice this is for us to stop the cooking process when our candy reaches temperature you're going to need a small or medium heat transfer it pot non heat transfer and sorry heavy bottom is preferred and non heat transfer is there is no dark spots in the bottom of your pot so that means that there is no spots that get hotter than any other spots you have proper proper heat distribution and your candy isn't going to burn in it's not gonna be hotter in one spot but another you will need a spatula your candy thermometer your candy mold yes I know they're red and my dummies I say don't use red molds for hard candies are perfectly fine but not for gummies or if you're making lollipops there's this type of lollipop mold which is a 3d mold or you've got the flat mold that you can get as well so you're gonna have get those prepared and have those standby on hand and I'm gonna use these that's probably another one you're making hard candies you also want to make sure that your molds are small remember you want it to be in your mouth you don't want to be like you want it to to feel good in your mouth not be oversized and that's about all the recommendation I have for your candy molds we will get started first on the can of butter recipe alright so for our can of butter candies you are going to add your one cup of sugar your a half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna stir that until it is combined and your sugar started to dissolve and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high oops sorry I always forget so you're also going to need a cup of hot water with a pastry brush or a paintbrush to clean these sides of the pot down up for many sugar crust that wants our sugar and water there of kamae gonna turn your heat on to medium high and you're just going to continue to stir it until your syrup begins to boil the moment that it begins to boil we're gonna stop stirring and we're going to attach our candy thermometer and cook our syrup to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and again you always just want to make sure that you wash down any sugar crystals that you see for it on the side of the pot the reason for that is so say your candy doesn't crystallize if you leave sugar crystals there it can cause your candy to crystallize now when you're stirring you always want to make sure to go around the edges of your pot the sugar likes to sit in there so you just want to make sure that none of the sugar is sitting or forming on the sitting and crystallizing they're on the bottom of the pot so you can see our or I hope you can see bubbles just starting to form there around the edge so it's starting to boil at this point I am going to stop stirring and I'm just gonna clean off any sugar off the edges then I'm going to attach my candy thermometer and as I said we are gonna cook this to 300 degrees Fahrenheit the moment we hit 300 degrees we're going to dunk it we're gonna dunk the bottom of the pot into our ice water and at first when it starts to boil its gonna be cooking off any impurities in your water and your sugar so it will bubble up like this for a moment but then in a few moments as soon as those cook off it will settle down and the other thing is the ones that starts with the boiling and you've tossed your thermometer just turn your temperature down to about medium now while your syrup is cooking you just want to get your molds all ready and prepared because once our syrup is ready we need to work fairly quickly and then just to let you know so when you attach your candy thermometer it'll go up pretty quickly and then you'll notice that it's gonna sit in around 220 220 - probably for about 10-12 minutes that's while it's mainly cooking the water off after that the temperature will start to increase and it will start to increase fairly rapidly so you don't want to go too far away from the kitchen right after that point so if you do need to take a quick little break and don't forget you've got about probably 10 minutes of safely way right now all right so I am 300 degrees remove your candy thermometer dunk it in your ice cold water to stop the cooking so we just want to wait for it to stop bubbling there a little bit turn off your heat and there we go you don't want to leave it too long cuz your can't it'll start to solidify on the bottom now I'm going to add in the butter now be very very careful because you are working with molten lava you're going to just start to gently just kind of get that there now if it does if your syrup does start to solidify too much on the bottom just put it back on the burner it's still warm enough to melt that and now we are going to get our lecithin and we are going to add in a half a teaspoon a generous 1/2 teaspoon of our lecithin and you're going to drizzle it all over the top of your syrup and butter and then I'm just gonna move this hold on and now you're gonna gently stir until your syrup and butter starts to combine be very very careful as it starts to combine you want to stir it from the center like this so you're pulling your butter and your syrups from the side and this is going to help to emulsify them and emulsifying is bringing them together bringing your water and your oil together as one one solution is one syrup so my syrup seems to be crystallizing it a little bit here so I'm gonna add in a quarter teaspoon of citric acid all right so once your syrup is all mixed its gonna lighten up like this and it's gonna go solid now you can add in your coloring and your flavoring so I'm gonna do this one tutti-frutti first oops I added a little too much sorry normally I'd in a capful I don't know why I just went all freestyle there and I'm going to add in the white and the white is going to help to give a solid background to him for our color and I'm going to do this one pink all right so I was having a little trouble there for a little bit there I thought this was actually gonna be a flop because my emulsifier might lecithin wasn't coming together fully with my syrup but I persevered and kept stirring and and it did come together that graininess is now gone that I was having there and now getting a nice smooth candy syrup so sometimes you might think it's a fail but keep going that's usually what's the failure probably close to way it will be failing is that it's just not am also fine correctly just not coming together so you just gotta beat it a little bit better I have just added a little more color here and now my syrups getting a little bit thick here as you can see it a little bit thick to work with so I'm just gonna turn my heat on to low just to help melt to keep it melted so I'm just gonna get this color mixed in and just get that melted I said just gonna heat it up a little bit so it's a little more melty melted and I will get this poured into our molds all right so with the butter and the lecithin your syrup is a little is a little thicker then if you were using the other when using the other method so now I'm just gonna pour it into my mold as best as I can it's a little hard off that happens just scoop it off you can clean that up later okay so this syrup I'm sorry is a little too thick to try and put into the sucker mold so I'll actually show you the sucker molds with the other one I'm just gonna fill the regular candy mold with these don't worry too much about it the Mesolithic drips on the side you can easily break those off and clean up your candy afterwards so yeah it's a bit messy sometimes the other syrup you'll see works so much nicer now if you do overflow on those just get a straight edge so straight an offset spatula or a straight edge knife and you can just scrape it off the top like so I just scrape it on my table and clean it up afterwards so that's it for our butter candies now we're gonna let this B's sit I'm gonna finish filling up the molds I'm gonna let them sit until they are completely cooled which it takes about an hour or so ready so for our texture version you're gonna have already have had pre-made up your canna sugar in your can of syrup and so for this recipe or rework what we are going to use the half a cup of Canada sugar 1/2 a cup of regular sugar the quarter cup of can up syrup and our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our half a cup of water our citric acid does not go in until we are done cooking if you put your citric acid in now beforehand you will actually make your syrup too hot and it will burn so just going to combine all our ingredients and then once they're combined I'm going to turn our heat on to medium high until our syrup begins to boil and also make sure to go all the way around the edges of your pot to make sure to get all that hiding sugar now you're gonna find the difference if you tried between the two recipes this one is so much easier to work with so I turn my heat onto there medium-high I'm going to continue stirring until our syrup begins to boil and I am going to wash down the any of the sugar crystals here that a-port got onto the side of the pot now that your syrup has started boiling you're gonna stop stirring you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and I also recommend to get the fan going just because you are cooking even though you're using the dehydrated sugar in the hut there could still be some alcohol left over and that can cause you just want to have it ventilated now if your syrup starts to bubble up this too high and you're getting a little worried there just pick it up off the heat turn your heat down to medium and place it back down and you are going to let this cook now until your syrup hits 300 degrees the only thing that you're gonna do here like I said you're not going to stir anymore only thing you'll do is if you see any sugar crystals or anything formed on the sides just clean that up and as your syrup gets close to temperature don't forget to grab your pot of ice water all right so I'm almost a temperature I've got my pot of ice water ready let's stop hitting the camera and 300 remove your candy thermometer carefully put it in your sink and then drop your pot bottom into the ice water until it the bubbles start coming down and also turn off your heat okay so I'm starting fires here all right so we've got our syrup here and now I'm going to add in our flavoring so I'm gonna do a peach mango tropical punch thingy here so I'm going to do a half a cup a half a capful of each flavor sorry a capful I lied sorry the jiggling of the camera it's a little hard to work off now in some candy hard candy recipes they'll tell you to put that the your flavoring in right away you don't want to do that I can see how that's vaping up there that's your flavor actually burning off so when you see that huge vape of smoke that's all your flavor burning off okay so those are my flavors it's gonna get them stirred in there a little bit now for the color now if I just have if I'm just gonna add in yellow I'm gonna show you what that will look like rocks I'm gonna use peach and you can use the liquid gel or the gel these gels the Wilton gels either one doesn't matter okay not quite that much so I don't use the white and I just use the peach on its own you have a translucent color but it's not very pretty you don't put some on the paper here so you can see it's not the prettiest of colors horrible but if you add the white in it gives you a solid background and it makes your the color the primary color that you want standout is the actual color and so you can see also this syrup was a lot easier to work with stays much thinner and the same thing though if it starts to solidify a little bit on the bottom there just put it onto your burner it's still warm enough it's still warming up and it'll just get that all melted in so I'm just going to finish stirring that up there and I'm going to get the get this ready to pour into the molds so once your syrup is all nicely one color one uniform texture we can get ready to pour it into the mold see that works a lot better and if you're doing these lollipop molds you want to bring them up right to the right to their edges if you don't then when you put them together you'll find that you'll end up with gaps oops not that much then to put small together just flip her over make sure that you do it on the right side put it together and squish her down and then you're just gonna make sure that it's all well pushed down and some firm I'm gonna fill up our little our little molds here and that's it you're just gonna get these filled up and let them harden up and then we'll get them out of the molds yes he's so much easier to work with alright now that our candies are cooled we can take them out of the malls so our first one with our butter the ones that were kind of messy and yucky and trying to get them into the mold just work them out and then with a pair of kitchen scissors you can always just cut around the excess and it'll just come off and then you can just save that you can also put it all any excess you could also put it back into a pot melt it down if do it in a double boiler and or just put it over low heat but be very careful and you can remount it and then recast him again now what I would probably recommend is with the butter one as I said you saw kind of how difficult it was getting in the molds is to just lay it out onto a pan and score it make score lines in it so they can break it easily you can kind of see have a look at that I did it in the cough drop video and then and then here were my the cans syrup and the can of sugar ones the same think there's any extra edges and these two edges you can just easily just snip them off they come off really easily now let's have a look at our suckers so far so good there's still a little bit warm same thing though just cut off any excess around the edges like so and also top them off there you have it two different versions of hard candies and lollipops so odds obvious if you have it as always not as obvious I apologize as always if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments then I will be back to say goodbye in just a moment oh sorry one thing I forgot to tell you if your place is your good through the humidity's good oops you can just store your candies and just put them into a glass jar or into a candy dish good to go if there is any humidity or you find that they're sticky at all you can toss them in powdered sugar or icing sugar and again store them in a glass jar or airtight container the icing sugar will help them from sticking together so I hope that helps you out so guys that was my tutorial on lollipops and hard candies I hope you enjoyed that and as I said before if you do have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and thank you guys so much to help for helping me get to the nine thousand mark well it's Riley a little bit over now yay and and again to lots more recipes to come I do keep a list of these suggestions that you make and I will try to get through them as we go so as I said lots to look forward to in the future if you're new to my channel I do hope you subscribe and if you enjoy this I really do hope you share with your friends so thanks again for joining and you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "Xr5Y9wIOR1M": "[Music] hi there welcome to stated his kitchen today I am SuperDuper duper excited because I'm going to show you my best ever recipe which I absolutely love to make I'm showing you how to make my bubblegum flavored lollipops kids absolutely adore eating them but adults have to make them so let's get started get yourself a nice heavy base small pan and in that put 225 grams of glucose syrup I put it in already on top of that you need to put 450 grams of granulated sugar and on top of that 80 mil of cold water now I want to turn on your hob to medium-high and I'm just very gently very very very gently just going to stir in the glucose syrup so it doesn't burn on the bottom of the pan now get a lid and pop it on and set your timer for about four minutes what you want is to self clean aside so everything now is going to bubble up the steam is going to take the sugar off the sides and self-clean the sides so there won't be any crystallization of the sugar the most important thing about making these lollipops is that everything has to be ready before you start so that when your sugar is ready to pour you are ready to you need to get yourself loli molds and lolly sticks I definitely prefer plastic lolly sticks than wooden ones it's important to have a sugar thermometer because you're lonely pops have to get up to 154 degrees we've got ice water here ready to plunge the pan into when the temperature reaches 154 degrees we've got all of sprinkles ready and also all of our flavorings ready they go sugars now bubbling away nicely and the sides are perfectly clean it's probably going to take around ten minutes to get up 254 degrees the hard crack stage at this point you want to keep your fingers well away from this sugar syrup it would not be funny if it goes on your fingers and also if you've got children around make sure you put it on the hob over here 154 we're stopping now okay we're plunging it I've got to plunge it straight into the straight into the ice water because you want to stop the sugar immediately 1:54 you want to stop it immediately from cooking very gently move it around sorry it so important not to let any of the water go into the sugar syrup at this point if you're experienced at lolli making you can pour it directly into the molds but I think it's best for us if you pour it straight into a jug I'll put this in me and the sink I'm putting a strange thing with some hot water in it for this otherwise it'll stick to the sides it'll be a nightmare to get off later so if you put into a jars and then put some hot water in your pan it's gonna make the clear-up process a lot lot easier now it's time to put in your food flavoring um I've decided to use bubble gum today because it's absolutely the children's favorite but there are so many different ones you can choose from in my box I have great watermelon candy floss strawberry coca-cola banana I mean the list is endless today it's bubble gum and in a jug of this size you probably need about 10 tiny drops 1 and then just leave it for a little bit and before you know it the whole thing the whole room is going to smell a bubble gum and it's delightful wait for the bubbles to to subside a little bit and that's time to start your pouring you ready okay be very very very gentle very very very very careful want to take it up just to the top covering your sticks a nice stream going slide it over these little bits here just crossed that they crust up and they could just be peeled off at the end should always try and make lollipops when the weather is quite cold is a perfect time of year for lollipops if it's summer and it's humid it's very very difficult to make lollies because they go with sticky and disgusting let's see if I can try and get another one once it starts getting a little bit thicker if you've got it in a jug like this you could pop the jug in the microwave just until it starts bubbling and then you can reuse it okay to make sure every stick is in correctly now I'm gonna pop this in the microwave for about 10 let's just finish them off so I've managed to get eleven out of that mouth sugar if you wanted to double it and do double the amount of sugar and double them up glucose syrup that's also fine it's now time to decorate you need to it's a little bit of practice this takes a little bit of trial and error because you obviously can't touch your sugar but you need to know when the right time is to put the sprinkles on because if we put the sprinkles on too early but what happen is the heat will just make them melt but you know what it will take a little bit of time but I think these are probably ready now I'm gonna use some of these gorgeous embellishments they're just sugar embellishments and you can pop them on your lollipops and they make them look absolutely fabulous be very very careful when you put them on though pop it down and push it in remember the sugar super hot hey go if you leave it too long to put the embellishments on what will happen is they won't stick at all because there'll be nothing for them to stick to this ones are getting a little bit hard now so you've got to be super quick these are so pretty okay so I've used as embellishments now the rest of them I'm gonna do well you can use any sprinkle you want really it doesn't matter my children really like it when I put millions on them no those millions you can get or nerds they're great as well I'm putting because it's Christmas I'm doing Christmas balls on this one and I think I'll do some stars on this on the others it's basically showing you can use anything really anything you want to use so put a red one and a white one and green one on there green one go white one and a red one on there now what you have to do is give them about ten minutes to set and as soon as they set you can take them out of the molds we've left these to cool for 10 minutes now it's time to take them out and finish cooling on a piece of baking parchment pretty down as you can see the little bits that are touching them it's just falling off the side and you can always just try bit and see if you like them these are without a doubt favorite any kind of kids party or children's gathering even add r72 now we can leave them on the baking parchment until they're cold to the touch and then they're going to go straight into their own individual cellophane bags so when they're being stored they don't stick to each other and also once you add a nice little ribbon on them or they're perfect to give as a gift so there we have it now you know how to make your own tasty gorgeous Christmas lollipops perfect for children at this time of year thank you so much for watching my video if you enjoyed it then please click subscribe because I'm going to be adding so many more

we're gonna be mean destroyed pump it is sharper a shortcake yeah oh yeah another thing in the last video I made a mistake I said remember those this plan set open and then they like what you test them and then they open that's why I met I said they kept them they close I got it unwrap this what it looks like it looks like candy cane kind thing it's pink white and red okay so we're gonna try to you they work in two hundred dollars in free gas from edmunds take you how about that national park this kind of case like um have you ever tried like strawberries in a cake if you have that it tastes like it's really good you can find these at walgreens or Die stories like CVS pharmacy or so dude and out of one out of a 10-carat this at ten and seemed a fast one so like comment down below and subscribe thank you", "j79R3cDNUsg": "today we are showing you how to make these candy um suckers Adam driving or you don't have to you can use sucker sticks or anything to hold it on or if you don't want two and make this okay okay so what we will need is water and jolly ranchers so it has to be hot water very hard or boiling water and something to hold it on or nothing to hold on yeah we're doing hold on so whenever it's like if it feels like if you like warm actually if you weren't like a good texture flexible texture then leave it in for a long time but if you don't want it that good of a flexible texture and then you don't want to put it put it in there too long either cuz it'll get all sticky and it'll get all stringy and you don't want that you want it to stay and as you see what i'm doing i am dipping it in the water taking it out of the wrap and molding it on to my handle on domestic and i only have to jolly ranchers I have a whole bag of Jolly wrenches right behind me but I'm not this is a small bowl see a nice flexible texture and try to get it as far as you can and then just slap it on there and I was going for a rose text see I'm trying to go it's kind of like a rose oh and if your water still hot you can always just for you use it so I'm going to get some more daughters you actually want to roll this around so I doesn't get stick and then you want to put it in your thing you're going to let these sit for about like 15 or 20 minutes okay and also what I forgot to mention that other people have done this the only one person I know that had done it was Miranda sings a sister I watched her tutorial and from this one out her tutorial is rose ones though so yeah but this oh that's our microwave that's the water we were being very and now our jolly ranchers have melted look at that and this is actually a good activity for actually like like party stuff treats Halloween candy you anything we will be back with the next back to draw the Richer we just used the one that we already did and we put two more jolly richer stuff I'll be back when they're hot and you probably want to check here like every five minutes or sell because they really they really I'm sorry um together to promote fast or a few minutes and if it actually opens up its wrapper then you need to take that up re fast so um we're going to let this sit for about ten to five minutes and we'll be right back okay as you can see there dunno they're very flexible slob we'll get them out of the water and then i will show you okay you guys this is our final result it we were kind of going for a rose but i don't know if it looks like a rose but it looks good i actually have to give myself credit on it looked very good and it tastes varied the lunches um the flavors for this one are the green to green apple cherry and watermelon this one was sour cherry and green apple that's the bedroom and yes i washed my hands and this kind of gross but this one is watermelon and

thanks for tuning in with me once again I got another two-for-one a look review to bring you today this is gonna be all two flavors from air factory we got blue wrasse and a wild apple so you guys had a routine sit back relax grab a vape and let's go check it out [Music] [Applause] [Music] these flavors were sent over to me from Aspen Valley babes for purpose of review that of course will not change my thoughts or opinions on either of these two flavors so again they're from the air factory lineup we got the blue rice and wild Apple now I know these have been out for quite some time a lot of people have already tried these but I get requests a lot I get a lot of people who ask me if what I think of the air factory line up which juices I recommend and a lot of people requested me to do reviews from the air factory lineup so even though they've been out for a while I still wanted to give you guys my thoughts and opinions so there are seven thirty seventy thirty VG PG they come in a zero three or a six milligrams nicotine there are a hundred mill bottles and don't ask for value babe store $27.99 I'm gonna leave you guys coupon code down below so if you guys use code aaaa TV you'll get 25% of yeah 25% knocked off for the air factory or any of the other flavors that Aspen Valley has to offer and they got a ton of flavors on their website so yeah zero three six milligram that caffeine I got mine in a three but for some reason it was just a mistake I guess a little slip-up they sent me the air factory blue razz in a zero but not a big deal things happen I'll still be able to give you guys my thoughts and opinions so again we're gonna start it off with the blue wrasse and then in the second half of the review we'll move on to the wild apple give you all my thoughts and opinions on both and I'll let you know at the end which of the two I prefer the most for this review I decided to bust out the old hooome tech crystal ball and yeah although it's gimmicky as [ __ ] and I hardly ever use it it puts off amazing flavor and the airflow is extremely extremely smooth on this so I decided to bring it back out of retirement but anyway um the coils I have in here some aliens from Fresno 578 on Instagram his name is eat Ethan Windsor he makes exceptionable handcrafted coils for an awesome price so it makes you guys go check him out I'll leave his information down below so let's open it up will small let you know what I got from the smell will vapor when I go over to vapor production throat hit flavor I mean how the exhale I'll play if it's an all day vape for me if I recommend it to you why I wonder why I would not go out and buy it well grade each category a being the best at being the worst and then we'll wrap it up so here we go so if the blue razz is definitely there it's a really nice sweet blue razz candy flavor so I'm gonna give a smell on this and a I've always enjoyed the smell of this play of this eye liquid it smells fantastic so we'll go ahead and give it a name and I'm really I don't know it's maybe a blue blue razz airhead just bluegrass candy in general but it's got a really fantastic smell I wouldn't say it's a bluegrass hard candy it's definitely a blue razz chilly candy that's what it reminds me of all right so we already got it ready to go here in the Bumi Tech crystal ball let's up of eight got that 85 watts and the coils are running out to about 0.15 and also just to show you guys the bottle up front plain and simple just got the air factory logo there but um some blue going on all over it just looks like a bluegrass candy all right and vapor production in 70/30 blend doing normally what a 1730's expect it we'll go ahead and give it a solid B for that Mike's dense milky clouds I'll do another one for you throat hit minimal too hard very smoothly inhale and the exhale getting no throat hit from this and again I'm sorry this is a zero so there's not gonna be a throat hit anyway but even in the free milligram blue R as much I've had which I have had before I didn't get a throat hit either but of course in a zero you're not gonna get anything obviously but um really smooth e-liquid though even in a three milligram flavor let's may pull a little bit more and then we're gonna go ahead and start hittin on the flavour so this in my opinion is definitely in all day vape I can easily vape it all day it's a really good blue razz candy flavor um I guess it kind of does remind me of a blue raspberry had to be honest with you it's definitely a blue rose chewy candy it's kind of in my opinion this has the perfect amount of sweetness to it I don't like a liquid set or just over overkill on the up sweetener this definitely is sweet but it's not it's not taking it to that next level where it's just uh you know overkill and just ripping through my coils and cotton although you know it does do a little bit of a number on the coils in the cotton after some time it's not as bad as some other II like what's out there let me do a couple more but the flavor I'm getting from the crystal ball here is absolutely top-notch that's why I decide sometimes to go ahead and use this because it puts off really really good flavor and um I'm gonna go ahead and say on the inhale it's it is what it is when the inhale any exhale there's no difference or no change in flavor on this one it's a straight-up chewy blue razz candy with a nice little uh what a nice kick of a nice little sweetness to it all right make it a like it likes a little picking out sweetness on the initial inhale on the exhale it leaves a really good taste on the on your lips terribly is a really good aftertaste as well it's just a really good well-balanced blue rescue candy in my opinion I'm gonna get the flavor in a this has always been a one of my favorites when it comes with blue razz flavors I know that subjective of course a lot of people would disagree but I put this over I'll put this over a lot of other blue revs candy flavors that I've had for instance I did a review on the I love candy and that they're bluegrass flavor this absolutely blows it out of order in my opinion um so yeah I would recommend this to anybody using the blue rasp waivers if you're looking for a really good sweet but not too sweet blue razz to me candy flavor you can't go wrong with this one in my honest opinion all right here we are with the wild apple from a factory and this one is in a 3 milligram now I had this a while back and from what I remember I really enjoyed it it was a really good nice all day vape but it's been quite some time since I've had it so here's the bottle just as the air factory logo with all the green let's open it up have a smell so yeah I'm gonna give this one an 8 - again this is 100% it's a wild apple candy flavor you can absolutely pick that up when you smell this it has a nice little tartness - it's not overbearing at all it just has a really really nice wild Apple smell alright so we already got it ripped and ready to go here any FME tech crystal ball I went ahead and tripped all the old blue Razzleberry so here we go it's update and as you can see from the bacon production just like the blue razz it's doing exactly what a 1730's expected we're just gonna go and drip a little bit more in there so yeah for dad I'm gonna go ahead and give it a solid be definitely nice and a nice dense clouds lingering around for a while so we'll go ahead give it a solid B all right and throat hit on a scale of minimal to hard and even in a three milligram which is still not that much this is it's it's smooth guys on both the inhale and the exhale I honestly can't tell any difference really between the three and the zero really smoothly inhale in exhale so it's pretty much non-existent when it comes to the throat hit flavor we're gonna vape on a little bit more and then we're gonna get in all that so the tartness from this I will say is absolutely on the money it's in my opinion the perfect amount it's just that has a really a really good little bite to it so that I don't I like the fact that it's not it doesn't have like an overbearing you know sour apple flavor to it but it's got in my opinion the perfect amount of that tartness it just really kind of just kicks you right there on the on the lips and and in the back of the throat there so for that I've really enjoyed this a lot I like the tartness of that green apple and on the inhale it is what it is guys on the inhale any exhale this is 100% a chewy wild apple candy I mean to the tea what a nice tartness there on the XL I'm really enjoying this one let me do a couple more and then I'll let you know witchity to that I personally prefer more but there is absolutely no mistaken when you vape this what it is it's definitely a wild apple chewy candy so I'll say for the simple fact just because I'm in the bluegrass flavors more I prefer to bluegrass but that's not to say that I couldn't easily make this all day because I could so if you're in the wild apple flavors and you like that tartness from the wild apple 100% I think you're gonna thoroughly enjoy this one um honestly this probably this end of bluegrass would probably be really good mixed together so if you mix a little bit together a little 50/50 blend they're you know half a DI wild apple half nobly rise shake it up a little bit and drip it I think it would be absolutely out of this world in my opinion it's probably something I'm gonna try actually when we're all done the review so yeah I would definitely recommend this to you listen if you're not an apple flavors as obviously it's not gonna be the one for you but if you're looking for a good while at Apple chewy candy hands-down I think you found one right here so that's it I would definitely recommend it to you and um make sure you guys like comment subscribe don't forget to click that bell it'll alert you whenever I put up a new review I got plenty of other reviews coming for you guys

"oxgFUJY0-DY": "hey guys it's me Caitlin and this week's theme on designated tutorial week so that's gonna do once it started so mean Ashley just making jolly rancher lollipops to start by getting as many jolly ranchers as you want actually still finding jolly ranchers and just got some Forks down cuz we get 0 half sticks so these are our sticks I gasp wink and no I'm just using its way down there just gonna be like suckers you pick up with your hands oh that's cool and then we're having some the manor room and we are just preheating mom and I think 352 350 so let's see if Kaitlyn knows how to do this are you oh never mind so stop it ticking he's all an interest but we don't have a lot of drama actress Ashley would you like to explain some stuff so you just take your data ranchers user ID left everyone's i'm exid i gave me up a long time back and goes for christmas so gotta get rid of them so we just unwrapped the Jolly Ranchers so we have four green and to rad I won't see us oh and then what you're going to do is you're going to put one green but you can choose your parent thing in one rag and one green and we have six trailer interest to make two lollipops for me and Megan over a home alone and you can also spacematt little if you wanted your lollipops like longer because they will expand so you could like space them out a tiny bit so they're like a little longer we're just going to keep them together and then we have among wax paper and you're going to put the preheated oven at 350 for like four minutes and and then you just keep watching them yeah but we're going to show you what to do and how to fail this a minute felis then we're going to put these in the 350 degree oven without learning years and now I'm going to rearrange these because they got out before good things she's doing and not me because I would burn down the house and now you just watched them profusely they're melting but I first me is scared they weren't gonna melt so a world least one of them is not drink so really crap so so yeah these are how they turn out I'm just gonna make change for these under-the-table nowaday can just pull back because the greater is cooler than any hot and you can have get him to like spread if you wanted thankful to that also what would be cool we should we should try this is I think I've seen it done somewhere though haven't you Caitlin I want to say

recipe is for hennessy popcorn and it's the same one you use to make regular candy popcorn and also a caramel popcorn so it just depends on which one you like and you actually just use the same ingredients just you're either gonna add vanilla caramel flavoring or you're gonna add whatever type of alcohol you prefer so here are the ingredients here you're gonna need 10 cups of popcorn um you can use popcorn kernels or you can use popcorn that's already been pop it doesn't matter it's your preference you're just gonna have to convert it to make sure that you have 10 cups of popcorn pop the popcorn then you're gonna need some brown sugar whatever food coloring you prefer butter like I said before vanilla or caramel flavoring you can put actual real caramel in or whatever alcohol you want and you're gonna need Carroll syrup or corn syrup for your utensils you're gonna need a larger bowl some parchment paper a silicone spatula if you have one or a spoon and a cookie sheet so any like a large medium to large saucepan you are gonna put 3/4 stick of butter 1/2 a cup of corn syrup 1 cup of brown sugar light or dark 2 teaspoons of caramel or caramel extract that is optional 1 teaspoon of salt that's everything you're gonna put into this pot and then you just mix it so you're gonna dump all those ingredients right on in here together and just mix it up the caramel extract or caramel is optional because that's in case you are making caramel popcorn if you are making regular candy popcorn you will omit that so as you can see is getting to a little a little bit of a boil you are gonna want to heat this in your pot for about seven minutes so you need to bring this to a boil once you see that is boiling you're gonna leave it boiling for seven minutes just time it out perfectly and everything will come out great so now it has come to a rolling boil this is when you want to take it off once you see the rolling boil after seven minutes then it's ready now you're gonna remove that from the heat and just let it settle down for a little while about five minutes and you want to add your alcohol it's gonna be five tablespoons if you're not adding alcohol you're only gonna add your extract so right now you will either add alcohol extract or flavoring oil if you want and also your food coloring [Music] now you are going to pour the mixture over your popcorn you're just going to take it and pour it completely all of it in over the popcorn it's like this so once that is all in there you are going to mix it up stir and mix that in well like I said before if you're gonna make regular candy popcorn you will have this whatever color you want it to be it actually makes a really vibrant color so that's one thing a lot I like about this recipe so you don't need too many stars but just make sure you get everything fully incorporated I have a little more in my pen that I am going to pour in little extra and that looks good just mix that in and when you do this part you want to work fairly quickly because it does start to get hard so you don't have all the time in the world you just want to pour it completely over each piece of popcorn okay now you're gonna take your cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and just pour the popcorn right onto this we want to spread it around as even as possible just for even cooking just want to spread it off as best as you can doesn't have to be perfect and this is going to bake in the oven at 250 for 30 minutes every 10 minutes you want to stir so once you get that pretty even on your cookie sheets you're gonna pop this cookie sheet right into your oven middle rack for 30 minutes but make sure you come back and start every 10 minutes because you do not want the popcorn to burn so stirring every 10 minutes absolutely helps with that so after 10 minutes you're sort of gonna be chopping it I'm not necessarily stirring but same concept you can stir you don't want to chop it as like breaking the popcorn up but it's why I'm showing you now you kind of want to just flip it folding it over basically folding it onto itself and then you're gonna push it back down so just keep flipping that and be careful not to break it up into tiny pieces so this is the first ten minutes and I'm gonna put it back in for another 10 minutes so once the 30 minutes has gone by its gonna come right out of the oven and you want to immediately dump it into a separate bowl or a plate or whatever you have just to sit it out to dry so now don't fit fairly quickly because it starts to dry and you don't want it to dry on to your personal taste so you're gonna and you are gonna leave this out to dry about 15 minutes should do it I am gonna post the recipe and also if you want to make the color candy popcorn you are gonna use white sugar instead of brown sugar so this is just one of the classes that I teach if you want to know more information you know how to contact me I do make just about everything and you're gonna break this up into pieces once it's cooled down you're gonna break it and you can hear the crunch it's hard is crunchy and it's ready just take your little cases and it breaks really really easily it'll break right up then you're gonna pop it into whatever you container you're going to use you can use a bag like this or you can use a mason jar a lot of different containers however type of package you want you can put your sticker on there tie it with a little bow and that is the finished product", "3mA2FaNRZ2A": "welcome to 420 rx cannabis cooking and confectionaries here's Jamie hi

and then there's two maple there's two BBQ and then there's two honey and then when I figured out it came with maple I wasn't very like oh wow just got some maple cuz I don't know I like maple and stuff but I don't that I didn't think like the maple and the bacon would really go to go together but the good thing is if you like maple it's perfect don't even think about the bacon if you don't like bacon it doesn't even matter because you leave me taste the bacon I mean yes it is the bacon lollipop and there is tiny little bacon bits a little tiny dot things on them but if you just lick the back in the front you don't taste bacon and so yeah you don't really taste the bacon and also if you're just like Mabel that's perfect and probably in the barbecue I'm probably in the honey they're both you don't really taste the bacon but to taste the bacon if you do like maple and bacon you're like oh you don't really taste the bacon you just like biting it just bite it right off they bite a big and start chewing it like I break a piece off of the lollipop like that and just like chew it and you will definitely taste the bacon and the maple because there's tiny little bits and if you try to get the little tiny bits off and you do it does taste like bacon it doesn't taste like all the it's all like crunchy or anything but it's still really good so I give this like a ten out of ten because first of all I thought it wasn't gonna be good at all like I didn't think it was gonna be good and it's just fantastic like with the taste that's like seven like it's good taste it's like five out of five tastes like it's not watered down or it doesn't it's like a really once you lick it off and if you just constantly yeah mmm your mouth it's always a very high taste of maple so definitely recommend these going vat19.com and there's categories at the very bottom of the website or just typing like bacon and it'll just pop right up it'll come with if you want to check out the bacon just the bacon lollipop it's not the breakfast lollipops let's take pin bacon you can like see which one is cheap or watch one like you want to try best or even if you want to get two and this is a really cheap so that's another good thing that's why I give it a 10/10 it's ten dollars for four big huge lollipops I mean look at these it's like it's like as close to my face no but um look at that that's my poem that's like it's a big lollipop I can like it's big I'm gonna try to fit in my mouth back I can definitely recommend these and I think you should go get them so yeah that's why yeah so back on the rate 10 out of 10 definitely the taste is fantastic if you do get a little if you do get the chance of fighting a little bit of the bacon off that's really good and it's a big lollipop I mean it's it's big it's gonna last a long time it's going to like it's it's gonna be nice if you just see them on yeah probably one of the candy stores there's probably is probably them at the candy stores

lollipops you're gonna need one third of a cup of corn syrup one cup of sugar and one tablespoon of water um a thermometer and um some lemon flavoring or as a matter of fact just any flavoring doesn't have to be lemon and then i'm using red dye so um first you you're just gonna put all these ingredients in side of a pan and make sure the corn syrup gets down well yeah so i spilled my water so i'm gonna go refill that a little so you're gonna put the water and the sugar and then you're just gonna put it on this stove over here and boil it until 300 degrees fahrenheit um you could put it on low or medium low but you just have to make sure that you're always stirring it um because that could really do something bad so i'm just gonna keep stirring it until it's kind of like um has a watery substance um not so much chunky it's been about three minutes and um we're like more than halfway there right now um more than 100 degrees so i would just keep stirring until it gets to 300 so we're on our way now um it's time to pour our suckers i think okay so i do want to give you a warning this it's like um acid lava it will burn right through your skin you don't you definitely don't want to touch it so um yeah um so i'm just gonna turn the stove off now and as carefully as i possibly can it's not very heavy so that's good um i'm gonna bring it over here and then i'm gonna take my food coloring and pour one or two drops in two drops will make it more red one drop will make it like a pinkish color and if you want it to actually be red you would probably have to put like a lot of drops in you need to add this in before it gets too cold yes you do need to add the lemon in before it gets too very cold okay you're fine okay okay um you're not gonna put like one or two drops of lemon like i know this looks like a lot but um the lemon flavor you can't really taste it so um you're just gonna keep mixing it you might want to mix it fast if you left it out for a while because um it does get cold very quickly oh i can smell the lemon okay these are gonna be good lollipops so now i'm just gonna get a spoon of this and let it drip there and i'm gonna pour it onto the carton paper and then i'm just gonna put a stick in here so there's my stick this is kind of a mini lollipop i've made giganto ones i've made super tiny ones which that would be this um you probably want to get quite a bit in there and you're just gonna keep doing that until you think you have enough lollipops so um i've been pouring some of my lollipops and it's um it's hardening really quickly i do want to let you know once you have poured all your lollipops if you manage to do it without the mixture hardening so quickly um you're going to let them sit for 10 minutes and then check on them after they're um after 10 minutes passes by um i have tried letting them sit for 10 minutes and it wasn't working so you might want to let them sit for more time than that as you can see my mixture is really hardening right now which isn't very good so i'm gonna try to get as much lollipops as i can out of it unless you just want one or two then you can use half the amount of everything that we used so this is one of the lollipops um this is basically how they all turned out um there is a little bit left in the mixture my mom also put it on the oven another time and it did get like um the texture changes you can see this one is um more clearer and this one is foggier um but yeah they all pretty much turned out great and they taste delicious bye", "UNa08MLeyWo": "a my Legion I got something else from Japan cry want to do the rest of the lollipop reviews from the fuji a lollipop bag got last one i have to do is orange I can get to shyness see not showing it won't it's got the

hope all of you are well and I know this is a really odd time for every single one of us but I hope you coming to these channels on YouTube or giving you some sort of escape enjoyment entertainment and we will continue the doobies for you whether it's my channel or another channel to laugh a little to cry with us and just try something new and speaking of trying something new our friends over at Reds have created a brand new eliquid flavor strawberry actually actually it's it's not new at all is it I mean if we're being honest strawberry is like the first flavor that most illiquid companies try out with and maybe they did but they decide to go with well apple hence the name the company big shout out to central cloud vapors in Daly City California the brothers for sending me a sample of their strawberry flavor and this is actually the iced version they do have your standard regular non iced version as well - I like ice so I'm gonna try iced we're gonna try it with the mod here so let's give it a shot oh no you can see the edge of my green screen I mean I'm really in my office this is not a green screen at all yeah this is totally in my honest opinion it's strawberry it's strawberry on ice it's exactly what you thought it would be if nothing less nothing more it's really really nothing to write home about if I'm being honest with you guava was more of a you know like a throw out and see if it sticks kind of flavor and for me doesn't really work but I know some of you do like the guava as much as you like I think it was a peach that they did mango one of those two things but those are a little bit more unique in that but strawberry I mean come on red strap it that's at least five years old now I mean everyone's tried strawberry the probably done was dropping I'm done with strawberry I had to try it though for you guys and also cuz you know I'm always a sucker for new flavors but it's it's really not new simply put it's it works if they have nothing else to the vape shop go with it it's fine you're not gonna be disappointed at all but it's not gonna be an adv unless it's you know again in this weird time vape shops generally aren't even open so if that's all you can find in your nicotine level then yes you will be happy with it but by the time that you do have the availability to get your other ATVs and other flavors you won't be happy to go back because it's for me at least it's just nothing nothing new nothing exciting but that's just me that's just my opinion if you guys have different opinions please leave that in the comment section

to you guys in the next one stay safe hi [Music]", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music]

got to try my\nhomemade Caramel Apples. When apples are in season,\nthis is a must make recipe. Hey, you're watching \"Preppy\nKitchen,\" where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make\ndelicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These Caramel Apples\nwill be ready in a snap. So let's get started. First off, let's talk about the apples. You have a lot of choices here, and really any eating apple will work. I like the traditional Granny Smith because it's really tart and that pairs nicely with the caramel. Another thing though, is that your apple's\nprobably covered in wax, we need to get that off\nbecause the wax is slippery, and when the hot caramel\ntouches it, what's gonna happen? Slides right off, not good. So take your apple and\ndip it in some really hot, scalding or almost boiling water, and then use a clean kitchen\ntowel and rub it vigorously. Polish it up like you're\ngiving it to a teacher. Just continue this process. I have a couple honeycrisps in here because that's Brian's favorite apple, so it'll be a nice treat for him. I love fall in New England, the beautiful colors, the\nbrisk chill in the air and of course, all the apples. We have a ton of apples here on the farm and even though I'm\nusing the Granny Smith, our varieties are so\ndelicious too, perfect. After the stems are removed, it's time to attach an apple stick, add it through the center, and then try and get it straight\nthrough, not too crooked. These are something else\nthat you can get there, pieces of plastic that look like sticks, that's what they look like. All right, the apples is\ngonna hang out in the fridge while we make the caramel. It's not a must-do, but I find that a cool apple kind of helps the caramel cling\non and set up more quickly. Now it's time to make the caramel, and if you've made caramel before, it's very similar but different. So here's the deal. (laughs loudly) Let me start off by adding almost all the ingredients into our pot. Two cups or 400 grams of brown sugar, and I'm using a combination\nof light and dark, one, because it doesn't really matter and two, it's like the\ntwo open bags I had so. I need half a teaspoon of salt, five tablespoons or about\n70 grams of unsalted butter, if you want to use salted butter, just reduce the salt by\na quarter of a teaspoon that you're adding in, one and a half cups or\nabout 350 ml of heavy cream, and finally, the secret ingredient for your caramel is Corn Syrup, this will help it become much more sticky and cling on to your apples. I don't use Corn Syrup all the time, but when I do, it's\nbecause it's necessary, it really is needed for some recipes. Before I put this on heat, here's what you should have on hand, because you do not wanna\ngo searching around once this has started. Okay, a wooden spoon. This is to stir things in the beginning, and the wooden spoon is not going to change the temperature\nof the caramel very much, and because it doesn't conduct heat, it's not gonna burn\nyour hand, double bonus. A little bit of water to\ndip your pastry brush into, the pastry brush will\nbrush the sides down, it's really important\nnot to scorch the glide. And the last thing is a\ncandy thermometer, right? Let's set this over a\nmedium, low heat right now, and we're gonna stir until things are melted in homologous. So once it's all melty and fine, then we can stop stirring. All right? So I'm just gonna\nstir this over that medium, low heat, I'm really waiting\nfor that butter to melt. So, you can speed this up through editing. (soft chiming) Everything is basically melted, I'm gonna stop stirring\nand switch my pastry brush. Just wash the sides down, you don't want all that stuff burning. If you watch my channel,\nyou've heard this before, but having a nice thick\nwalled pot is so important. A lot of times, if you're\nusing a really thin walled pot, scorches everything either\ninvest in a nice pot, or you can find them secondhand, super cheap and see that\nthe walls are thick, it makes a huge difference,\nthat's all washed down. Now we can switch to our thermometer and just check things out. I want this to be in the Soft Ball Stage, that's 235 to 245 Fahrenheit, I'll put the Celsius in the card blocks, I don't remember it offhand. This is why you don't wanna\nuse a small pot for this, In fact, the caramel will be bubbly, so if it was a tiny pot,\nhuge mess, no, no, no. We're gonna take this off heat, it just reached 235 after\na caramel has been off heat for a minute or two, go ahead and mix in one tablespoon or 15 ml of a nice vanilla, they'll add some good\nflavor to your caramel. Okay, mix that In, and you can see the consistency of the caramel is pretty like, it's pretty thickened. We're gonna set the caramel\naside for five to 10 minutes, it kind of depends on\nthe ambient temperature of your kitchen, but\nthe dipping temperature is gonna be around 190 Fahrenheit. So yeah, this is like\nstill exactly 235 degrees (pot clicking) and take a minute. Make sure that caramel's\ntotally off heats. I was like, why is this still\nlike 0.3 degrees cooler. It should be cooler by now, It's 'cause it was on ultra low, I turned the knob the wrong way. While the caramel chills, set up a little station for dipping them because you wanna work kind of quickly and chances are, you want to\ndecorate these apples as well, you could totally do them\njust plain, a caramel though they will be delicious and pretty. I'm gonna to do some mini M&Ms, some sprinkles and some chopped peanuts. So, chop the peanuts on\nyour tiny cutting board, dump that into a bowl. The Last thing you need is\na place to put the apples, they're gonna be super sticky\nand it would be heartbroken if your apple was stuck to a\npiece of paper or the counter. So you want them to cool on the\nleast sticky thing possible. It's gonna be a silicone sheet if you have any Silicone\nBaking Sheets, get one out and if you don't, use a piece of parchment paper, it'll also work. My caramel just hit one 190 so, let's pour into a little bowl, this stuff is delicious by the way, and yes, you can make caramels out of this like little packaged caramels, do it, same recipe, dip your apple in, give it a little bit of a turn and you can even scrape the bottom off if you want it to have\nless caramel on the bottom, now it's ready to either place onto our Silicone Baking Sheet or you can decorate it. So this one, for example, could get some little\nmini M&Ms cutting it. Is that too many or just\nenough? I don't know. (dryer whooshing) Okay, so here's the real, if you see a bunch of\nair bubbles hanging out in your caramel, that's not gonna be\ngiving you a pretty apple, So use a hairdryer or a heat gun if you have one and just pop them. (dryer whooshing) It's back to dipping apples, here we go, and then\ncontinue decorating it, this one's gonna get some sprinkles on it, it doesn't seem to get a\nlittle bit of everything on it. So, some peanuts, some M&Ms\nand then some sprinkles, it's the Monster Apple. This monster is ready to cool down and I might be jumping into it later but I wanted to talk to you about what to do with the excess caramel, this is not waste, We're gonna make some little\ncaramel candies for it. So clear this away and let's move along. Just plop them either\nonto a piece of silicone like I am or onto a very\nlike maybe lightly oiled piece of parchment paper, form it into either like a log, a brick, whatever shape you want. and as you can see, it really will not stick to the silicone and this is perfect. From a caramel into a breaker log and then set it aside to cool completely. Once it's cooled, you can\ncut it into smaller pieces and either enjoy it right away or wrap it into a partial paper for later. Now let's cut that caramel apple up, I want a bite. If you like this recipe,\ncheck out my fall playlist, all my favorite fall recipes\nin one playlist for you. But now it's time for a bite. That was so delicious, I love the apple, the caramel and the toppings all working together and every bite.

a dripper bottle but now they're just messy and useless and give this [ __ ] a good shake and plus if you drop him your you drop the bottle it breaks put it in I think the the companies even naked 100

probably I still do hate you know even my naked my naked one I don't like these seals and [ __ ] but I mean it's it's as this [ __ ] leaking are you serious you can smell a lot of grape though I'll tell you that [ __ ] yeah alright so you guys can see transferred over from the box the labels all that good [ __ ] good to go given the pricing information and open her up yeah that's just straight-up grape Wow this this grape is like very sweet it's not a sweet crepe but it's got that harsh miss at the end which I I'm not a fan of to be honest with you yeah it's got that Apple like that really crisp really sharp hard apple taste to it so I would imagine it's a grape Apple yeah all right so let's go ahead and saturate damn holy Excelsior's did I give you a description I am so caught up in all the [ __ ] maybe I should give you a description all right it's been one of the most sought-after each's you guys already know all right sink your teeth into crisp juicy flavor with

Apple II kind of taste to it and this is not bad yes I'm getting the Apple and the grape I mean to be honest with you it's it's not a bad juice it's actually really good no throat hey good vapor production and that's pretty much all I got I mean it's a really good apple juice like apple juice and grape it's really really good not bad the only qualms I have is just get rid of these glass bottles and go with the Yuni bottles like everybody else you're into grape apple absolutely good and jump on that [ __ ] I know I'm a little late to the game but you know it is what it is right so

underneath it how does how does and why that they double they double that I just told you my I had a freshman I was frustrated with the first one so they give me a second one you see almost slipped

little bit of weirdness at the end there it is after Yuri saturate hid the flavors come through them not a bad juice apples and berries really good yep that's not bad so just like coastal clouds Reds apples I should have reviewed them a long time ago because they do have some really good ejuice vapor smells good too I like when I went in a juice the vapor smells nice it just it's just Pleasant you

watching if you guys enjoyed that if you in guys speak English if you guys enjoyed this video guide and slap a big fat thumbs up on it and if you haven't subbed to this channel go ahead and do some reduce our vacations on so you guys get the father I'll talk to you guys in the next one deuces [Music]", "XskMydRGJYo": "hey did you waive all my candy huh you're supposed to meet back here [Music] [Music] yeah what's up YouTube hi YouTube babe heads back again with another one of our juice reviews comparing them to the food they're supposed to taste like today we'll be looking at bazooka blue raspberry sour straws so we couldn't find any blue raspberry sour straw candies but we got these blue raspberry sour belts and these blue raspberry sour Pharaoh's so let's eat and vape and we'll let you know what we think here we go so thus our belts were way sweeter and way more sour than the e-juice so we're going to compare them to the sour barrels and this juice is very close I was hesitant to buy this juice because I had the sour in it I didn't know how that would translate in an e liquid but it works it works well it's not like Tucker face sour but more like a sour patch kids sour it also has a pretty good sweetness has about the same sweetness as the barrels but way less sweeter than the sour belts we like sweet juices and this one has enough sweetness and the blue raspberry is there it's not overpowering at all but I would have liked a little bit more that blue raspberry flavor but they went more of a mellow candy and it probably appeals to more vapors this way you get sweet and sour on the inhale and then it mellows out on the exhale and you get the blue raspberry out on the exhale speaking of the sweetness this juice is very good on the coils these are coils from two days of vaping in an RDA I can vape this juice for like four or five days without changing my cotton and cleaning my coils and I can't do that with any of my other favorite juices if you buy the 200 mils they give you two 15 mil bottles so you don't have to carry around this big juice bottle these gorilla bottles are great for carrying around a juice and great for dripping after you screw off the cap that is they're also great for filling any tanks plastic squeeze bottles are my favorite for eliquid but it's always better to cut the tip a little because it comes out better and especially in the big ones if you don't cut it and squeeze it too much the pressure can make the top come off and you'll have a huge mess and that's happened to me before and it sucks when you get this juice it will come in this box and I use it to put all my captain so I like when great products come with extra packaging stuff so now they also make these in 60 MLS that's good because if you never try to juice e4 it sucks to commit to 200 ml of it and it comes in zero three and six milligram nicotine strings nothing higher so you mouth to lung vapors this is probably not for you so I like what juices tell you the ratio of VG and PG but this bottle says 20 percent PG 70 percent USP glycerine and 20 percent flavoring that makes a hundred and ten percent this is not the first time I've seen a ratio like this so will somebody please explain to me in the comments it looks like a 70/30 and that USP glycerine is supposedly a farmer grade glycerine so from what I understand it's better than the food grade vegetable glycerin but not entirely sure you can find this juice on very big vaping site like vapor DNA has the sixteen obatala for $24.99 an element vape has both 60 mil bottles for 1995 and 200 mils for 39.95 200 mils for 40 bucks wrong this is one of the cheapest uses I've ever purchased and my little local vape shop has this juice so it's everywhere it won't be hard to find this juice so of course we're going to test these and different setups for y'all we have an RTA and subong tank with bazooka in it so the flavor is about the same in an RTA but it gets even more mellow yeah and it gets even more mellow that and subong tanks so for me this juice has to be pushed at higher wattages in an RDA to get that true sour candy flavor so I would have suggest this juice for tanks I just use this to drink I usually only use our TAS so I bake this in an RTA and I think it's fine but definitely a higher wattage so if you guys budget your money for a juice then you can get 200 mils of this stuff for only 40 bucks so if you like candy vapes and you think you'll like those sour notes then this is a great a juice so this juice definitely passing the vape Ed's test even though it didn't taste like those sour belt it did taste like the sour blue raspberry barrels so you can't go wrong with this a juice it's sweet its sour and it's candy so with this information you can decide if fate bazooka is for you peace ah [Music] remember guys if you enjoyed this video please like and subscribe and if you have a juice that you want to put up to the vapor edge test leave it in the comment bye yeah you go to sleep enough is that enough and sedation what is the word and two fists and suffice rar the bear went over the rocks costclub plus I'm Italian I can't help it sorry nice", "mmFXOFtiZf4": "I love caramel apples they're delicious but honestly they're awkward to eat I mean it's an apple on a stick today I'm going to show you a delicious easy way to make caramel apples that's gonna be super fun for parties and you can make them at home there's so many fun things happening in the fall like tailgating and Halloween parties so I thought it'd be fun to take one of my favorite recipes from this time of year and turn it into an appetizer of sorts I'm calling these caramel apple pops the recipe can be found in the description below the first thing we want to do is get our apples ready so what we did with these is we boiled them in hot water for about 5 seconds apples from the store and normally come with wax on the outside and that wax actually repels caramel and I want to make this as easy as possible on you at home so we went ahead and boiled that wax off and then took a dry cloth and just rubbed them really good after we took them out of the hot water that way they're ready to go and they're ready to be dipped and one of my favorite ways to cut apples actually is to cut around the core it makes it easier so almost like you're leaving a little square in the center you could use an apple corer but I just prefer this method to me it's a little easier so I'm going to cut these into hearty slices and then I'm gonna put lemon juice on top the reason why I'm doing lemon juice is so I can prevent these from turning brown because the last thing I want to do is present these at a party in they're brown and they look Genki now here's a trick we want to have a lemon juice on these it's gonna give it a nice little tangy flavor but when we go to dip them in the caramel I'm gonna make sure all the moisture is off of the slices so the caramel will stick if we were just to make the caramel and dip a wet apple into it it's not really gonna stick you want them to be as dry as possible when we go to dipping them in the caramel so we have those sitting we're gonna let those soak a little bit in the lemon juice to make sure they get really good and protected from browning and we're gonna start our caramel so what we have is 8 ounces of soft caramels and put those in our pocket and I'm going to add a tablespoon and a half of heavy whipping cream and we're gonna get our heat going you're gonna want it to be on about medium-low because if you crank it up too high and you start boiling the caramel it's gonna burn and it's gonna be a hot mess disaster and while our caramel is melting we are going to use treat sticks you can find them at your local craft store you can buy them I'm sure online Hot Tips make this even easier to stick our treat sticks into our apples is you're going to trim a little bit off the bottom of your apple just to make sure it's flat it will be easily inserted great so super cute there's our first one so again while our caramel is melting we're gonna build all of our pops so when I was a kid I loved Halloween in one way because I loved getting dressed up as a princess so any excuse to put on like a tiara and a frilly dress and frolic around like I was the cat's pajamas my favorite Halloween costume was when I dressed up like Cinderella that was me however the boys in my neighborhood would jump out from the bushes and scare you as you're trick-or-treating so I got to the point where I could barely go out I would cry before trying to leave a house because I was so scared of these neighborhood boys but I did love candy so I would eventually overcome my fears and go trick-or-treating okay this caramel is melting it's looking good so you want to make sure your caramel is bubbling a little bit but you don't want it to get really really hot because then it will burn and your you will know that it's burning because you'll get these little like dark brown pieces in the bottom I don't know I'm sure but yeah you don't want dark brown pieces you want it to look really smooth and creamy so I'm gonna take this off because I don't want to burn I'm going to let it cool down for a little bit because when you're building your caramel apple pops you don't want the caramel to be really hot because it won't stick to your caramel apples so we want to let this cool for a few minutes just so it's really thick and then we'll bring it back out and we will dip our apples so we have our apple pops all set up ready to go again I made sure and took as much of the moisture out of these as I could with a paper towel I just really dried them off really good to make sure the caramel can stick to the Apple pops and also when we dip these we're really trying to get the caramel to stick to the skin you know when you see a big caramel apple the caramel is all around on the skin because that's a good conduit for it but the flesh part is a little more challenging so we're really going to focus on getting the caramel on the skin and this caramel is cold for a couple minutes so we are ready to dip these apples so when I did youdid we all do I was told not to sing that for copyright reasons all right let's start dipping these hop number one done I'm gonna put it down and I put our topping on it I'll do this one with sprinkles and it's much easier to sprinkle your toppings on top and said have you taken the pop and just dipping it in there so pop number two just dipping it in there getting it really good on the skin gorgeous we're just gonna keep on dipping I still want to see a little bit of the green skin so when I'm dipping these I'm not gonna dip the entire Apple you're just getting that just get the hip pretzel this one up I love the pretzel topping it's kind of like salted caramel it's delish and again we're just doing one Apple here you can use mini apples as you want this makes a good amount of caramel so I mean dip to your heart's content okay so we have some with sprinkles some with bretzel some with Reese's Pieces some with nuts but you could do whatever toppings you want chocolate chips you can even add a chocolate drizzle if you like but these are ready to go I'm gonna let them sit in the fridge for about 10 to 15 minutes just to get them set really nice and well and then we're gonna bring them out to serve so I have some of our caramel apple pops already made and dips but I wanted to set up an apple dippin station for when I have my friends over to enjoy these caramel apples and I love food that's interactive I mean who doesn't love interactive party food and I wanted to set it up too so that my guests can make their Apple pops and dip them in the caramel and I also had in mind like how can I make this look fall and rustic and feel like a Halloween party or a fall party so I have this burlap table runner this wooden cutting board it just feels a lot like fall and also when I'm thinking about my Apple station I was thinking about like what do people enjoy on caramel apples I personally love chocolate so I have some Reese's Pieces peanut butters are great combo store chocolate and peanut butter is perfect some people like salty so we have some nuts and some chopped up pretzels or you could do like fun sprinkles or maybe even a little like orange and purple sanding sugar something fun like that I am super excited about fall I feel like this whole set up is a perfect way to walk them and fall before I get to dip in I want to capture this set up [Music] so cute hmm these are delicious but I want to see how you style your caramel apple Bob's tag at Pop kitchen on Instagram or comment below I want to know what you want to see me style next", "hABgu3tSA_0": "Hello everybody. My name is Tasha and welcome to Heart of Tarts.  On today's show we will make a Lollipop Lollipop \n oh Lolli Lolli pop tart. Here we go. To begin you are going to preheat your oven to  350 degrees F Then to a food processor you are going to add in 1 \n 1/2 cups old fashion oats, along with 5 pitted dates,  1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  Once you have pulverized it down to a flour, you are going \n to add in 1/4 cup water and 3 tablespoons coconut oil. Pulse that until everything is just moistened and sticking together Pulse that until everything is just moistened and sticking together and then press the crust mixture around the sides \n and bottom of a 9 inch tart pan. Bake that for 15 minutes until it is brown and \n dry and then we can make our filling. I am making a green filling just to keep \n it candy land-isk. I love candyland, don't you? I can live in Candyland. I love sugar so so much, but let's get \n back to the tart. This is not about my obsessive sugar addiction To the food processor, you are going to add in \n two peeled bananas, one peeled and pitted avocado,  and one teaspoon vanilla extract. Blend that to a puree then spread evenly around your cooled tart crust. Now we can start with our lollipop design.  I have a couple of colors here, you can \n use more colors than I have.  I have purple grapes, which I am going to start my spiral pattern \n with and then you are going to stop right before you get back to where you started so that you can loop \n it inward and keep going like a lollipop swirls around. And then I have chopped the peel and just outer layer of flesh of \n a red apple as you can see I am doing here and  I lined those pieces up along with the purple grapes. Now that I am thinking of it, I probably should have put the \n green apple between the red and the purple just to  break it up a little bit more, but it still looks \n fantastic and now that I think about it,  the red would have ended up next to the purple again anyway once \n we swirled it all around. If I am thinking about this correctly Just line the fruit up and swirl it inward until you \n get to the inside and you are basically done. Now some people ask, \"How do you go about \n dissembling your tart, cutting it and serving it?\" Well today I am just going to show you how \n I take it out of the tart pan. It should be loose along the sides and if it is not don't force \n it. Just loosen it with a knife and it should pop right out. I have a plate ready to receive the tart along \n with the removable part of the tart pan. Just place it on that all together. I am just going to finish off my \n lollipop with a lollipop candy stick.  As you can see, I taped two of them together and \n I just stuck it into the crust through the filling. It stayed pretty stiff. I really enjoyed how Candyland and lollipop \n this tart turned out and hopefully you will too. If you did give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to \n my YouTube channel Heart of Tarts. I'll be here tomorrow. Bye.", "S7Rtqb8yHOc": "to my channel today we're gonna do like a tasting like dum dum lollipops and likes like each flavor to see if they're good and we're gonna do it with J dog that's me first
