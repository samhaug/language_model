{"bQ7XcdwVTe8": "hello all city candy fans welcome back i'm nicole and today we are going to be trying the sour frunias so right away looking a look at it well here's the packaging it instantly reminds me of a now and later so it's just a little different version but this is a sour one we're gonna give it a try so as we pop it open take a look it's got a nice blue color to it this is perfect if you got like birthday parties or like even like gender reveals this will add a little fun to it and it's a nice light blue color perfect for that baby theme and it's got a little flecks in there you can take a look and see and if you like sour we're gonna go ahead and give this a shot oh it's very good it's actually very soft so you know how noun layers they start off hard and then get softer as you go this is soft very instantly and i actually personally like that the flavor is instant the sour is there but if you're afraid of it being overpowering don't worry it's just a little bit of a kick and it's very nice if you want to try one of these today you can come in store visit us or you can buy it online at allcitycandy.com", "HUb6baa_ym4": "hey guys welcome back to my channel I hope you guys are having a good day you know what I mean like I'm so sorry for my wheel being in the way but um here's the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "mimEFSWWRi8": "hello

wife discovered that maybe not a lot of people know but when you go out and purchase your blueberries there's something cool you can do a lot of times you need to clean them before you use them but if you're gonna do that you want them you know here boom what you can do is float your blueberry first and what's gonna happen here do a little shake these blueberries let it rise into the top they're gonna be sour maybe unripened don't ask me why I'm not a chemist give this another little stir just give that give it a stir pop you didn't mean to do that I'm not used to filming and trying to do so and you'll just see it you'll have some rise to the top and of course I can't prove this on camera but this one it's bitter one of these ones down in the bottom here nice and sweet so no know why but it's a neat little trick to separate your blueberries out and give some a little more time to ripen them up but you'll have to go through that stir it about three or four times depending on any blueberries you have until you get them all separated pretty cool little trick though have a nice day people", "l2i4wdUb2EA": "[Music] [Music] I'm going to the next review on the North Fork not for flower damn I see so loud North Port flower and North Lord I go culture I'm not sure what they call themselves by Monday building down below their Instagram and their email because right now the website is not up unfortunately but today and we'll be doing the sour blueberry rush and his brother tiny but they look freaking awesome you have to see that so he handled all this whatever they gave me 25 grams and he said they sent me out four different strains so just open this up guys get into it oh yeah also gotta say that he sells wholesale so if you're looking to get a QP or four strains of 25 each a QP a pound so he sells like big amounts make sure to hit a load varies and it makes sense you know this in here okay see if I can grab a couple buzz and you could check them check it out guys you can see that even more I guess I came to a minimum boost mode and fortunately definitely some good bugs tell us is blueberry yeah sour blueberry rush 405 I guess that's the sample number four or five yeah I definitely could smell the blueberries in there see you get one more look at this before it goes away there goes so it does have a lot of trichomes orange hairs trim very nice if you want it to be untrimmed and it'll be cheaper it is I wasn't quite up you get it untrimmed it's what's it called it's cheaper if you get untrue I don't know why I'm having trouble dish stuffing a little bit but yeah definitely get like a like a earthy fruity and course of blueberry smells really nice but these are bright green another here they're very bright the butter is small and some of the butter small but like it's really frost okay I'm sorry it's really lime green and has a lot of orange hair about trichomes yeah definitely looks it's very bright bright green I like that and definitely I love that fruity smell all right guys I'm gonna pick a bowl of this cuz I'm tired of just looking at it I want to just a me see but all right let's pack a small little bow these little nuts are like really sticky definitely I gotta put the humidifier back in there I want to put a big humidifier packing all my want all these because they were harvested around the September yeah I definitely get let go or earthy piney taste maybe on the second heck it tasted blueberry you know that boy there's a blueberry right there yeah cuz on a second one I'm the second hit on my other one review I did that's when I really got the flavor yeah I can definitely taste it's like a like earthy almost like a spice and piney and then I think with a little bit of aftertaste of like the blueberry I was supposed to be like sour blueberry I never strayed this train never heard of it I've tried sour space kind of you yeah I like it there guys wow that is really really good definitely I recommend this well then that's it I like a whole bunch of it right now yeah I wish I could see what I see right here that the camera doesn't do it justice it really really is a nice flower yeah I don't I just I'm kind of speechless with a verse is really really good flower very nicely trimmed bright bright green no yeah I never tried a blueberry hemp before but nothing gonna be smoking this what ever finish this off oh I'm gonna finish it off any time soon but I'm gonna try and on the smoke as much as I can I really like this one guys definitely go check him out guys North Fork agriculture North Fork what's it called flower I leave their Instagram and his email down below so you could check it out I'll let you know if whenever the website does come up I will put it on the link down below but make sure you go check them out guys if you have any questions go talk to him he's definitely down to you know talk about how much she's gonna sell I think he's so like I don't know peace it was just exclusive for me but he gave me four strains of twenty five grams each or you can do a QP or a quarter pound or you can do a pound and they're very affordable if you wanted untrimmed then it's a little bit cheaper if you want to go that route yeah it doesn't take much to trim it it's not it doesn't look too bad but yeah guys definitely I recommend this one here's one that was right before them and he sent me four different strains so yeah [Music] you can read that if you want and I got this next I got this huge box it came in covered my whole face but yeah I have one more string to do definitely I was excited all dates are like : Chinese yeah so I'm gonna end the video here guys definitely go check them out tell them that I sent you Tim Joseph Lee really sent you and if you have any questions he supported half the down to him but I know what they might have in the video here and you were like and a comment down below and I'll see you on the next one [Music]", "6J9aM0Gh0iE": "[Music] and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's old-school today guys cuz we are taking a look at an edible just like good times good times I mean old times but the old times aren't necessarily good times anymore because here in California we are fully in the new recreational world which includes this ridiculous hundred milligram cap on edibles not just that but makes absolutely crazy packaging requirements for all edibles here in California so what edible are we talking about that is ridiculous today what we are gonna take our first look at Plus gummies that's right another gummy review I normally tell you to avoid the gummies but I have heard a lot of good things about Plus and I am a little curious I'm always hoping to find another gummy I like cushy punch or flourish or Tiki killers that's actually worth something so I'm definitely looking forward to reviewing these plus gummies first thing you're gonna notice is how crazy this packaging is so here it is here is our plus gummies I believe they are sour blueberry blue in case you don't know is objectively the best flavor of everything if there is a multitude of colors and blue is available always go with blue because blue is much like a like a law of thermodynamics or whatever the case may be blue is always the best fruit flavor even though I don't know of any naturally-occurring blue fruits other than blueberries and blue tasting foods are hardly ever blueberries usually blue raspberry or something it's always the best trust me on this though so we have a sealed bag with you know all these insane requirements on it batch number this that and the other I mean it's great because it has all of those wonderful serving sizes and ingredients and all the testing results all this stuff you know I like seeing but it's a bag and then a fancy 10 on the inside I think all edibles now have to be bagged in addition to whatever kind of thing holds the edibles they have to have these sealed maggots it's insane it just boosts up the cost because this uh 100 milligram 20 piece edibles so I believe it's 20 gummies each worth 5 milligrams of THC cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is outrageous of course but that is the world we now live in and we shall review it as if it's the world we want to live in who knows I don't know what I'm saying I know I'm sad I'm disappointed that the edible world has changed so much and so for such and in such a shitty direction over the past year but let's stop the bitching and get straight to the review of the plus gummies cannabis infused sour blue berry so we're gonna open up the first layer of the packaging here it looks like it's got a little tear thing nice Oh and then then we got our second layer the zip sealed bag on side of the tear bag and then we gotta figure out how to open this the childproofing I think you ground push down and that breaks the seal yes there we go so second layer of security through now we're finally to our chin on the inside and to the gummies in here ah so here are our blue raspberry or blueberry gummies whatever they call it blue flavored the best 20 gummies in there give it a smell oh definitely a cannabis e odor which is not a bad thing I I'd like to know that there's some cannabis in these but also a hefty flavor and aroma of blue but certainly in a cannabis aroma there as you can see just a bunch of little squares dropped one there and let's pluck it into our mouths but before we do in case this is your first week to review the way they work when we do edibles we reviewed the whole experience I'm gonna eat all 20 of these gummies and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because it's you want to know how have it tasted like [ __ ] but you what you really want is it gonna get you [ __ ] up it's gonna get you high are you gonna get what you paid for it and that guy's is what you need to stick around for but first the taste test so here we go first cube in the mouth um very spongy gummies very very spongy almost hard to bite into because they're so Airy um a surprising cannabis taste them it's not awful but there is a 4 what is 5 milligrams of THC in these cubes definitely a cannabis taste to it but the blue the blue sciency flavor counter sex but if you don't like cannabis taste maybe you don't stick with these because you're gonna taste it again not terrible not overwhelming but it is surprisingly noticeable for what is just 5 milligrams of THC so guys I'm gonna eat me about what 16 more of these and I said I'm gonna eat me which is very back woodsy and folksy way of saying I'm gonna eat the rest of these so guys I'll see you in about two hours I'm gonna scarf these down and I'll let you know then if they're worth your money or not so thanks for staying tuned this far sticking around this far sorry guys this is really my second video back here on weeds and this will probably be another video between season 3 and between season 2 and season 3 so forgive my rustiness see you guys in two hours thanks for sticking around 2 hours since I have had the plus cannabis infused gummies looking at the camera for the first time now since coming back the fuse but I also see now I'm saying the word let's just start over one more time BAM I'm back guys it has been 2 hours since I had the plus cannabis infused gummies and I think there was an even yeah it says create on there as well there are a lot of nouns and adjectives and verbs on that packaging I'm really not even sure what it's called I'm just gonna call it plus gummies plus gummies uh guys I am genuinely pretty impressed uh for a gummy and for a hundred milligram edible this brought the heat um I'm not outrageously high but I am at like maybe a 6 somewhere in that range which is way higher than I expected it to be after a hundred milligrams and especially after a gummy I am pretty pleased with this now that is in the relative scale compared to you know this new world of edibles because this is a very expensive product you don't get a lot for your money here compared to the old world but in this new world this is a pretty good little solution um I found myself not maybe quite as high as if they were like akarova or a Kanaka mini cookie situation but for a gummy and for how much less you have to eat then which is very important to me you have to eat a [ __ ] ton of those cookies from like all you know Pete's and Korova and Kanaka all those ones you just mentioned you have to eat like 20 of those you know many cookies to get the hundred milligrams the gummies here were a hell of a lot more manageable that 10 was no problem to eat by myself I didn't didn't feel like a gluttonous badass after consuming that whole thing at all so really really pleased with that aspect um have a cannabis taste for sure but not awful um I didn't feel like retching after eating that not even close there was a cannabis taste but it was not the primary taste and again didn't have that just incredibly bitter kind of almost you know a cynic that Pacific we've tasted no no just the taste is there but then again for as potent as these came you know turned out to be you would expect that so guys this is a a nice win I think I'm I'm pretty impressed with Plus cannabis infused gummies and then also that were to create for some reason on there as well so I'm really happy with this I think I'll be reviewing some more stuff from plus in the future and if you see these in a dispensary near you and you guys want to eat all of something to get the hundred milligrams Jesus it's it's almost easier to recommend this then which is hard to say which is hard to believe actually then like the Kanak o or the kirova because it's just such it's so much easier to do and they're they're sort of equivalently priced you don't get quite as high but it's it's it's easier to it's easier to manage for sure so really surprised me on this one guys and what the [ __ ] let's just shoot the moon here guys I'm gonna throw a cherry on top - my little cherries on top here just little things I like to add that aren't necessarily we related something you can just do to enjoy throughout your week and I'm just gonna throw this one out because I am having an ever-loving blast playing spider-man on the ps4 from insomniac holy [ __ ] guys it's so great to see insomniac get this win I assume this game it's going to be an amazingly huge hit it seems to be it's only a couple days since it's been out but reception seems to be great and it seems to be doing really well sales wise I'm so happy for insomniac I love these guys since the ps1 days back in like Spyro loved them on the ps2 days Ratchet and Clank so my favorite you know 3d action platformers ever even love the resistance franchises back on the ps3 days and then they have been one of the greatest VR developers as well and I'm a big big fan of VR so you know what [ __ ] it I'm going to this endorsement is not for spider-man which is an awesome game I am having an utter blast with it it doesn't rewrite the rules anyway it's it's not a you know changing the genre it's just a hell of a good video game you know it's not rewriting anything but it's it's wonderful I'm having a blast with it but instead this cherry on top is just for insomniac in general they make great great games they've been making great great games for like 20 years I love them as a studio I'm so happy to see them having this huge success with spider-man so insomniac you'll never see this video but great job guys really proud of you and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review what a great time we had great gummies that were so good here's an extra piece of packaging we had [ __ ] spider-man and insomniac on our cherry on top woohoo this guy's has been a [ __ ] good review let's just acknowledge the fact that everything went aces this time which doesn't often happen so great job plus great job insomniac and great job weed thank you so much for watching this review it's gone way too long and I will see you guys on the next one peace", "3bQvTNKexGw": "hello everybody and welcome to medical marijuana reviews in the Pittsburgh Pennsylvania area by yours

pretty you should wear a paper towel over your face more often please not again oh my gosh we have so many chicken", "nAaEzz1PRcg": "[Music] hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with red white and blue berry grilled chicken that's right there's no more patriotic way to celebrate Independence Day than by making a red white and blue themed recipe and speaking of forming a more perfect union that's what we're trying to do here by combining a very spicy chili rub chicken breast with a beautiful blueberry sweet-and-sour sauce and yes I realize that might sound a little crazy but you know what else sounds really crazy when people first heard about it the Bill of Rights and that totally worked out for the most part and I really think this will too so let's go ahead get started with the white part of the recipe the chicken breast and we will be using the abomination that is the boneless skinless chicken breast which I generally hate to use I prefer my chicken meat next to juicy bones and crispy fatty skin but you know what you and your personal trainer seem to like these so I decided to take one for the team and use this and what we'll do to help cover up its inherent blandness is coat these with a very spicy highly seasoned rub and because we are going to start this with some vegetable oil we'll call this a wet rub so like I said we'll start with a little bit of oil to which we will add a whole bunch of salt as well as some freshly ground black pepper followed by three kinds of ground chili pepper we will use some paprika some Chipotle which is a very spicy smoked ground dried jalapeno and of course some cayenne and yes I'm going to use a ton because I want these kind of spicy so I'll give you the amounts on the blog as usual and it will be up to you to adjust you are the Wiccan of your chicken so we will leave the exact spiciness up to you and then last but not least a little bit of finely minced garlic and we'll give that a mix with a whisk and once that set we will transfer our chicken breasts into the wet rub and we'll move those around a little bit to make sure they're completely and thoroughly coated and that is pretty much going to be it for the red in the white so we'll go ahead and we'll wrap that up and pop it in the fridge for a few hours and yes if you want you can leave it in longer probably over nights fine but generally I would recommend doing this the morning of your cookout but anyway I'm going to pop mine in the fridge for about two hours and while that chicken sits absorbing those spices we can move on to the blueberry sauce so what we'll do is dump some white sugar in a saucepan set over medium heat and believe it or not we're going to start this sauce by almost caramelizing sugar so what I want you to do is put that on medium and just don't stir it don't answer the door don't answer the phone just stand there and wait until you see that sugar melting around the edge see that how its kind of getting clear and eventually what's going to happen is all that sugar is going to melt and then it's going to start turning golden which is when we really have to pay attention and as soon as it gets to this point right here we're just about to go Pascal then we will turn off the heat and dump in our vinegar which is going to be kind of exciting and very cool to look at and that how sugar is going to momentarily turn into rock candy but don't worry it's going to dissolve in a second and what we'll do at this point is well put our heat back on medium high and we will add in our fresh blueberries and we'll give that a little stir and then all we're going to do is wait for this to come up to a simmer at which point we'll lower our heat to medium low and simply simmer this for about I don't know four or five minutes until our blueberries kind of soften up and collapse and our mixture starts to thicken and like all similar sauces if yours starts to get too thick add a little splash of water on the other hand to thin let it reduce a little more that kind of thing is we'll be calling the business cooking so please don't be frightened but you may have to adjust and like I said we'll simmer that for four or five minutes or until our blueberries soften up and collapse and the mixture thickens up a bit and then because this is a savory sauce we will do a little pinch of salt as well as some freshly ground black pepper and we'll stir that in and that is going to be pretty much it for the sauce and then what we'll do at this point is remove that from the heat and strain it and of course straining is always optional but I do recommend it the sauce is going to look and feel a lot better so as usual we'll just push that through our strainer with a spatula and what we're going to be left with is a gorgeous I'll be it not blue blueberry sweet and sour sauce and as I mentioned earlier you can totally thin this out with a little bit of water but I do think it should have a little thickness to it something similar to a barbecue sauce texture which really is sort of the purpose this sauce is serving and in case you're wondering yes you can serve the sauce warm but it's totally fine at room temp which is how I'm going to serve it ensure taste for seasoning if you want but don't forget this is going to be paired with a smoky grilled highly seasoned piece of meat so keep that in mind but anyway our sauce is sets we will simply set that aside and we can move on to grilling the chicken so let's go ahead and pull our breasts out of the fridge and we will give those just a little bit of a pat-down on some paper towels to remove any of that excess wet rub we do want to leave a little bit on there but we don't want it dripping and then assuming our grill is ready which mine is we can head outside to cook these up so I'm gonna place those down on the grill and you know I hate to give times for this kind of stuff if you force me to gas mine took about four minutes aside but there's no guarantees all I can tell you is try to cook them to perfection and because you're good people I'm going to give you some tips on how to figure that out on the blog and because the cooking time is relatively quick you can just leave these down without touching them until you flip them but you know what a sucker I am for grill marks so I did give mine a half-turn which as you know is going to create those gorgeous professional-looking grill marks check it out look how perfect that is it's borderline annoying but anyway turn those over I gave the other side about four minutes or so at which point we'll pull those off and we'll head back inside for final assembly so we will let our gorgeously grilled chicken breasts rest for just a minute while we spoon a little bit of that blueberry sauce on our plate and I was actually thinking to do one of those fancy spoon swipe designs but then I remembered those are kind of silly so I stopped placed on my chicken which as you can see I cut a few times on the diagonal and why do we do that instead of just putting the whole breast on for drama oh yeah that's a proven scientific fact by cutting and fanning like this you get a way more dramatic presentation and then I also added some pesto macaroni salad to the plate for two reasons founding father Thomas Jefferson brought macaroni to America and forget red white and blue green is and always will be America's favorite color and then because I got to take some pictures I put three strategically positioned blueberries and then I finished with a little bit of a drizzle of the sauce over the top to create what I call the racing stripes and that red white and blue berry grilled chicken is done so let me go ahead and grab a fork a knife and begin my pursuit of happiness and that is exactly what I found is you take that first bite is my friend Ralph would say it tastes like burning but that fire is quickly put out by the sweetness from that sauce until you take the next bite and it all starts over again so just an absolutely delicious pairing I cannot help but think if somehow the founding fathers magically appeared in my kitchen that they would see this and say that looks incredible and also who are you and how did we get here so on behalf of Tom Ben John and the rest of the boys I'd like to say we really do hope you give this a try soon so head over to food wishes calm for all the ingredient amounts and more as usual and as always enjoy [Music]", "8zcQyWeZtX4": "[Music] all right so this was a very random discovery we just pulled off a side road off the highway and just like went down until we found uh like a service track that's a very basic fact leading up to like a lake that's over there and decided to take a walk and right here we spotted uh blueberries i don't know if they're blueberry they might be bilberries it's hard to tell right here these are uh these are blueberries or bilberries i guess you can't tell until you break them open and right by these over here are crowberries there's not hardly any berries on it but this is the uh these are the leaves that you're looking for it looks almost like an evergreen like tiny little pine needle shaped leaves they're soft though i don't think they're actual pine needles but they're just like very very tiny little leaves so they look like uh like an evergreen and the berries are so tiny they're hard to find but uh let's uh let's take a look at the blueberries first because these look like they're ready to go and they're like all over the place too they look ready and they're covered in mosquitoes if it's red on the inside bilberry if it's white or green on the inside it's a blueberry that is a bilberry and that's really good nice and tart but doesn't taste like unripe it just has more sourness than a blueberry does usually how people will pick these is they use this little hand rake and they'll rake it over the plants and the blueberry will hit the rake and they pop off and you can take big buckets full that way don't have one of those so i'm just gonna do it manually but just like this when you see one you see like all these other plants so this whole area this is nothing but blueberries like all of this all the way up through here this is all blueberries and all throughout here alongside these are all crow bears so this is a killer little spot and i think they need a lot of light because they're they seem to be concentrated right here on the side of this road so there's like a little bit of clearance where the sun can shine there's not too much shade so this is probably a good way to find berries is to like kind of look alongside uh a clearing like this because then you're gonna get an area that's getting a little bit more sunlight so you're gonna be able to find them and those shiny leaves i believe those are lincoln berries and there's another species of bilberry that has this red leaf here so all throughout here are more than one type of berry but it's uh is insane how many berries are out in this forest right now like you could fill buckets with it hello so i am here in helsinki finland behind me is the central market of helsinki and in front of me are two blueberry varieties one is your standard supermarket blueberry they're a little bit bigger than usual but uh these are actually imported won't lie these are not grown in finland these are grown in portugal so just regular old blueberries next to them though are very special grown in lapland finland bilberries also known as european blueberries they're a lot smaller and they're also supposed to have a lot more flavor than your standard blueberry so i'm going to try the the regular one first it's um good taste how you'd expect it to taste but if i can give like little scales on it sweetness is quite high it's sweeter than an apple i'd say like uh like a six out of ten maybe a seven out of ten um sourness is there but quite low i would say like a three out of ten it's less than an orange that's good you know what blueberries taste like bilberries however uh let's try it i'm gonna try just one on its own i'm tempted to take a handful because they're so small but they're supposed to be more flavorful so see if like this tiny one has more flavor than these big ones it doesn't have more blueberry flavor but it does have more tartness to it tartness on that is like a six out of ten it is more than an orange not quite a lemon the sweetness on it is i think less i'd say like a three out of ten for sweetness but they're very powerful they've got a little strength in them for their size they have a little bit of an herbal taste to them kind of like eating the top of a strawberry or something and the flavor itself is different they're more complicated these ones have like a very clean simple flavor just like blueberry and sweet the big ones have like maybe like a touch of um herbal taste like like a hint of basil the bilberries don't really have basil they've got looks like a mixture of like random herbs it's a little herbaceous a little bit more sour a little less clean blueberry taste like when you eat one of these it's like having like blueberries syrup blueberry jam this one uh not so much there's a little bit more complexity to it i think maybe i like the bilberries more just because there's a little bit more to it they have like a little bit of a roughness to them that the standard blueberry does not have like these are like a little bit too clean tasting it's like a little too sterile these ones have like a little roughness to it that i really like so i'd say the bilberries are better and they also have a little bit more pop because there's more sourness to it i like sour fruit so for me that's really tasty this would be better uh as a jam or juice than the regular blueberries both are good fresh but these would be better in that sort of application because it has more pop to it but otherwise i think it depends on what you like me personally i think i edge towards the billberries a little bit [Music] so here is another i don't know what this is here's the bilberry the regular bilberry and you can see the leaves are a little bit greener the fruits are a different color on the bilberry they're like a light blue and they've got like a dusty outer coating this one is dark and shiny and has red leaves the shape of the leaf is very similar but the coloring is different so i'm not sure if this is a different species or if it's a different cultivar i'm i'm guessing it's probably a different species having the the outside be so different so shiny like that makes me think it's different it's also red on the inside and the flavor on that is really good it's a little bit different than the regular bilberry because it has a little bit more of a berry flavor a little bit like strawberries and raspberries mixed in there it's not just tart blueberry like bilberries are more like a tart blueberry this has a little bit more to it like a lot of like different forest berries mixed together in uh in one berry really tasty i prefer those actually over the regular bilberries i gotta figure out what the species are on these but if i figure it out i will put that in the video but it is something to look out for not all these berries are the same and they grow alongside each other so here's the one with the red leaves and that dark berry you can see it right there and then right next door is this one with the dusty outer covering to it throughout this whole area it's like that they're like right next to each other like that they just keep going and going and going all the way across the forest floor everywhere you look these are all bilberries everywhere it's just like carpeting the entire forest i want to give a special shout out to alt pod and smarter every day they are mega patrons over on patreon.com patreon is how this channel happens is how i can afford to do

You're in luck 'cause\ntoday's recipe is it. Hey, you're watching Preppy\nKitchen where I, John Kanell, teaches you how to make\ndelicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These blueberry muffins will\nbe ready before you know it, so let's get started. First off, set that oven\nto 400 degrees Fahrenheit. We want it nice and toasty, and this recipe whips up in a snap, as I said earlier. Okay. Add those dry ingredients into a big bowl, starting with 2 1/2 cups\nof all-purpose flour. That's 300 grams, if you're counting. 3/4 of a teaspoon of salt, in you go. And you can add a little bit\nmore or a little bit less, depending on what you like. Two teaspoons of baking powder, in you go. Give it a whisk and set it aside. Now it's time for those wet ingredients. For the wet ingredients, I'm adding one cup or 240\nmilliliters of whole milk into a bowl. Room temperature if you can. 3/4 of a cup of regular\nold granulated sugar, that's 150 grams. A teaspoon of vanilla,\nwhich is totally optional. You don't have to, but why say no? 1/4 cup of melted butter. 1/4 cup of sour cream. I love sour cream in\nmuffins and everything, it's a delicious ingredient. If you don't have sour cream around, you can totally use\nregular whole milk yogurt. In addition to that 1/4 cup of butter, I'm also using 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. You can use any mild oil you like. I have come around and started using oil in my cupcakes and muffins because it keeps them moist. Butter is an amazing ingredient. However, if it gets\ncold, it's kind of hard, so it's always best warm, and some people like\ntheir blueberry muffins room temperature. Two eggs, room temperature, once again. We did almost all of the wet ingredients, but there's one last thing to talk about, and that's the lemon. I think lemon and\nblueberry go hand in hand. But if you're anti-lemon, just use 1/4 cup of milk instead of the 1/4 cup of\nlemon juice that I just added. And you can skip the lemon zest. I'm adding in the zest\nof almost a whole lemon. It's totally to taste, though, so if you're a lemonaholic like me, add the whole lemon's dust in. And if you're not, skip it altogether. (sniffs) Ah. (laughs) Whisk, whisk, whisk, whisk, whisk. Okay. We're almost done. There's one thing to talk about, and that's the blueberries, hello. Okay, so I have, this\nis about 7 3/4 ounces of fresh blueberries. You could use six ounces. You could use all the way up to eight. It's totally up to you. And if you can't get\ndelicious, fresh blueberries, use frozen blueberries instead. Just seven frozen blueberries,\ndon't thaw them or anything. You'll increase the bake\ntime just a little bit, you can keep your eye in that oven. Fresh blueberries, we do wanna toss them in a little bit of flour just\nto help them not sink so much. So take about a tablespoon\nof the dry mixture, sprinkle it over the blueberries, and just toss them around a little bit. That's all you're doing. No big deal. Save that for last. And now let's combine the wet and the dry. Add that wet to the dry. Get it all out. And now let's mix it up. You can use a spatula, like I am, or go ahead and do the whole whisk thing. We're gonna be very\ngentle with this batter. Not because we have to,\nbut because we're nice. Okay, mix, mix, mix. Now once you see it come together, it's time to add those\nblueberries in there. So just pull up them in, and just gently fold them in. I think the most iconic movie\nscene about blueberry muffins is from \"Casino.\" You can let me know in the comments if you remember the scene, but it just involves\nthe uneven distribution of blueberries in muffins. It's very important that everyone\ngets a lot of blueberries. So you could even reserve a couple and pop them on top just for show. That looks totally good to me. I'm gonna get my muffin tin out and move on to the next step. I'm using a large ice cream scoop to get all this batter in here, and I'm gonna fill them\nalmost all the way up. We want a nice bakery-style blueberry top, which is kind of like up and out, not the flat cupcake that I\nusually prefer personally. So in you go. And if you want, you could\ntotally finish these off with a streusel topping. I might add a little bit of\nsugar on at the last moment. I'm thinking about it. Ooh, that's a good one. If you thought there was gonna be a 12th blueberry muffin there, you're wrong, it was a total fake-out. I'm gonna fill this up halfway with water, and when it goes into the oven, it'll be a little bit\nsteamy and happy environment for the muffins to live in. They won't get too dry. Popping in a couple blueberries on top, just like a chocolate chip\nin a chocolate chip cookie where you add some chocolate chips on top just before popping them into the oven. A couple of blueberries on\nthe ones that look naked will make everything seem fine. Do you want me to like sprinkle\nsomething on top of this? - [Brian] Shouldn't you do that on one of the middle ones? - No. (Brian laughs) Someone doesn't know how to bake. We have a special request\nfor some streusel topping on top of half of these, so I will oblige that\nmystery person's request and make it happen. It's so easy and actually pretty fun too. So set these aside for\njust a couple minutes and let's make that streusel up. Okay, a super quick streusel topping. 1/2 a cup of sugar. You could use brown sugar, but for this I want it to be a little bit lighter and brighter. 1/2 a cup of flour. Normally I'd measured up\nto scale, but not today. Whisk it up with your finger. And then use your clean hands to add in 1/4 cup of butter, and we're just gonna mash\nit up with our fingers. You can also do this with melted butter, but I like the way it comes\nout with cold butter better. So you're gonna mix it up with your hands until you have a crumbly mixture. It's a crumble topping,\naka a streusel topping, and it gives everything a nice finish. I'm gonna include this as\nan option in the blog post, but I think a traditional blueberry muffin would just be plain. You can let me know in the comments if you prefer a crumb topping\nor if you like it just plain or maybe with a sprinkle of sugar. Okay, my mixture is\nbecoming nice and crumbly. I like to finish off by making a huge clump and then breaking it\nup into smaller pieces to give me nice big crumbles. Slide that over here. This is enough crumble, by the\nway, for the entire recipe, not for half, because someone\nasked for it. (chuckles) Get some crumbles. Just place them on top. All of a sudden I feel like an artist placing the last\nbrushstroke on a painting, but really just plop them on. Ready for the oven. 400 degrees for about 20 minutes until they're puffed up and golden. You will notice what's happening. You can use a skewer or your finger to either pat the top and\nsee if it bounces back or comes out clean if\nyou're using a skewer.

Pancakes, muffins, the works, all the delicious stuff\nthat you want for breakfast. But first, it's time for a bite. Look at this. Do you see that? Full of blueberries,\njust like it should be.

My family loves\nblueberries. The problem is I am in Ohio and I have alkaline clay soil which\nblueberries hate. I have tried doing in-ground plantings, I've built up raised\nbeds, I've amended the soil, but our native\nsoil leeches out the acidity so quickly that my blueberries have always just\nstruggled the entire time they've been in the ground. So the compromise that I\nfound is growing them in containers because I can control that growing media\nand make it the perfect environment for blueberries. Now I'll never be able to\nopen up a blueberry farm but we can have a few blueberries sitting on the patio\nand actually pick fruit off of them which is really nice. So if you're in a\nsimilar predicament where you'd like to grow blueberries but your soil is not\noptimal for blueberry production take heart. You can grow them in pots- they do\nreally well. The key is getting your soil right. So blueberries have a low pH\nrequirement typically between 4.5 and 5.0. This is much lower than most garden\nvegetables and some fruits. They also prefer over 3% organic matter and good\ndrainage- they do not like to have wet feet. So we're just wanting to provide\nthem a mix which is going to give them all of those things. Now you can take the\neasy route which I have done before with great success. You can buy pre-mixed bags\nof potting media for acid-loving plants. So I have used, it was called the\nBlueberry Success Mix from Gardens Alive for my own blueberries and that's\nworked really well. You can pick up acid-loving potting mix for, usually\nit'll say for rhododendrons, azaleas and camellias, from your local big-box store\nor garden center, and those mixes will work really well. Often those have\nfertilizer for acid plants built right in so you just basically fill up your\ncontainer, plop in your blueberry plant and you're done. It's really quick and\nsimple. Today though I was out of my mix so I wanted to blend up something with\nwhat I had on hand. So in doing a little research on the\nbest do-it-yourself blueberry potting mixes what I came across repeatedly from\nplaces like University Extension agencies, The American Highbush Blueberry\nCouncil and several other sources, was they were all recommending a 1:1\nmix of soil and peat moss. And that will achieve the purpose- it does provide good\ndrainage and blueberries will be very happy. The only problem with that is- that\nif you can avoid using peat in your mixes you probably should.\nThe continual harvest of peat is really starting to lead to the destruction of\nvulnerable wildlife habitats and there are other options. So you could go with\nsomething like a coconut coir and just do a 1:1 mix of potting soil and\ncoconut coir, and then throw in an acid loving fertilizer and you would be good\nto go. What I am using today is this Pro Mix premium organic garden mix. I like\nthis because it has mycorrhizae in it and it does really well for containers. I've\ngot some coconut coir that I'm gonna mix in. I actually already have some mushroom\ncompost in this planter here. And mushroom compost is just the leftover\ngrowing media after the mushroom crop is harvested and typically it will contain\nthings like composted animal manure, sometimes leaf compost, it does sometimes\ncontain peat moss, but it's whatever that particular grower happens to be using to\ngrow their mushrooms on. And this is a local source I've been really happy with\nthis. I use it in my containers and in my gardens and it seems to make my plants\nreally happy, so I'm throwing some of that in and then the last thing will be\na fertilizer for acid loving plants. And same thing when you're looking for a\nfertilizer you can typically find- this is a slow-release it's a 14-7-7 and it\nis for acid loving plants so it says azaleas, camellias,\nrhododendrons any type of formulation like that your\nblueberries are gonna be happy with as well. I've also used this in the past--\nit's Gardens Alive's blueberry fertilizer again formulated for acid loving plants.\nAnd typically when you're getting an organic slow-release acid fertilizer\nthey're gonna contain things like cottonseed meal because cottonseed meal\nis low pH but a good source of nitrogen for plants. It may include things like\nfeather meal, sometimes it will include elemental sulfur. Elemental sulfur is\ncommonly used to lower pH in the soil. The thing to keep in mind with elemental\nsulfur-- it actually has to be converted by the soil bacteria into sulfuric acid\nto be effective and that can only happen in warm moist conditions during your\ntypical growing season and it can take at the minimum three months to a year. So\nwhat I saw was that recommendations for lowering your soil's pH with elemental\nsulfur said to apply it to the soil three months - up to a year ahead of\nplanting time. Now that's in a scenario where you're actually wanting to lower\nyour native soil's pH. Since we're planting in a pot and we've already got\nall of the elements in there that are going to make our blueberries happy that's\nnot so much of a concern but it is something to keep in mind anytime that\nyou might be using elemental sulfur. Holly Tone is another commonly recommended\namendment for acid loving plants and that's pretty commonly available. But\nanything formulated for acid loving, preferably a slow-release all-natural\nfertilizer, is gonna work really well. Do follow the manufacturer's instructions\nfor application though. Blueberries are very sensitive to over fertilization and\nin this case more is not better. You want to follow those instructions and you do\nnot want to over fertilize! So with that being said I'm gonna mix up my potting\nmedia and get this blueberry planted. So as I mentioned I already have some\nmushroom compost in here I, actually already have a little bit of the garden mix.\nI'm gonna add some of this coconut coir. You can see very similar texture to peat\nmoss. I'm gonna add some of my garden mix here-- it is a compressed bale so this\nwill kind of need broken up. And then I am just gonna get in here, I probably\nshould have done this in a bigger bucket but that's okay, and I am just going to\nmix all of this. You can also do this in layers which is really effective.\nSo basically think of making a giant parfait you would do a little coconut\ncoir, a little potting mix, a little fertilizer in one layer and just\ncontinue to layer that up the pot, which makes it really nice and easy to mix\nthis. And then I'm gonna use this stuff today because, like I said I've used this\nbefore. This calls for one cup per planting hole for newly planted\nblueberry shrubs. So I am just going to add a cup of this fertilizer now and mix\nthat in. And then you'll also want to make sure to reapply fertilizer each\nspring, ideally before the new growth starts leafing out to keep your\nblueberries happy. So we're gonna get this all mixed in. Next I like to\nthoroughly saturate the potting media before planting. This just seems easier\nto me because I can make sure that the media is soaked all the way through to\nthe bottom before planting. Now it's important that you keep your blueberries\nregularly watered as they grow. Blueberries have shallow root systems\nand are very sensitive to drying out so 1 to 2 inches per week consistently is a\ngood amount to aim for. Adding a mulch on the top of your planting media can also\naid in keeping the roots cool and damp. Ok now we can go ahead and get this blueberry planted. \nThis is pretty fibrous, has a fair amount of root growth in there, so I'm going to\nbreak it up pretty roughly here, rough up those roots, it'll make that plant reach\nout into the soil. And then you just want to plant these at the same level they\nwere growing in the nursery which means you want this to be level with the soil\nsurface. I'm just gonna dig in there plop this puppy right in here.\nNow pot size I'm sure is a question that you probably have. I've not grown a\nblueberry in a pot smaller than 20 gallons and I actually prefer a 50\ngallon pot for most blueberries. The smallest you can probably go is about 24 inches\nwide by 24 to 30 inches tall I would not try going any smaller than that. Now if\nyour plants are really small when you get them you can pot them up in a small\npot and then transplant them into larger pots as they grow, but you just want to\nmake sure that whatever your plant ends up in it has plenty of room for its root\nmass. And then my final step here is going to be to add a pine bark mulch. So\nthese are pine fines, it's just a finely shredded pine bark, but this works really\nwell because as I mentioned before it helps to hold moisture in the soil as\nwell as being a little bit acidic so you could even actually mix pine fines into\nyour potting soil, that works really well, but they make a great mulch. Now a few\nother bits of advice for blueberries in containers. There are different types of\nblueberries-- so there are things like Northern highbush,  Southern highbush, dwarf, wild blueberries or rabbit-eyes. So true to their name Northern and Southern highbush are going to be larger plants,  rabbit- eyes are as well, but they can get up to\nsix feet tall. Now growing them in a container is going to restrict their\ngrowth so they won't get that big, but you're definitely going to want to opt\nfor a bigger pot if you're growing one of those.\nYou can get a dwarf or half high or a wild-type blueberry, Tophat is a variety\nthat jumps to mind, they're only gonna get about this tall and they're really\nideal for smaller containers on patios because they're really suited to that\nsmaller size pot. The other thing is that while most types of blueberries are\ntechnically self pollinating, except for rabbit-eyes they do need a pollinator,\nand those are typically grown in the South, other blueberries are going to set\na higher yield of fruit with another cultivar with a similar bloom time\nnearby. So if you can do two pots with two different cultivars in them on your\npatio that's a great way to do it. One plant you will get some fruit you'll\njust get more with another one close by. Now the cultivar I have planted up today\nis called Ka-Bluey blueberry and I've actually already got\nsome of my patio that are the Ree-ka, Ray-ka, it's R-E-K-A, I'm not sure how to pronounce\nit variety, and so all of these blueberries will be sitting there\ntogether. You also want to be considerate of where you place your containers. so\nblueberries do prefer full sun, that's six to eight hours a day of sunlight. If you\nlive in a warm climate you may want to provide some protection from that strong\nlate afternoon sun because sometimes that will tend to burn up in the berry\nplants. Full sun is going to give you best flavor and best fruit production.\nConversely in cold climates you're going to want to think about winter protection.\nMost blueberries are going to be hardy to about negative 20 Fahrenheit, \nbeing above ground in a container is going to make\nthem more susceptible to freeze damage in the winter, so it's a good idea to either\nmove them to a protected spot in the winter-- so like an unheated greenhouse\nand unheated garage with some windows something like that. You can also put\nstraw bales around the base of your planter or wrap everything really\nthickly in burlap-- basically anything that's going to insulate that pot. I've\neven heard of people digging big holes, dropping that whole pot in the ground\nfor the winter because that's gonna give it similar to protection to being in\nground. I typically do the greenhouse or the straw bale method and that has\nworked well for me. And again I'm in Ohio 6a-- so if you're in\nlike zone 5, 4, 3 you're gonna want to give even more consideration to how\nyou're protecting these plants through the winters. And then the very last thing--\nnext year when you've got fruit on your plants, be aware that the birds also love\nblueberries and they will try to steal all the fruit. So you'll be admiring your\nwonderful crop set, you'll be waiting for them to turn the perfect shade of blue,\nyou'll think \"oh tomorrow's the day\" and that morning all the birds will strip\nyour plant! It happens inevitably, it's happened to\nme a million times. So if you notice that birds are eyeballing your plants you may\nwant to invest in some bird netting. Again it's easy with containers because\nyou can just drape that netting over the whole plant and pot and that's gonna\nkeep birds from most of the fruit so that you're getting some to actually\nenjoy after all your hard work. But that's it-- go get yourself some\nblueberries and big 'ol pots and plant up some blueberries today.

Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time!", "ZkM5NHv1628": "Berries come in all shapes and sizes. From the smallest blueberry to the biggest,\nspikiest pineapple, berries are about as varied and diverse as they come. While you may already know that there are\nmany varieties of berries that make for a healthy and nutritious snack, you might not\nbe fully aware of just how effective these little fruits can be when it comes to maintaining\na healthy lifestyle. In fact, according to the experts at Healthline,\nberries are in fact one of the healthiest foods that you can eat! In fact, we here at Bestie think that it would\nbe in your best interest to make an effort to eat berries every day. So what makes berries so special? Before we go any further, it would be \u201cberry\u201d\nkind of you to subscribe to our channel, and ring the notification bell. That way, you can get helpful tips and information\nthat we have to offer. Now then. we hope we didn\u2019t \u201cberry\u201d the ledge\nwith that little segue. Too many puns? We\u2019re sorry, hopefully, you can forgive\nus and \u201cberry\u201d the hatchet, unless you think that we\u2019ve crossed the line and that\nwas the final straw...berry. Okay, that was the last one, we promise. Now, let\u2019s move on and learn all about the\nmany reasons why you should consider eating berries every day. Low in Calories As you may already know, the average adult\nneeds a certain amount of calories per day in order to properly function. For women, the requirement is about 2000 calories\nper day on average, and for men, the average number is 2500. In order to lose weight, however, it\u2019s actually\nrecommended to consume 500 calories fewer per day; so around 1500 calories for women\nand 2000 for men on average. By maintaining this daily intake of calories,\nyou can expect to lose about 1 pound of excess body weight per week. One of the things that make berries so special\nis that they are relatively low in calories. To give you some examples of what we\u2019re\ntalking about: One cup of blueberries is about 84 calories, one cup of blackberries is about\n62 calories, and a single cup of strawberries can contain as little as 49 calories! With such a low-calorie count, that means\nthat you can eat more berries at once than you can with other foods, while still controlling\nyour daily calorie intake. And as we said before, limiting your daily\ncalories can help you lose weight at a rate of 1 pound per week, which means that after\none full week of eating berries, you can already expect to see progress towards your weight\nloss goals. Hey, one pound might not sound like much,\nbut it\u2019s a step in the right direction! Vitamins and Nutrients In addition to being relatively low in calories,\nmany types of berries contain a wide variety of beneficial vitamins, minerals, and other\nnutrients to help get you through your day. One very important vitamin that all berries\ncontain is Vitamin C, which helps your body\u2019s immune system and prevents diseases such as\nscurvy. Remember when we said that one cup of strawberries\nwould be about 49 calories? Well, in that same cup of strawberries, you\ncan expect to find a whopping total of 150 percent of your recommended daily intake of\nVitamin C! Additionally, berries provide an excellent\nsource of Manganese, which can prove the health of your brain, bones and nervous system, and\nVitamin K, which assists the body with blood clotting as well as bone metabolism. The fact that berries are so rich in nutrients\nyet so low in calories means that you can use them to ensure that you\u2019re getting all\nthe nutritional benefits you need in a day without accidentally overeating. After about a week of snacking on berries,\nyou\u2019ll not only be on the road to weight loss, but you\u2019ll probably be feeling healthier,\ntoo! Antioxidants Most types of berries come fully loaded, not\njust with a wealth of vitamins and minerals, but also with plenty of antioxidants as well. Berries contain a massive amount of antioxidants\nsuch as anthocyanins, ellagic acid and resveratrol; all of these antioxidants are helpful to your\nbody, as they can prevent cell damage by keeping the free radicals within your body at reasonable\nlevels. Among the many varieties of berries, a study\nhas shown that blueberries, blackberries and raspberries have some of the highest concentrations\nof antioxidants out of all commonly eaten fruits. Just another one of the many health benefits\nthat berries have to offer. In addition to preventing cell damage, the\nantioxidants found in berries can also help in preventing inflammation within the body. While inflammation is your body\u2019s natural\nway of fighting off injuries and infection, modern diets and lifestyles can often lead\nto excessive and chronic inflammation, which in turn can lead to unwanted conditions such\nas diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Thankfully, studies have shown that the antioxidants\nthat berries contain may be able to help lower and prevent the chances of chronic inflammation. In one of these studies, a group of people\nconsumed a strawberry drink along with a meal that was high in fat and carbs, and the result\nwas that the inflammatory markers in their body were much lower than those of a group\nthat didn\u2019t add the strawberries to their meal. What this means is that strawberries, as well\nas other types of berries, may be an ideal snack for those hoping to reduce the risk\nof heart disease, as well as other diseases and conditions. It is also believed that the antioxidants\nin berries can help to reduce the risk of certain types of cancer; specifically, cancer\nof the esophagus, mouth, breast and colon are all believed to present a reduced risk\nin individuals who consume berries every day. The anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and resveratrol\nfound in berries are all believed to reduce markers that are associated with the formation\nand growth of cancerous tumours in both people as well as animals. High in Fiber Like many plant-based foods, berries of all\nkinds are also an excellent source of fibre, which aids in your body\u2019s digestion and\nmay even help lessen the risk of certain diseases. More specifically, berries provide a very\ngood source of what\u2019s known as \u201csoluble fibre\u201d. Soluble fibre is characterized by the fact\nthat it dissolves in water, and studies have shown that the consumption of foods containing\nsoluble fibre can slow down the movement of food through your digestive system. This means that eating foods that contain\nsoluble fibres can reduce feelings of hunger and leave you feeling full for longer amounts\nof time, which in turn makes you less likely to overeat or snack on foods that contain\nempty calories. This, in addition to their already low-calorie\ncount, makes berries even more ideal for weight loss and weight management, since a healthy\nserving of berries will leave you feeling more full and satisfied than an equally-sized\nserving of other foods that don\u2019t contain soluble fibre. If that wasn\u2019t enough, the fact that berries\nare so high in fibre means that they are also low in carbs. Studies have shown that diets that focus on\nreducing carbs can be up to 2-3 times more effective at weight loss and management than\ndiets that focus on reducing fat. So that means that if you decide to put down\nthe chips and start making berries your daily snack instead, you can expect to see fast\nresults! Additionally, it is believed that the soluble\nfibre found in fruits and berries may also help your body by reducing \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol\nand keeping your heart healthy. Strawberries, for example, are an excellent\nsource of pectin, a type of soluble fibre that can reduce cholesterol by up to 10 percent! In addition, berries such as strawberries\nand black raspberries have also been shown to help lower and reduce cholesterol in individuals\nstruggling with obesity and metabolic syndrome. It is believed that berries may also help\nprevent heart disease by preventing LDL, or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, from becoming oxidized\nor damaged. Berries May Improve Blood Sugar Studies have indicated that berries may also\nbe useful when it comes to improving your body\u2019s blood sugar levels, as well as improving\nyour body\u2019s insulin sensitivity and insulin response. In one of these studies, a group of healthy\nwomen consumed 5 ounces of strawberries or mixed berries, or about 150 grams, along with\nbread every day. The resulting data found that the inclusion\nof berries helps reduce insulin levels by as much as 26 percent compared to the bread\nalone. In another study, obese individuals who were\nstruggling with insulin resistance were encouraged to consume a blueberry smoothie twice per\nday. As a result, the individuals who consumed\nthe smoothies experienced greater improvements to their overall insulin sensitivity than\nthose who did not. This means that people who suffer from insulin\nresistance can turn to berries as an option to improve their insulin sensitivity and potentially\nlessen the negative effects of their condition. Thanks, berries! So the next time you decide to search your\nkitchen for something to snack on, you may want to consider putting away the chips and\ncookies, and instead reach for a cup of fresh berries. Not only will the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants\nhelp to keep your body healthy and protected against disease, but they will also leave\nyou feeling full and satisfied with fewer calories, allowing you to start seeing weight\nloss results in as little as one week. While they might come in all sorts of shapes\nand sizes, one thing is clear: with berries, you can\u2019t go wrong. Did you find this video helpful or informative?

Let us know in the comment section below.", "Px8jx9rIcr0": "all right welcome back everybody today it's time to revisit my Project X series the sort of non-conventional beers that are really fun to brew but have probably some wild results so today we're gonna be making a fruit beer a blueberry we tail to be exact so this is a beer that um was kind of inspired by some outside input and I might be brewing this for somebody but it's still something that's fun for me I made a ton of summer beers this summer and each of them is like oh this will be my last summer beer but I keep making them because I keep drinking them and giving them away so I'm pretty sure this is gonna be it my last summer beer that it'll be fun to make anyway so it's a blueberry wee Dale right so what we're actually doing today only is making a wheat ale know sort of blueberry stuff is going to go into it today so the way that that's gonna work you can either do some sort of flavor extracts means your own tincture with like vodka and blueberries or you can buy premade extract that's all well and good but I want to try and do this the hard way so I got some blueberry puree three pounds of it to be exact arriving in the mail pretty soon so once the primary stage of fermentation is done on this beer we're gonna go ahead and rack it on to the blueberry puree and then it'll actually reefer mint a little bit it's gonna ferment out most of those sugars but leave a good amount of blueberry flavor behind hopefully and maybe we'll get a cool color out of it so no idea really what's gonna happen with this beer I have no idea what to expect but it'll be a lot of fun in the process and regardless of how it turns out I'm gonna let you guys know so anyway here's a recipe for today it's just gonna be a simple wheat ale okay so we're just using six pounds of American Way week four pounds of us to row and half a pound of carrot peeled and then four hops it's just one ounce of Willamette at 60 minutes just a bitter that's it and then for yeast why you use 1010 that's the American wheat for water I'm not looking at this too seriously so I just kind of grabbed it a water profile that I used in a Belgian beer a little while back that worked out really well for me so that's 86 parts per million of calcium 11 parts per million of magnesium 65 parts per million of sodium 130 parts per million of sulfate 100 parts per million of fluoride 90 parts per million of carbonate and in order to achieve that I had six grams of gypsum 2 grams of Epsom and 3 grams of calcium carbonate aka chalk so for mashing we're gonna match this at a higher temperature 150 for mainly because I kind of expect the fruit addition later on to dry the beer out pretty seriously so I want to keep some residual sweetness in there to balance out and he's sort of unattended like tartness from the various signs of sugar so we're gonna leave that a 150 forward and look at that for 90 minutes I hope it's gonna be pretty fun and easy beer to brew I'm heating up by a strike water right now it's got half a Campden tablet in it so that's getting rid of any chloramines from the water and then I've added my brewing salts on top of that so shortly we should be able to mash the in okay so a strike water has reached the appropriate temperature so it's time to pull out the heat stick and start doing in the greens [Applause] [Music] all right so my thermometer that I always use has read its last temperature so unfortunately that is gone so I have to use my backup which is bear with me this little meat thermometer here so this is gonna be a very interesting approximation probably not super precise at all but hopefully it works because this is the only thermometer I have right now I mean if I'm reading this correctly it says 154 maybe 155 I'm going to call it I hope it is [Music] all right so that's about ten minutes into the mash right now so it's time to take a sample from the mash and check its pH make sure we're more or less on target okay so it looks like it's somewhere between five and five point five which is wherever you want to be so I'm not going to dust anything in the mash and it should be fine [Music] alright ending the match looks like we're at about 150 degrees more or less very much approximate with this thermometer but that's that's fine go ahead and start draining things out now [Music] okay so we got about six and a half gallons from our first Runnings so our pre boil volume is eight gallons so for my second runnings I'm going to go ahead and add about a gallon and a half of water to boil kettle and let it do its thing I let it sit for like minute 20 minutes and then we'll drain out the rest of the second runnings and then top up our okay [Music] [Music] all right so now you can tell the boils begun so given this is a wheat beer it's not a very clear clean beer by style so I'm not going to worry about adding things like world flock or other clarifying agents I'm not even gonna worry about bagging my hops so I think I'm just gonna dump this only hop addition it's just this one ounce of Willamette I'm just gonna dump it straight in and go from there it's the only hop addition in the entire brew very simple everyday for sure so we'll come back in about 50 minutes and then we'll add our chiller and use nutrient stuff like that so let this sit for a few minutes so our pre boil og sample is still a bit warm right now it's about 90 degrees so it's reading about one point zero three to add two points to that and call up one point zero three four okay so we're not ten minutes from the end of the boil so it's time to add our chiller so that we can start sanitizing knack and then I'm gonna add some yeast new crown [Music] okay so we've reached either parboiled time to shut everything on and we'll start the cooling process [Music] okay well broom was exceptionally easy today seriously there was not much about that one hop addition a very simple granville pretty standard brew day all things considered so that part was really nice well the post brew part of this is where it gets slightly more complicated so we're gonna be looking at adding some adjuncts in the secondary phase of fermentation so after this is cooled down we're gonna pinch our yeast or in fermented as normal so once we complete the first the primary stage of fermentation and the crafts was following and most activity has finished that's going to be somewhere around 7 to 10 days we're gonna take three pounds of blueberry puree which is on its way now it's in the mail somewhere it's basically concentrated blueberry stuff it's made from the real fruit and it's basically just going to give us a really good flavor from the blueberry but also add a little bit of sugar it's gonna ferment it down a little bit further but it's gonna give us color and hopefully a good blueberry character I've never actually brewed a root beer before but nearly every single resource I can find has advocated for adding the fruit flavor in with this method using puree so that's what we're gonna do hopefully it works anyway we're gonna what's a primary fermentation is complete we're gonna rack into a secondary fermenter and Racquet on top of the actual blueberry puree now given that that's a lot of sugar in that that's going to kind of restart permutation it's going to become active and it'll probably ferment through that pretty fast I would hope once activity is finished and that part of that sit for a couple days and then we'll go ahead and cake and we'll see how it worked all right so our original gravity sample is still kind of a bit warm it's about 80 degrees so we're adding about two points to the measured gravity here which is one point zero four three so we're gonna call it one point zero four five for our original gravity [Music] all right so the words somewhere around like 75 inch degrees still definitely way too hot to fit cheese so I'm just gonna let this cool down overnight and by the morning hopefully we'll be closer to our ideal temperature like 65 it will pitch our use tomorrow morning should be fine anyway I'm gonna aerate by splashing [Music] okay so today is the day that we're going to add the blueberry puree all three pounds of it to a secondary fermentation and get this wheat beer transferred over so right now this is the color of Louie beer prior to any adjuncts being in it just a nice pale gold wheat beer it's very simple so the gravity right now is one point zero one two which makes me believe the fermentation pretty much complete the crossing has fallen it's only been a week so it is still a bit young but fermentation will definitely kick back off once we add this blueberry puree right now the flavor is really nice and gentle well but I kinda like bread crust eat pie crust II kind of smoothness to it really nice mouthfeel around ya really very simple base to it there definitely a very delicious beer as it is right now nothing interesting that's the blueberries important but overall not a bad base so I think it's definitely ready to add the fruit I'm Nathalie interested to see how the color changes and how the flavor ends up after this so stay tuned alright so here I have three pounds of blueberry puree okay so this is actually made for beer and wine making specifically so it's been commercially sterilized so the only thing we need to be sure of is that the can itself to sterilize think of it like a package of yeast right so we're gonna go ahead and sanitize the top portion of the can then we're gonna open this is obviously a sanitized secondary fermenter and I have sanitized can opener here so we'll go ahead and open this up so here it is it's basically just like a syrup kind of pretty watery though it smells really good and then yeah we're just gonna basically dump this into the fermenter before we rack the beer I'm gonna get an idea of how strong this is that's actually um that's pretty tasty it's kind of like a blueberry spread or a blueberry jam okay from here on that we're just gonna rack the beer right on top of this as gently as possible so as not to accidentally introduce oxygen into [Music] so I've had the blueberry wheat on the blueberry puree for about four or five days now and it's completely fermented through all the sugars that were in that so the gravity right now is sitting at about ten ten now keep in mind we had added a lot of sugars for that so I really have no real idea of how much alcohol is actually in this so I like based on conventional calculations of original gravity to final gravity we'd have about four and a half-ish percent right now but we added a whole lot of sugar so I don't really know but I'm just gonna kind of ballpark it and say that it's probably about five percent ABV so I think this is good it tastes pretty nicely it's somewhat tart at the moment but we're gonna put this on gas pretty soon and get it carved up and ready to serve okay so fermentation of this beer went pretty well all things considered as you saw we added the blueberry puree and there was a whole second fermentation he generated a brand new Crowson and dramatically changed the color of the beer I think that whole process took about three days for the active fermentation and then I let it sit for another four or five days I think I have about a week's worth of time on the blueberries just absorbing flavor and getting nice then as you saw we recorded our final gravity and then I cake that and let it sit for two weeks on gas naturally carbonated pretty pleased with the results but one thing I should definitely not view is that I don't have a clear idea of what the actual alcohol content of this beer is so the base beer itself was going to be around 4.5 or 4.7 percent I think but adding the three pounds of sugar heavy puree definitely does pump that content up a bit however granted we added that to five gallons of liquid I think it came with an estimated gravity of the syrup itself so I think it was about 1048 for three pounds of it and I if my math works out it's somewhere around that adds like something like half a percent to one percent alcohol to overall beer anyway I'm not gonna be too overly concerned about science and specifics with this so I just kind of ballpark to debt about 5% ABV because that's what it is all right it's called Project X number two it is around 5% ABV as I told you earlier and it comes in about twenty IBUs all right so Paris is why starting off we've got a very nice fluffy head thank you wheat malt it's pretty strong thanks to me turning up the gas a bit but the head retention is awesome sticks around forever thank you we'd want once again color wise well it's not super appetizing to look at it looks kind of like a weird brownish kind of like brownish orange ish I mean it's really not an appetizing looking color at all it's not great clarity is not there as a wheat beer it is not supposed to be clear so we're still fine with that aroma has pretty strong with just heart blueberry a little bit of yeah a little bit of the wheat malt coming through a little bit of kind of not like a half of ice in the style will wheat there's no yeast esters coming through that's just kind of like a you get a little bit of blueberry and kind of a whiff of a little bit of bread hmm the mouthfeel of this thing is just super velvety smooth soft squishy I love it it's uh it's like a medium to medium full-body beer but it's a very very soft palatable moment now feel this a very very soft mouth feel that I really really enjoy all right and finally flavor so the first thing is actually an immediate tartness so because it's a fruit and it's full of simple sugars the yeast are going to ferment out all those simple sugars leaving the tart part of the fruit behind it's not an immediately sweet beer because of that it has a little bit of tartness but it's not very aggressive at all the nice thing about this and the reason why so many fruit peers are wheat beers is because the wheat malt actually has kind of this residual high crusty kind of characteristic to it so this has not only velvety softness and very very nice smooth I'll feel it's paired with a very very nicely balanced set of flavors and the tartness of the blueberries fades into a very nice full satisfying pie crust II really kind of characteristic from the wheat moment which makes this almost a little bit like blueberry pie in a glass on top of that it is extremely drinkable not very heavy not very high alcohol content very refreshing no yeast flavor at all coming through which is a good thing that was not the point in this beer I'm not really picking up on any sort of esters or phenols coming which is good means her fermentation was done at the proper rate proper temperature nothing is really overpowering in this beer there's no hop flavor good and there's no hop aroma but the whole point of this was to showcase the blueberry flavor and see what we could do with this fruit beer so you know it's definitely not without its drawbacks for sure most obviously the color kind of is not great um this would be one where I would be tempted to toss in a little food coloring to see what that would do maybe like little blue or a little you know yeah like a little blue would be interesting yeah we probably just make this dark and look at black it would be maybe a little blue maybe a little red in the right light this will actually look somewhat like a dark red but now in a normal light I don't think so it's more of like a dark brown copperish goldish orangish thing um I could also go for maybe a little less tartness up front but that may actually fade with time because it was even more tart earlier like a couple weeks ago so and it's been in the keg actually I should say for a couple weeks so it has had some time to aged and develop a little more flavor other than that it's really pretty hard to find flaws with this unless you're looking for a very sweet beer but it's very difficult to get very sweet fruit beer without using any sort of artificial ingredients in there which I really didn't feel like I wanted to do the person that requested that I brew this beer loves it so I consider it definitely a win and I like it - it's actually like a really nice kind of end to summer beer definitely recommend brewing this one I could see this beer base working very well with any set of fruits assuming to use the fruit puree method just be prepared for slightly tarter results than you might be thinking of but understand that that is very enjoyable thing if you give it a little time and you know you have enough malt character in the background and balance it out don't go overboard on the fruit trust me and we're definitely looking to bring fruit beers like this again with different fruits maybe apple would be pretty good to be interesting just to play around with it's definitely fun a little experiment so thanks for sticking around do the end of the video if you liked it go ahead and give that a thumbs up helps my channel become a lot more relevant to the

nature ripe you also have these blueberries by sunny ridge now the ones by nature right these nice big juicy things see great big things take a look see nice and big and juicy versus you get these little bitty shriveled things from uh sunny ridge and you also get a lot less of them see only like a few of them near the bottom but when you go and tell this to the store owner not store manager store owner well they're exactly the same well well they're exactly the same just get out of here they're exactly the same but they're not exactly the same see great big juicy plump blueberries and lots of them over 100 of them and here is like less than 50 into these tiny little shriveled things and and they look like they have mold or something they don't look very good i mean and you're paying exactly the same 399 for each bin it's not fair that's not all i would say product comparison i would say here you're getting bigger better higher quality blueberries and here you're getting these low quality little bitty things and the store has both of them side by side so my suggestion is tasting them to tell you the truth i've already run the taste test i don't think they taste all that different except that this one with the little shriveled ones some of these are not ripe and they're like sour but other than that most of them are okay", "qt7EP0KD8zw": "[Music] [Music] delicious hi tom spellman bill purcell we're here at uh dave wilson nurseries hickman yard this morning and we're going to show you what you can do with blueberries for home gardeners so we've got some blueberries that we're just about ready to start shipping these are one year plants in our four by nine grower pots and this is the size that will be distributed out to the retail nurseries here in another couple weeks or a month we just love this size of plant it will fruit right away you're going to get flowers and fruit on all this wood that's going to go dormant here this winter a couple of things that are really important to success with blueberries and i know we've talked about this before but number one fast draining soil you don't want a pot that doesn't have holes in it you don't want soil that's too heavy or has too much clay you want to make sure the water goes right through and out the bottom of the drainage holes the next most important consideration is an acidic soil base so we'd like to use a component of different soils to blend to come up with our mix for blueberries so the first component a good organic type potting soil and this has this has some sand it has some pumice it has some perlite and some organic material the next component good old-fashioned peat moss just sphagnum pieces regular ground sphagnum peat moss and then the third component is a finely ground bark an orchid bark or a pathway type bark like small we'll mix these in equal proportions one third of each to come up with our with our final blend and then we'll plant our plants into these containers so phil's already started on putting some of our mix together but i'll show you kind of how easy it really is just you know got an empty number five container just this is not scientific so i'll just go ahead and start off with the potting soil dump it in and go ahead and scoop in the sphagnum peat moss make sure when you're using the peat moss that comes in a bale like this that you're crunching it up and breaking it up pull that in there gives it good acidity and finish it off with some pathway bark this is going to give it the good drainage all the stuff available at your local garden center we'll get the base mix there and then we like adding in a good fertilizer benefits of something like this tom a starter blend fertilizer so number one thing on blueberries no high nitrogen you want a low nitrogen fertilizer so something where the phosphorus and the potash are three or four times higher than the nitrogen level so this is a 3 12 12. we also want to make sure that we have a humic acid base this is a humic acid based product and it has small amounts of trace elements so zinc iron manganese a little soil sulfur so these are all things that will help to keep the soil conditions acidic and good starter blend to put out a root system it's still warm enough that these plants are going to root out this fall there's they're going to start to fill in the dimensions of this container so that when they bloom out in the spring they'll already be working off an established root system and you'll get fruit off these plants right away you'll have fruit off these plants next year in april or may so we want to make sure we're giving them a good start let me just go ahead and add a little bit of this in there probably for the the three um number five size containers of of the mixed media we probably want half a pound or so of that fertilizer blended in there maybe even a little bit more since it is low nitrogen we're not going to burn with it but we don't want to push the plants this time of year we just want to give them a start so that they can root out into the new containers and then establish over the winter i'll just shoot three right here give it a good start and then pretty simple from here just gonna mix it up get a nice good mix here now one thing that's important uh all three of these elements had a fair amount of moisture the potting soil was nice and moist the bark had some moisture and most important the peat moss had some moisture if you're using dry peat moss you want to soak it first you want to make sure that it's really wet before you use it peat moss doesn't normally take any irrigation very well if you're starting off with a dry product so make sure that you have a fair amount of moisture in the soil before you begin another thing you want to make sure of when you're transplanting young plants like this is that the root ball that you're transplanting is also moist we want to never want to transplant a dry root ball so make sure that you pre-irrigate the plants so you have a nice moist root ball we've got our container here and we're going to plant a two-in-one combination this variety is emerald which is a nice large fruiting blueberry this variety is sunshine blue so sunshine blue is a very compact plant it's a small berry very very flavorful even though these varieties are all self-fruitful you get much better production if you grow at least two or three or four varieties together so that cross bloom between the varieties will give you a definite increase in production kind of like in the size of the container too this is probably for two is about the smallest that you want to go with you know plant two right you can go ahead and you know get a bigger container a little more room get in the wine barrel you do three three or four i i've done most of my half wine barrels with four varieties in the barrel okay so lots of great cross-pollination lots of successive ripening berries throughout the season but this is a good-sized container for two and since this root ball is about nine inches deep containers about 12 inches deep so we're going to start off with a couple of good shovelfuls of media in the container before we set the plants so that's probably a good start now it's okay on these to even plant them a little high so you don't necessarily want to put this root ball down below the new soil level that you're establishing in this container so you can just set them opposite each other put them right about to the top of the rim of the container and then start just packing some soil around them once these are done i want to see this little four inch root ball i want that exposed on the surface i don't want that buried i want to make sure that that those top roots can oxygenate and breathe well the worst thing you can do is is bury that too deep and then you you create an anaerobic condition where that that soil can't breathe and you don't have any any porosity in it even though you have good drainage you can still have rock that way so make sure that you've got that top of that cont of that existing four inch container or whatever size you're transplanting out of that you have that exposed right at the surface so we are don't want to have too much of a high pressure right we don't brush all the soil immediately so slow and steady so make to make sure that the the soil ball is is fully saturated make sure you kind of poke all the air pockets out of there you don't want little air pockets in there so you can see how fast draining this is right now yeah that's what the bark does so and you when you when you do this when you do this initial irrigation you want to irrigate let it sit for a few minutes come back and irrigate again maybe even do it three or four times so that you know you've now totally saturated this new root zone and that'll give you nice quick expansion of that root system yeah that's good for right now as far as pruning on these they're you know they're a little um in balance you could come in here and make a couple of pruning cuts but the one consideration you all will always want to consider with blueberries is every cut that you make now in the fall or in the winter is taking away fruiting wood for next spring so for me the plants look look pretty good you've got a nice ratio in the container and all these tips are where we're going to get bloom next spring so i'm not going to do any pruning right now i'm going to leave these alone i'm going to let them flower i'm going to take advantage of some berries where if i was planting an established fruit tree or larger fruit tree an apple a peach a persimmon a nectarine an apricot i wouldn't want it to fruit the first year but these are nice little tight well-established plants and they're perfectly fruiting able and we'll be eating blueberries off of these by april or may so we got here going on here is it tom this is um one of the the oddball varieties in the blueberry family it's not a blueberry it's a pink blueberry okay we've talked about this one before it's uh pink lemonade is the variety and but it is it does bloom uh inner bloom and will cross pollinate with the other southern high bush blues okay so since we have those two varieties together this is a little bigger isn't that a beautiful plant i mean look at that it's a one-year plant nice structure so now we have a variety that will inner bloom with our blues and it gives you an alternate type berry so we can you could easily grow this one in combination if you had a half barrel or a larger container put three or four in there you could put a pink in with a couple of blues or you can do it separately like this so we're gonna we're gonna grow this in a separate container of its own and just keep it close by so that there's plenty of opportunity for the bees to pollinate in in between the varieties the other thing is you know there are so many great options for pots our first one was the classic italian clay pot right that's terrible yeah now i mean you can go out to any independent garden center and they have you know all these different colored pots that you can put in there and kind of really dress up the patio and that's the whole idea the the selection of containers is more diverse and more dynamic than ever before yeah you've got cleaner gardeners plastic containers you've got high fire ceramics you've got terra cottas you've got uh you know mexican style pottery you've got all these different types of containers yep one thing that i think is really important that i always take into consideration when choosing a container especially something like this that i know within a couple of years or three years i'm going to transplant out so i don't want a container that has a tapered side that tapers inward i don't want an urn type container i want something where the base is narrower than the rim that way you can turn this up on its side roll it a couple of times pop that plant right out right if you have an urn style container and some of these containers are spendy they are you can spend 100 200 300 dollars they look great at the very beginning but it's what absolutely you have to get a hammer one shot deal yeah the only way to transplant out of that pot is to break that pot so uh make sure you're choosing tapered sides where the base is narrower than the lip or the rim so this one we're just going to go ahead simple planting same mix you know equal parts spark peat moss organic potting soil a little bit of grow fertilizer and get it done same thing you know we put some we uh added some soil to the bottom of the container before we set the plant in get this packed around the sides nicely get all the air pockets out and you know it might seem like people are like isn't that kind of a big container i'm almost told to go up one size you know the mix we're using the whole idea is that it's fast straining so we're not worried about this container being too big this is going to grow right into it you'll get a good three four years of of growing in here if you want but with this fast drain you mix this container size is not too big just like that no i think it's perfect and the other thing you always want to take into consideration for something like this that's more shrub form than it doesn't have a tree stem or something so you want to make sure that you're maintaining a balance you're going to do your pruning on these in the summer after the crop has been harvested and you want to prune this plant back to keep it into a balance with the size of the container you've given the plant to grow in so top to root ratio should be very close that's going to give you longevity that's going to allow this plant to grow in this container for at least three if not four years yeah so like you say our plants come in four inch containers if you were to put this in a six inch container it's already too small absolutely so this is i'll grow that in in a couple of months yep so we don't have to stick to blueberries on this this is a nice sized container nice decorative container nice high glaze on the outside and this is a baby cakes blackberry it's one of our bushel and berry varieties so it's not a big vigorous vine it's more a shrub form blackberry that'll produce again on on young wood it'll produce on these on these tips that are going to harden up this winter right it was hybridized for container gardening just like it's counterpart raspberry shortcake which is very raspberry so we we do have those selections that are grown specifically for container culture on the blackberries and on the raspberries and this one the i the flavor on this one is excellent i would compare this to any of the standard blackberry varieties very productive good sized fruit and really nice flavor yep how about the soil so you know we got this mix right here and it's custom for blueberries good for this too i think we're good for this you know it's it's going to be uh slightly acidic it still drains really well yeah so um drainage is key in container gardening any container culture you want to make sure you have really good drainage so i think this mix is going to work just fine for your blackberry as well as the blueberries get this thing planted up [Music] again get all that all that soil packed down so you get the air pockets out a little more yeah a little bit more again we're going to leave that that existing root ball just just barely exposed at the surface so after you irrigate it down a couple of times you're going to be able to see that original four inch square outline of that root ball you don't want to cover that you don't want to bury that you want to make sure that you're keeping it right at the soil surface or just slightly above man i can't wait we're going to have fresh blueberries pink blueberries and blackberries this coming spring i'm hungry already all right watering this in tom yup a lot of people ask about watering and how you should do it and well you know phil there's so many variables on that i mean you know how fast draining is your soil what what's the weather like is the plant in a vigorous stage of growth so all inside always the best way to uh irrigate is to check the soil moisture before make get a moisture meter or just you know put your finger down or a knife blade down into that container and see what the moisture level is like at two three four inches below the surface you don't want it to ever go bone dry but you wanna you wanna make sure that it goes just slightly dry in between irrigations so and when you do irrigate make it count make it thorough so like this right here just planted it knowing that you know we want to thoroughly soak it yes it's you know the soil we don't want wicking away we want everything to be in line so you can see right now it's drained through and uh you know maybe we'll pack you down a little bit more if it needs a little bit of soil just top it off a little bit irrigate it again a couple more times right away so that we know there there's no air pockets and that soil is saturated at this point you really can't over water it when you first put it in there the first three or four days you could you could basically set it in a bucket of water almost and you'd be fine but after that you're going to want it to be able to drain out thoroughly and you're going to want it to go just slightly dry in between irrigations and so something like this after it finishes fruiting in the summertime great time just go ahead you're out there hedging everything else just make this a nice you know hedge it out yes and push out new growth for next year absolutely so enjoy your berries you

"everybody hopefully all of you are doing well I decided we needed to do a little bit of baking today we're going to be making my sour cream blueberry and lemon pound cake get your ingredients together let's go since one of the ingredients in the pound cake is lemon we're going to start by zesting a whole lemon and we're also going to use some of the juice for the cake and the icing if you're using smaller lemons like the ones I ended up getting you might need to for the recipe but it's not a big deal next I'm going to cream one cup of butter and three cups of sugar together until it's nice and creamy after I get my butter and my sugar creamed together really well I'm going to go ahead and add 6 eggs one at a time making sure that each one is incorporated well before adding the next now I know some of you and pound cakes tend to cut down on some of the sugar this is one I am going to discourage you from doing that because of the sour cream in this recipe the sour cream kind of pulls on that sweetness so you don't want to leave out any sugar this time so follow through for those of you wondering if blueberries and lemons go together well they actually do they are used quite often as companions in the baking world between scones and muffins and things like that so why not in a sour cream pound cake what I've just added was some fresh lemon juice vanilla and lemon extracts and I'm just going to fold those in and then continue on with my dry ingredients now here's how I prepare my dry ingredients when the cameras are off I actually put a piece of parchment paper in the sifter and put the flour baking soda and salt in here and I shake out a third of what I need I blend it together and then I'm going to alternate with the sour cream for this recipe we're going to need 8 ounces of sour cream for the exact measurements to this recipe and others check out Gd seasoning calm the link will be in the description so once I'm done ultimately adding my dry ingredients and the sour cream all I have to do is move on to folding in my fresh blueberries and my lemon zest if you guys are enjoying this video don't forget to hit that thumbs up button and subscribe if this is your first time watching one of my videos so we can hang out and cook some more we cook a lot over here I've got all of my blueberries folded into the batter and now I'm just going to take the batter and pour it into my prepared two pan you can also use a fluted cake pan if you like either one will do we're going to bake the pound cake in a preheated oven of 325 degrees Fahrenheit for one hour and 25 to 30 minutes be sure and check it with a skewer at the 1 hour and 25-minute mark because it should come out clean and when it does it'll look nice puffy and golden just like this I usually let the cake stay in the pan for about 10 minutes and then I invert it so it can completely cool on a rack for a little more than an hour and then you can pour over this luscious icing that we've made of powdered sugar and a little lemon juice and even if you want to you can add some lemon zest from another limit that will push that lemon flavor even further if you look close to the second pound cake that I made you could actually see the flecks of lemon zest right in the icing when you cut it it is so moist the top gets nice and crunchy and it just contrasts really well with the moist cake and the softness of the blueberries and that icing just all types of good I want to thank you guys so much for joining me you know I appreciate it when you come and cook with me

sellers are saying that this is a native blueberry when in fact tag PO is not even related to blueberries what is tag Pope botany tag po or our dishes Kwame Lhasa is a small tree reaching a height of about 10 meters leaves are alternate of lanceolate to elliptic of lanceolate 6 to 15 centimeters long 2 to 6 centimeters wide and pointed at both ends flowers are white or pink fragrant born on compound terminal or lateral inflorescences and about 1 centimeter in length fruit is dark blue or purple rounded and 5 to 8 millimeters in diameter distribution common in primary forests at low and medium altitudes ascending to 1,000 meters throughout the Philippines occurs in India Sri Lanka Indochina Malaysia Indonesia and New Guinea now why we Filipinos should not call tak PO as native blueberry let's do the comparison number one tag po came from genus our dish' and blueberries came from vaccinium from their genus we can easily say that they are not related number two tag po grow is a tall tree while blueberries are bushy number three tag pose fruit turns from green to red to purple ish or black while blueberries turns from green to blue or darker blue number four in terms of

using fresh and seasonal fruit. Blueberries are essential and they're so diverse to use - raw, cooked, frozen - and have a ton of flavor. They have sweet components, savory, sometimes a little bit salty, and even bitter. Today I'll be making a blueberry whiskey sour. It'll be using whiskey, fresh lemon juice,\na little bit of sweet vermouth and of course, blueberries. In this case I made a blueberry jam using fresh blueberries a little bit of sugar, water, and a pinch of sea salt to get it started. Blueberry jam adds a great viscosity, body, and mouth feel to the cocktail. Unlike a traditional whiskey sour, instead of egg white we use the\nblueberry jam to incorporate it and garnish with a lemon twist and some\nfresh blueberries. The next cocktail I'll be making is a\ncorn blueberry spritz. Using Nixta corn liqueur, Amara\nMontenegro, some fresh blueberries and topping it\noff with soda water. As the cocktail melts and dilutes, the\nblueberries incorporate in flavor and also look amazing.

halfway through the review with that one and yeah so I'm gonna try to keep this as authentic as any other smoked CBD review but I do apologize if this one feels a little off from usual or if I forget some things to forget to mention some stuff I apologize I just really want to get this review done tonight I've been meaning to get this review done for a while now and yeah let's get right into it

anyways when you go to this website click on the sour blueberry Kush train they have the best description guys their slogan what's in your bud they mean it they they want to let you know everything going on with your hemp flower it's all out on the table nothing under the rug and yeah it says sour blueberry cush is one of the most unique flowers we've had in a while and with its sour blueberry and cush genetics it's no wonder why with parents so famous and they go on to tell you the appearance smell taste effects cannabinoid profile 17.8% CBD a guys that's a great number I think it's like fifty fifteen and a half percent CBD total and it says like with all strains with cush lineage sour blueberry Kush retains its characteristic hybrid backbone with slight sativa effects a jack-of-all-trades this incredibly unique smelling bud will satisfy you day or night now in my first attempt of recording the review for this sour blueberry Kush I could not get over the smell that was my this was my first time trying this strain was tonight because I only ordered a gram of this stuff so I waited this whole time to try it with you guys tonight as you can see I've already been trying it but I couldn't get over the smell guys it's uh it's a very unique sweet and sour smell mostly sour with the smell with a slight undertone of berry it's like Sour Diesel meets berry blossom but you know the Sour Diesel is on the heavier side it's got a such a pleasant smell one of the best noses of any sour strain I've had dr. ganja there definitely been putting out some great new strains lately and yeah it's so pleasant like it's mostly sour but it's got the right amount of like sweet berry underneath it just to top it off and it's almost hard to put your finger on what it smells like but it smells amazing guys anyways I'm probably gonna try to somehow edit in me rolling the joint that way like I said I want this to be as authentic as it can but I just wanted to let you guys know that it is already rolled you're just gonna see me roll one plus it gives you guys a little bit of time to join me and roll one up with me that way we can get the good vibes going guys get

flower that's how much they pop out of this string so if you've made it this far in the video I feel as if I have deserved your subscription so go ahead and click that subscribe button for me join family and another thing I love about dr. ganja is when a strain has seeds they they mention it on the website so like this sour blueberry Kush they put under the description it says sour blueberry Kush does contain some seeds which actually may be a good thing as many of our customers have asked for seeds and I rolled up one of my buds from my gram didn't find a single seed I seen a seed pocket without a seed in it but no seeds so I just think it's amazing that dr. ganja they they literally don't hide a thing they know that there is a certain type of smoker out there and a lot of them that they don't like seeds and they still are going to put it on this train knowing that a lot of people probably aren't going to order it just because of that that's awesome they they are so upfront that's what you gotta love about dr. ganja and yeah just just saying it's definitely not seed heavy because I mean I I grinded up almost by half a gram point six point seven and there was not a single seed in that bud so not a problem guys and yeah it was super sticky it stucked my grinder up caked it up pretty good and grinded up the smell so sour so pungent everything about this sour blueberry cush I've enjoyed greatly so far so yeah guys link will be down in the comments pinned to the top go check it out you can read all about this sour blueberry cush guys I hope you guys took that time out to roll on yourself that way we can get right into this session and enjoy some perfectly legal CBD hemp flour guys doctor ganja they are the bee's knees I'm trying not to cuss on this channel so I apologize I've already smoked about half of this joint and right now I'm feeling very focused obviously I was stressed because this is my third attempt to make this review but it kept me calm but not in like a tired calming way but just you know I just kept me positive kept me focused and ready to go again so the sativa effects are definitely felt I'm gonna go ahead and light this back up so I can just burn with you guys and talk more about this cush guys it's our blueberry Cheers as I was saying about the taste in my first attempt at this review obviously the the joint has gone out and I relayed it so the taste isn't as authentic right now but when I first loaded up it was crazy so with the smell I get a lot more sour than I do like sweet berry but with the taste it's like an equal balance you get a lot more of the berry in the taste than you do with the smell it's the perfect balance and it's a very pleasant tasting strain and yeah the the effects I were I was feeling after the first hit the effects are very potent it's got a nice heavy smoke it's easy on the throat and yeah guys everything about this our blueberry Kush has been so pleasant at number two luckily in my first attempt of reviewing this I didn't get too far to where I was doing the dink dunk but I got a give this our blue because the dink dunk it is well deserving of it everything about this drain was at least an eight or nine out of ten great sativa effects amazing smell looks taste and yeah guys everything about dr. ganja has been super satisfying they their order ship fast they ship discreetly they double steal the bags and plus they're wide option of hemp flour strains everything that they include in the details I mean dr. ganja they got a formula and it's working it's working well and people

about this crazy moist sour cream blueberry crumb cake set it with fat juicy organic blueberries and sent it with fresh lemon zest you're not ready not only is this cake super easy to make it's completely sugar-free low-carb and keto friendly let's get started okay so in a large bowl you're gonna whisk together the almond and coconut flowers just to break up any lumps they're going to add the baking powder and salt and whisk back to combine [Music] next add the sweeteners to the softened butter and beat until fluffy I'm gonna take about two to three minutes you're going to add two large eggs and beat that for an additional minute some tiny little lumps will remain and look a little grainy but don't worry about that then you're gonna add the full fat sour cream vanilla and almond extracts mix everything until it's fully combined and don't forget the lemon zest like I almost do I'm just scraping off the bits of zest that was stuck to the beaters because I want it all up in there okay pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture then whisk to combine make sure you don't see any more dry pockets of flour set that to the side and make the crumble whisk together the almond flour coconut flour sweetener and cinnamon in a medium bowl until combined and then add the room temperature butter you just want to beat that until crumbs form you're going to prepare a 9-inch springform pan by lining it with parchment paper and spraying it down with flour free non-stick baking spray [Music] pour the batter into the pan and use a silicone spatula to even it out add a layer of fat juicy blueberries and then press the blueberries into the batter just slightly top with the crumb mixture and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 35 to 40 minutes [Music] when the cake is done allow it to cool to room temperature completely it'll take a couple of hours grab your favorite pedo confectioner sweetener and give it a hefty dusting keep in mind that the fat from the almonds will soak up most of the confectioner sweetener so don't be afraid to go heavy slice it up and serve it with some of your favorite sugar-free vanilla bean ice cream and hug yourself this stuff is so damn good honestly guys this cake is so good it's so moist it's just moist beyond moist and the blueberries are so sweet and juicy you got to eat this with ice cream because the ice cream just kind of melts into the nooks and crannies of the cake and it all becomes like this one delicious mouthfeel it feels kind of sinful when you're eating it and honestly you don't need teeth to eat this that tender just in case you're wondering of course you can use any berry that you love but the blueberries y'all is hitting you got to try it I hope you enjoy this recipe you can get it down below in the description box hit that like button subscribe if you haven't already and I'll see you guys in the next video bye oh sure you wanna lead [Music]", "2mpJdqs1vKc": "I have a fruit platter with 5 different types of\nberries with whipped cream Blueberry It's about the size of my two fingers It's firm and sweet Blueberry doesn't have much flavor I think it's more flavorful when you put them in cake, pie etc. Raspberry It's a little sour\n ..but it pairs well with whipped cream Blackberry The taste depends on how ripe they are It's sweet when they're fully ripe I'm lucky this time, my blackberries are perfectly sweet Strawberry My strawberries are kinda small this time It tastes a combination of sweet and sour More on the sour side, but I like that when eaten with whipped cream Golden berry\n Out of all the berries, the golden berry is not well known where I live Not all stores sell this fruit, I don't see it often The taste is so hard to describe, it tastes somewhat between pineapple and apple", "ApOaamySTOU": "hey guys i am so excited to announce built bars new flavor raspberry cheesecake i am so excited i actually have already tried this so this isn't like a first impressions with you but i will tell you this it tastes exactly like those raspberry butter cookies that have the raspberry jelly in the center i love those cookies i will have to tell you i actually have been thinking about those cookies and when i took my first bite out of this that's exactly what reminded me of those cookies this is so good it's very fluffy very like that musketeer candy bar texture just like the cookies and cream the cookie dough like it's just the texture is so great so the macros on this is 17 grams of protein we got five grams of sugar five net carbs um 140 calories and the fat is 2.5 grams of fat so um oh my gosh i am just so excited about this flavor i'm gonna tell you i'm definitely buying a box of these i am really really just happy about being a build bar ambassador this like tops my list of like accomplishments that i have done in my life like i it's just such an exciting thing for me and i i just like can't tell you like i just feel so lucky and to be able to try new flavors early and to you know basically sample them and be able to tell you guys about them and i so good so i'm gonna take a bite and show you what it looks like on the inside because i tell you what it's it's just it's so good there's legit real pieces of raspberry so white chocolate so if you've never tried their white chocolate and you like raspberry i highly recommend this their white chocolate is incredible incredible i have tried other white chocolates or keto white chocolate and not my fave this way chocolate is so good every white chocolate bar i've tried from them is on point and with the raspberry and this white chocolate it just goes together so well so let's take a little bite oh my god oh my god i just got that that raspberry cookie taste and it's like who needs those cookies it has real chunks of raspberry in there real chunks of raspberry so you get that nice texture of the like raspberry when you're chewing it and i think that makes all the difference i think if it didn't have that texture of the raspberry it'd still probably be good let's just be real but that texture just elevates it and the white chocolate with the raspberry i'm telling you if you love those raspberry cookies you need this because i'm not kidding you i used to kill a whole box of those back in the day and oh my god this just brings me brings back that flavor for 140 calories and 17 grams of protein and five grams of net carbs you just cannot beat it so i highly highly recommend this bar i would definitely be ordering probably two boxes of these oh my god i'm buying something i'm obsessed with bull bars george and i just cannot get enough of these new flavors and this just beats it this makes it to my top five like real quick so anyway guys get yourself some of these these go live at 2 a.m eastern standard time and i will definitely be staying up and getting some but definitely use code hk socco to save 10 and just so you know you can use my

of these raspberry cheesecakes and go belt man i am telling you go built because i they just keep topping each flavor and it's like i keep saying this is my favorite this is my favorite but it's like how can you choose when they're just so incredibly good you just you just can't and again if you haven't tried their white chocolate this is the time to try it because they don't always have the white chocolate all the time so um excelente excellente so awesome job built thank you guys so much for watching definitely pick up some build bars and i'll see you guys all later", "bhUhkA0EX4w": "hey guys welcome back to my channel my name is quinn if you guys are new um for today's video i decided to do another diy using natural ingredients this time using blueberries to get a beautiful lilac purple you can already tell in the thumbnail it's gorgeous i know if you guys really love my diy using onion skin videos and if you haven't seen already i'll post it up right here um or here i'm actually filming this video after i have already succeed you may or may not know but using natural ingredients to dye your clothes it's actually really hard yes there's some fruits and vegetables that stay in your clothes but it's actually hard to get the pigments to stick onto your clothes when you actually want them to stay on your clothes so i actually experiment and fail a lot of times using different ingredients so that's why i'm actually filming this video after i already got my results i know you want me to jump right into the video so um that being said i'm so excited to show you guys and if you guys are interested then please continue watching you're going to need a white cotton t-shirt i have this long sleeve one that i got in size xl this is not a new white t-shirt it's old it's washed once i tried dyeing this shirt using red cabbage and i failed miserably so i'm just reusing it you can kind of see the faded red cabbage blue dye here but now i'm going to use blueberry instead so i really hope this works and you are going to be needing salt again rubber bands and some kind of fabric to strain out the blueberries i'm boiling 10 cups of water and about a little bit more than half a cup of salt i'm going to heat it up and then i'm going to stir and dissolve the salt in the water so now that the salt is all dissolved in the boiling water you want to dunk in the white t-shirt so you want to really submerge the shirt inside the salt water and hopefully what the salt is going to do is make the dye bond to the fabric better yeah let it cook for at least 30 minutes and while my t-shirt is cooking for 30 minutes i'm going to crush up the blueberries in this bowl i want as much pigment as possible so i'm going to crush all the blueberries and by the way these are not old blueberries they're like brand new so um just fyi if you want to know that information i think this step may be optional some people don't crush the blueberries but because i've had bad experience not getting the color dye i want i want to make sure i crush it and get as much pigmentation as possible i used the whole basket of blueberries and this is how much it came out to be after 30 minutes remove the t-shirt from the pot wring it out and then using the same water i'm going to dump in the blueberries i'm going to let the blueberry simmer in medium heat for about 45 to 50 minutes using the crumble method i'm going to crumble up the sleeves really really tightly [Music] and tying it off with the rubber bands [Music] i'm doing the same to the other side and make sure that you are really crumbling it very tightly together and rubber banding them because you're gonna dunk this whole shirt in the dye water [Music] and then for the shirt i'm just doing from the corner okay so this is what it looks like all really tight and secured now i'm going to dump the blueberry dye on top of this fabric now i'm going to separate out all the blueberry skin and all the residue that we don't want it's so hot so i'm going to use a ladle it's really hot i should have let it cool so you can see the color is like purple so i'm guessing the shirt is going to come out a light purple and then now you want to literally dip your whole t-shirt into the dye water and because the rubber band is making resistant it shouldn't die through and you should receive patterns [Music] and make sure you flip the shirt over to the other side so then this side can get dyed too it's now the next day and this is kind of what it looks like i let it soak into the ball of dye it looks kind of like a purple red color i am going to hand wash this without soap and let it air dry and let's see what it looks like oh my gosh i just finished hand washing this with just like cold water no detergent and it looks amazing tell me if this is not the prettiest freaking natural purple color that you've ever seen i like i don't know what to tell you like it's freaking gorgeous it's a pretty freaking purple color ever and the pattern also turned out amazing i love how there's like a patch of like dye here and like yeah so that was like this that scrunching crumbled method and it looks so amazing it's wet right now but i'm going to let it air dry and then i will show you what it looks like on afterwards and the reason i hand wash this with no detergent right now because i just want the dye to just like really seep into the fabric for as long as it can so be right back i'll show you what it looks when this is drying so this is what it looks like fully dry the color is so so pretty it's like a violet purple and it's like the perfect purple [Music] so this is what the t-shirt looks like now that it's dry i got impatient so then i put it in the dryer instead of air drying it i put it on delicate and um my delicate only spins for like 20 minutes so it took me a couple times drying it to get it like dried up the color is still here and it's a really pretty purple color and i love how the pattern turned out it's so pretty so um this is a success and for those of you who want to know if the color will stay after i wash it in the washing machine i will put it in the description box and let you guys know if it faded off or the color will stay after i wash it with like detergent using the washing machine and all that so give me a thumbs up if you think this color purple is gorgeous and comment down below and let me know if you guys are gonna try to diy this or um tag me if you do on instagram and subscribe if you haven't already click the notification bell and you will get notified

more and more fermentation products are coming into the mainstream these days and it's for a really good reason they transform foods that we know into new and exciting flavors and today I have my brother Pete with me and we're gonna make some lacto-fermented blueberries from nomas guide to fermentation Pete wanting to tell a little bit about the book gnome has been named the world's best restaurant four times over and they've shared a lot of their secrets into the variety of techniques in fermentation in this book and we're just starting to delve into some of them personally I've made Koji which is a fermented grain and that is just started to open up a whole new world of flavors and techniques and recipes yeah what's pretty cool about this lab is that it's really a complete separate entity from the restaurant so people that work in the fermentation lab they're not really involved with a day-to-day they don't have to worry about cutting up your ingredients and all that they can fully just go a hundred percent into fermentation so in summary Noma really knows their stuff about fermentation and they simply define it as the transformation of food by microorganisms whether it's bacteria yeasts or molds there are a number of different microorganisms that can be used to ferment food the one we're going work with today are lactic acid bacteria shortened to el-ad and in the genus lactobacillus these bacteria exist naturally on the skins of different fruits and vegetables we're gonna be utilizing lactic acid bacteria for their enzymes which will transform sugars into lactic acid creating these sour flavors that we love and this is a common fermentation method that is used in foods like pickles and kimchi nobody finds the basic lacto fermentation process as one is way your ingredients to is add two percent salt and three is wait until your desired fermentation has been reached so we've got some wild berry bushes right over here and we're gonna pick some berries and do a blueberry ferment with lactic acid bacteria so as you see we hit some rain so we changed locations to under the porch so now that we have our blueberries picked I did want to point out that if you are buying from the grocery store for blueberries specifically or any other fruit or vegetable that you may want to ferment look for things that are organic or have not been treated with pesticides because if there are pesticides that might affect with how much lactic acid is on the outside want that good bacteria or else the fermentation will not be able to occur and basically all that we need to do now is way out we're gonna do a kilogram of blueberries and then we need to do two percent weight of the salt and then add in our weight on top and then let this thing ferment for a couple days and we'll talk about the process as we make it alright everyone we're gonna switch over to a quick voice over so like I said we need to mix in our salt which we weighed out 732 grams of our blueberries yielding 14.6 two grams of salt we round it up to 15 and then all you need to do is mix these in a separate Bowl loosely just combine everything and pour this into your crop [Music] and then we're gonna add a weight on top and weight and we're gonna do this with a water bag the water bag weight displaces oxygen in the container which serves two very important purposes one the LAV functioned best and the absence of oxygen and two it excludes potential pathogens which need air cellular respiration that could ruin the fermentation we also removed the rubber gasket on the jar so that the carbon dioxide gas produced by fermentation can escape to store these for the fermentation Noma recommends storing these at at least room temperature or 70 degrees Fahrenheit though they often use 82 degrees fahrenheit to speed up the process a bit without over activating the fermentation also if you are using a clear container like we are do not store these in direct sunlight as it may kill the microbes inside while we wait you can't go off and do whatever you do need to check on the blueberries once a day to taste them to ensure they do not over for men and this is the art part of the cooking what may taste good to me after five days may taste better for you after seven generally these blueberries are going to take around five to six days at room temperature all right so we made it to the end and I believe this is the sixth full day of fermentation and you really want them to be sour but you also still want to have that kind of sweetness that blueberries have in them and I think these are about the right stage for me you get hit with like a list nice sourness on the outside but then as you bite through it you still get a little bit of sweetness in there so we're gonna call them done right here and all we need to do is just pull out our bag let's actually strain these I've just got a nice funnel and a mesh bag and we're just gonna pour the juices over into this jar so now we've got our juice I'm sure gonna give this just a case straight up that's really interesting think I want to make like a lemonade where you put in like a tablespoon of that liquid for our other berries I'm just gonna drop them straight in here so we have our fermented blueberry juice and our fermented blueberries right here and to store these I'm just gonna cap them up and store them in the fridge if you like the taste of how they are right now you're gonna want to store these in the fridge so they don't keep fermenting and changing flavors if you left them out on the counter they would actually keep fermenting and Noma also says that you can freeze the blueberries very well and then just pull them out when you need so definitely a lot of different options on what you can use these for and like I said we'll be testing some new things and just see what we can come up with I'm really excited to make some drinks with this juice and then we'll share that video with you guys next week on Sunday so you can look forward to that hopefully you guys have enjoyed the video and found it informational on lacto-fermentation hopefully you guys try up some projects whether it's blueberries or if it's vegetables or any other fruit really you just gotta follow that basic process that we outlined in the beginning and you can have fermentations going all the time so I'll catch you guys next week for what we come up with peace and you made sound leave and now I feel I was saying too", "bzFObXkPVF8": "scientifically proven health benefits not

to the show today I have with me pink lemonade blueberries yeah so I was at Italy which I've talked about before it's like a fancy-pants grocery store here in New York City they'll get some very interesting fruit sometimes and usually it's stuff like this like some sort of like limited-edition cultivar it's where I had like the pine berry there they're big on stuff that is like a normal item but something that would be interesting on a dish it's more towards foodies than like a certain culture so a lot of stuff like this and I looked it up and there's a lot of people claiming that pink lemonade blueberries actually tastes like lemonade so I figured this would be a good one to try out there's a lot of different fruits out there that claim false things there's the chocolate pudding fruit which does not taste like chocolate pudding despite what people say there is the pine berry as I mentioned that when people say it tastes like pineapples doesn't taste like pineapples so this one people say tastes like a pink lemonade so let's see if it does even if these don't taste like anything at all they do look pretty cool it looked like regular blueberries in you know shape but like the coloring on them is really nice-looking it's got like that nice like pinky blush to it I'm going to actually try a regular blueberry first and these blueberries are from the same company family tree farm so I'm gonna try one of their regular blueberries and then try one of their pink lemonade blueberries that way it's not like so greatly different in quality so let's try a right look blueberry first tastes how you'd expect it to taste these blueberries have a slight tartness to them but not a whole lot it's maybe the tartness that and like a like an apple would have so let's say that has like a 3 in tartness the sweetness is pretty nice I'd say the sweetness is like 5 so 3 on sour five on sweet with the plain regular blueberries and they taste you guessed it like blueberries so let's try the the new one hmm the sweetness on this is higher I said the regular ones were like a 5 these are like a little bit more than that I'd say maybe like a 6 the tartness is about the same no that's a little bit more it's maybe like a 4 it has more complexity to it it's a little bit sharper in its flavor the blueberries they have are perfectly good they taste nice it tastes like a very mild blueberry taste these taste like blueberries but they have a stronger blueberry flavor there is something lemony about them it's not so distinct like this is lemonade it definitely tastes like a blueberry but it does have like a little extra pop to it a little extra brightness to it and that makes me think yeah sure like lemons yep that makes sense like I look like almost like a little bit of like a citrusy taste to it it also has more of a berry flavor to it like if you were to add like some raspberry or strawberry to it like a little bit more complexity in that berry taste but the main thing that I'm getting from it is just blueberry yeah so pink lemonade blueberries yeah I say that is accurate I mean parents they are pink ish looking they looked really cool the flavor on it yeah I I wouldn't be like oh my god pink lemonade like very strongly but there is a hint of that so I'd say that is accurate yeah I'm not I'm very skeptical anytime like some sort of product product claims that sort of thing it seems like a marketing thing but in this case I don't think that's just my imagination I think there is a subtle additional like tartness to it and a little bit more like a feel of having like a little little bit of citrus in there and like a little bit of an additional berry taste as well these are good check them out if you see them I think the system this is like a fairly major blueberry brand I bought these at Italy for like way too much money and it was like six or seven dollars or something I bought these a dinky little fruit stand by my house for less than a dollar so you can find them at high-end places you can find these at just regular mom-and-pop places so if they will sell the regular ones there's a chance they might have these too so keep your eyes open for them these are actually pretty good I do like blueberries and I say that I like these even more because there's like a little bit more to them it's not such a simple taste so yeah if you see him

resist but there's really no reason to try and resist them as this fruit is among some of the healthiest foods you can eat of course you probably just want to know how you can grow your own right the good news is that blueberries are long-lived dependable and some of the easiest fruit to grow organically certain species are native to particular regions of North America but some type of blueberry bush can be grown just about anywhere provided you have acidic soil with a pH below 5.0 they can also be grown in containers filled with a bark based acidic planting mix here's what else you need to know in order to reap those buckets of berries 1 decide where and how to plant if you're limited on space you may use a bucket or another type of container that can be placed on a patio or deck if your soil is not acidic enough simply purchase a bark based acidic planting mix you also want to choose a well-drained sunny spot though they grow in semi-shade you'll get more fruit with sunshine - when to get started late winter or early spring happens to be the best time to get started in planting your blueberries they need time to grow roots before the hot weather arrives 3 choose your plants you'll want to choose the right type of blueberry plant for your particular region for example if you live in a northern climate lowbush blueberries are native to the colder areas of North America and tend to do well there if you're very far north choose Saskatoon's a very Hardy variety that can survive temperatures as low as minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit for planting just before planting enrich the soil in each hole by mixing a bucket full of pine needles peat moss or compost leaves which helps maintain acidity and provides a long-lasting source of humus for optimal nutrition aeration and moisture set each plant in slightly deeper than it stood in its original hot five prepare for healthy pollination blueberries have both male and female organs on the same flower they really need a second or even third plant to pollinate with if you hope to have a larger blueberry crop doing so allows bees to travel between plants and cross pollinate six prune the plants every winter the first year that you plant the blueberries clip all of the blooms off the plants this will allow the plants to become resilient before they start producing fruit pruning also removes crowded or stagnant stems and allows productive parts of the plants to grow stronger 7 harvest your blueberries do this in late July or early August some varieties including rabbit I will take a bit longer to fully ripen

going to need is blueberries of course ziplock bag a paper towel a blender a jar and some water first things first you're gonna want to make sure that you have a United States distributed and made blueberries because basically what happens if it's offseason blueberries and they were shipped into the United States from a different country what's gonna happen is that they're subject to my new levels of radiation in order to make sure that there's no mold bugs mildew whatever might be on the plant that they don't want here in the states so they kill all that off but unfortunately it also kills the seeds so they will not germinate so again make sure it's a product of the United States and then you'll be good the first thing you're gonna do with these is stick them in the freezer for a couple of weeks I would say at least two weeks but it doesn't really have to be any longer than three weeks at the most what that is going to do is replicate the conditions that the plant would be under in the wintertime so then that tells basically tells the seed that's encoded in the seeds DNA that now's the time to start germinating so two weeks in the freezer and then we can go ahead and throw them in the blender here so right now we're just going to take the blueberries dump them in there add the water and all we've really got to do is blend this up for about ten or fifteen seconds [Music] so what we accomplished here basically we're just mashing up all the blueberries and then the seeds that we want will fall down to the bottom of this mixture so we're then going to do just kind of strain this out if you're lucky most of the seeds will sink right down to the bottom of your blender so not much straining is required but what I'm gonna do is just put this into a mason jar and rinse it out with water a couple of times to refine it a little bit more there we go most of the pulp has been removed from the seeds and we're ready to move on to the next step here's where we took the paper towel just folded it up a few times and then we place it into the plastic bag either if you use a ziplock whatever as long as it's holding in moisture that's our goal what we're going to do is take the seeds and spread them evenly throughout the paper towel or as evenly as we can there we have it what we did was put the blueberry seeds in the bag added just a little bit of water so it soaks up into the paper towel keeping it nice and moist all you're gonna have to do with this is put it in a warm dark location for two to three weeks and at that point you will start to see them sprout what I would suggest to do is just take a nice and close look at the end of those two weeks to see if any of the seeds are germinating and if they are all you got to do is place that into your substrate and then you will have your very own little blueberry plants growing at home for free the last thing to keep in mind when we're talking about these blueberries that you're growing is understand that they're not going to be a true variety you're not really going to be sure what you're gonna get with this because of cross-pollination so you might get some great blueberries you might not but you know hey they were free and it was a cool project to do at home with your family thank you guys so much for watching subscribe comment down in the section below if you have any questions comments or concerns and as always have a great and wonderful gardening adventure [Music]", "owNT9gL1W5s": "[Music] hello everyone this is Bill Klein I'm an extension specialist in the Department of Entomology and plant pathology at North Carolina State University also the extension horticulturist for blueberries this session will cover a blueberry copepods for the southeastern US before we talk about cultivars I'd like to give a little background on blueberries the species of blueberry is vaccinium there in the heat family or the Eric kcee blueberries are native to North America they're related to azaleas rhododendrons cranberries they're acid loving plants that require a low soil pH when you look at a blueberry bush it's a multi trunk plan it's not a single trunk like a like a tree you'd like to see all different ages of wood coming out of the ground they're deciduous so they drop their leaves in the winter time and it's a woody plant in the perennial it lasts many years they require winter chilling there they're a temperate plant that has to have a certain amount of cold weather in the winter in order to leaf and flower normally in the spring blueberries are pollinated by insects most cultivars will not produce much of any fruit and less than insect visits the flower they are typically hand harvested we're seeing a trend toward more a machine harvest most of the cultivated blueberries are sold fresh but there's also quite a lot that is processed mostly mostly frozen if we take a look at the blueberry bush and concentrate on the twigs where the fruit is born if you look at the bushes in wintertime the flower buds that will will bloom and produce fruit are quite obvious in the winter time they nice their fat buds out on the ends of the twigs and those will will bloom produce flowers they're pollinated by insects and in that dish where the berries will be produced that summer if you follow through to the fall of the year the vegetative shoots that were produced during the summer during harvest and after harvest formed flower buds in the leaf axils so if you look at this image with the fall color in the lower right hand corner you can see flower buds forming in the axles of those leaves and of course when the leaves fall off what will remain will be the terminal flower bud for the coming seasons crop just a little bit about culture and management for blueberries pollination is essential you have to have an insect visit each flower or you won't have a very forum so that's a really critical step in producing the crop for cross-pollination it's best to plant more than one cultivar most blueberries are are partially self infertile so having a mix of cultivars will produce more fruit larger fruit more seeds in the berries and so you'll just get a better fruit set with cross-pollination other practices pruning is an annual task usually in the dormant season you remove the old and weak canes shape the bush in the crop most blueberries will overbear if not pruned in most situations irrigation is essential especially during establishment for poor blueberries so irrigation both for drought relief we see a lot of drip irrigation systems and micro sprinklers and also for freeze protection there a fair amount of systems in North Carolina for overhead irrigation for freeze protection as far as fertility and organic matter the best advice I can give you on fertilizer use is to I sit on your soil testing a lot of sites in North Carolina typically we'll only need nitrogen phosphorus and potassium may be sufficient one key thing you need to maintain a low pH for the lifeboat replanting so around 4.5 it's ideal I see sites that range anywhere from three point nine to five point three where the bushes are doing okay so that's sort of the range we have to work with but your your target pH is gives low most sites outside of native blueberry soils require amendment and this is usually pine bark amendment in the soil or aged sawdust again mixed in with the soil prior to planting and just an image here of the blueberry flowers and one of the pollinating insects this is the southeastern blueberry B it's a small bumblebee like insect and again blueberries have to be visited by an insect blueberry flowers in order to form a berry so this is a critical step if pollination is not done what you will see is berries that do not size so what we're looking at here is a cluster of fruits where some berries were pollinated and others were not the small berries that are sort of red-faced will not size they were not pollinated so they will fall off two to three weeks after bloom and this is a this is a common phone call from growers after bloom where the berries are falling off and the ones that are dropping are simply the ones that were not pollinated blueberry pruning is something that's done every winter there's also some options for summer pruning in the southeastern US we'll talk at length about blueberry pruning in another session here that's just a couple of images to share with you to show sort of a before and after pruning scheme you near the base of the bush and in the Canes open up the center of the plant and reduce the crop load a very critical step has to be done every winter to keep the bushes in top shape overhead irrigation is is quite common for freeze protection in the spring this is a fairly high volume system with sprinklers about 12 to the acre that are capable of keeping the balloons and merging flowers wet during a freeze event in the spring if you keep them wet throughout a freeze event for mice and continually for mice until it melts the next day then you can protect the crop so that's the idea behind overhead for freeze protection another really common system is a drip irrigation system and this is frequently used in areas where water is needs to be conserved maybe you're getting from a well and don't have a lot of water volume so drip systems have been used quite successfully it's where many of the commercial blue-gray growers that I work with are in southeastern North Carolina and blatant and surrounding counties and they have blueberry soils that are our native blueberry soils they have characteristics that allow them to produce blueberries without having to add organic matter or without having to add irrigation so these fields have high organic matter content they're sand based and absolute of salt and pepper appearance and no brown color in the soil so in these fields the the rows are bedded up too to keep the roots out of the water because the water table is within 12 to 24 inches of the surface year-round so a really unique native blueberry sites and then produced blueberries quite well on our plant sites where the humic matter in the soil may be low and water table is quite far away the site has to be modified and this is a really common tactic you know in a lot of parts of the southeast especially some of the smaller plantings that that have to amend the site you see this a lot with with pick-your-own operations and 1/2 to 3 acre plantings just throughout the southeast so on these uplands Heights typically add pine bark or peat moss but I see more pine bark than anything else added to the soil and mixed in as an organic substrate for the blueberries it's got a pH of around 4.5 helps with the drainage and on at least on flat sites as you see here in this picture really really try to keep them on as much of a raised bed as as possible the evaluating site so you know that it involves a set of posthole diggers I think it's really valuable when you evaluate the site for a grower trying to determine whether it's a good blueberry site to go out and do some digging and you can see what the soil profile is how will drain the site is and also find out if there are any any restrictive layers or anything that would would cause a problem for the blueberries down the road so site evaluation I think is a critical step on most upland sites where there are not native blueberry soils this is what the end result looks like you very often have to amend beds with pine bark grow the bushes on raised beds and then mulch the surface and often with sod in the middles grass middles and this system works quite well and the mimics that that native characteristic of a well-drained high organic site in discussing blueberry cultivars we first have to back up and discuss species within each species there are cultivars that are suited for it for different areas and of the species that are cultivated the ones we can grow in the southeastern US depending on your location include rabbit eye hi bush southern hi bush and some of the newer interpolate cultivars rabbit eyes are vaccinium Brigade um they're native to the deep south if you think about the Alabama North Florida that that region hi bush are quite different they're vaccinium corn bossom it's also called northern hi bush they were originally domesticated in New Jersey but also native down into the south we see them in the wild in North Carolina the third type southern hi Bush is a complex hybrid so it's vaccinium form bossom crossed with a lot of other species and so this energy specific hybrid has a lower chill requirement brighter soil adaptability a lot of good characteristics from from the different species that are involved and just a brief mention of the the Pinta voyage there not a lot of them out there one that comes to mind is Robison it's a pent-up load released by by NC State University these are hybrids between rabbit eye and high Bush and have characteristics such as ripening season that are sort of in between the two blueberry cultivar selection is really driven by your location of things you have to take into consideration in addition to the soil type and the percent gimmick matter that we've talked about are things like chill hours this is the hours below 45 degrees that are required by that species or cultivar in order to leave in flower normally so chill hours occurring in North Carolina from October to February and we keep pretty close tabs on that because it helps us to understand why some cultivars do well in our area and some don't another driver of cultivar selection is the USDA hardiness zone and with some cultivars being well adapted to warmer climates and some to colder if you look at the children's of the various blueberry species you can see that they have a chill hour range that the four corresponds to the USDA hardiness zone but there's also a lot of variation within species so for instance high Bush cultivars may require as little as eight hundred hours of chilling the winter to well over 1,200 rabid eyes tend to be in the 400 to 800 range the southern highbush are the most widely variable from almost no chill to some cultivars that require as much as nine hundred hours of chilling and those correspond to the USDA hardiness zones with high Bush being the most hearty rabbit I sort of intermediate and Southern High Bush intermediate down to even out to zone team if we correlate that to the plant hardiness zone map and it's color coded you can see that the high Bush for zone 3 down to 7 highbush blueberries would be there would be cultivars available all the way from from Canada down into Western North Carolina northern Alabama so the the range of high bushes is quite broad in there quite cold hardy if you look at the rabbit eyes they would be more in the 7 & 8 range so this would be if you look at North Carolina most of the Piedmont and coastal plain most of South Carolina most of Georgia and so forth so the the 7 to 8 range on the chill map is the light green to 2 tan color and then finally the southern hi bush which would be plant hardiness zone 7 down to down to TN would go from most of North Carolina down through the southeast and on down into the Florida peninsula so if we look at North Carolina as an example when I'm making cultivar recommendations for our state the high Bush cultivars are preferred for the North Carolina mountains and the elevation I use is about 2,500 feet because that seems to correlate with the cold temperatures that are just just too low in the mid winter temperatures for a rabbit a blueberry once you get below 2,500 feet the rabbit eyes will do quite well in the lower Mountain foothills Piedmont and the drier areas of the coastal plain and the strength of the the rabbit eyes is their soil adaptability in drought tolerance or just a really tough Bush and then finally the southern hi Bush and some selected low chill hi are most of us run in our main coastal production areas and the key to with the cultivar selection there is that we're trying to get early ripening so really striving to to have have the early crop in that part of state once you decide what species of blueberry to grow I encourage you to research your your choices talk to folks about the the varieties that you're looking at very often folks will say I wouldn't grow that one because of various reasons some varieties tend toward stimulus route cracking during wet weather some of the older cultivars are just are just quite soft or they may have a wet stems bar so we'll talk later in this session about a specific cultivars that I would recommend but also encourage you to to do your own homework on this and and you may encounter cultivars that that are locally popular that are not the ones that I recommend so there's a lot of blueberries out there and a lot of good information on those cultivars so to encourage you to to look into it and make good make good choices one characteristic that will disqualify a cultivar from commercial production it can be as simple as its fruit color we have a comparison here on slow the rabbit eye blueberry on the left in this image versus Columbus on the right there's a tremendous difference in the the black see bloom wax coating on the berries that is natural there is an indicator of quality and so the light blue color is desirable the dark blue is not and and that alone can disqualify a cultivar even though all other characteristics are good one thing that's been extremely valuable to us in North Carolina has been local testing and evaluation of cultivars we're sort of midway on the East Coast so we can use some cultivars from the north from New Jersey we can use some of the Florida cultivars have transplanted north and grown quite well for us but the only way to really find out is to use to try them this is a picture of Mike mainland he's a emeritus professor of horticultural science at NC State and and a famous blueberry fellow of worldwide and mic is retired but still still comes in and still works with blueberries and harvests every year and just invaluable amount of research and cultivar evaluation has come out of its program if you look at the field that Mike is standing in you can see bushes that are still dormant and some that are leased out so these are characteristics that are occurring because of their kill requirements so the load / iya teas are leafing and blooming and producing fruit already the high chil cultivars that may not be suitable for North Carolina ours are still dormant they still haven't haven't broken dormancy and haven't started to come out if we look at blue great harvests timing by cultivar in South Eastern North Carolina you can see how our program is weighted our industry is heavily invested in southern hi bush the the green color on the chart shows our major cultivars and the time that they ripen just a couple of hi Bush cultivars are in use in that southeastern part of North Carolina so Duke and the old heirloom variety Croatan is still around also I'd like you to notice the copper bars in red this is the transition to rabbit eye blueberries and notice the the time of year that they ripen so the rabbit eyes ripen quite a bit later than the high Bush or southern hi Bush and rabbit are ripening being from mid-june through August so our season as you can see is really heavily weighted towards the the higher value early early fruit so we have lots of cultivars in that early season window I promised we would get down to specifics of cultivars and we've reached that point so I'll take a look at hi bush cultivars first so these would be four zones 3 to 7 well-drained amended soils of irrigation and again hi bush are the most cold tolerant so at higher elevations in North Carolina these are the only only cultivars that can be grown so our old standards if you go to the old plantings up in the mountains of North Carolina you'll see cultivars like early blue blue crop Jersey some of the newer ones that I like are Duke which is performed quite well for us Aurora Liberty and Draper rabbit eye cultivars zone seven to eight are really the the mainstay of our small picture own operations in the south so these are what you're most likely to see in backyard plantings or pick your own plantings in the southeast they're mostly irrigated or at least initially irrigated mostly amended and on a plain sight the old standard cultivars are premier and climax are a couple of the earliest bright wills a little bit newer TIF blue is a really common rabbit eye that you see plantings and TIF blue tends to sprout a lot so it gets transplanted people dig the shoots and move move it around so if someone got a blueberry plant from their neighbor chances are it's the old Georgia cultivar TIFF blue powder blue is an older NC state release some of the newer cultivars that I like Vernon is a quite attractive fruit they will split in rainy weather but I like the cultivar nonetheless kruer is a really new cultivar that I don't know a whole lot about but it's large rooted and quite attractive and flavorful a lappa hog is a cultivar that's seeing a lot of machine harvest refresh in Georgia we haven't got that much of it in North Carolina Columbus is a NC state release and really I think the highest quality rabbit a cultivar out there in terms of fruit quality era of cottony Onslow were all later ripening newer cultivars you know all suitable for production the final category of cultivars I'd like to mention is the Southern High Bush cultivars zone seven to ten so they're they're grown from the coastal plain all the way down into subtropical zones their optimal own native sites but they can be grown on a well-drained irrigated amended of plans they are not nearly as rigorous Ashley rabbit eyes so where I see both the rabbit eyes and Southern High Bush planted together rabbit eyes tend to survive and do quite well the southern hi bush depending on their own care and on-site preparation may or may not survive so I've just be cautious about trying southern Bush cultivars on sites that are better suited for for Rab guys but some of the standard cultivars more or less in order brightening their O'Neal star New Hanover and legacy newer cultivars rebel Susie blue farthing Commedia Gupton legacy is one that I think is probably underutilized it has quite broad adaptation to two sites and to two chilling I think it will go fairly far south and quite nice nice fruit and I think it's one that in North Carolina we see grown from the coastal plain through amended sites in the Piedmont and all the way up to seen it grown near your Boone North Carolina so really quite far up in the mountain so legacy one to consider for sure before the final slide I want to include one more than I think maybe an overlooked cultivar Gupton was a release from the usda at Poplarville Mississippi it's a Southern High Bush you can see there 80% ripe on the 18th of June in coastal North Carolina what was interesting about this this picture is that this was the first time this Bush was picked so we let the whole bush blew up really 80% ripeness means it wasn't picked the first time or the second time so we waited until a lot of the fruit was ripe and yet the quality was was still quite good so it's one that hangs well on the bush and I think is an overlooked candidate for Southern High Bush production I think the reason it got overlooked is that it is late compared to to some of the cohorts where we typically pursue and the season we typically pursue so with that we going to answer any questions and thank you for your attention [Music]", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i

tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "F-eDrK-SRh4": "what's happening guys if you've been watching the vlogs at all or you been following my insta stories then you know every day I do something called yogurty 30 but if you don't know what I'm talking about basically yogurty 30 is just some point the day where I make a Greek yogurt and frozen blueberries snack and it's just sort of become a thing every time I make it I take a photo of it I put on mine as a story in my hashtag yogurt e30 but I've been wanted to make the recipe into a YouTube video lately because on Instagram a bunch of people have been DMing me asking me what is that how do I make that just curious about yogurt e30 and want to give in I'm healed dirty thirty goodness and deliciousness so that's what I'm gonna be doing today I'm going to show you how I yogurt e30 how I make this snack it's very easy there's only three ingredients super quick to do and you can totally tailor the recipe to your macros your calorie goals and it'll be just as delicious so let's hop right into the kitchen and get to some yogurt e30 all right so first things first guys you'll want to take out a large bowl and your food scale if you don't have food scale there's a link to get one in the video description below but pretty much every store sells on these days Target Walmart your grocery store you name it they probably have a food scale for sale and we're just using a food scale because you want to be really really accurate when you're weighing all of your ingredients out it's just the best way to have a successful yogurt e30 alright so now that that's out the way let's talk Greek yogurt guys I highly recommend going with fy'y I've had all the Greek yogurts I'm pretty sure in existence nothing comes close to this this is the best stuff you don't have to use the zero percent fat if you don't want to you could use a low-fat kind or a full fat kind that's totally up to you in your goals anyways the first thing you want to do is add a cup and a half or 340 grams of the nonfat Greek yogurt into your bowl step two is just adding our frozen blueberries into our bowl we're gonna be adding a cup and a half or 210 grams of frozen blueberries and a pro tip guys just let your blueberries thought if you have the time to do this for about five minutes before you add them to your Bowl just make mixing everything way way easier when we get to that stuff and also you'll be able to develop a froyo type of consistency out of your yogurt and blueberries way easier if you do that too we've got the yogurt in there we've got the blueberry in there last step is to add some sugar I'm using Splenda sugar blend but whatever sugar you use in yours is totally your preference if you want to use stevia if you want to use regular sugar that's totally up to you what I will say is I'm adding three quarters of the tablespoon or about 8 grams of the Splenda sugar blend and if you're using stevia or regular sugar you'll probably need to use more just because Splenda is sweeter than both of those alright so at this point we've got all the ingredients in our bowl I mean just take a fork and start crushing the blueberries into the Greek yogurt and start forming that delicious Froyo consistency so you want to mix the ingredients together until all the Greek yogurt turns purpley pinkish in color and also you can take a huge scoop full with your fork and everything stays together it's totally frozen maybe even more frozen than a Froyo consistency is that's when you know you've got the perfect consistency for some yogurt e30 so I'll do it taste us for you I'm pretty sure you know how I feel about the yogurt e30 but here we go taste this time it's absolutely delicious it's a light it's refreshing tons of blueberry nests it's wonderful better than any blueberry Froyo you'd get at any Froyo shop there's like the perfect blueberry to yogurt ratio in here a hint of sweetness really it's a bowl of deliciousness like every bite is a bite of deliciousness but it's an entire bowl full of just absolutely yumminess cheers to a successful yogurt e30 of your own I'll put this down and we'll get to the macros all right guys so as far as the macros if you make the yogurt e30 exactly how I made it it works out to be 332 calories 34 grams of protein 47 grams of carbs and 2 grams of fat of course this is a pretty substantial amount of yogurt e30 so you don't want to make this much just cut the recipe in half cut the recipe in 1/4 just make it fit your macros and your calorie goals stuff like that so I hope you guys enjoyed today's recipe I hope you enjoy the yogurt e30 if you did give the video like hit the thumbs up button because it really just helps a channel out it helps the video out a lot and I really appreciate it too so thanks so much for watching if you make this and you take a photo and you put it on Instagram hashtag it you'll gurdy 30 because I'll be looking for that hashtag and I'll see you guys in the next bit", "Db6SYxAfmPM": "hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with how to blueberry pancakes that's right we always get a ton of food wishes for breakfast recipes and it's come to my attention that many of you are not doing blueberry pancakes properly so let me show you what I consider to be the ultimate method for blueberry pancakes and while we're doing this I'll explain why the other methods aren't as good so step one you're going to make a batch of your favorite pancake batter we have several on the blog that are fantastic so check those outs and you're going to ladle that into a preheated skillet I usually cook my pancakes on medium-high and as we're forming that you'll probably notice there are new blueberries in the batter what we're going to do is place them on top and by place I mean throw down wind up from like a foot away and throw them down I want deep impact I want them embedded into the batter just like that so right off the bat using this method you're going to get perfect blueberry distribution because you're controlling where they go and if you're thinking why didn't you just put them in the batter no that doesn't work as good first of all the gobbles berries mixed in evenly you're probably over mixing your batter plus as you're labeling the blueberries will settle and then some pancakes will have like 20 blueberries some will only have like 3 I brunch guests get upset words are exchanged hands are thrown long story short you're out of the will thanks going so this is a much safer method so you're gonna go ahead and throw down as many blueberries as you like and yes I'm just doing one for filming purposes but even if you have a large skillet with for pancakes going those are going to take 2 or 3 minutes before the ready to turn so you have plenty of time to throw down your blueberries when you get down to those last couple open spots you can push them in but the throwing is the most fun part of the project and by the time your blueberries are placed your pancakes should be ready to flip and you know the signs the edge of the pancake starts to look cooked and dry and those bubbles will come up to the surface so at that point we're going to flip it over and then besides perfect distribution as we talked about earlier the real magic to this method is the direct contact of the blueberries to the skillet so instead of them being insulated by the batter and just sitting in the middle of that pancake just barely getting warm in a couple minutes it takes to cook this side of the pancake those blueberries are getting hot they're getting sweet they're getting juicy which is just not going to happen as easily if they're stuck in the middle of the batter I mean a couple might be touching the bottom but using this method they're all getting sweet and juicy so I think it works much much better than mixing them into the batter and of course if you want to show off your hot and juicy berries you can leave it facing up like that put on your butter and syrup but I'm kind of your purist I'm going to flip mine over oops clean it up of course I'm going to spread on a little more butter that melted and some maple syrup and then as we cut in you're going to see not only the perfect blueberry distribution but more importantly you can see that blueberry juice mixing with the syrup I'll say one last time the berries are hot they're juicy and they're sweet so anyway just a quick and easy tutorial on how to properly blueberry a pancake do not mix them into the batter this works much better not only does every pancake have the same number of blueberries using this method each forkful has about the same number of blueberries and by the way you restaurants that are just dumping blueberries on top of pancakes and calling them blueberry pancakes those are not blueberry pancakes those are pancakes so that doesn't count blueberry pancakes have blueberries in them and when it comes to blueberry pancake integration you can't go wrong with this method so I really hope you give it a try head over to food wishes comm for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy you", "Y5fwGxJjn5E": "hello and welcome to my kitchen at home now I'm a little bit in denial about some are bidding over in Britain's starting to get cold the nights are drawing in but I figure it's always summer somewhere in the world so today's recipe is a really quick and easy one for blueberry popsicle now this recipe is great because it's super simple it's hardly any ingredients and it's really adaptable you can like adjust the sweetness you can even change up a fruit if you want but the best thing to do is to make a blueberry compote so I've got 200 grams of fresh blueberries here you can use frozen if you've got them and then 50 grams of caster sugar and like I said if that seems a bit too sweet for you by all means reduce it it's not going to have any effect on the consistency now I'm gonna take a coke to go now I'm just gonna set that over a medium heat and the blueberries are going to sort of start releasing their juices after a couple of minutes and then I'll give it a stir once things start to get a little bit juicier in there it's a good idea to grab a potato masher like this one and just give them a little squish to help middle and once you switch them a little bit more and they're nice and juicy you can let that simmer for about five minutes and thicken up just a little bit is probably ready when it will coat back of a spoon my blueberry compote is ready and I've allowed it to cool completely and it's absolutely beautiful really lovely red color and now I just need to get my yoga bit ready because this this lolly is going to be sort of ripoli white and pink so I've got some Greek yogurt here about 375 grams and I'm gonna add a hundred millilitres maple syrup and that just needs to be whisked together to combine it another said before this recipe is really adaptable so if you don't want to use maple syrup that's fine but just be straight up Greek yogurt or you could add a little bit of or lemon juice to make it really sharp and contrasted a sweet blueberries completely actually because these are your popsicles now obviously making popsicles are going to require one important bit of kit and that is one of these molds and they come in various different shapes and sizes this is a ten whole popsicle lolly thing it's got a lid and it comes with little wooden sticks it's really good I just bought this online and now I'm gonna start building up my lollies I'm gonna start by grabbing spoonfuls of my yogurt mixture and popping them into the moat and now I'm going to do is spoonful of the blue become pop I probably noticed that while I'm doing this it's all kind of smearing over the inside of my mold but actually I really like that because I want this lolly to look kind of little rippled but if you want this to be neat and tidy you could put your comp up on your yogurt into piping bags and pipe them in so that you don't get any mess so I'm just going to keep going until I've used up all my yogurt and my compote now you don't want to help these fill up completely to the top because when things freeze they expand a little bit so if it's up to the top it's going to expand outwards so I've left a little gap at the top and I'm going to put my lid on and stick little wooden sticks not all the way through they want to have a little about this much poking out the top all your sticks are in these obviously need to be frozen in the freezer for at least four hours like my lollies are completely frozen and now it is time to try and get them out now it's gonna make it a lot easier if they have a little dip in a warm bath I've got a bowl of warm water here and that should have loosened it a little bit whoo that's pretty cool I think you'll agree that is a very pretty looking popsicle and that is gonna be very very tasty but you probably don't want to eat ten right now so I am gonna wrap mine up in greaseproof paper put them in the freezer so I can grab them when I need them but all my lolly is wrapped up and in the freezer for when I need them and I will need them because I've almost forgot my summer is like and this is a little reminder so here we go mmm who'd have thought that four ingredients could make such a delicious simple treat really creamy really cold really fruity and you could use any berry with this instead of blueberries if you wanted and like I said you could sharpen up with a bit of lemon juice add more sugar take away some sugar this is completely up to you have a bad fun with it and let me know how you get on take pictures of your popsicles hashtag cupcake Gemma on Instagram and Twitter and if you like this recipe then why not check out my strawberries and cream popsicle recipe from a while back cause that's a good one too I'll be back next week so please subscribe and share this video in the meantime see ya week", "zzOGutpJb1M": "[intro music] David Handley: I'm David Handley, the University\nof Maine Cooperative Extension small fruit and vegetable specialist, and today we're\ngoing to talk about selecting a site for planting your blueberries. Now, when we look for a site for blueberries\none of the first things you want to do is select a site that's open and not shaded. Although blueberries will tolerate shade,\nif you're after these plants for production, in other words lots of berries, then they\nshould get full sunlight. If you're primarily interested in having them\nin the landscape and feeding the birds then sure, go ahead and put them in a partially\nshaded area, but just understand you're going to lose a little bit of fruit when you go\ndown that lane. Now, the other thing you want is a little\nbit of protection. Blueberries are not adequately hardy for all\nparts of Maine. So if you can have a hedge or something running\nalong the west and north sides to prevent those cold winds from coming and hurting those\ndelicate buds in the wintertime, that will help quite a bit. One of the things you don't want to use for\na hedge though is balsam fir. Balsam fir exchanges some disease problems,\nspecifically witches' broom, with blueberries so that's not a particularly good plant to\nhave around your blueberries. But some other kind of evergreen hedge will\nhelp them get through the winter much better. The other thing you want to be near is a source\nof water. These plants need water not only for establishment\nbut through the fruiting season, especially for facing a very dry summer, you want to\nbe able to get water to those plants. Get some place where you can either run a\nhose to them, some trickle irrigation or a soaker hose to keep those roots well rooted\nduring the summertime. Now in terms of soil types, blueberries like\na well-drained soil and this is a mistake gardeners often make. They think, \"Blueberries grow in the swamp\nso I'm going to plant them in a wet, soggy part of my lawn.\" That's not really the case. Blueberries will tolerate wet during the late\nfall, winter and spring, in other words, when they're dormant. But during the growing season if their roots\nare in water, the plants will drown and you'll lose them. So pick a well-drained soil. In other words, don't look for a spot where\nthe water stands in the spring. Stay away from there, go a little further\nuphill where the water drains away quite nicely. Blueberries don't like heavy soil so we want\nto stay away from areas that are loaded with clay. They prefer a sandy or sandy loam type soil,\nsomething that drains well and is nice and friable like we see here. Lots of big chunks in this soil will drain\nvery well, the roots will be able to grow through there very well. This is the type of soil that we're looking\nfor. If your soil has a lot of clay or is compacted,\nyou need to work a lot of organic matter into that soil to loosen it up, to improve the\ndrainages and help those roots grow better. Some of the things we can add to the soil\nto help improve that, peat moss is very typically used for blueberries because they like a lot\nof organic matter and they tend to grow in peat type soils in the wild anyway. Peat moss is a little bit expensive but if\nyou're just growing a few plants, this will work quite well. Remember to wet it before you incorporate\nit into the soil. If you incorporate it in dry, it actually\nacts like a sponge and will suck that moisture right out of the soil. The other thing we can use is compost. Compost is just a nice source or organic matter\nand will also help loosen up the soil. It can be less expensive than peat moss, especially\nif you make it yourself. Just make sure it's got good drainage and\nalso be aware that the pH of your compost can be quite high sometimes and blueberries\nlike an acid soil. We'll talk more about that in a minute. You can also use other sources of organic\nmatter, things like sawdust for example, but bear in mind if you use something like sawdust\nor just leaves or pine needles worked into the soil, they can rob the soil of nitrogen\nbecause as the bacteria in the soil tries to break that down it will pull the nitrogen\nout of the soil, make it less available to your blueberry plants and you may find you're\nhaving a real tough time keeping those blueberries adequately fertilized. So I prefer something that's already broken\ndown like compost, well-rotted sawdust or just some peat moss pre-moistened before you\nwork it into the soil. Now, in terms of preparing your soil and getting\nready for that, this should be done in the fall before planting. Of course, have a soil test taken. Stop at your cooperative extension county\noffice, pick up a soil test box, get the little form, make a soil test the way they tell you. We have a video on that at this website that\nyou can look at. But be sure on the form that you fill out\nblueberries because blueberries have some very specific nutritional needs and you don't\njust want to put a general garden code on here. Make sure you code for blueberries. They'll come back and tell you what you need\nto do but one of the things you need to be aware of is that blueberries are acid loving\nplants. They're in the same family as rhododendrons,\nazaleas, mountain laurels, that group. They like their soil to be acid or sour. Usually what we're looking for is a pH of\nabout 4.8 to 5.2. Typically if you're going into soil that's\nhad lime like a lawn or a garden, your pH is going to be up around between six and seven\nso you may need to acidify that soil. What they'll recommend is that you put some\nsulfur on it and you can buy sulfur in little pelletized form like this or you can buy it\nin a powdered form. Your soil test will tell you exactly how much\nyou need to add per square foot to bring that pH down to the desired level of 4.8 to 5.2. This should be worked into the soil preferably\nthe fall before planting so it has time to break down and adjust that pH for you. Now, when we're going to plant these things\nwe want to work some organic matter into the soil. You can do this the fall before if you want. You can add some compost to the soil or you\ncan work a cover crop in such as winter rye, or oats, or buckwheat, one of those things,\nbut when we actually plant the plants we'll be working some compost and some other organic\nmatter right into the soil. Typically what I recommend is when you dig\na hole for blueberries, you take the soil that you've taken out of that hole and mix\nit one to one with your organic matter such as compost or peat moss. Just work it right in there and this is what\nwe're going to backfill around the plant once we plant this in the springtime. So we'd put the plant in, backfill with this\none to one mixture of organic matter and soil, and our pH is at the proper level because\nwe put sulfur in the fall before, and we'll be all set. So the primary things to remember are full\nsunlight, protection against the wind, a good source or water, good drainage in your soil,\nand correct your pH to 4.8 to 5.2 and you'll be all set. The last thing we want to talk about is weed\ncontrol. One of the things we don't want to do is dig\nright into a lawn, just dig a hole in a lawn and stick your bush in there because the grass\nwill quickly come back in and compete with the roots of these blueberries. These blueberry roots are only about six to\neight inches deep so you need to kill out any grass or weed species that are on that\nsoil prior to planting. You can do this with a lawn herbicide if you\nwant the fall before to kill it out and plant into it the next year. You can do it by working that grass up the\nyear before and making sure that it's not going to come back by working it repeatedly. Or you can just do something like laying some\nold landscape fabric down or some old plastic that you might have lying around, tar paper,\nwhatever, put that down on the ground for several months and this will kill out all\nthe grass underneath. When you pull this up in the springtime you'll\nhave a nice bare patch there that won't have many weeds in it. Plant directly in it without working the soil\nup because that'll disturb more weed seeds to come up. You'll find that you'll put that plant in,\nmulch around it and you'll have very few weed problems afterwards. So, that's how to get your site ready for\nblueberries. In a little while, we'll talk about actually\nplanting these things. [music]", "OsNTptC6SJA": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of Joey baking calm today we're going to make strawberry blueberry frozen pops and this is what they look like these are delicious they're a mixture of fresh strawberries and blueberries with some sugar syrup and yogurt so the first thing we need to do is to make our sugar syrup also known as a simple syrup which is really kind of just a fancy name of a mixture of sugar and water so I have a small saucepan here and we're going to use sugar syrups can you have different proportions of sugar to water for this one we're using equal amounts so I have 1/2 a cup 120 milliliters of I'm using filtered water and a half a cup of hundred grams of granulated white sugar so really all I'm gonna do is put this on medium high heat and the purpose of this is really just to dissolve the sugar so I'm just gonna bring it up to a boil and boil it until the sugar is dissolved okay so it's up to a boil sugars dissolved so take it off the heat that's it now you don't want it we don't want to make our mixture our popsicle mixture with this hot so what I really like to do you want to cool it down at least to room temperature my preference is to chilly the great part is you can make this sugar syrup up to two weeks ahead of time and just put it in the in a covered container in the refrigerator so what I'm gonna do let that cool down and then when we come back we will make our frozen pops so to make our strawberry blueberry mixture I'm going to use a food processor you could also use a blender for this and first you will need 1/2 a pound which is 225 grams of fresh strawberries of course wash your berries and cut off the tops and then I've just coarsely chopped them and then I'm also using half a pound 225 grams of fresh blueberries again wash them if there was any stem remove those and of course as you know when you're picked through your berries make sure there's no soft ones err you know rotten ones you want nice fresh ones so what I'm going to do is just process this a little puree them there we go okay start they're just not completely pureed just a little and then I'm going to add our chilled sugar syrup sweeten our berries and then what I like to add is a third of a cup 80 milliliters 80 grams of a flavored yogurt today I'm using actually a blueberry use strawberry sometimes I've used lemon you could even just use a plain so I'll leave that up to you I like the you know frozen pops have kind of an icy texture to them but adding a little bit of yogurt not only adds flavor but it also adds like a little bit of creaminess so on what I'm going to do now is just simply puree this until it's a nice mixture okay now how much you puree it it depends whether do you want little chunks of fruit in your frozen pops if you do then don't process it as much if you want it like a really smooth more like a like a frozen ice then puree it a lot I'll leave that up to you so now you will need your popsicle mold now for this amount of mixture I this is for 10 popsicles I would say 8/10 it really depends on the size these ones hold almost a third of a cup 80 milliliters mixture so you can kind of whatever yours holds and if you didn't have a popsicle mold you could just like use little paper cups as well so now it's hard to get that into the mold so what I do is I'm just going to pour it a little bit here is I use some container with the spout I kind of like these ones because they're silicone then they kind of kind of squish them and then fill your molds now don't feel all the way to the top because they do expand a little as they freeze so leave a little room at the top you know this is you could just drink this like kinda as a smoothie if you have any leftover yeah and our last one little more in there so what I like to do is to put the tray your popsicle tray on a baking sheet I find that easier to get it in and out of the freezer so and also if you did slop which we all do just take a paper towel and just kind of clean up the top of your mold and then if yours is like mine just put the cover on and then you take some popsicle sticks and put them in now if you were using paper cups what you would do is fill your little paper cups you'd have to put them in the freezer and freeze some partway and then take them out once they start to get firm up and then put your sticks in so either way just do that look and then what we're gonna do is put this into the freezer until they're frozen I would say usually eight hours a lot of times I like overnight but depends on how cold your freezer is and then when we come back we will try one so they're frozen I made these ones yesterday now what I do to release the frozen pops from the mold is just run this part under hot water or you could take a big bowl put some hot water in it and submerge the whole thing in so here we have it I think these look so cool and as you can see or maybe you could see I didn't process the mixture too much so you do see pieces of fruit which is what I like it makes them look like a homemade fresh fruit pop they're nice and kind of icy but not too icy with that little bit of yogurt adds a little like just a touch of creaminess which I like and these are delicious I mean I make these all the time if you have kids great way to get them to enjoy fresh fruit you could vary your fruit if you want have fun with that change it up you could use some peaches or you use blackberries or really any combination and the yogurt like I said you could use different flavored yogurts these are so good you have to make these and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking com [Music] you [Music]", "zb3VGWk0qyU": "hey everyone today I'm going to show you\nhow to make a no-bake blueberry cream cheese pie (music playing) in order to make this pie filling we\nneed to mix our cornstarch and our water together first so I've got a tablespoon\nof cornstarch and then we're going to add 2 tablespoons of water we're going\nto whisk this water and cornstarch together and I want to do this before I\never add it to the pie filling because this helps ensure that we don't have any lumps, little to no lumps all right we're gonna take that\ncornstarch mixture and we're gonna go ahead and pour it into a medium saucepan\nI'm gonna keep our whisk handy because we're gonna be using it a little bit\nmore and add a half a teaspoon of lemon juice 2 tablespoons of cane sugar or\ngranulated sugar whichever one you have and then I like to add 1/4 teaspoon of\ncinnamon just for extra flavor you can make that optional if you don't want\ncinnamon in your filling and then we're gonna put our burner on medium heat low\nto medium heat and we're gonna stir this all together really well with the whisk I feel like the cinnamon just kind of\ngives of all the flavors especially with the blueberries gives it all a pop of\nflavor so that's why I like to add it in imma turn that heat down a little cuz that\nseems to be really hot for that we don't want to scorch it now that we've got\nthat mixed up and we don't seem to have any lumps or anything I'm gonna switch\nto a spatula and I'm gonna go ahead and add my two cups of blueberry puree now I\nhave a lot of people ask me how to make puree with fruit and really all I did\nwas take the blueberries that I had and I'm using frozen blueberries for the\npuree I'll use fresh blueberries when we add those in but for the puree I like to\nuse frozen and I just thaw them and kind of dry them before I put them in my\nblender and then I pureed them in the blender and measure out however much I\nneed in this case it was two cups so you'll need a blender or some kind of\nfruit masher if you don't have a blender you can use a potato masher it's gonna\nleave you with some chunks though so if you have a blender that's how you puree\nstrawberries blueberries banana is anything like that when I go ahead and\nturn the heat back up now we're gonna add in two cups of just whole\nblueberries and I'm using fresh for this part I just I kind of like to use fresh\nwhen I'm adding the whole ones in cuz they're gonna add more of a structure to\nour pie filling we're gonna cook this for about ten to fifteen minutes on low\nto medium heat we're gonna cook it for about ten to fifteen minutes or until it\nbegins to thicken and you'll know it'll thicken up that cornstarch is gonna\nstart working and it's gonna thicken into a really nice sauce or filling but\nyou want to constantly stir because if you don't it will scorch and you don't\nwant you don't want burnt pie filling so just make sure that you use a spatula\nsomething that you can scrape the sides with and stir it the entire time your pie\nfilling will start to thicken now if it's not thickening enough\nyou can add a little bit more cornstarch but you want to make sure that you mix\nthat cornstarch however much you add with just a little bit of water and\nwhisk it together so that you don't get lumps in your filling because if you\njust add the cornstarch straight to the filling you'll have lumps and you don't\nwant that so make sure that you mix it with a little bit of water and then you\ncan put it in and your sauce will thicken up a little bit more I actually\nadded a tea... about a tablespoon and a half of cornstarch with a little bit of\nwater and that helped tremendously now that's probably I probably had to add it\nbecause I used frozen berries for the puree and they likely had a little bit\nmore moisture than fresh berries would have had so if you're using fresh\nberries you might not need to add any cornstarch extra cornstarch at all but\nonce this has thickened and I think I think we're pretty good here when it\ncomes to cooling your pie filling you want to remove it from the heat and let\nit cool completely because we're gonna be putting this on a no-bake\ncream-cheese filling and you don't want that to heat up we want that to actually\nchill so you want to let your pie filling cool completely you can let it\nsit out on the counter or you can put it in the fridge and I usually do a mix of\nboth if I need it quicker I'll put it in the fridge or freezer just to get it\ncooled down faster and it will thicken up even more as it cools as well to make\nour cream cheese filling we're gonna go ahead and add two blocks of cream cheese so 16 ounces total two eight ounce blocks I like to scrape the package so that I\nget all of it off of there I don't want to waste anything\nI mean look at that that's a lot of cream cheese and if you throw that away\nI mean that's one last bagel that you can spread cream cheese on all right now\nyou could go ahead and whip that if you want to but I'm just gonna go ahead and\nthrow my other ingredients pin and whip it all together so we're gonna go ahead\nand put in one and a half cups of powdered sugar and then a tablespoon of\nmilk and then we're just gonna get get to mixin' and mix it up until it's nice\nand smooth and creamy so we've got our cream cheese filling\nnow and it's I mean it's pretty stiff so so we're just gonna take this cream\ncheese filling and put it into our already prepared pie crust spread it out\nso it's even get some of this excess off of there you really want to spread it around to\nthe edges to make sure that it's nice and smooth all around the pie now we're\nready for the blueberries all right now you're ready for your blueberry pie\nfilling and we're just gonna go ahead and spread that in the crust now if you\nfeel like you have a little bit too much topping here for your pie you don't have\nto put it all on there you can save some of it back for ice cream or I mean toast\nanything like that I'm gonna add just a little bit more I want to make sure we have plenty of\nblueberry flavor on this pie all right I think you might be good here I'm excited\nabout this I can't wait to eat it as for the crust you can use whatever\nkind of crust you want you can use a graham cracker crust you could use a\ncookie crust you know like kind of crumble them up like graham crackers and make a cookie crust you can make a gluten-free crust like we did or a\nregular pie crust it doesn't matter you can have nuts in it if you want that's\nreally good putting pecans or walnuts into it but I'm just using a regular\ngluten-free pie crust this time all right so now we're gonna take our pie\nand we're gonna put it in the fridge so that it can chill completely probably\nabout two or three hours you can even let it go overnight if you want to but\nprobably two or three hours at least (music playing to end of video) mmmm is it good? mmmm if you like this pie as much as we do be\nsure and subscribe to my channel I'll have more recipes coming

Cookies for breakfast? YES PLEASE! Hey welcome back to a deliciously chewy\n blueberry breakfast cookie you and your family are gonna love. The\ningredients are super simple, like banana, a bit of applesauce,\nvanilla, old-fashioned oats, and blueberries. The oats are the old fashioned type. See the\nlarger flake? They're not the instant or quick-cooking oats. Those will not absorb\nas much of the mixture and you'll be left with mush. Anyways, the oven is\npreheating and I have a baking sheet here that I've lined with parchment\npaper or a silicon mat. In this large bowl, I am going to mash my bananas. We're gonna add in the applesauce, the\nvanilla... let's give it a quick mix. And now, let's add in the oats --a little\nside note: if you don't have applesauce around, you can use an egg and a little\nbit of water; about a tablespoon or so. So now I'm going to stir this together. As\nyou can see, it's all mixing around and you want this to have like a thick\ncookie dough like texture. The final step is to fold in the blueberries. You can\nuse fresh or frozen berries in this recipe but you do want to add them at\nthe end; otherwise, they'll get all mushed in and they'll break. All right, so I'm\ngonna scoop the batter onto the baking sheet and gently, with a fork, press it\ndown a little to shape the cookie. In the oven they go for 22 to 25 minutes. I know\nyou want to check these out so let's give these a quick look...\nperfectly chewy, delicious! And, they're only sweetened by fruit. These cookies are\ndefinitely a win-win for breakfast and even as a healthy snack. For the recipe and\nmeasurements check the description box right below this video.

Say hello to my blueberry galette recipe. This little guy whips up in a snap and it is beyond delicious. You're watching Preppy\nKitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make\ndelicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. This galette will be\nready before you know it. So let's get started. First off we're cubing one cup, 226 grams, of cold butter, cold. If you want to use salted\nbutter for this recipe, that's fine just don't\nadd any extra salt, okay? Now we're gonna cube it up, and by the by, if you don't have a food processor, that is totally fine. I'll walk you through the\nsteps on doing this by hand, which is how I did it up\nuntil maybe two years ago when I finally got my\nfirst food processor. I was always like, I\ndon't need another gadget, and then I had a friend\nover and she was like, you don't have a food processor? And I was like, oh maybe\nI'll give it a try, and now I love it. My cold butter is all cubed up. If you're not ready for the next step, pop this into the fridge. It needs to stay cold;\ndon't let it warm up. I'm adding two and a half cups, or 300 grams of flour\ninto a food processor. Add a quarter teaspoon of salt. One quarter cup or 50\ngrams of granulated sugar. Remember, when you're making a pastry, it's never gonna be super sweet. The filling adds the flavor. Pop the top on. Turn it on, and pulse, pulse, pulse. That's good. I'm just gonna pause right now, if you were doing this by hand, just whisk up the dry\ningredients in a large bowl, freeze the butter, and\nthen use a cheese grater to grate the cheese into the dry mixture and fluff as you go along\nso it doesn't become a giant mass of grated cheese. Then after it's all grated, drizzle in the ice water\nand then kind of like cut it together either with\na knife or with a fork, to mix it without warming it up. Okay, let's add in our butter. Gonna whisk this up until there are little lentil sized pieces\nof butter mixed in there. Just pulse, pulse, pulse. All right, here we go. You can see I have\nchunks, chunks of butter, and that's like about the size you want, like a pea size or smaller. We're gonna continue to pulse though, because now we're gonna\ndrizzle in some ice water. Normally in a recipe for pastry dough I would say like three\ntablespoons of ice water, two tablespoons of vodka. The vodka hydrates the dough and doesn't add any moisture, though. So it hydrates the dough,\nlet's it come together, but then it bakes off. It doesn't activate the gluten. You can always just use more ice water, or add a little bit of lemon juice as well to the ice water. That'll also inhibit things. I'm going to add bout\n5 tablespoons of water. Okay so let's take a look\nat what's going on inside. Right now this looks like a crumbly mess. I'm not gonna put my fingers in there, that's how you get hurt. Does that look ready to you? I don't know, let's find out. Squeeze it in your hand, almost ready. So it needs a little bit more ice water. I'm gonna add one more tablespoon in and these have not been full tablespoons. That's why I just keep adding, cause they're only like three\nquarters of the way full. I know it's ready because when I stopped the food processor it kind\nof collapsed into crumbles. So get a little tablespoon out. Pop it into your hand. You can see it turns into dough. So it's a crumbly mixture right now, but it will become a\nbeautiful pasty dough. That's what I was looking for. Now we're gonna transfer this to a counter or pastry mat and get it ready for the fridge. There's a couple steps that\nwill really help you out. I'm using my fancy new\npastry mat Brian got me. I have the horrible habit\nof cutting on a pasty mat, so I've ruined two. But this one is so nice\nI will never cut on it. You keep me honest. Dump those crumbs out. It's hilarious because it just\ndoesn't look like it's ready. So if this is your first\ntime making pastry dough, you might think, oh my gosh what is this? I followed the directions! But, it's actually great because it does this magical thing. Scrunch it together, you can\ntell it's gonna work out. I don't want to knead this, but I do want to bring it together. This is what pastry mats are good for, your counter is fine, you can work the dough together with them and not make a huge mess. If you notice, I'm pushing\nit together like this, but it's still kinda crumbly. And you're like, hmm I\ndon't know about this. Here's what you do. You do push it together in a mass, but you're going to knead it\njust like two or three times. So in you go, give it a\nsquish, give it a squish. That's barely even a knead. It's more like a slide. This pastry dough is ready\nto go into the fridge and as it chills, it'll\nreally, really come together. You're going to love it. In the meantime though, before\nit goes into the fridge, give it a head start. Flatten that disc out\nbecause it'll cool quicker and you'll have less rolling\nout to do afterwards. Cover this with plastic. We do not want it to dry\nout while it's chilling. This can hang in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour\nand it'll be ready to go. I can not wait to roll this out. Once your pastry dough is all chilled, it's time to set it on the counter. This seems a bit counter intuitive. Why do you want it to warm\nup when you just chilled it? But, it needed to come\ntogether in the refrigerator, settle into a mass, and\nnow it needs to warm up so you can roll it out. While this is warming up, we're gonna make our blueberry filling. So in a large bowl add 750 grams or four cups of blueberries. I'm using fresh blueberries, but yes you can use frozen\nblueberries as well. You'll just add a little bit\nof extra baking time to them. Do not thaw them if they're frozen. Don't thaw them, use them frozen. When they thaw they explode, basically. At this point I want you\nto sample a blueberry. Hmm, that's really nice. If they're a bit flat,\nwe're gonna zing 'em up with some more lemon juice. If they're really flavorful, you can add a little bit less sugar. You could add a little bit less lemon. So, those are actually great. I'm gonna zest almost a whole lemon in. If they were flat and kinda\nlike, meh blueberries, I would zest an entire lemon. Sprinkle that in. Now we're going to add\na quarter cup of sugar. Now sprinkle in two tablespoons\nof all purpose flour. That will be just a little\nbit of a thickening agent so it's like gooey and like\npie filling on the inside and not too runny. Give this a quick toss. I'm gonna use my fingers. These blueberries are all\nreally nice and coated. The only thing I have to\ndo is add two tablespoons of lemon juice, about\nhalf of a lemon depending. This one is not juicy;\nlook at this nonsense. Now I just toss it one last time. Help it along with a spoon\nbecause there will be some sugar and flour at the bottom. Your filling is now totally set and if you wanted to, by the by, you could definitely add like a sprinkle of culinary lavender, cardamon, whatever else you like to\nzazz up those blueberries. But this is delicious as is. Set this aside, and now it's time to roll our pastry dough out, it's ready. The eggs I need because before\nI roll the pastry dough out, I will be making a really quick egg wash. One egg into a small bowl. Add a tablespoon of cream of milk. And now give it a whisk. The egg wash is going\nto make it golden shiny, and just look really nice. Eggs are done. Before I roll this out I want to show you all these specks of butter in here. This is a flakey pastry crust to be. Lightly flour the surface\nof your pastry mat. You could do this on the counter. You could do it anywhere you want, but the pastry mat is fun\nbecause it's a surface that you can lift up to invert things and nothing will get stuck. More flour for the top. And if you want to be extra certain, you can flour your rolling pin as well. That often helps. So we're gonna roll this pastry dough out. If we see some cracks, it's okay. As we roll it out though,\nwhat do we want to do? You want to move it around. Just make sure it's not sticking. If it sticks it can\nbecome kind of annoying. And we're always rolling\nfrom the center out. Here we have a little bit\nof cracking at the edge. That's fine, just pinch it together. Rolling it up, and I love\nseeing the specs of butter that are still there. I'm rolling my pie dough out so it's about a quarter of an inch thick. It might seem kind of large now, but remember we're gonna\nput our blueberries inside and then fold the edges over. So I actually need a pretty big piece. So right now it's a little bit unwieldy. I do want to flip it\nover just to make sure it's not sticking, little bit of flour. And you can use your pastry mat here and roll it over. (gasp) Magic, it's so convenient. I'm kinda of moving things around so I can get more of a circle. Final step, just make the\nedges look kinda pretty. I've gone to the crazy place. You don't have to do this, it's just me. Right now, you need to stop. Don't go further until we transfer this to our baking sheet. If you do, ohh it goes bad. So let's roll this back\nonto our rolling pin. This can say bye-bye. Thank you for your service. Okay baking sheet out. Line it with parchment\npaper and let's unroll this. It's gonna be hanging off, don't worry. This is fine. Now that it's laid out\nonto the baking sheet, we can transfer our\ndelicious blueberry filling into the center. You can spread it out a bit. We want to have a nice border of about two inches or so at the edge. So think of it like having a very gentle, oblique mound of blueberries\nin the center of your galette. It's time to fold it over;\nthis is the fun part. So one, now a little fold. And I'm just kinda folding\nand pleating it as I go. This is almost ready for the oven. Now we're gonna brush our egg wash on. Cover all that pastry with the egg wash. Before I pop this into the oven, a final and optional step is just a light sprinkling of\nsugar on top of the pastry. The pastry is very just lightly sweet, and a little sugar will give you and initial like, hmm. With the egg wash and sugar applied it's time to pop this into\nthe oven, 425 Fahrenheit for about 25 minutes. This will be nice and golden,\nand you'll see some bubbling, gooey action in the middle. It'll be amazing, just keep an eye on it toward the end so it doesn't burn. Out of the oven, topped with ice cream and ready to eat. This is my version of heaven. I really hope you get a\nchance to make this recipe, but before I take a bite, if you like this recipe\ncheck out my pie playlist, all my favorite pies and some of them are almost as easy as this. All right, now it's time for a bite. Oh my gosh that is heaven on a plate. The blueberries are bursting with flavor, perfectly sweetened, and that\ncrisp pie crust is the best.

this was not possible because my experience with blueberries was eating them in the wild in Acadia National Park in Maine cold northeastern climate and then foraging for them in Alaska also another cold climate so I thought you know what can I even grow them here in San Diego in zone 10 B the answer is yes although there are some things that you need to take into account so today we're taking a look at three different varieties of container and warmer climate specific blueberries from bushel and berry really cool varieties so we're gonna pop these up and just talk about how to care for them our first variety is southern Bluebell this these two right here 250 to 300 chill hours very low amount for a warm climate like mine has these sort of green leaves that turn red and the berry is sort of a pinkish color these two in the middle peach sorbet 300 chill hours the leaves have a variety of colors peach pink green etc and then the berries have sort of a tropical flavor so excited about these guys finally we have blueberry buckle cora blue these have 350 chill hours or require that much and they have beautiful dark green foliage and the berries are much darker and sweeter so excited to try all three of these let's pop these up and talk about how to care for them so blueberries are a plant that require extremely low pH relative to most plants four to five range so what I'm using for that is an azalea and camellia mix which is low pH and also mixed in just a little bit of micro bark to loosen it up maybe at a four to one ratio of the Azalea mix to the micro bark so we're mixing this up and what you want to do is size up the container so this is I think a twelve inch we're gonna put it in a sixteen and that's what it's going to live out its life so you want to give it enough space to you know do well it's a shallow rooted plant so what we have to do is we're gonna fill the bottom and I've got a drainage hole down at the bottom of course with this terracotta and we are going to go ahead pop out one of our boobs I'm gonna leave space at the top for about two to four inches of mulch and I'm gonna use that micro bark as that mulch blueberries are shallow rooted plant so you got to make sure and you mulch that soil you don't want them to dry out otherwise they're gonna be in a rough spot so we'll take a little bit of this mix out make sure it's nice and solid we're gonna backfill and pot up maybe two inches or so of the micro bark mulch and then you want to put this in an area that is sunny but sheltered super super hot conditions it might not do so well even if it's a low chill our variety so it's a really good idea to give it a little bit of shelter from those hotter parts of the day especially as you move in the summer [Music] all right we're potted up we have the blu-ray buckles here two of them we have the peach sorbet the southern Bluebell right here blueberries typically need about one to two inches of water a week of course if you mulch and if you're in a terra cotta that's going to evaporate out a little bit more so just kind of have to keep a manual eye on it until you get a sense for it but what I'm just going to do is go ahead hydrate this micro bark really quickly and then water the rest now what's interesting about these varieties are that they are hybridized in traditional manners so not GMO just normal breeding techniques like you would see in almost any other variety of plant which is really nice if you're going to plant them in containers like this you really do kind of need a large one like this 16 inch or I would really recommend that and then as far as caring for them you will want to put some sort of netting over the top if you have an issue with birds you could just throw maybe like a bamboo pull up and net over and that might work and then you can also give it a 10-10-10 fertilizer after about the first year and maybe a six inch band around the blueberry plant and that'll do really well and then as far as pruning goes not really a whole lot is needed for these varieties they're relatively low growing you can kind of just let them go and you'll be in a really good spot to enjoy blueberries as long as you want I mean blueberry plants lasts quite a long time so I got my berries here hanging out in relatively full Sun although as soon as the Sun gets about right there it does start to shade it just slightly so hopefully that provides a little bit of summer cover during those hotter months of the year a couple more notes before we go these varieties are all self pollinating however if you plant a few close to each other or have a couple containers close to each other that can help increase yield and then if you are in an area that gets really cold in the winter it might be a good idea to either throw a frost blanket on these or move them to an area that's a bit more protected because low chill our varieties will have a hard time with high chill they have no chill you might say so anyways guys thank you so much if you have any tips suggestions on growing container blueberries or experiences of your own please leave them in the comments down below I got all these ones from bushel and berry and these are varieties that you can actually only get from bushel berry so feel free to check them out but until next time good luck to the garden and keep on growing [Music]", "lXuDLUAaCSQ": "hi I'm Stephanie jour ski of joy baking calm today we're going to make a lemon blueberry bread this bread has lots of fresh blueberries and grated lemon zest and when we pull the bread from the album we're going to brush it with a hot lemon glaze which key which adds a nice lemon flavor plus we'll keep the bread wonderfully moist so to begin pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is 180 degrees Celsius and you will need a loaf pan and you can either lightly butter it or I'm just going to spray it with nonstick spray just the sides and the bottom and then if you have an electric stand mixer like I have here use the paddle attachment or you could just as easily use an electric hand mixer the first thing we need is a half a cup 113 grams of butter have that at room temperature and I prefer using unsalted butter because I like the flavor better but you could use salted now if you use salted I would leave out the salt in the recipe so just put that in and I'm just going to beat this for about a minute or so just to soften the butter until it's creamy hey just scrape the sides next add 3/4 of a cup which is 150 grams granulated white sugar and then I'm going to beat 4 on medium high speed until the butter and sugar are nice and light and fluffy that'll take maybe 2-3 minutes okay so as you can see it's just a nice get some air in there mix them well together so scrape down your sides in the bottom okay and next we're going to add one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and try to use a pure not the imitation the pure is a much nicer flavor and then we're going to add two large eggs now have those at room temperature and I'm going to add one at a time so I'm going to beat the first one in and then add the second okay now if your batter looks a little curdled as you can see mine is don't worry there's a lot of moisture in here so but once we add the dry ingredients that will smooth right out okay so now for our dry ingredients in a separate Bowl I have one and a half cups which is 195 grams of all-purpose flour you may know that is plain flour and to that I'm going to add one teaspoon of baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of salt I like to use the kosher salt and whisk that together you could sift it but I just find it's just as good just to whisk it and then I'm going to we need the the Oder skin called the zest of one lemon and I have to choose one of these hand graders you could use a box grater make sure you wash your lemons thoroughly before you grate them you want to make sure you get all the dirt and everything off it's best if you can to buy organic lemons the outer skin is where a lot most of the lemon flavor is that's why we are using the zest okay set in and then you will need 1 cup 240 milliliters of fresh blueberries so the problem always is sometimes blueberries fall down to the bottom as the bread bakes one way to help prevent that sometimes the blueberries are so heavy they just will drop but just take about a tablespoon of your flour and just toss the blueberries in the flour and this you know I can't guarantee it but it does seem to help to prevent them from sinking sometimes the blueberries are just so heavy they drop anyways but we can try okay and then we're also you will need 1/2 cup 120 milliliters of milk you can use whole milk I'm using a reduced-fat 2% for this so what I'm going to do is add the flour in three additions alternate that with the milk in two so it's going to put about a third of the flour mixture in here and then scrape down the sides of your bowl as you need to and mix this in on low speed because you don't want that flour coming up in your face really smell the lemon flavor okay Omar the flower it's almost mixed in scrape off your meter there and then I'm going to add the blueberries and whatever flower is on the bottom of the bowl and just use your spatula and gently fold in you don't want to break the blueberries and then it'll stain your batter all blue although sometimes that can't be helped okay try to get them evenly distributed the blueberries and then we'll just pour it into our pan this is very similar to a pound cake okay and then just smooth the top with the back of a spoon or you can use a offset spatula okay so into the oven it takes anywhere depending on your oven somewhere between say 55 60 minutes you want a nice golden brown and more importantly a toothpick inserted into the center will come out clean okay our lemon blueberry bread is done as you can see it's a beautiful golden-brown color and a toothpick inserted in the center does come out clean so now we're going to make our lemon glaze so in a small bowl I have two tablespoons 25 grams of granulated white sugar and to that I'm going to add 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice just stir that together and then I'm just going to pop this in the microwave maybe 20-30 seconds just until the sugar is melted okay that looks good let's give it a quick stir and then just take either a toothpick or I have a little bamboo skewer here and just pierce all the top of your lemon bread and this way when we brush the hot lemon glaze some of it will seep into the bread this adds such a nice lemon flavor and it really keeps it nice and moist okay so then with the pastry brush or if you don't pastry brushing just use a spoon it's going to brush the top see all the beautiful berries peeking through the top there okay now just let this cool for at least say 20-30 minutes in the pan and then you can remove it and let it cool the rest of the way so until next time I'm Stephanie give joy baking calm", "3a-TKb6JUeQ": "[Music] look at where we are wearing the frozen food aisle in the grocery store but look at what it is yeah frozen raspberries they're so sweet and high in vitamin C I wonder how these raspberries got here [Music] Wow look at all of these raspberry bushes and all of these raspberry bushes have raspberries on them and this is the color raspberry red and it's so tasty well since we're picking them these to be frozen we pick them up the perfect ripeness and actually we don't pick them we shake them off with the harvester [Music] we're in front of the heart see and deep in there it's shaking these bars like this that's enough so then the really ripe raspberries fall off into the harvester look [Music] so now we're on the harvester the driver driver seat and the driver operates the harvester and shakes the raspberries off of the bush [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] after the raspberries

So what's the latest on this healthy. little\nblue super-fruit from the wild? All of the research points to improvements\nin night vision. Blueberries and especially wild Maine blueberries\ncan quiet the storm that is going on in the body of people with Type 2 diabetes Blueberries have been protective against development\nof arthrosclerosis and in some cases prevention of cancer. The regular consumption of blueberry juice\nimproved brain function and therefore memory function. Similar to metal oxidizing into rust, oxidation\nin the body allows many diseases to occur. Anti-oxidants protect against this process\nand one of the first scientists to understand that wild blueberries contain an astonishing\namount of anti-oxidants, was Ronald Prior. He developed the ORAC test, the most recognized\nand used way to measure the anti-oxidant capacity of foods. The word \"antioxidant\" now, has become a household\nword basically blueberries, in most cases, have the highest antioxidant capacity of any\nother foods and the wild blueberry are even higher than the cultivated blueberry in antioxidant\ncapacity. In addition to anti-oxidants, recent studies\nhave found that other flavonoids or chemical compounds in the wild blueberry offer significant\nhealth benefits. One underlying theme in all of this is the\nproperty of these flavonoids as anti-inflammatory agents. In a lot of our degenerative diseases\nand processes the underlying damage is arising from inflammation these compounds are working\nas anti-inflammatory agents, which there is lots of evidence that they are, that's very\nsignificant. Some of the most beneficial chemical compounds\nare located in the blue color or pigment of wild blueberries. These are called anthocyanins\nand scientists like Canadian Wilhelmina Kalt are active in studying their health benefits. We continue to look at how these compounds\nare absorbed by the body and that's quite interesting. For that, we really focused on\nthe pigments in blueberries, the anthocyanins, because they are very much the compounds of\ninterest in blueberries because they're so abundant?what we found is that the blueberries\nhad a very nice cholesterol lowering effect and this was in a diet that was already very\nrich in plant products so over and above, you know, that healthy diet, the blueberries\nwere having an additional beneficial effect on the cholesterol which was nice. In another study, wild blueberries improved\nmemory function in a group of people with mild cognitive impairment. We showed that the 12-week supplementation\nwith blueberry juice improved performance on the memory so they were better. They learned\nmore effectively and were better able to recall what they had learned. As scientists begin to understand the healthy\neffects in the blue pigment, doctors are recommending to their patients: a daily dose of blue. I am the co author of the book called The\nColor Code which is all about the health benefits of brightly colored fruits and vegetables\nlike wild blueberries. It's a simple way of thinking about food. And the goal ideally\nwould be to include foods of every color every day, try to make your plate as colorful as\npossible. I encourage patients to start their day with\na blueberry smoothie every morning. To me, it's a great way to start your day with an\nantioxidant protective coating of your brain and your entire inner body so that whatever\ninsults you get during the day, you're protected from them. How is it that wild blueberries pack such\na nutritional punch? A plant is not able to get up and walk away\nwhen there is a stress. It has to combat that stress with chemicals. Since wild blueberries haven't been genetically\naltered or pampered like cultivated berries, they have a lot more of those natural protections\nthat helped them survive in the wild protections you get when you eat them. But how do you\nmaximize their benefits? People hear a lot about functional foods and\nprotection for their health and it tends to become overwhelming and confusing. The thing that is so beautiful about wild\nblueberries is it's a no brainer. It's so easy to use in so many different ways. And wild blueberries are as nutritious frozen\nas they are fresh. They're frozen at the point of harvest,..\nConsumers get confused about that because they think they're processed, but they're\nnot. That freezing actually enhances the nutritional value because it doesn't get exposed to air\nand light which depredates the nutritional value. The advantage to that is that you don't have\nany spoilage they're like individual little BBs. You shake them out, you use exactly what\nyou need for that meal, put it back...so it's very convenient and generally there is a very\nbig cost savings. The USDA guidelines now call for half our\nplates to be filled with fruit and vegetables. It's reassuring to know that just putting\nblue on your plate - a half-cup to a cup a day of wild blueberries - is an easy way to\nmeet health standards. And it's great to know we're learning more about how this convenient,\nanti-oxidant super fruit does its magic. What's exciting about the research to me is\nthat it continues to grow. More and more people in a wider and wider range of fields of biomedicine\nare looking at wild blueberries because they're interesting. They produce effects it's a very\nexciting time to be involved in this field.", "7Qs6bhWjjq8": "[Music] well we have met alfred dinsdale before in your landscape business but this isn't a landscape business where are we this is our blueberry farm in north plains and how big is it we've got 75 acres of berries here it's 150 acre farm we started planting about nine years ago wow and you've already been harvesting already here we are in the middle of um we're in early august and you're still harvesting we started about june 20th this year and we've pretty much been harvesting every day since uh it'll get a little bit more sporadic going forward but we'll harvest until probably the first week of september before we finish wow and i am on this huge machine it's amazing and you'll be seeing pictures of it so run us through the process of the picking well uh for the machine picking generally that's towards the end so we try to get through first with hand pickers get off the best fruit that goes to fresh market the final picks right now we're going through with the machine and cleaning off whatever's left so this fruit will be going to a processor who will either it'll get frozen it might get dried it might get canned they have a whole bunch of different products but it's a different different organization than what does our fresh market fruit it is interesting and so about how many different varieties do you have we've got five different varieties uh duke is the early variety we start out and that's been anywhere from the first part of june to the first part of july depending on the year then we have rika rika is an oddball it had some years been ahead of us i had a duke and like this year it's behind duke we're still picking rika and we're into some of our mid-season varieties so it's really variable uh legacy is our our big mid-season fruit uh legacy is an excellent berry it's one of the more complex flavored really good eating berry a little more complicated to get off the plant it tends to ripen at various stages so you have everything from little tiny green fruit to big plum bright fruit all in the same bush but yeah that's interesting because we can get a lot of these at just a retail nursery so at home i can really extend my season that long absolutely yeah you can have a whole season a whole summer season this way and there are a couple of new varieties out that are double bearing that go they bear early and then they bear another crop towards the late part of the season yeah so alfred this isn't just a farm you're really a con a conservancy of the earth here too no that's right when we first started this farm we went to the soil and water district and natural resource conservation and we have them help us develop a whole farm conservation plan and that plan really includes it's everything from wildlife habitat native plantings stream side buffers it's ground cover between the blueberry rose the grass it's the drip irrigation it's variable speed pump it's things like raptor poles to encourage raptors to go after the rodents so it's a whole plan that kind of integrates all the different aspects of modern agriculture and of and of sustainability and trying to incorporate this into the farm right from the start and so you have people going through there there's still some hand hand on here but it's just an amazing process to have this machine in this field and so can we go somewhere to pick out um shrubs you guys grow them at your landscape nursery yeah we have a hotel nursery uh and we have uh we sell the most of the retailers in the portland area i know al's carries blueberries and you know several others so yeah they're they're absolutely available well you know this is just a grand scale you can go to a lot of you picks and get some blueberries or why don't you plant them in your backyard please go to garden times.tv we'll click you over to dinsdale landscape you can even go out there and get some or they can even come to your house and design a garden for you thank you so much alfred it's been amazing nice talking to you [Music] you", "Sq1YORqKhNA": "I'm in signal XM in Quebec Canada is the largest producer and exporter of wild blueberries in the world every year we produce over 200 million pounds of them and they're so good that famous brands like French company banana make the wild blueberry preserves with our blueberries job there we are right in the harvest season tons and tons of blueberries I am curious how do you I mean harvest these blueberries I mean you don't pick them no no they're not then pick at all you know there's you know the volume is so important you know that you need to spit it out a little bit so everything is mechanically harvested in fact these berries they're put in boxes plastic boxes they're stacked on pallets and then you know we're shipping it out to the reception desk where code bar is is put on every pallet or full category at the start and then you know we ship them to the processing plants where the where they fully washed HUF you know frozen flash frozen they are calibrated by size and x-ray so that's a you know top-notch product [Music] how many blueberries will you harvest about here in the region this year you know we should be processing you know growing processing around 75 to 80 million tons of Wow yeah that's a whole lot of blueberries that's a whole lot [Music] and the group owns more than 65,000 acres of land in this technical extension region this is the biggest one piece farm of organic way blueberries in Canada certainly and I would say worldwide in fact our group is the leading supplier of while organic blueberries worldwide and we're also the largest supplier of wild natural blueberries we require that's I know so that's that's very unique and that's what makes you know the the product and the company so special so we're with with by far you know the the market leader you sure you have the best blueberries in the world in a very best we supply our wild blueberries in over 30 countries so so the biggest markets United States obviously you know is this is very good but you know we do a lot of business in Japan China Korea we do a lot of business in Europe and France and Italy in England so about 30 countries yes Canada is the world biggest wild blueberries producer

welcome to passion for plants today I'm gonna be showing you guys just an update of my blueberry plants that I had shown in a video earlier so basically the Jewell Southern High Bush here has produced a lot of fruit and has gotten ripened this one has not but by a lot I mean like maybe I don't know three or four handfuls I'll show some pictures of the harvests that I've done and then I've just picked off a few here and there as well they have been so good though they're so sweet they're almost like grapes cuz they're just new they're not really bitter or acidic they're they're really sweet they're pretty large in size and I just love the color of the bush itself but here let me show you guys the plants or the fruit that's left on this that have not ripened yet so here's some so you can see all these areas where the fruit was that we've picked off and then here's some that are still going to ripen there was a couple more over here let's see there's a bunch right here and some here so these all right then too but yeah for the past probably three weeks we've been just eating off of this and it's just it's a treat it's really fun so you know throughout the years it'll get bigger and we'll have more fruit on it and then we'll go over to this one which is the it's the jelly bean variety from bushel and berry and this one definitely stays more compact it only gets like one to two feet tall and wide so it's been smaller but this one is behind on the other one and it's just forming all the berries now it was blooming for a while so there's a ton a ton of berries on here I mean it's just covered these are all gonna turn into blueberries here's here's something that's still blooming over here that's how they look so pretty soon here we'll be getting a big harvest of blueberries from this one and I don't know how they taste because they're not right yet but that's pretty much it I have had no issues with powdery mildew mites anything like that I have had zero issues I come out here and they look fabulous no rodents or anything are eating any of them so I've been pretty lucky we've been kind of moving them this is like shade because it's 90 degrees so I usually have a mountain this Sun but we have them in the shade today so I don't know me moving them in pots instead of it being in ground in one place is better Oh squirrel look jingo just went get him Jane oh okay there goes my plants and my seeds okay oh yeah mm-hmm all right yeah that's life with the dog but he's killed so anyways that's pretty much it yeah we're really happy with these alex is enjoying the blueberries too I forced him to eat them and tell me how they are this is just not so that's pretty much it if you guys have any questions with anything let me know but thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you the next one bye", "6TXBIcizCYk": "if you want to grow lots of blueberries then take these seven steps and in a few years you'll not only have plenty of blueberries to eat fresh but also lots of extras if you want to freeze preserve give away or even sell step 1 select a sunny site even though blueberries will live in the shade they're not going to produce the fruit that you want in the shade so definitely choose a place that gets full Sun and you're gonna have lots of blueberries another suggestion is to choose a site where you have easy access to water depending on your soil type you may or may not have to water a lot once these blueberries are actually established I rarely have to water mine any more but that first year it's very important they stay irrigated so for your ease of convenience select a site where you can water them easily step 2 is to do a soil test this is the most important thing that you can do for your blueberry bushes blueberries are unique in that they have to have acidic soils so doing a soil test is an absolute must you want your pH to be between 4 & 5 ideally up to five and a half might work if you have to but 4 to 5 is where your blueberries are going to thrive I highly recommend getting a professional soil test done these are blueberries that are going to last you for years and maybe even decades so you definitely want to get started outright if your soil test shows that you have a pH above 5.5 then you want to take steps to amend your soil with something that will lower that pH I recommend elemental sulfur in the form of pelletized sulfur that's usually the easiest way to lower your pH step3 clear the land if you're not already working in an established garden bed you're going to need to clear your land we rented a tiller the first year that we did it and in the process of tilling the soil getting ready for a blueberry Bish's we added different elements to help acidify the soil even more organic matter is huge for blueberries but they really don't need a whole lot of fertilizer especially the first year so don't worry about any fertilizer organic or otherwise the first year just be sure to add plenty of organic matter in the form of compost or different amendments like that when you're preparing your soil step number four is to choose your blueberry bushes from a reputable nursery I chose a local nursery because your local hometown nurseries are going to know the type of blueberry bushes that thrive in your region I'm from the southeastern United States and so I grow rabbit eye blueberries which thrive in our hot and humid climates so make sure that you choose a source that you can trust if you order online make sure that you're getting the right variety for your region that makes all the difference and if you're in the southeast like me I recommend it TIFF blue it's the most beautiful productive and tasty blueberry well except for this pink lemonade these are have to be the tastiest blueberries I have ever eaten you're ready to plant make sure when you plant your blueberry bushes that you plant them at container depth and even more importantly look at the spacing requirements for your particular bush I planted mine probably about 4 to 5 feet apart and honestly now that they're full-grown I wish that I had more space between them I know they look small when you're beginning to plant them but when they're full-grown and many varieties are taller and wider than you are you definitely want the space to be able to walk around them and harvest them easily step number six most well blueberries have a very shallow root system so you want to be able to protect it from weeds that will compete with the roots but even more importantly when it comes to weeding which you're not going to want to do with your blueberry bushes all season using any kind of hoe can disrupt those root systems so you want to be able to mulch it very well so that they don't have to compete with the weeds and you don't have to do a whole lot of weeding in step number seven protect your blueberry bushes from wildlife rabbits deer and birds love blueberry bushes and their berries so make sure that you are ready to protect not only your bushes but also your berries from these critters that want the blueberries as much as you do personally I haven't had much of a problem with having to share my blueberries and I think one big reason is because I planted my bushes right next to my dogs run since my dog is so close to my bushes deer and rabbits don't even bother it but I'm not saying that that's a fail-safe or that it's perfect for you but so far in my seven years it's worked out really well if you notice that birds like to get your blueberries before you do you could always hang blueberry netting over your bushes but I have to be honest despite a plethora of birds you can hear them in the background and a birdhouse not ten feet away from my Bish's I never have a problem with birds I think part of it is because I have so many berries that it's not that big a deal to share you may wonder if you can grow great blueberries because maybe this is your first season but I started my blueberry bushes by very first year gardening I have no idea what I was doing I read a little bit here and there and it worked out really well thankfully I got some of the basics right and now I'm harvesting more blueberries than I can eat give away and self follow these steps and you'll be well on your way to harvesting fresh blueberries every year for years to come I'm Jill McGee he of journey with Jill net and the host of The Beginner's Garden podcast for more information on how you can grow your best blueberries see the link below and be sure to subscribe for more episodes [Music] you", "PZ4mL2LRMyg": "we're gonna get one of these are you did howdy and welcome to the Texas bucket list where I like to talk till I'm blue in the face but it's not because I'm talking too much it's because I found the place for blueberries down in the neck amongst the towering trees of East Texas sits a field full of frolicking furry creatures or butterflies gently flap their wings waiting for just the right summer breeze to lift them off for a flight and folks get their fill of fine fruit it's a beautiful peaceful place and you get the antioxidant power sherry Randall owns the blueberry place a farm hidden in the woods near Nacogdoches and when we pulled in to pull some blueberries off the bushes we didn't realize how beautiful this place is sherry you have a healthy healthy bushes yeah hi welcome to the blueberry place have you been here before oh yeah I mean this your first time before sherry was the boss lady at the blueberry place she had a career in Colorado that kept her eyes to the sky would you work behind the doors okay does that mean top-secret stuff what stuff sherry retired from the industry with her husband in 2001 and they wanted the perfect place to put up their feet he's Texas is gorgeous it's a lot like down with the tree yeah when they found this field full of fruit they fell in love but continuing to cultivate the crop for the crowds wasn't something they expected to do we weren't gonna keep it you know we thought well we don't have to do that cuz we weren't looking to do that closed on this place on a Friday night and Saturday morning there's all these people out here picking blueberries it was the Kiwanis Club picking blueberries for the pancakes for the festival so it's like the town's patch so we ended up having a blueberry farm just gonna go right there go on this handle you're all set to go pick after we bought this I can answer the phone and this lady said are you still open and I said yes she was oh we heard it was bought by old people I said I am the old people I just have a young boy as summer kicks off in the Lone Star State people come from far and wide for a few short weeks to take a stroll and get their fill of fruit did you like picking blueberries yeah but what do you else do you like to do by July 4th they're going yeah a lot of times by July 4th we are closed fortunately you don't have to go from us that's right that's right then I got my privacy back while Sharri jokes about her visitors if you happen to run across the retired blueberry farmer during your stay she'll talk to you till she's blue in the face because somehow these blueberries bring people together you make a lot of friends you know it's some like Old Home Week when people come back you know people you have a say oh and especially when you get older we made it another year so it's really cool it means a lot for a small town to have something like this to do I can't really think of not having a blueberry patch down the road seasons are the clumping berries so you can walk up and just find a big clump and you'll get several berries at once Wow let's say that's it that's as easy as that okay and then these aren't sprayed so you know spray no spray at all I always thought this part was the top part cuz you always see this nice rabbit eye yeah what are they called rabbit eye berries what is that that's the type of area so rabbit eye okay these are the kind you normally see in a store that the northern ones are you know these are the four that spread for the south oh they're so much better than at the store they taste like candy I mean they coming off the bush there they're sweet there's a lot of people that don't realize but they have never seen a blueberry bush and they're so different a pound of blueberries will set you back a buck fifty here but remember you're doing all the work we made everything so it's self-serve you think they drive in they get their harness their bucket their bag and they go out and do the thing they pay they don't ever have to see us as you might imagine this is very popular with the kids and parents they love it too we live in town so it's um it's nice to come out here and letting you know just be in nature really oh it means I can wear them out and they'll go to bed early it's awesome and they're eating fruit so it's kind of a twofer on that one yeah while it may take a while to fill your bucket picking and partaking and blueberry binging at the blueberry place is well worth a stop on the Texas bucket list this is the healthiest thing we've ever eaten on the Texas bucket list yeah if you can come out here and enjoy God's creation this is one of the one of the best places to come to you [Music]", "7HRPeIp2Z1c": "hey guys it's Danny and today we're talking frozen berries now I always have frozen berries in my freezer they are one of my freezer staples they are a low sugar fruit they're packed with antioxidants they're extremely delicious and when you buy them frozen you will often get them at a lower price point but the problem is other than smoothies a lot of people don't know what to do with their frozen berries so today I'm sharing with you three of my very favorite crazy easy very simple ways to enjoy my frozen berries idea number one blueberry almond and cacao nib cereal you're going to take a half a cup of frozen blueberries top that with a tablespoon of sliver almonds and a tablespoon of cacao nibs pour in your almond milk or whatever milk you prefer and enjoy this is a great way to curb a sweet tooth and it's a delicious snack as the weather starts to heat up idea number two cottage cheese and frozen raspberries now just for the record you could also do this with Greek yogurt into my bowl goes 1/2 a cup of frozen raspberries 3/4 of a cup of low-fat cottage cheese and just a dash of cinnamon stir that all together and you will have a rich creamy cheesecake like snack and guys I gotta tell you using the frozen berries instead of fresh berries makes this snack even more delicious because the berries just melt in your mouth and they add a little extra texture as well and my third and final crazy easy way to enjoy your frozen berries is my banana strawberry nice cream into my food processor goes 1/2 a cup of frozen strawberries one frozen banana chopped into small chunks and about 3 tablespoons of almond milk or whatever milk you prefer pop on your lid and pulse this on and off on and off on and off until it starts to come together and you have a beautiful rich creamy banana berry ice now if you haven't jumped on an ice-cream wagon yet I highly recommend you do you will be amazed at just how much it tastes like the real deal and of course any of these berries are interchangeable for all of these snack ideas really you could use any type of frozen fruit you want I mean are these easier what I told you they were crazy easy before we got started so now I want to hear from you which of these three might you try first or which one have you already tried or and how do you like to eat your frozen berries come on down into the comments below and let me know and remember guys if you want to stay connected and inspired all week long when I'm not here on the youtubes then be sure to follow me on Facebook and Instagram as well because I tend to be there most every day of the week thanks so much for watching guys I'm Dani Spears and I'll see you back here next time with some more clean and deliciousness Cheers hey guys it's Dani and OOP hey guys it's Dani and now boom sorry if you haven't jumped on the nice cream boo what I call it an ice cream wagon here we go and whoop", "Lj2TP5YxOyI": "so today I'm gonna walk you through how to prune your blueberry bush not only for the health and vigor of the bush but also to increase your harvest yield I'm Melissa Kay Norris the author of the made-from-scratch life handmade host of the pioneering today podcast and we raised 100% of our own meat on our homestead as well as over 50% of our fruits and vegetables and this is how we prune our blueberries to make sure that we get a harvest to take us through the entire year without buying them from the store so the first thing we're gonna need is we have got some handheld pruning shears and for the larger canes I've also got the lockers so we've got our long-handled and I just used these to prune our elderberry bushes a few days ago you always want to make sure that you are sanitizing your shears so that if there is any disease but you're not transferring that between plants so an easy way to do that is to just take some rubbing alcohol or this is isopropyl alcohol and pour that over the part that's going to come in contact with the bush when you're making your cuts [Music] now a pruning time is going to depend upon your growing climate for us I like to prune here in the Pacific Northwest and we're a gardening zone seven the end of January into February the reason for that is because you can see your fruit buds so you know where your fruit blossoms are going to be and where you're going to have your blueberries versus what is just the leaf buds and this is going to be really important when you're making your pruning cuts and your pruning decisions it's best if you can prune on a dry day so when your blueberry plant is only one or two years old the only thing that you would prune for it would be any broken or diseased branches after that as you start to get into three four five six and hopefully decade old blueberry plants then you're going to be making some more severe cuts and I'm going to walk you through each of those this plant right here is about a nine year old blueberry plant so no matter what plant it is or the size I should say age of the bush that you're going to be pruning the first thing that we're going to look for is the new growth vs. dead or diseased growth your new growth you're going to be able to visually see really easy as this bright red color and it's more supple and Viney looking your old growth is gonna be the darker gray and more woody looking wood then you're gonna have areas where you have got dead branches and you can see those because they're usually very dark brown sometimes they'll be black and they don't show any signs of new growth so the first cut that I make when I'm looking at a plant and we're getting ready to prune and this is going to be true no matter what age the plant is even your younger ones is you want to cut out any of the dead areas so whenever we're making a pruning cut when we're cutting out dead we're gonna do it at a 45 degree angle and a nice sharp and clean cut so pruning shears are essential and you want to make sure that they're nice and sharp so you're gonna come right below that dead area into the healthy tissue and at a 45 degree angle you're gonna make your cuts with that another one right here that's right above a fruiting bud and so we're gonna come right above there and we'll also get that cut off so this is obviously a dead branch so they want to remove that now when you're removing a full branch that's dead we're actually going to come and not do that 45 angle cut you're gonna come right up to this part and you're just gonna do it flush right up against it now here we've got at the tip here these are all fruiting buds so these larger swollen ones at the tip these are all going to be multiple blossoms and you're gonna get a handful of berries right here then down here these are all what your little leaf buds are so this is just going to be foilage and you can tell when we're looking at this branch as this comes out there's hardly anything on this this is older wood and it's also growing out into the Iowa where we go through and mow so I'm going to remove this because even though there is a couple of brooding buds they're very small and there's no growth or proof happening on this so we're going to remove this and again we're just gonna do this right up flush on that branch you always want to make sure you remove any of the material that you're pruning you don't want to leave the dead or diseased branches and you want to take those out and this is just on the end of here this is dead so we're gonna take that off as well as right here but we're going to leave these because they're fruiting and when they're really small like this this little suede just doesn't have anything on it you can almost just pray from off the little tiny ones when you're looking at the center of your blueberry bush the wood that is six years or older which is going to be characteristic of being a lot thicker around dark and this is my the oldest pieces they have all the moss on them after they've hit about six years of age you're gonna be able to tell that they stopped producing as well and you're gonna want to start thinning them out so some of these younger newer canes can become a part of the blueberry bush and that you always keep it bigger so this here has got a lot of dead and there's nothing coming on this so I'm going to take this actually all the way down to the ground and we're gonna cut that off really low and remove it that also is going to allow more Sun and airflow to get in here so that we don't have fungal disease setting in as much and that the berries can get ripen but they're not shaded by a lot of boilage so one of the things that I like to do is to travel up this branch and I'm going to leave part of this even though this is older wood when I'm looking at it there's a lot of blueberry blossoms on this branch and there's still a lot of good here however this older branch right here it's shooting into the middle of the plant which I want to keep that a little bit more open as I said for airflow and to help those berries to ripen and this doesn't have a ton of new growth it actually has quite a bit of old on there so I'm just going to remove this portion and take that out and then we're gonna let the rest of this grow and then next year I probably will remove this in its entirety when this one has filled in a little bit more okay so as we're looking at this plant over here you can see this is one of those older canes and as I come out and examine it there's hardly any new growth on this there's a few little fruit blossoms but there's just not a lot it's not very vigorous it's not adding much to the plant and it's taking away so I'm gonna actually when you get to these bigger canes on here we're gonna take our loppers we've got the longer handle so you just got more leverage and you want to go down really low when you're removing a cane and we're gonna just remove and cut that out and again as I'm looking at this older wood now this wood isn't quite as old it's got a little bit more red to it a little bit of moss growth on it and it's not as thick so I can tell that these are slightly newer though they are getting older but I need to evaluate them because I have a lot going on in the center here and we need to see which one is the healthiest because these are starting to rub and you don't ever want to have your canes or if you're even pruning your fruit trees when they start to rub that's a place for disease and insects to enter into the plant so we want to remove anything that is rubbing and causing friction against one another so we're gonna evaluate and see which of these are the healthiest so this has a lot out here there's hardly any fruit buds on here there's a little bit but there's not a lot of new growth and it's not going to be a lot of fruit production whereas this one I've got quite a bit of fruit buds here and a lot coming up through and here so I'm gonna remove this one out it's also an older cane and it's just less vigorous so again you're gonna get your lopper right in there at the base making sure you have the right ones selected and we're gonna take this one out actually now that I've got it removed I can kind of get in there in a little bit better angle and we're gonna go even a little bit deeper taking that out at the ground level so this one here even though this isn't a super old one you can see where we've had breakage here you want to make sure that we remove this because that is an easy entry point for disease and insects to come in I've also got some dead branches coming off of this and as we look at it even though this is a little bit newer growth it's not very vigorous there's quite a few dead spots and there's only a few fruit buds so I'm just gonna take this one all the way out and completely remove it from the blueberry plant now these are smaller but there's only one fruit bud on this entire thing and they're growing back in towards the center of the bush and because they're not showing good signs they're not very vigorous I'm gonna go ahead and take these out as well remove any dead dead wood like that even though we're going to keep this cane so we removed a couple of canes from the center but as we come into this one this is an older cane again and this growth down here doesn't really have a whole lot on it I've got some dead stuff I don't have any growth coming here this is all dead and even though I've got one healthier vigorous spot on this cane it's in the center and because it's so old it's gonna stop producing each year I'm going to get less and less fruit off of it so we're gonna come down to again you want to come down right to the base and get as low in there as you can and we're gonna remove that cave that also really opens up the center of our blueberry plant so these blossoms that are in here and these canes can come in and have good airflow I've also got down here some younger canes that are just starting and these ones already have fruit buds right here and are showing good promise so I'm going to leave this one because it's already showing fruit production and I'm going to take this one out so this can actually replace the cane that we just removed so we're going to come over on this side of the bush and here I've got some older wood and as it comes out there are some fruit blossoms on here but it's not really vigorous so what I'm going to do is this is some newer wood that does have some fruit blossoms on it but as you look at this it's got a lot of new growth but there's only one blossom on here so this cane I'm gonna take out right here at the bottom now as we look over here I've got some good fruit budding coming on over here and this is new growth I don't have a lot of new growth coming out here and this is an older cane but I know I'm gonna get quite a bit of fruit off of this section and this section so I'm going to leave this this year and just take out the part that is a little bit dead here on the end and then this one's not doing very good there's a couple fruit blossoms but there's not a lot so I'm actually just gonna cut this one all the way back and then just remove the dead parts here on the tip and on this one I don't have a lot of fruit bud and I've got some dead wood so again we're just gonna take this down to the bottom there and kind of this one has some fruit blossoms here so I'm going to leave that because I'll probably remove this pane next year but just so you can kind of see how you can plan to leave some for this year and then you'll know the following year you're gonna remove it and if you enjoyed this video on learning how to prune your blueberries make sure that you hit subscribe and hit the little bell so that you get notified when

to grow blueberry series today I'm going to show you how to container plant blueberries [Music] blueberries actually make fantastic container plants we definitely have to think about what materials were using in the container because they are acid loving plants there's a lot of reasons why you'd end up with blueberries in containers if you're in an area of the country that doesn't have soil that is acidic enough for blueberries or maybe you're a renter an apartment whatever they make great container plants you need to think about the size and type of container you're using though I'm going to put the blueberry plant in this 15 gallon container today this is just a black nursery container this would be about an equivalent 16 inch pot if you were buying a decorative container just make sure it has drainage holes in the bottom we need to make sure that the water can find a way out of the bottom when it gets too wet when we get a thunderstorm or something like that alright that's probably not adequate that 15 gallon container over maybe we could keep it in this container about two years this plant right here is in a two gallon pot it's going to go in that fifteen gallon container we can leave it in there this year and maybe next year from there it's probably best that it ends up in about a twenty five gallon container and if you are buying a decorative pot this is about a 24 inch wide container a whiskey barrel would work perfect for this as long as it has a drainage hole in the bottom of it or one of those half barrels is probably the equivalent 25 gallon pot so when we're container planting a blueberry you're always going to hear peat moss peat moss peat moss and that's great because it does have the low pH that we're looking for one issue with peat moss is a blueberry plant is still a woody shrub and woody shrubs like to dry out a little bit between rains and between waterings and peat can really hold a lot of water almost too much water at times so I like to cut the peat moss a little bit with some pine bark soil conditioner and I'm actually going to start my container off with a little bit of soil conditioner right at the bottom and I'm going do it right up to the edge of these drainage holes here which will give a place for extra water to find its way to that bark and then out of these drainage holes another option for that would be to buy a small bag of gravel and maybe put an inch or two of gravel right at the base of the pot so I'm going to start with about two inches of this pine bark soil conditioner right at the bottom of this container and I'm just going to get up to where I've covered the drainage holes that are in the side of it and that's going to be perfect it's a up about that much on the edge of this container from there I'm going to go ahead and put some of this peat moss in this peat moss is in a bale it's very compressed as I put it into the container I'm going to want to break it up just a little bit and we'll fill this up to about 3/4 of the way okay that's about three-quarters of the way up so we've got our bark on the bottom then we've got a layer of peat that's probably about 12 inches deep I'm going to come back and put some bark on the top of this so that when I plant my blueberry it's going to mix in and incorporate into that peat moss to create a little bit of drainage the thing you'll see when you pull a blueberry plant out of the container this one is not particularly root bound it's only been planted in this container since the fall it's got a couple weeds on the top we're definitely gonna want to get rid of and a little bit of pine straw and some leaves that have fallen on it but this one is not particularly root bound blueberries have very fibrous root systems and most of the time when you take one out you're going to really need to get go all the way around it and really loosen up the edge of that root ball and from the bottom I'll typically just peel away like this and make sure I rough all of it up it does have one side on it here where the roots are very tight and I will rough that up a little bit one advantage to using a decorative pot rather than this black nursery pot is blueberry roots are a little bit sensitive to heat so if this black pot ends up in the full Sun all day it will probably damage the roots on the side of the pot that's getting the most Sun and occasionally I'll come out and rotate a pot around like that to then get the roots to fill in on the other side not a lot of depth to this when this pot wasn't very full and so I'm going to work that bark into that peat moss a little bit then I'm going to dig a small hole I'm almost setting this on top of what I had done so far and then I'm going to fill up to the edge of it at the end of this I don't want to cover anything that wasn't covered when I took it out of the container none of this would that's above this soil line should be covered up at all so I'm going to mix some peat then some bark them to peat then some bark until I get this right up to the top edge and then I'm going to tamp it down around it and then we'll need to do some watering on it one thing about this peat moss holding that much water it comes dry in this bale and it's going to take several times watering it to get it wet you need to get the container where it's going to go before you start watering it because the weight of this thing is going to triple probably we can pack it down quite a bit now just keep going back and forth until I have it right up to the top that's great I don't have anything covered I've got it sitting right flush to the top I'm going to take a little bit of this pine bark and just put a little bit right around the top this is going to help control any weeds that might try to come up in this right now this pot is very light because like I say that bark is dry and this peat is dry when I water it it will be very very heavy so that's really the basics of this if I'm using the peat moss in the pine bark I know it's acid enough I don't really have to worry about lowering the pH after that you can soil test these you can buy one of the inexpensive pH testers box doors have them all the garden centers have them and actually check this and make sure the pH is in between 4.5 and five or 5.5 if it's not low enough you can add some sulfur a small amount of sulfur to the container at the time and then maybe check it a couple weeks later and see if that's lowered it enough the last step I'm going to take before I lose this to where it's going is I'm going to put some Holly tone on it which have some sulfur in it and it's a great slow release fertilizer for acid loving plants I'm going to use probably about 3/4 of a cup ok so that's basically it you can see the blueberries have formed on this variety already and they'll continue to grow throughout the season here's your 15 gallon container I've got the peat and pine bark mix a little bit of bark on the top and that will help the top inch or so of soil dry out and help control weeds up in the upper part of the soil here they have a harder time gaining hold if the top inch of soil is never wet and then like I told you here I don't have anything covered that wasn't covered in the container I'm still see the top of the root ball from where it was originally in the other container this 15 gallon container like I say I'll definitely get this season and probably next season out of it initially I'm going to water it very heavily until the water runs out of the bottom it'll take me probably two maybe even three waterings to actually saturate this peat moss then I'm going to let it dry over time and the way container plants work is I probably won't have to water it again for at least a week and over time that amount of time is going to go less and less and less until I'm probably watering it daily months from now and then once it becomes really frustrating next year I would probably take it out of this 15 gallon container and move it over to it the equivalent 25 gallon container whatever that is and then I think you could probably permanently leave it in that container occasionally with container plants I'll actually go in and dig some space out maybe two or three spots around the container and go down pretty deep and add some fresh soil to it and I'll be taking out some roots at that time and probably will do a little bit of damage to it that way but having that fresh soil in it occasionally will definitely help with the growth of these plants thank you for watching my video on container planting blueberries if it was helpful please hit the like button and subscribe to my channel for future videos also next Thursday I'll be back showing you how to actually plant them in the ground I have clay soils in my yard so I'm actually going to be mounting them up above that clay it's probably important to some others that may have clay based soils as well and also show you how to plant them in sand to your soils which is really quite easy so again thanks for watching you", "d78dI7kn8qU": "well it's a bit chilly but if you keep\nmoving fantastic weather this November to February you can get an awful lot\ndone but I tell you what if you're a gardener you're an optimist you're an\noptimist you're thinking to the future you think it's a bowl of raspberries\ncherries gooseberries oh all the fruit you can imagine so let's go and plant a\nfew berries log of many stay bass oh there's so many I'm definitely gonna\ntell you kids toys one of these days but now the weather's nice a bit of planting\nnow just imagine if you will a blueberry muffin with your old homegrown\nblueberries this one Spartan is a belter it really is good and they're very very\neasy you follow a few rules too easy to do now what I'm gonna do is write the\nway these are just old fiberglass containers that I picked up what they do\nthis perfectly I'm gonna plant two in each of these tubs early mid and late so\nI'm gonna do Spartan gold Traub and Dixie and that'll give me blueberries\nright the way through and it really is easy pieces to do them you really need\nan acid on the acid side of pH of compost now a good area Katia's compost\nif you're filling up a tub or a large pot these are last in a good quality\neducation compost three years you won't have to do anything a slight trim if\nyou're a few branches get broken but other than that you don't have to do\nanything to them and you get big luscious fruits off all this in these\ntubs is an area cassius compost and then this Spartan is a good doer look at that\nthat's a beautiful plant and it's a bit door miserable today but for planting I\ncan see in springtime oh and thinking of blueberry muffins in a cup of tea whoa\nnow about a foot apart they've got plenty of room to grow it well-prepared\nso you can't really go wrong with just a tub full of compost\nin there and that Spartan same level it was in the pot nine centimeter pot see\nso this the big pots it's as easy as that I'm gonna plug these look like I\nsay we're gold Rob and Dixie and that will give me blueberries right the way\nthrough me old blueberries but there is another way and there is another one you\ncan try a pot on it's all on the patio now take a look at this one this is one\ncalled top hat really lovely compact if you have a look on the website you'll\nsee a beautiful picture of this because one things blueberries do have it it's\nlovely flowers so on a patio in a pot on top of a table\nlovely dome with flowers but after the flowers you've got blueberries and\nhonestly your friends will be absolutely amazed now the compost is just the same\nericaceous also has a pH and the pH needs to be on the acid side not the\nalkaline side so ericaceous compost in your pot crocks in the bottom because\nthey like a lot of moisture but they don't like standing in in wet so on the\nbottom a few crocks ericaceous compost permitting and that's ready to go on\nyour patio beautiful springtime flowers then fruit to follow you really can't go\nwrong with top hat in a pot but all of these or growing pots there's no problem\nwith them at all so you've got no excuse but blueberry muffins\nnow Blue Beam or things such a cream cup of tea oh you see that's what's driving\nme onwards", "LGCwXwfik9g": "okay I think

blueberries and from the hands I saw earlier I'm sure a lot of you either probably most of you have some blueberries already or some of you are thinking about putting some blueberries in okay blueberries are great for a couple things of course they're great for the berries that we get off of them they are very easy to grow the berries are very nutritious a lot of antioxidants they freeze well they make great pies but they also make great ornamental plants a lot of people use the blueberries just as an ornamental just as a shrub they let the birds get the berries and they just use them as a shrub because they're so pretty and green in the summer time and in the fall you can depending on your variety you either have yellow or or red stems so they make a very good ornamental shrub also okay if you do everything right in other words you have the right pH you give them the right amount of fertilizer the soil is just organic enough they get enough water they get enough sunshine you should get 10 to 12 inches of growth a year that's quite a bit but this is if everything is right and they should produce ten to fifteen pounds of berries now we are talking about our northern highbush blueberries there are some other varieties that I'll talk about a little bit later that are coming that we used to not have here 10-15 years ago we only had high Bush because they can't grow high bush back east they're not called cold tolerant enough so they grew low bush or half which don't produce as many berries we are very lucky that we can grow our northern high bush berries here okay it's really important before you plant to get your soil pH tested how many of you had soil tested specifically for your blueberries today good good okay the reason it's important is blueberries really need a low pH 4.5 to 5.5 our rain that we have does add make our soil a little bit more acidic than some areas but sometimes we end up amending the soil with lime to raise the pH and then decide to put the blueberries in and find out that the pH is too hot it's hard to lower lower the pH on your blueberries after you've already put them in so it's really a good idea to get the soil test done before you put them in like I said elemental sulfur is what we add what we put to lower the pH but you don't want to do that when you have your berries out there it's kind of hard to regulate it if you incorporate Douglas fir sawdust into the soil the sawdust is acidic and it will help lower the pH a little bit one thing it will do especially if you're using fresh sawdust it will take nutrients out of the soil but the nitrogen it will use up that nitrogen so you may have to fertilize them a little bit more raised beds or putting them up on mounds help because blueberries have very shallow root systems a lot of the roots are really close to the surface so mounting them up and having them in a nice fluffy area really is helpful to them okay blueberries are self-fruitful you only need one blueberry plant to get blueberries but if you have them cross pollinate with another variety you will get more blueberries and they will be larger blueberries so if you're going out there and you say I'm going to buy maybe two or three blueberries you don't want to get all the same variety you want maybe you might want to get two of your favorite variety in one of your second favorite variety just to get a little bit of cross-pollination mulch is very important for blueberries because mulch doesn't many many things and what we tell you is to use fir sawdust most of you if you've seen the fields of commercial blueberries you'll see that they have sawdust on em sawdust is nice and light and fluffy it's easy to fluff up around the bush it also adds like I said it will add we will lower the pH a little bit as it works down into the soil we don't recommend that you use compost or manure because they are not only high in pH which we don't want but they're also high in salt can be very high in salt and blueberries are one plant that really doesn't can't take salt content very well so we don't recommend that you put compost some people have told me well I've done it and I don't have any problem and that's good I say well good for you we hope it stays that way but if you are using composting you find that your blueberries are just getting a little not looking quite so well as they should be that might be one of the factors you might think about taking that that compost off and putting either first sawdust or some fir bark on there since the roots are so shallow having mulch on around your plant will keep the roots cooler in the summertime and keep them warmer in the winter time and also it's nice to in the fall when the leaves fall off we want to get rid of any debris we're going to get rid of those leaves because they will bring on more diseases and we want to have healthy plants so having sawdust there is an easy way to rake up the leaves and move them away from your plant usually OSU recommends when you start that you put with your brand new plants you put about two inches of mulch up the trunk and then every year add two to two two more inches until you get to six inches now I know a lot of you have been told and which is a good thing that you are not to put mulch around the base of trees and shrubs because it will help it makes the bark disintegrate blueberries are different than that with blueberries you can put the mulch a little ways up the trunk we want new growth to come from underneath we want that new growth to come from that area so the lighter and fluffier it is close to the trunk and up the trunk the the better it is for those blueberries to put new shoots up from the ground so that's one of those it's don't put stuff around your trees and your other shrubs but for blueberries go ahead and put the mulch up a little raise up the trunk its we blueberries cannot compete they don't compete well for nutrients they don't compete well for water so it's really important that you keep all the weeds and grasses and things away from your blueberry plants it's hard to do when you've got grass and crabgrass growing up through there and you'll notice if you take a rake and you try to rake those weeds out of there you'll be hooking that rake on all the little feather roots there at the top so it's really important to try to hand pull those weeds but mulching will help with that you'll have less weeds if you mulch around your plants okay the other thing blueberries need is a lot of water people ask me my blueberry is not doing so well what's wrong with it well I say okay does it have the right pH have you fertilized it enough did you water it enough and is it in the sunshine those things are very important people don't realize how much water a blueberry plant takes if it's a young guy and you just put it in the ground maybe an inch a week and we're talking when we're not getting our rains and if it's a mature plant you may need anywhere from an inch and a half to three inches of water a week in a hot of the summertime one thing people forget to do is when you've got your blueberries and you've already eaten them and there's no more blueberries on the bush people have a tendency to forget about their bushes and that is the time that they're setting their berry buds for next year so it's really important that you keep watering those plants until we get our really heavy fall rains which might be October might not be till November because if you don't keep water on though you're just making you're not encouraging more buds more berries for the next year so don't forget that watering of course it is better to water from the base if it's possible some people don't have that they have to overhead water blueberries do we'll get some diseases a lot of plants get diseases from overhead watering it just seems to be the right you know the right environment for diseases to come blueberries aren't quite so bad not like your tomatoes would be so if you need to water with a sprinkler or something like that it's not quite as important with blueberry as it is with some of your other crops but if possible watering from the base one thing you might think about if you are watering with a drip or a soaker hose really check go down there and dig after you find things that they've had enough water dig down and see if you've really watered down that 18 inches that it's supposed to be okay I don't really need to explain you don't really need to memorize how much fertilizer and things to use the handout that you have is has a little bit of information on it and I have another handout OSU has another publication called growing blueberries in the home garden it was out with one of the displays and happened to gone missing so I don't have it to show to you but it has specifically how much fertilizer you need to add but what I wanted you to get out of this was mainly if you're going to use an organic fertilizer what we want what the blueberries want is a fertilizer that has just nitrogen you don't have to worry about the phosphorus or the potassium you want mainly just the nitrogen so if you're going to use an organic fertilizer blood meal and feather meal had the highest organ highest nitrogen so those would be two of the organic ones that would be good to use on your blueberries if you're just going to use a synthetic ammonium sulfate which is 2100 so it's just nitrogen that is what's recommended the publication's from OSU will explain to you how much ammonium sulfate to use but you can just calculate that out with whatever product that you do use I want you to notice that this says new plants not only do you fertilize the amount of fertilizer that you use when you have a new plant is different than from established plant but the times that you fertilize is also different for new plants we would we would fertilize a little bit in late April again in early June and again in late July but for established plants you're not going you're going to do it in April 1st of April May and June you're not want to do an ende later than the middle of June because if you do you're going to encourage a lot of new growth late in the season which will probably get cold damage so that's what I mainly wanted you to get out of these two slides was that when your plants are new you just put them in the ground this year the times you're going to add fertilizer is different than if your plants have been in the ground for a year or more you don't add lime to blueberries line increases the pH and what we want to do in blueberries is lower the pH yes okay the other thing you need to know about fertilizers is that blueberries cannot translocate that means if you put the fertilizer on one side of the plant the other side of the plant cannot take up that fertilizer so you need to fertilize in a circle around the plant so put your fertilizer in a circle rake it in really gently and then water it in that way all parts of the plant will get that nutrient hey pollination yes okay she's asking at because I mentioned that they can't compete and she's wondering if you could under plant with strawberries that is one thing I get a lot of questions about people say I want to put my strawberries under my blueberries strawberries need a pH of 6 blueberries need a pH of 4.5 25.5 and they don't compete well for the water so you don't want to have them underneath your plants I would say at least two or three feet away yeah okay all right Mason bees bumble bees and honey bees all pollinate blueberries and the nice thing about mason bees I did talk earlier on mason bees and we talked about mason bees come out earlier in the season then honey bees do they come out when it's cooler well your blueberry plants will be opening up their flowers in April and sometimes if it's really cold the honeybees aren't out yet so the mason bees will be doing a really good job of pollinating your blueberries so if you want to grow blueberries and you want to grow mason bees that's a perfect combination okay we're going to talk a little bit about pruning now the objective of pruning you want a lot of new strong wood growing up mainly from the base sometimes depending on your variety you have some of the new shoots won't come from the base won't come from the ground they'll come from an other another shoots it's already there but we want to try to encourage that and we want to have kind of a happy medium between new growth fruit production and it's sort of an experimental you'll we can tell you exactly how to do it but every plants different a little bit so you'll know one year if you if you if you prove really heavy you'll get a lot of new growth but you won't get there are many berries and if you don't prune heavy enough you won't get new growth but you'll get a lot of berries but each year they'll get smaller and smaller so there's sort of it's sort of a little bit of experiment with that okay so what you want to do is first of all with any plant you want to remove out any dead or diseased or any dying parts that's what you want to do normally we tell you that we want this blueberry to stay five years old and your blueberry will live to be a hundred if you take care of it but we don't want it to be any older than five or six years old all the time so that means you're going to constantly take out some of the older canes to encourage the new growth because blueberries grow better on one two three four and five year old wood so that's what you want if you get it if you don't prune your blueberries every year and the wood gets older and older and older you'll get less and less and less berries and less and less growth new growth too so you want to cut out one or two of the old unproductive canes if these are mature bushes but you don't really need to start pruning on your bushes except for the diseased dead parts until they're about five or six years old so if you've just planted them just do a little bit of maintenance pruning for right now and wait into a few more years before you do any heavy pruning on them and you'll notice on your blueberries that you'll see a lot of the unproductive wood is Twiggy it's at the top and it's little tiny pieces we cut that out the longer the stem the better the blueberries are so when you're looking at your boo berry bush and you see a whole bunch of little stems you see little ones that have berry buds remember the berry buds are on the tip and then you see longer ones that have berry buds those are the ones you want to save and the little tweaky parts of the points you want to get rid of all right and of course you want to try to thin it out a little bit we want air circulation and we want light to be able to get into all parts of that plant Hey hi pH causes the most problem in blueberries and it causes a lot of iron deficiency iron can only be taken up through the plant if it's in water most nutrients they have to have water to take it up well if you ever want look at a fertilizer chart you will notice that when the pH gets really high your iron iron that's available to that plant gets really really small so that means the higher your pH the less iron that plant is able to take up so that's why we tell you that having the pH low is very very important a few disease problems you may run into with your blueberry plants mummy berry is one that everybody will probably see sometime in their life and what it is when the berries just start to ripen they start to turn kind of red and then they fall off and when they fall off in the ground they they kind of mummify they turn into these little white mummy looking objects and the fungus is inside of there and what happens is next April right about when your flowers are ready to open when your flowers are open up that fungus is inside that little mummy down there will release its spores and it will come and reinfect your berries again but there's two very easy cultural ways to take care of that and that is if you're going to put mulch on your blueberries do it in march that way you're smothering any mummies that happen to be on the ground or take a rake and very carefully rake up around your blueberries a couple times during the month of March that way you're going to release those spores early before the flower buds are open and then the spores won't have anything to infect really easy way to take care of that there's a couple other things there's a couple viruses as you may come across they both start out the same every berry and every leaf drops off of your plant blueberries shock the plant will return it will grow back that's same summer it will grow leaves blueberries scorch is just like its name scorch it turns black and it's dead and that one you need to remove but try this is something your plants may get but try this is just gray mold many of you have to have strawberries I've seen some of your strawberries get all mole that's called grammo that's a botrytis it's a fungus blueberries can get that too depending on our weather but usually it doesn't infect the whole bush just a little bit of the tips and you can cut those parts out should you and nothing will grow there you mean the virus I have an area where I tried to draw always release and I replanted a mechanic but nothing will grow there I don't know what happened um she has an area that she's tried to grow blueberries and has trouble growing them there the first thing you'd probably need to have is a detailed soil test not just pH but all the other things and that that's a cost and I can talk to you about that afterwards how you can get that information to get a complete soil test to find out whether your soil is doing what it's supposed to do okay these insects you may have a few leaf rollers or aphids or scales but they really don't cause many problems on our blueberries but the problem you are going to have with your blueberry how many of you heard of the spotted wing Drosophila okay how many of you have spotted wing Drosophila in your blueberries that hand came up twice he definitely has it in 2009 this little bugger started came to our area it is a fruit fly you know how you have fruit flies when you leave your bananas on your counter and the fruit flies come in and they eat it because it's decomposing well these fruit flies are going to start they are going to lay eggs inside of your berries before they're even ripe and they are fly so what they do is they lay an egg inside of the blueberries strawberries raspberries a lot of soft fruits and then that egg will hatch out into what does a fly a maggot a maggot and you will notice when you pick your berries you'll know if you had them because they'll be real soft if you didn't notice if you're trying to make jam or jelly you'll notice because as soon as you start boiling that stuff you'll have the maggots floating on top it's a very very bad problem here and OSU even hired a specialist to see what we could do about this problem so far everything they've came up with for homeowners is culturally what we can do and I'll show you a picture here is we can make traps for them now when they first decided to figure out how to get rid of these things they they took white cuts clear cups they put some holes in them the size this information protecting your garden fruits from the spotted wing Drosophila is available to you to download free from our OSU site and it has directions also on how to make these since they've done that they've also experimented with red cups and they think maybe red cups would work pretty well the reason this this yellow thing is in there that's just a sticky trap and some people like to have a sticky trap so that they can see the insect when it sticks to it but what you do is you put apple cider vinegar a little ways up on the cup the holes are at the top so the little fruit flies smell this vinegar and they go in the cup and hopefully it will help reduce the population you'll put several of these hang them from your blueberry plants or put them down with your strawberries or any of the other soft fruits that you think you might have this problem and you don't need to do it just when the fruit is on you can do it all summer long I have some of these out my garden I started them in November and they've got some of the spotted wing Drosophila flies in them even now just apple cider vinegar yes that's what you put in so you can look up this information but those of you that do have blueberries are you know I was hoping that I would make it without having any because we have a lot of Tree Swallows a lot of swallows I thought okay I haven't had problem yet I didn't have a problem the blueberries but they did come into the blackberries last year so be aware that they are out there and keep track of your berries keep finding out whether whether you have that problem if you do you'll probably want to put out some crops for now it's a fruit fly the reason they call it the spotted wing Drosophila in here I'll show you again is because the male has those two spots on the top of his wing that's how you can tell the male the female just has a different type of ovipositor but than the regular fruit fly they originally came from Japan they were back east and then they came West and now we have the problem most people ask me the biggest thing to say is my blueberries what can I do about the birds well that's a big problem of course the only way to specifically keep your birds out is to build a frame around your blueberry plants we have a Master Gardener here that's even listening back in the back and she has this beautiful framework that she has all of her blueberry plants in she never has any trouble with birds and she's always she's always able to harvest every one of them that grows but for those of you that don't want to frame you'll just have to try experiment with some other things blow up devices have you seen those great big yellow blow up balloons with a big eye on them I have found that one thing that works really good they're kind of hard to find and that is the blow-up snakes they blow up to be about this long and this big around but I'll give you some information don't put them underneath the bush where you think snakes should be set them on top of the bush and when the birds fly over they see this giant snake and they fit that they not hurt you you could also try anything shiny CDs work birds hair tape might work put it in put whatever you try to scare the birds away put it up before the berries ripen and move your things if you don't move them around you'll find birds sitting on top of this owl so you'll want to move them from place to place just so the birds think that it might be real okay there's stuff you you also have a list there and in that book that I mentioned there's a list of the different types of cultivars different varieties of blueberries that we have blueberries come in midseason early mid and late season and if you wanted to get the earliest earliest in the late latest blueberry you could find you could be eating blueberries all the way from the end of June to the middle of September so and the tags will tell you whether they're early mid or late season now remember I talked about the the blueberry plants that they have back east there are nurseries a few years ago decided that there was really a market for these smaller blueberry plants because people have smaller landscapes and a lot of people wanted to garden in containers so you will find a lot of smaller blueberry plants out in your nurseries now so you'll need to make sure that when you go to purchase a blueberry plant that you know what you're buying are you boring a high Bush that will give you 15 pounds of berries or are you buying a low Bush that will only give you 5 pounds of berries so think about that read some of the articles read some of the OSU publications find out which blueberry plants you think that you would rather have in your yard and don't be too anxious to to to harvest them as soon as they get blue they really haven't reached their peak sweetness yet so you want to wait 5 or 10 days until they get sweeter and as you're waiting the birds are going to come in and wipe them out so all I can say is good luck and thanks for coming you you you Oh you", "pjizIoMC2CM": "get a folks it's Rob here and welcome to our backyard farm in today's clip I'm going to have a bit of a chat to you about growing blueberries in containers and not this dear old lady here who's just started to flower but for new plants that we've purchased did I want to grow in some root pouches in a little bit of a wicking setup up near the house now the variety I'm growing out was actually recommended to me by a patreon patron Kate thank you very much a Kate she's also growing some herself they're called blueberry bursts and it's been developed here in Australia by the folks at plant net now it is a dwarf plant it's an evergreen as well it's probably only grossed around about a meter tall or 3 foot tall so it is great for container gardening it's also got very large fruit said to be 3 times the size of a normal blueberry that you might find in the stores and is an early season crop as well so it will learn fruit before this dear old lady here so we'll have a nice continuing supply for a couple of months now growing blueberries in containers is a great option for most of us as it does give us greater control over the pH of the soil blend we used to grow the plants now the reason we want to take control over the pH of the soil with the blueberries is that they're kalsa few jiz which is basically another word for an acid loving plant that doesn't like soil that is alkaline or has a high pH level they actually prefer a very low pH anywhere from four to round about 5.5 depending on the variety that you're growing I'm actually looking forward to see what sort of a harvest cake gets from her plants as her should fruit before ours and yeah next year we'll be able to UM compare the harvest so anyway we'll leave it there and we'll take a wander up closer to the house and in the shade and we'll have a look at mixing up the soil and then potting these little ladies out so now comes time to plant this little lady out I'm using a 56 litre or roughly a 15 gallon container it's actually a root pouch normally they recommend a 50 to 60 centimeter pot when you're growing blueberries in containers this one's a little bit smaller but I'm not too concerned at all mainly because it is a smaller more compact variety of blueberry not only that the root to itself with its fabric walls will allow the plant to air per in themselves which means they will have a healthy root system than in a normal plastic or terra cotta pot so the foil blend I'm using is the one recommended by plant net for their all their blueberry plants it's going to be 50% coarse pine bark which is ten to twenty five millimeters in size or roughly just under half to an inch in size and also to camellia and azalea potting mix camellias and azaleas are both acid loving plants so it makes sense to use that potting mix in your containers for blueberries as well now I am adding in a few of my own amendment I'm adding in a little bit of my own sifted compost there will be soil biology in there that will help make nutrients plant available I'm also adding in a small amount of slow-release chicken pellet fertilizer that will hopefully break down over the coming months and become plants available and from there all I've done is grabbed the garden fork and given the ingredients so to speak a good mix around in the wheelbarrow so to begin with all I'm going to do is add in the blend and make a mess as you can probably see so what I'm going to do now just place the pot in there it's a bit of a bounce around firm down the soil a little bit and backfill around it what I'm hoping is going to happen is I can pull that pot out remove the blueberry from it and then pop it straight into the hole that was left behind so I might just leave it there just burn this down a little bit pop the pot out turn it upside down give it a bit of a squish and now I can pop it just straight back in there and then backfill up to the top of the soil there and there we go that's pretty much all it one potted up blueberry onto the next three so with the leftover pine bark I'll use that as a mulch over the top of the pouches just to help slow down any evaporation from the surface of the soil itself they were also awarded in weird and eco seaweed liquid fertilizer so nice fertilizer just to help the plant cell into the pouches when it comes to fertilizing blueberries I pretty much will do it just once a year leading up to when they start to flower and fruit I put a small sprinkle of the slow-release organic colors down cover that up with some homegrown compost and then a layer of mulch again on top and that's pretty much all it they do recommend giving the plants a good feed during the flowering and fruiting stage though so I'll be using the Eco seaweed because it's sixteen percent potassium I'll just be feeding it probably every second third week I'll give it a nice little liquid feed and that should really help in the flower and fruit formation now as you can see I've got mine in a tray you don't need to do that that's just the way I like to garden any excess moisture as you can see down the base there gets trapped and it can be used by the plant and as you can see over the back of my banana pouch garden there is some water in the tray I leave it in there the plants use it up over about a 12 to 24 hour period and any mosquito larva in there die off so it's not a mosquito hazard and I have seen other people put rocks around the base of their trees and that just stops any mosquitos getting to the water itself by the way you don't need to have our root pouches to use this tray method you can buy trays at the hardware store that you can sit your pot plant in and do exactly the same thing I'm just doing it on a slightly larger scale just with those pouches there and as you can see a couple of banana trees in our pouch there so these guys really are easy to grow in containers as long as you keep in mind that you do need that specific soil blend from the hardware or nursery store just quickly as for watering these guys just for the time being that will be wicking up water from the tray later on but just until they're established I'll be doing the digit tests basically popping that down into the soil blend seeing if it's moist or dry and then watering appropriately from there just quickly at the start of the clip I mentioned Kate suggested these blueberry plants to us I need to thank all the rest of the awesome patrons over there on our patreon page your contributions basically helped by these trees or bushes and the soil mix that went into these is here so thank you very much folks also if you would like to check out our super contributors from patreon their names and length and Facebook groups are all in the description below so go check them out you could even say g'day to them in the comment section below if you feel like it if you are interested in patreon you can check it out through that little link up there I do hope that everyone who has stuck around this fire has enjoyed the clip you can stick around a little bit longer after it's finished there'll be a little section just showing one of our native bees pollinating a blueberry flower from last year it's amazing they can actually fit in there I think I don't hope you're all well and happy ended to your gardens of booming and I will catch you next time cheers folks have a tough one you", "O-ej_OXMJlQ": "so we were out berry hunting today and we were trying to find some blackberries and we were successful the black bears are not ready yet so we're gonna be getting our wild black raspberries I just wanted to show you this field of blackberries I found it's truly unbelievable come over here I've never seen such a large field of blackberries like this it's a little bit more I now show you some of the berries developing but they just truly impressive here's the berries down low they're still developing so they don't have their mass yet this is gonna be very heaven that way it goes way up over that hill and back through that way and around and scoops over and reconnects with this trail here this is amazing so about another month I would say they got their bearings they formed their berries they're developing there's also blueberries out here or humm another type of berry called a swamp Dewberry it's developing it will stay as low to the ground I've never seen a blackberry so if you look down low these are some baby blueberry bushes no no and here's a better example of some swamp do berries closer look a lot of them over here there's a lot of wild blueberries along this little trail it's a bog for some reason they just absolutely love the conditions over here so they very large you can see one right here with some blueberries on it here's some more there's some getting ready right here there's a lot lot more than I thought Wow there's a big fat one right back here right here's some more kind of hard to reach she was feel how my feet feel right now it's very very unstable it C plays a fat one that's tall I'm over six-foot and this thing's a couple feet above my head I found like this 15-foot tall blueberry bush I'm standing on the ground of a look oh how large it is Wow huge here some berries sure about my bucket back here I had my son strapped to my chest birds are tweeting at me see this big one to feel bigger the berries all right all that big they don't seem like they're ready maybe the birds have been having having a field day with this one here I'm kind of in a place where you can't walk through well you know I bet you people let you people came back here and got this one because there are some grounds matted down some yeah these are so good can't really reach them all the large ones maybe a bear give up there fall through here this is great environment for snakes hi where the Bears come through not ready some of them are very small over here on the left side they're much much larger berries you could see that plant from back here it's a monster it's all the way around I bet you on the back side of it it's covered and this one here there's a path but I'll send my son back to get this one here I could see some heavy berries on that bush so there's a path but I bet you that the Bears path through here and this is a bog so could be some snakes wow that guy is loaded I got to get to that bush and I just wanted you guys to see this right here ton of them there's loaded and pretty much happened by the handful yeah they're much larger over here must be good soil on this side drop my bucket lose everything I've got look down here this bush is just loaded me how about you yeah that's how it is that's how it is hopefully I don't drop my bucket [Music] maybe hey this one it's a monster these are like 15 feet tall you could see the berries on beautiful this one is so huge I'm over 6 feet tall so these are monster bushes I'm looking way up you can't even see the bottom oh just stumbled upon this monster here I wanted to share it with you guys it's just unbelievable it's a little bit harder to get get to when some of the other bushes around here because there's a trail and it looks like not just this one but another one right there and you could tell by the way the ground is all matted down around us but there's a big bear I think comes over through here and lumbers around and tramples down the grass so real big score here and see how big they are this very big berries almost door sized very good for a while mmm it tastes good too Wow here's another one simply loaded down this is unbelievable I don't know if I've ever seen it like this I think it's just because people come to get blueberries out here it's harder to get to a little bit but if you look for the laid down and matted down grass the animals will tell you where the best bushes are so you know because they live off off this they're fattening up for the winter and they'll let you know I'll let you know where to go it looks like it's a big game trail back here coming out here too to get some food", "6oMigYhlBYI": "ten berries you've never heard of number ten salmon berry the salmon berry yes an awful name for berry is a raspberry looking berry with a lighter color this berry starts off yellow and turns a light red when it becomes ripe they taste like a mix of a mild raspberry and a blackberry these berries require a constant water source to grow with adequate heat for this reason they'll usually be found on the side of rivers and creeks they are a rich source of vitamin C and K and are high in manganese the salmon berries not ideal for eating but better for making it to jams juice and wine most berry bushes have multiple uses with the salmon berry the bark and leaves of the bush can be used to treat burns the name comes from an old native tradition of putting one of the berries in every Salmons mouth that was caught for good luck number nine crowberry The Crow berry or otherwise known as black crow berry or Moss berry is a round purplish berry that has a very acidic bitter taste to it they can be consumed raw but rarely are the cruel berry is grown in Arctic and subarctic regions of the world and have become a staple food for Inuit Sami and to nine of people who inhabit the Arctic they're usually used in jams jellies ice cream wine and juice and also have been used in cosmetics the crow berry is high in vitamin C k manganese and copper number eight pine berry this white looking strawberry has a reputation for tasting and/or smelling like pineapple plus strawberries this is debatable but there is a tropical element to the berry which would give that impression the flavor is more of a tart tropical tasting berry with a muted flavor they are native to Chile and are available in early summer if you can find them the primary can be eaten fresh or served with desserts like ice cream cake and even mixed in drinks they are a partially self pollinating plant that are high in antioxidants vitamin A and boost the immune system unless you live in Chile they're very hard to find so if you do find them they're gonna be very expensive number 7 Hawthorn these bright red berries are grown on a thorny Bush that has insanely sharp needles the red berries get darker as the season goes on to indicate its ripeness the young leaves of the bush can be eaten and the old leaves can be used to make a tea the berry itself tastes a mixture of sweet and tart just make sure to spit out the large cherry like seed as they contain cyanide the Hawthorne berry has powerful healing effects to the heart including reducing blood pressure and increased circulation Hawthorne is dropped into the superfood category so typically if you see them being used it's in some magic potion to help you lose weight or feel better don't be fooled by these products but the Hawthorne berry is very good for the heart number six gin berry or orange berry these semi transparent pinkish berries grow in large clusters the berry is edible but the very large seed isn't they grow in warm climates and can't endure frost many aspects are very similar to the blueberries such as they grow in a bush or short tree the berry size that can be grown in a planter and they don't grow indoors very well the gin berry is typically eaten raw or juiced number five bear bury the bear bear is a small round red berry that grows on a small ground level bush these small berries have a thick skin and are very granular they taste not much like of anything in our melee and have a slight sour and bitter notes to their flavor they're most commonly used in porridge and oatmeal and not so much eaten raw bear berries grow in the Arctic and Alpine regions of the world caution should be taken when consuming them though they may cause nausea and constipation if too many are consumed if you consume them for a long period of time they may cause stomach and liver problems as well which is why it's recommended that children and pregnant women avoid eating them all together number four fairy bell berries these are looking berries are bright red and grow in the shape of bells hence the name fairy bells not only do they look unusual they grow out of large leaves and clusters which is bizarre in itself the fruit itself doesn't have any real markings or seeds on the outside like other berries just too smooth yet fuzzy red exterior they don't have all that much taste of them just a bland flavor with minor sweetness that comes through the fairy Bell berries grow in moist forested areas that range from Arizona United States all the way up to British Columbia Canada number three fall Solomon seal this edible berry has a mottled color which transitions from green to dark red as it ripens he grows in large clusters like grapes and has the taste of molasses mixed with the tart skin of a Concord grape these berries as well as the rest of the plant have been used to treat a plethora of medical problems by numerous native tribes all over North America the root is edible and cooked like a sweet potato the young shoots are boiled and tastes like asparagus the fall Solomon seal is high in vitamin see so if anything you can ward off scurvy with these little berries number two Solomon seal a completely different plant that just looks similar to its false counterpart yields berries that are dark purple both plants developed white flowers but instead of a large plume of tiny flowers the Solomon seal has flowers that hang in a row from the stalk these flowers will develop into green berries that will eventually turn purple when ripe the ripe berries taste just like molasses just as the false ones do but have a delicate sweetness to them with that said the berries are actually poisonous and may cause vomiting and nausea this is the major difference between the Solomon plants the root and young shoots are perfectly edible on the Solomon seal as well number one kusa dogwood buries the kusa dogwood is a tree that gives life to the kusa dogwood berry a round oddly shaped berry that has appearance of a soccer ball the inside is soft and creamy with the taste of papaya but the skin has a slight bitter taste to it for this reason people often bite the fruit and suckle the pulp and spit out the skin the berry is native to China Korea and Japan and is eaten raw or made into wine each fruit has two to three raisin like seeds on the inside that need to be spit out this can be a deterrent for some people to consume them along with a weird rough outer casing texture the flavor of the fruit can vary quite a bit from tree to tree so if you have the pleasure of trying these sample from multiple trees to find the best berries you guys are interested in finding any of these berries where he lived check out the

Melissa and we are out at Hoffman farms you guys grow blueberries don't you so first of all before we get going on blueberries themselves tell me a little bit about this this beautiful farm absolutely well our farm is 104 acres here on this property we farm a total of 140 acres of blueberries in this this area my parents came here from the Beaver Creek Molalla area in the late 70s and they've been farming here ever since what do you think about is the amount of different varieties you grow here um well I can list them for you I didn't know how many my head but we have um let's count dukes Brigitta x' Liberties legacies Draper's Elliots and aurorus we have eight different varieties growing here on our farm now I have to ask a question on pollination throughout my career in the horticultural industry I have personally been told and told many people know you you have to have two plants and if you you have to have them from the early mid or late cycle I'm glad you mentioned that because it's actually it's a very common misconception I have to have two plants I have to have two blueberries so that they pollinate one another correct and the answer is no blueberries are self pollinating all you need is bees yeah for them to pollinate however we do advise gardeners to plant more than one variety simply to extend their growing season we reached an early plant a minute and planted late and you'll have blueberries all summer long what would the home gardener be expecting when they knew they got their plants they're ready to grow blueberries what would they do well a lot of times we tell people that you can treat your blueberry plants kind of like you treat your rhododendrons really yeah they like the same type of soil that they've already that the roadies like they like um a lot of water but good drainage but what they don't want wet wet roots and then as they grow pruning is going to be a really important part of the process and what do you suggest on that we on our farm we prune in the spring we prune we try to prune not more than about 30 percent of the plant okay and it's important to know that your new wood that you're growing this current year is going to be the wood that fruits the cut in the coming growing season okay so when you're pruning you don't want to prune off all of that new wood all of the new growth like you would maybe a rosebush if it's kind of going wild you want your you know your pruning that back you don't want to do that to your blueberry plant because you're going to not have as many berries yeah the next year some of us how is it then that people would know that a blueberry is ripe ready to pick that's a great question so you're gonna want to look for a cluster that has multiple blueberries if you have one berry here and one berry there and the rest are still a little light purple or reddish color you're gonna want to let it ripen for another day because or another two days because the more sunlight the longer it stays on the plant the sweeter the berry is going to be when you pick it and now I'll show you where the berry meets the stem here that's going to be the very final place to get blue all over and if you've still got some green around the base of that stem you want to leave it on the bush a little bit longer and let it sweeten a little bit more or you're gonna be eating very sour blueberries and if that's what you're going for that's when to pick them but if you want sweeter more delicious Oregon berries you want to let them ripen until they're a full blue color so now back to this poster this is the Oregon berry festival it's coming up Friday the 18th and Saturday the 19th and you've been there before and you're part of the whole berry industry so tell us what we can

and frozen fruit so let's jump right into it I'm gonna start with a strawberry fruit roll-up which I made from fresh fruit the beauty of homemade fruit roll-ups is that you can use any fruit or fruit combination you like I have tried berries mangoes peaches apples and they all work beautifully [Music] next I'm adding a splash of lemon juice and some maple syrup the lemon juice isn't really important with dark-colored fruit but with light colored fruit like mangos or peaches I find that the lemon juice deaths keep the colors bright so I always add it in blend all the ingredients on high and then pour the mixture onto a silicone mat if you're going to be drying these food roll-ups in the oven or a dehydrator sheet if you're going to be using a dehydrator I tried making the fruit roll-ups with parchment paper and it works but the finished roll-ups just don't look so pretty since the fruit puree is quite runny the parchment paper absorbs some of the liquid and crinkles underneath making the fruit roll-ups crinkly as well a silicone mat on the other hand holds its shape perfectly [Music] spread the fruit puree as evenly as possible into a quarter to eight of an inch thick layer and then dehydrate it for six to eight hours until the fruit roll-ups are dry and no longer tacky [Music] I used a knife to cut the strawberry roll-ups into strips but I find that scissors work even better and that's it for the Strawberry roll-ups [Music] [Music] now on to the next ones blueberry roll-ups for these roll-ups I used frozen food just to show you that it works exactly the same then again I added a splash of lemon juice and maple syrup I forgot to mention in the beginning that if your fruit is sweet enough you don't even have to use a sweetener sometimes when my fruit is sweet I just add some vanilla extract or different extracts to make the flavor pop a little bit [Music] again blend the blueberries on high until you have a pourable smooth texture it does take a little bit more time to blend frozen fruit but if you have a high speed blender it doesn't take longer than a few minutes and yes you can use a food processor to do this as well pour the mixture onto a silicon mat and either dehydrated at 150 degrees Fahrenheit or bake it in the oven at the lowest temperature possible which will probably be around 150 degrees Fahrenheit the temperature isn't all that important what's more important is how you spread the mixture keep in mind that the edges always cook faster than the center so try to spread the fruit very thicker on the edges if the edges look like they're getting crispy you can cut them off later or brush them with a little bit of water or juice during the baking process to rehydrate them [Music] [Music] you can test if the fruit roll-ups are done by touching the center it shouldn't stick to your fingers or indent when you touch it [Music] I feel like we should have Katie my three-year-old daughter here because these food roll-ups are obviously a kid snack and I remember when I was a kid I used to love these especially the strawberry flavor and I still like them and now my daughter loves them so I make them for her and as you can see in the video you can make these frozen food from fresh food you can choose whatever fruit do you like I just like berry flavor so that's why I went with berries which ones did she like as a kid son Wright made fruit to go I think they were called a little package individual packages for everyone that was like I don't know like that long probably I think they still sold them nope I think so I don't know I haven't checked in a long time I think they do um but these are better because they're not sticky here they're like really dry so like you don't don't worry about little kids running around your house yeah sticky fingers all over the walls and all that door handles a lot of stuff so there look that's a plus they taste the same like there's not really any difference maybe these unripe ones they seem to have like more of that liquidy sugar all over them that's making them sticky so yeah they might have a little bit more like tangy sugar flavor these ones taste better than though it tastes more like berries and the consistency like the texture these ones are much thinner I don't know if it's just a strawberry or the berry that you use but the blueberry ones are thicker that they're closer resembling like the actual fruit to go through the other stuff yeah I like the blueberry flavor better to not just because of the texture but they're sweeter and I think it's just because blueberries are naturally sweeter so the strawberry ones are more tangy whereas the blueberry roll-ups are more sweet so you hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give me thumbs up

episode of ethan and mel do cocktails my name is ethan i'm the co-host of the drunken cheryl podcast and i'm mel i'm his wife tamer of zuklitz lover of kitties all that stuff so last week we did a mudslide or a white russian she's drinking already been drinking mom life hashtag quarantine it's really cold outside and the zuplets are going crazy wine please so wine yes oh my gosh all right so last week we did a mudslide or a white russian the kind of the line kind of blurs between the two this week we're going to do something different we're going to do a blueberry gin sour and this is going to be i think the first shaken drink that we've done so far we did a stir drink first then we did a dumped drink second and this one is going to be shaken and we've got our shakers and our tools so shall we get started yes please all right so we're going to do two versions of this cocktail they're very simple they're very similar and i'll tell you what we're doing as we go so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to start out with some blueberries these are rinsed already just as a disclaimer we did clean these all right so we're putting about a decent handful in there well your size handful yeah my size handful and we're really not putting too much thought the recipe calls for half a cup but frankly i just dump a good sized handful in there next we need a ounce and a half of gin also known as the best gin ever yeah in our family we typically call this gin ryan because of course it's pitched by ryan reynolds and we both kind of have a crush on him all right next we need an ounce of lemon juice you can use fresh lemon juice it would probably make it taste better but i don't have a lemon juicer and then we're going with half an ounce of simple syrup this is our own homemade version or i should say ethan's homemade virgin yes because i don't have the patience for that and this is a two to one simple syrup so it's two cups of sugar with one cup of water it's just a little bit sweeter a little denser the next thing we have to do is we have to muddle our blueberries so we're just going to use this muddler here from barfly and we're going to squish our blueberries until they're all nice and smooshy and release all their juice and everything like that this is going to be kind of a pink drink we're going to add some ice to our tin so i'm going to go with um one big cube and then i'm going to smash the second cube if i can we're going to see how this i need a bigger spoon all right i'm back and i have a bigger spoon now when all those fails get a bigger spoon so and hope that you don't get it all over the table oh we're going to get it all over the table one more there we go okay so now we're going to add our stuff to our ice we're going to seal that and we're going to shake okay that's enough now we're going to give it a nice double strain into a coupe glass smells amazing oh i bet it does very slow strain and we're gonna garnish with a couple more blueberries you can garnish however you want with a toothpick and blueberries but we just dump them in yeah cause it's a nice little taste at the end all right so that is the basic blueberry gin sour this is the basic cocktail but another thing that makes sours in general way better is if you put a little bit of egg white in them because what that does it makes them creamier and sort of nice foam and stuff like that so we're going to very carefully add just the egg white we want to make sure we cut the yolk out of there the first thing we need to do is a dry shake which means we're going to shake without ice [Music] all right so we've shaken that up we've started the process of getting that nice and foamy and emulsified now we're going to add some ice and some more crushed ice a lot better probably because it's melted a little bit yeah right or i've just gotten better yes we're gonna shake it for 10-15 seconds and now we're gonna wrestle apart our tins and we're gonna give this a nice double string into our coop glass that looks really creamy creamy that's what she said and finally as before we'll garnish this one with a couple blueberries you know what comes next do we get to taste it the best part of the episode we get to taste all right so which one do you want to try i will do the classic blueberry whiskey sour no no gin sour you get to try both of them so yeah and we know why don't you start with that one okay ready all right cheers cheers and here comes the added benefit of being married switch switch and we don't have to quarantine no ooh i like that one better the taste is very similar um it's sweet you can keep drinking it yeah it's sweet it's sweet the the sort of the tangy lemon goes really nicely against the sweet um the taste is pretty similar for both of them but that one just seems a little bit more satisfying to drink it's just a lot creamier and aviation just makes it a whole lot better we prefer aviation because it doesn't have that weird i don't know piney taste i'm more of the type that just prefers not drinking a tree so we would say that she's a little bit more on the botanical side than the juniper side yes we like aviation yes ryan please sponsor us that would be lovely anyway so this is the blueberry gin sour it's a fantastic drink it's easy to make it incorporates some fresh fruit into your diet so it's healthy for you even it's healthy for you even because it's technically a fruit yes all right and melissa likes it if you're interested you can add an egg white if you're not interested you can drink it regular and it's a good boat still pretty good well hey that's kind of our show so if you're interested in cats stick around for the blooper reel consider heading over to the drunken trail podcast

hundred and fifty six acres we run about four predominant varieties but there's really probably ten varieties on the farm my grandfather and father planted their first blueberries in like 1940 woolens and then he went to World War two my dad he stayed over there two years in the Pacific and he came back and they picked their first crop I think in 43 when I came back to the farm I think we had maybe 50 acres of blueberries so since then we've gone to six hundred and twenty or thirty something wearing their crops been ok if hadn't been great we have with some of effects we're seeing effects from Hurricane Florence little few pollination issues with certain varieties but you know is if the weather has been really good for harvest so that's helped a lot it goes all over I mean you know we ship some to Canada our fruit goes to Canada goes up in the Northeast but now since you know gee Jersey starting we'll push more towards the southeast and that way but I mean you know we we go pretty much everywhere average year we'll do about three and a half to four million pounds of use sometimes you know five but most of the time we're about three and a half million before meeting if we have a really good crop will we'll be able to package about twenty thousand boxes a day normally this normally this year we're running the average in about ten thousand a day the part we use it for is field heat removal and you can bring your fruit in it can be they can be pulping like ninety degrees and you can bring it in and put it under those tarps and turn those fans on and you create that static pressure and you can bring them to 60 degrees in about an hour hour and 20 minutes so you can just drop the heat right out of and then that that means days in the grocery store you know the forest shelf life and the fruit and then once they leave our packing half they go to our shipping facility and they're brought their took from 60 down to 34 using the same forced air cooling pressing and that's where they're shipped that 34 degrees today we're kind of pushing over the pink a little bit so we probably got about three to four hundred workers out here today harvest these fruits and in the packet including the packing out I mean we're doing we're doing a thing called worker welfare but you know the stores want us to make sure our workers are being treated and treated good and they really are we take care of our people but yeah we're competing against product gotta Mexico we're up here they're making fifteen eighteen dollars I were down there they're making a dollar on it has this challenge I love to grow the crop I don't I don't know I we all read all the bureaucracy that goes with it nowadays you know we did with the food safety stuff which is a lot of good point to that and you know growing the crop is fun you know there really is I mean we enjoy doing [Music] you", "VCUSac8dIFI": "hello everyone June 16th saturday 8:30 in the morning it's already in the mid 70s and the humidity has to be about the same I'm gonna try while it's this early to get out here and get some of these blueberries picked you can get an idea here of how many we have coming these blueberries right now are about 5 feet tall and I think they're four years old we got them at a master gardeners cell several years ago but the numbers of blueberries are just mind-boggling they come off of this these bushes they're staggered out some to lower down you go in the 1 2 3 4 plants the earlier they ripen so up in here we have some bitter ripe and then when you get down to the bottom you have a whole lot more that are ripe as you can see that the good news is is that the netting has done a great job of keeping the birds off the bad news is is that the netting is done a really good job of keeping us out the netting gets all in the plant you know so it's it's kind of a challenge to pull the netting back and of course the other thing that happens is the grass just grows out of control so I'm gonna try and get the netting pull back lift it up on the top up here on the on the rails enough that we can pick the blueberries and get in with a mower and most some of this stuff down to get it back under control before it becomes a playground for the snakes so rather than show you the comedy of me getting the netting done which will be slow and tedious we'll come back when we start doing some picking I put the netting up as I had three 14-foot links so it was actually quite amazing I managed to just by moving three boards get one section of it up so we're going to be able to pick these blueberries pretty good wanted to show these things to you now what you got a see we're gonna size it a blueberry look at the size of these blueberries and they are so sweet and as you look I mean they're hanging like grapes everywhere so I'm lucky I got a birdbath right here so I put a little piece of wood across it and put my bowl there so I can use two hands picking and we're gonna get started on this here very shortly just gonna start right here up close so I don't knock any good ones off and work my way in Chris picked is already picked probably close to a gallon I'm guessing there's that much here again so while the excessive rain has raised havoc with the tomatoes it has truly made the blueberries ecstatic [Music] Wow I'm just going to put this under here I don't let the blueberries fall roll them off with my fingers it's not a bad way to pick them there's this mini drop so many on the ground sharing what the birds will definitely happen yes I believe in sherry I love the birds they eat the bugs but problem is the birds aren't real big on sharing themselves I think just too soon keep everything just for them between the birds and the squirrels the netting has actually worked this year I'm really surprised as you can see we're already well on our way to a nice picking I'm going to turn this off and you know watching me pick gets kind of boring we'll be back when I've gotten at least done with his one Bush alright I finished picking there's still lots of blueberries onin but I finished picking the first bush and once you see what I've gotten I know it doesn't always like no relevance to what you're looking at let's see if we can pour it from one to another without making too big a mess this should give you an idea of how many blueberries we have yeah I mean this container I don't know probably a gallon the half container this is probably too close so you can get an idea how many blueberries we have just always I get agree but there again we're still the size of these things and they are so sweet then of course we still have two more bushes that haven't started wiping yet nope except for a few and that little guy there needs to come come to Papa yes they're gonna be really really big nice big blueberries also so one two three four little blueberry bushes about five feet tall and we'll get remember we've already picked like close to this much once before and we still have two bushes that haven't even kicked in yet so this is this is just one bush here blueberries are a pretty good productive crop toss some of the red ones out [Music] well you might want to think about having them you grow blueberries further south we had them in Jacksonville Florida and know you can you know they go all the way up into Canada so it's hard to not be able to say you can't grow blueberries but boy am I looking forward to getting in there with a mower that grass is really getting high hey everyone here's all the blueberries we picked and as you can see it is a mountain of blueberries I don't know what we're gonna do it although freeze obviously a bunch and of course you always want to know do the blueberries taste good hey boo let's see what Boogle thinks and I get your greasy Seal of Approval there booboo here yeah boo who says they're nice and sweet we thought they're nice and sweet and somehow or other I managed to get the netting back up and over them so we may be able to pick these still again blueberries there what's on the menu", "GiOo95A8jE8": "hi everyone I'm Bridget Davis the Internet shift just want to show you

fruit and we're going to have a lovely shot of blueberry juice which is going to kickstart our brain it's going to help us and all sorts of wonderful ways it's going to protect us from strokes it's going to improve our memory and also our learning ability it's also going to increase our motor skills these wonderful things that blueberries can do for your brain or you got to do something to turn your juicer on it's not feeding it through and out the other end what you're going to get is it wonderful brain fuel that would be talking about so daily consumptions of blueberries can even help you prevent type 2 diabetes this really is a superfood lip Lippert what a wonderful superfood blueberries really is so all my blueberries are in there I'm just also going to add just a little bit of filtered water just so I can get all that lovely blueberry juice out of my slow juicing yeah just a little bit you guys coming out like fast there you have it and literally this is the way I like to kick start my day so a little glass we're going to turn this baby off just going to swap that around a juice there pour it into my glass you can actually probably get two shots out of this so one for you and one for pissing you really like and there you go start your day the blue juice way thanks for watching guys between Gabriel soon take", "AIxCMZwp-WE": "*music*", "E4Ep1atfFlg": "This little tablet is made of a small red\nfruit called the miracle fruit, a shrubby plant native to West Africa. The fruit itself doesn\u2019t taste like much\n-- it\u2019s got low sugar content and a slight tang kind, of like a mildly sweet cranberry\n-- but people don\u2019t eat it for its taste. They eat it because of how it makes other\nthings taste. See, miracle fruit contains a unique protein\ncalled miraculin that does something really weird to your taste buds when you eat it:\nit makes sour stuff taste super sweet. I\u2019m talking like, turning vinegar into syrup\nand Tabasco sauce into donut glaze. Since miracle fruit isn\u2019t always easy to\nfind, has a very short shelf life, and miraculin breaks down when it\u2019s heated, people tend\npass the fun along by freeze-drying the pulp and mashing it into powder or pills like the\nones I happened to have right here... Fun times! So what the heck just happened to my tongue? Okay, for starters, your tongue is covered\nin lingual papillae, otherwise known as taste buds. They\u2019re receptors that translate food chemicals\ninto electrical signals that tell the brain what it\u2019s tasting. Each taste bud contains a bunch of taste cells\nwith proteins that bind to the molecules in food, which is how we detect specific flavors\nlike sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. That is, unless you\u2019re eating miracle fruit. Because when you chomp a berry or suck a tablet,\nthat miraculin binds to specific parts of your sweetness receptors.. Under totally neutral conditions, miraculin\nactually blocks these receptors, preventing them from picking up sweet flavors in food,\nwhich is one reason the fruit itself doesn\u2019t taste like much. But under acidic conditions it does the opposite\n-- it jacks up your sweet receptors, making them extra /extra/ sensitive. So if you, say, take a bite of lemon or chug\nsome pickle juice, those acids actually cause the miraculin to change its molecular shape,\nincreasing the intensity of its binding power, and changing the shape of those sweet receptors\n-- making them go haywire. Suddenly all your brain is hearing from your\ntongue is, that is SWEEEET! Just how sweet, you ask? Well, artificial sweeteners bind to your taste\nreceptors more aggressively than natural sugars, which is why most of the powder in the little\npackets isn\u2019t actually the sweet stuff. And one study showed that acid-activated miraculin\nbinds about a million times more strongly than aspartame -- an artificial sweetener\n-- and nearly 100 million times more intensely than sugar. And if a stronger bond means a sweeter taste,\nyou can see how miraculin would make orange juice taste like maple syrup.

than i've ever done on my channel before and that's i'm going to cook a blueberry cobbler for you now this cobbler was a recipe that my grandmother used i called her granny that's why she was she was our granny and every sunday she had this of some sort of this recipe and i'll tell you a little bit more about that in a minute but she did some version of this recipe with any kind of fruit you want to use for sunday dinner after after church so i'm going to show y'all how to make it because it's so simple and it is a huge hit even for people who think they don't like cobblers i this thing let me tell you one one christmas with all the family gatherings you know we go to this family that family friends all this i think i made 12 of these total during like two three weeks there because everybody was like you're gonna make your blueberry cobbler aren't you and you can't just make one one of these generous size portions eight slices but some people we here in the south like more than a generous size portion i'm going to tell you we like more like a quarter of the five sometimes so you need to make more than one if you're going to a large gathering now if you just got a small family you're just making it for dinner you want to do you but if you're taking it somewhere you're gonna you're gonna want to make more than one of these and maybe make a variety make a blueberry blackberry apple whatever you want to do so anyhow we're going to get started on here in just a minute i get my oven started and and then i'll show you all the ingredients and i'll also link down below the full recipe and like i say it's super super simple you could even teach your kids to do this maybe not putting it in the oven and stuff but everything else a kid could do this part and with that being said if you're not already subscribed to me i would love for you to join my youtube family and hit the notification bell you'll be notified each time i upload and i am on instagram i'm on facebook page or facebook and on pinterest all as crape myrtle row and i would love for you to come over there and join me in those platforms also i do post more on instagram and now that i've started i just started my facebook page i think two weeks ago or something like that it's not been very long at all and i do try to correlate what i put on instagram with facebook because i know not everyone has both platforms but usually they have one or the other um so come over there draw me say hi let me know that you you know you come from youtube or something and let's just get started okay the next steps we're gonna do is or i'm gonna let you know the things you're gonna need you're gonna need one cup of sugar one cup of flour one stick of butter and one cup of milk and then what we're gonna the first thing we'll do i mean this is a very simple oh and of course your blueberries these were frozen and this is roughly um i'm gonna say two and a quarter cups that just happens to be what i had left and i froze in the refrigerator and they're they're still frozen i just took some hot water and kind of run over them just to soften them up just a little bit and drain them a little bit more but you can use fresh blueberries or any fruit you want to use you can use can you can use whatever i've never used can blueberries for this i've used canned peaches and canned apples but i've never used the blueberries because this is a this is a pie that you grow cobbler rather that you can use any fruit you like i have made the biggest ones are the blueberry i make tons of those i've made blackberry strawberry pineapple um what else have i done with it i think those are like i said peach i've done apple but blueberry seems to be the one that gets the most and these are not like your typical pies but it's mostly fruit these are the type of cobblers that it's mostly like almost like a biscuit type thing because you put your once i get all this mixed i put it in i dropped my blueberries on top and the dough kind of just rises around so it's oh yeah kind of like a biscuit the best way i can describe it and it was my grandmother's recipe so this is what we're gonna do first i take my stick of butter and i grease my pan really good with that butter now i mean you don't have to do this you could spray it with you know like cooking spray or whatever you wanted to do but i mean i've already got the butter here and this works great and this is the way my grandmother taught me to do it so that's why i'm gonna do it and every sunday she used to cook dinner after church for everyone you know she'd cook it before church have it ready and always had a dessert of some sort now the rest of this butter i'm gonna take and melt in the microwave roughly 45 seconds per minute to get it going and while that's melting i'm going to measure my cup of sugar and flour and unlike most bacon i mean i just kind of and my hands are clean y'all i wash them beforehand just kind of roughly get the cup of flour and then a cup of sugar i can get my scoop down in here i'm gonna leave the recipe link below because okay those those you will need another quarter cup of sugar to put on top and that's what makes it like a crispy crust let me get this out check it out right quick it might be just a little bit longer probably the one minute would have been better [Music] this is not a step you have to do but i like to take my whisk and go ahead and incorporate together just take my whisk and kind of do that to get any lumps or anything out then i take my one cup of milk and i pour that in i go ahead and give that a stir and this you know this is not a thick batter this is a very loose even really looser than like pancake batteries it's see it's like very runny and i just try to get all my lumps out that i can i mean if you is not going to matter but i just try to get that kind of stirred around and now let me grab the melted butter and i'm just gonna gradually pour it in as i'm stirring because i don't want you know this hot butter and that milk to have a problem stir it as i do that get it all in there this is such a simple recipe guys and i think that's why my my grandmother chose to make this pretty much every sunday of some variation she made this pie as our dessert so now i'm just going to pour it into the pie pan here and if this is something you're going to make to take to family gatherings that you know maybe there's people just gonna want to take some home whatever you want to leave it you don't want to clean up this dish just use the disposable ones that's really easy to they work just just as fine in that so now i've got these blueberries that i'm going to use and i just take and i just start dropping them around in here and however many you want to put it's up to you like i said this i just had a bag full of them from back in the summer that i had put in the freezer and had them in the bag and it just measured out to be like two and a quarter cups i normally would put around two cups but you know this and i have a little extra ones in it because just those views not worth trying to put up for anything else then again i may stop here i mean it's your choice we like a lot of blueberries so i put a lot of blueberries in try to find every little spot that looks like it doesn't have something in it and drop it in there and like i said this comes out to be more of a biscuit like dough and i think i am going to stop that's probably at the two two cup marking how so i'll just eat the rest of them when they fall out now here's the trick that makes this great i mean it'll be great like this this is the way my grandmother did it she didn't add this extra step but i read in a pioneer woman cookbook and she does almost the identical type of pie but she takes this quarter cup of sugar and i know y'all gonna think it's crazy it looks like you're drowning it and you just start lightly sprinkling it all over covering this pie or this cobbler i should say and i know i got a few little lumps in the sugar not gonna matter it all melts down this ends up melting and creating like a caramelized crust almost on here and it is so good um like i said it's going to look like you're drowning it so now the next step is i'm going to put it in the oven like we said it's a 350 oven the timer went off while i was off camera so to let me know it's preheated i'm going to set my oven at 50 minutes now you may want to start checking yours at 30 minutes and see and it's done when you see the top getting brown my oven however i have learned 50 minutes is what it takes with so when this gets done i'll come back and show you what it looks like okay i just got it out of the oven and this is how it looks this is where i told you how that sugar coating almost makes a caramelized crust on the top i'm gonna let this cool probably about 30 minutes or so before i cut into it otherwise it just makes a mess but you you can see the blueberry stuff's still bubbling down in there so we'll be back in just a minute i got me a piece out and as you can see this is not a pie that stays together as a solid piece it it kind of falls apart hence it's a cobbler but i mean it just it looks so good and i can't wait to take a bite but i hope you all enjoyed this video and like i said if you make one and you're on instagram or something take a picture tag me in it or mention it to me or something and i hope you all enjoyed it bye", "2XTSWj6LXQQ": "[Music] [Music] I'm to grow at home we were out here and we were berry picking we were foraging for wild blueberries today and Huckleberry's I found a nice heavy production the thing I love about wild blueberries though is the fact that they are non-gmo they're non sprayed no pesticides so far looks like we're doing not that bad this is a bug a natural resource near us and we can come through and find tons of berries some things you want to look for and we talked about it and our other foraging wild edibles video would be snakes you're going to watch out for snakes it was particularly wet and rainy today so it's actually kept some of the bugs down but this is a bog meaning that there's a lot of amphibians a lot of creatures a lot of things that cause snakes to come in here and there's a lot of poisonous snakes happen to be where we are there happens to be rattlesnakes water moccasins so you want to avoid all of those they love berries because rodents love berry bushes so as you can see this one's loaded down now we do have a couple different bushes out here some of them you come across will be huckleberries there'll be a smaller berry just too sweet same plant family some of these as you can see these ones our blueberries are very actually kind of large goodness they're so good you'll never find anything sweeter than if you get out of your house go find yourself a state park somewhere find where blueberries are located and go berry hunting because if you've had berries from the store and you know what else is like that the blackberries if you've had blueberries from the store they do not compare at all with wild blueberries but the berries that you get out here in the wild they just have so much natural sugar they're so sweet and of course they're all organic that's the best part about all of it you really can't replicate this you really can't replicate this in this beauty you come out here these are better than my blueberry bushes I got in my yard I have seen some impressive bushes before some older bushes but to tell you the truth you can't really reproduce this because there's so many plants so many berries out here and I really we're out here the whole family and I really encourage you guys to get out there and enjoy this yourselves this summer you can't buy this experience you can't really buy berries of this quality and if you did they would probably be very very expensive I bet you someone somewhere will pay top dollar for some real organic wild blueberries like this and they're great for cooking they're very very sweet the ones in the store have like a papery fibrous texture along with the blackberries which taste like water from the store and so it's something you got to get out and experience for yourself I hope that if for you guys that are out there and you're listening to this that you live in a place where you can do this so get out there and we've got so much work to do gotta get the rest of these berries guys I wanted to share this great find all the great ones are just out of reach see I'm off the bog over here so it's pretty sloppy but these are just huge berries I've actually never seen wild blueberries this large before so that's why I wanted you guys to see these and if you just look at the size they're almost as thick as my finger I tell you the truth so they're pretty big for wild berries this is really the find of the century I found out here this thing is loaded down heavy under there so it's a little precarious position balancing like this so I'm gonna get busy so I found another really good find over here on the other side now the ones away from the path a lot of the people walking by a good view at some of these luscious big berries I'm shocked guys this has been a great year for berries now we did have early season as far as it being warm so maybe they got a head start and we're able to get a head but this is much larger we come out here every year same places and you know some years they perform better than others this has been a particularly wet year in this area so and you'd be surprised the ground where I'm standing whenever you apply weight like the weight of my body sink down about two to three inches so there's a big difference in the atmosphere and the conditions the growing conditions this year but yet you see that they grow great if you try to grow blueberries at home and you have them soaked in water have the roots growing in water then you just really don't see production like this example I'll show you exactly what I'm talking about you see him you see him they love berry bushes and you see this guy over here he's just waiting for a bird to come through I don't know he's kind of small he's real small he's a tiny guy but his neck is curled like that he's probably not gonna do much damage but you could see what I mean the snakes they love to bury bushes and you see how he blends in perfectly with his surroundings you would have walked right up on him now this yep and you see the berries right underneath where he is yeah but still you got to keep your eyes out when you're coming berry picking and yeah certainly so wanted to share a little special friend with you how cool",

to garden calm in today's episode we're going to be talking about how to plant and care for blueberries if you're not already subscribe to me at learn how to garden there's a link below this film if you wouldn't put your email address onto there it means every time we put up a new filming like you know it also means you get access to our written blog posts that don't appear anywhere other than on the website they also let you know what other activities were up to here at learn how to garden throughout this year blueberries are one of the fruits I get asked about most they're very popular at the moment there are super food they're really really high in antioxidants but people get real problems with them and that's because of the very sort of unique conditions that blueberries like to grow in now this is what a blueberry bush is like to look like when you first purchase it it's going to be grown in a pot more than likely and it's going to have none of its leaves there are one or two varieties that are semi evergreen but you're more than likely going to have one without leaves and the first thing you have to remember is that this needs an acidic soil that means it needs a soil that has a pH between about 4.5 to 5.5 which is much lower than most of the other fruit that we grow if you can grow camellias or rhododendrons really really well in your garden then blueberries will love it but for the majority of people they can't prove a problem and it normally comes down to the pH of their soil so for a lot of people what I suggest is that the best way to grow these is actually in a container or a pot and what you're going to need is a decent pot this particular plant here is going to grow to about five feet tall so it's quite a big plant you could grow it in a 12 inch or 30 centimeter pot but what you really want is one like this a decent 50 centimeter pot so that this plant can get to its full potential and what we're going to do with this is the first thing you've got a single drain hole in here and you need to crock that now all cracking means is that you're going to cover that hole with some broken pot but what you don't then do is put a layer of drainage in it's a very old-fashioned thing you see it written in the majority of books but drainage all you're doing is reducing the amount of compost in here so it's very simple you take some broken pots just to cover the hole an i10 to grow plants that are staying in a pot for a long time in terracotta I think that they grow better I think that the temperature fluctuations are far less they get far less hot in the summer black pots can get very very overheated for the roots around the edge in the summer and we're going to need some ericaceous composter all that ericaceous means is an acid loving compost and if you live in the UK you're fortunate enough that you can get this this is a compost made using roux and Bracken and you can see it's ericaceous it's got ericaceous written on it and that's what you're looking for most ericaceous compost used to be based on peat but we're trying to use less peat now so I'm going to empty this compost first of all out onto my tray I've been asked quite often what these trays are and all they are a builder's trays that you can buy for mixing cement much much cheaper than a purpose made run for horticulture so get this compost and you could plant straight into this but if you have access to some really well rotted manure and when I say really well rotted you want manure that you can put into a sieve and will sieve through so you can see that coming out of the bottom and that will give us manure like this right friable compost so you want some well rotted manure or your alternative is again some well rotted leafmold and the reason we're adding this is that the leaf mold in the manure is absolutely full of natural micro Raizel organisms a natural bacteria and because this plant is going to be living in this pot for a long time the better the balance we can get of soil nutrients the healthier the plant will be so I now just need to mix this all together once it's all mixed just start to load your plump pot don't force it all down just let it sit nice and evenly in this pot another trick with blueberries when you water them only use rainwater a lot of us have tap water that's very alkaline and the blueberries don't like that so rainwater for your blueberries and once your blueberry starts to grow from the minute the birds appear you want to be watering it every couple of weeks and you're going to want to feed it once a month with a week feed again we need to look for a feed that says ericaceous feed you can get an area Keysha seaweed feed which is fantastic once you get roughly to within about four or five inches of the surface put your blueberry in still in its pot and keep taking your ericaceous mix and we go all the way round once we've gone all the way around gently firm down take the blueberry out invert it tap it and out it should come pop it into the hole looks perfect for it tap off to the same level as it was growing in the pot and water it in if you're going to grow in terra cotta pots like this go to the expense of buying one that's frost proof otherwise you'll find that if they freeze the water in the terra cotta expands and the pot cracks and the reason they're much more expensive is that they have to be fired twice in the kiln rather than once that's why they cost a lot more and that quite simply is how to plant a blueberry in a pot it would be exactly the same if you're doing it in the ground if you're at acidic soil now it will tell you everywhere that blueberries are self fertile and they are if we just had this one we would get a crop but if you have two different varieties you'll get more than double the crop off both of them because they will cross pollinate which is much much better they're fairly trouble-free as plants go I have very little trouble occasionally we get Korean fly but not very often the biggest problem with blueberries are birds birds will take the blueberries just before you're ready to eat them so you do need to net them once the berries are swelling you can get pink blueberries which sounds like a contradiction in terms and some people say that they are less susceptible to bird attack and I haven't grown the pink ones I tend to grow just the blue blueberries brilliant for juice brilliant to use in sorbets in the summer if you growing it in a pot even in the smallest garden it means you can have fruit and move it anywhere you want if you grow a 12 inch pot what you'll actually do because the roots are constrained you'll have a smaller plant the first couple of years you don't really need to prune it after that it's very much a case of removing about 1/3 of the old wood just to keep new wood generating new plants and new plants new wood generating and on that new wood you get more buds and more fruit so that's it planting blueberries it's to do with the pH of your soil if you don't know what the pH of your soil is invest in a pH testing kit needs to be acidic between 4.5 and 5.5 rainwater ericaceous feed it's all to do with the pH of the soil and the pH you're keeping it out if you can do that your blueberry will be trouble-free and really happy it's a lot for watching learn how to gun", "1V4vPsNFw0k": "This crumble bar recipe is easy and\nberry delicious! I'm Tess and today I got a great deal on blueberries and I'm\nmaking homemade blueberry crumble bars. A great snack or dessert that everyone\nwill love.       This morning I went to the farmers\nmarket and got a great deal on fresh blueberries. These blueberry crumble bars\nare real easy to make and make a nice bright refreshing snack. This is a great\nrecipe to make for parties and get-togethers. Most people love them! In my bowl I have three cups of all-purpose flour and I'm adding in one\ncup of sugar, one teaspoon of baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a half a\nteaspoon of cinnamon. Giving that a good mix to incorporate. Just a reminder that I will leave the\nrecipe and the list of ingredients for these blueberry crumble bars below this\nvideo. Also remember to like and subscribe if you enjoyed this video\nrecipe and click the bell to make sure you receive notification of all my\nfuture video recipes.   Now that everything is mixed well I'm\ngoing to incorporate some fat. You can use shortening or butter or a\ncombination of both and I'm using both. The shortening and butter should be at\nroom temperature and I'm using a pastry cutter to cut the fat into the flour. You\ncan also use a fork to do this. Continue cutting until you see pea-sized or\nsmaller crumbles. Something like this. Next, I have one large room temperature\negg that I will do the same thing and this will take a minute to incorporate.   Here I have four cups of fresh\nblueberries that I rinsed and drained. I'm adding a half a cup of sugar and\nfour teaspoons of cornstarch. Giving that a good gentle mix so all the blueberries\nare coated. The cornstarch will help hold the blueberries together and thicken the\nblueberry juices as they cook. For a little POP of brightness I'm adding in the\njuices of half a lemon. Again giving everything a gentle mix. I have my oven preheating to 375 degrees\nFahrenheit. I have a 9 by 13 pan that I greased and I also put in a parchment\nliner so the bars will be easier to lift out. I'm placing half of my flour crumb\nmixture on the bottom, spreading out and gently tamping down. This is going to\nmake a nice firm base for the blueberry crumble bars. Now the blueberries and\nleveling out. They are so beautiful!       The other half of the flour crumb mixture\nI'm sprinkling evenly over the top.       I like to add some\nsliced almonds on the top for a little crunch. This is going into a 375 degrees\nFahrenheit oven for 45 minutes or until golden brown on top.       The kitchen smells so good. I'm letting this completely cool before cutting. In the meantime, I'm making a simple\nicing to drizzle over the top. This is about a half a cup of powdered sugar or\nconfectioner sugar and a little orange juice. You could also use milk. Just\nputting in a teaspoon of the orange juice and giving it a stir. You just want\nto add a little at a time. And this is the consistency that you're looking for.   You can put on as much or as little of the icing that you like.     This recipe\nmakes 12 nice blueberry crumble bars. Of course I love the blueberries! The\ncrumble topping and sliced almonds add a nice crunch and texture and the simple\nicing gives it a pop of sweetness. This blueberry crumble bar recipe is easy and\ndelicious.

", "ClL1w6TUldk": "you hello my name is Nicholas Stodden I'm with Monrovia nursery we're at Rogers gardens Southern California's premier garden center today we are going to talk about planting blueberries just putting a few finishing touches here before we actually bring the blueberry on stage blueberries love to be in an acidic soil they're an acid loving plant so when you plant them make sure you buy the right soil Rogers Gardens have a great product for gardener bloom and it's good for blueberries camellias azaleas etc blueberries do nicely in the ground remember to remember soil when the product I just mentioned but they love to be in containers and I think that's really where they should be so you can use a terra cotta container we also have this fiber container I love this this is actually made out of wood pulp and it will last for five or six years in your garden doesn't it look beautifully natural okay so when you plant your blueberry fill the level up to about halfway in the container today we're going to plant a bountiful bloom this is a great blueberry for Southern California all blueberries are self pollinating so if you buy two together bountiful blue and sunshine blue you'll probably get about eight to ten percent for blueberries look at this girl absolutely loaded with fruit okay we position the plant nicely now I always recommend using a dr. art product this is called acid lovers so when you're putting the soil into the pot put a little bit of fertilizer as well good directions on the back of okay so here we go make sure that you don't plant the plug deeper than the soil level blueberries will work fine in a doubled shade position also in full Sun if you're on the coast we're going to beach Newport Beach Huntington Beach you can have them in full Sun and they'll do just fine okay now we're in position are nicely there that's a good happy plant we're in mid-april right now and you can see this particular plant is covered with fruit so you'll be able to harvest probably in the next two to three weeks blueberries like to be kept just a little on the moist side and if you have a patio there's no finer plant to have up there with you

[Music] blueberries provide a wide array of health benefits that's why we love them they are excellent sources of vitamin c potassium fiber and vitamin k blueberries are high in antioxidant which protect our body from free radicals and help our body prevent aging and fight different types of cancer for years we have been harvesting bountiful blueberries last summer we harvested approximately five gallons from our nine blueberry bushes four of them are more than ten years old and the rest is just about three to five years old some varieties that we have are the south moon which is the best tasting variety we have and we also have the sunshine blue variety which is actually really good all of them are planted in containers most of them are in half 55 gallon container drums we usually freeze them for future use and we also make delicious blueberry gems that we gift or share with our friends when it comes to planting blueberries it is essential to consider the soil ph blueberries love acid soil which is around 4.5 to 5.5 ph we use raised bed garden soil and steer manure in amending the soil and add food fertilizer to it it is also essential to consider the drainage and ensure that the soil can drain well off the container [Music] in this area our blueberries get five to six hours of sun so always consider the location of your plants when it comes to watering make sure that they are getting enough water our blueberries are set with watering system scheduled every other day but we give them extra water during hot weather we don't prune our blueberries at all but we cut the old dying stems or branches and finally we mulch them to prevent the weeds from taking away the nutrients from the plant [Music] [Music] you", "w8BwxgV4daM": "[Music] hello friends welcome to our

Today we're gonna make a basic cheesecake, said no one ever. This is by no means basic. This cheesecake is super\nimpressive, it's tall, it's kinda like a New\nYork style cheesecake. It's delicious, and it's\npretty easy to make. I think you'll be surprised. So let's go over the\ningredients real quick. You're gonna need about a a cup and a half of graham cracker crumbs. You're gonna need six\ntablespoons of unsalted butter. One tablespoon of regular sugar. Five eight ounce blocks of cream cheese, at room temperature, very important, to get those five sticks of\ncream cheese at room temp. A cup and a half of white sugar. Seven large eggs at room temperature also. A fourth of a cup of sour cream. And then a teaspoon and a\nhalf of vanilla extract. Alright, first things first. Preheat the oven to\n350 degrees fahrenheit. Then get started on melting your butter. So I got our butter nice and melted. And measure out your graham\ncracker crumbs, cup and a half. And your tablespoon of sugar. So go ahead and pour the\ngraham cracker crumbs right in to that butter and add the sugar. And we're just gonna mix it together, until all of the graham\ncrackers are moistened. Alright so what we're gonna do next, is transfer that to a spring form pan. This looks like a nine\ninch spring form pan, you see it's got that tall wall, and the base comes out, which is great for serving the cheesecake. I wouldn't recommend any other\nkind of pan besides this one. So just transfer your crumbs into he bottom of your spring form mold. And then even them out on the bottom. Now this part doesn't have to be perfect. You just want them to be pretty even. And when you're putting\nin the graham crackers, try and let them go up the wall, just a little bit, to make sure that we seal the edges, and we're not gonna be\ngetting cream cheese seeping through the bottom. And we're gonna pop this in the oven, for eight minutes at 350. Alright, the crust is\nready and it's perfect. So you wanna let that cool\ndown to room temperature. And in the meantime, crank your oven up to 450, and get started on your\ncream cheese filling. We're gonna start with our five sticks of softened cream cheese. Now, again, super super important that this is at room temperature, because if it's not, you can have clumps in your cheesecake, and we don't like clumps\nin our cheesecake, no. So put those in, and then add your cup and\na half of granulated sugar. And you're gonna mix that together, on about medium high\nspeed for five minutes, or until it's nice and fluffy. And scrape down the bowl as you need to so you don't get chunks of cream cheese. (whizzing) Alright, we're gonna scrape her down. Make sure there's no clumps. Okay and crank it back up to finish off that last five minutes, or the rest of the five minutes. Alright, five minutes later, you can see how nice and\nfluffy that cream cheese is. We're gonna kick it down to medium speed, and add your eggs one at a time, until they're nicely incorporated. (whizzing) And it's a good idea to go ahead and scrape down the bowl right now too, just so you don't get any globs of cream cheese on the sides, it's all well incorporated. So just scrape her down. (whizzing) Now we're gonna kick it down to low speed, and add your fourth of\na cup of sour cream, and your vanilla. And just keep mixing\nuntil it's well blended. (whizzing) We're ready to transfer\nthe filling into the crust. Yum, check that out. Woo, that looks perfect. So velvety smooth. It's huge. Look at this, it's\nfills up this whole pan. Smooth out the top with a spatula, and then you're gonna bake\nat 450 for 15 minutes, then turn down your heat to 225, and bake for another\nhour and five minutes. Now also super important, do not open your oven while it's in there, otherwise it's more likely to\nform the cracks on the top. Now this one, sometimes it still forms a little crack. But that's perfectly fine, because we have a\nblueberry topping coming, that's just fantastic. Once the cheesecake comes out of the oven, it's gonna be, oh yay tall. Maybe half an inch, sometimes\nan inch above the rim. Which is what it's supposed to do. And then as it cools, it sinks back down. So you want this to cool. Just take it out of the\noven when it's done, let it cool to room temperature\nin the refrigerator, or if it's cold in your garage, just pop it in the garage. Let it cool down all the way. And that's why I like making\nthis cake in the evening, is because it can really, you're not gonna eat it anyways so, why tease yourself all day? So first things first, we are going to take your knife and run it around the edges of the cheesecake. Just to loosen it from the pan. So that's what we're gonna do. Just run it around the edge. La-di-da. Okay. And then you can release the\nsides of your spring form mold. Ta-da. And then you're gonna take\na thin edge spatula like so, and just slide it under\nthe base of the cheesecake. You can just serve it right on the base of the spring form mold, and that's perfectly cool. So push it through along the edges, and then once you're done doing that, you can transfer it to a cake platter. Now be very careful, because the base of this, the cookie crust is very slippery. And when I made this\nfor Thanksgiving dinner, I have a disaster story. So I was carrying it to someone's house, and as soon as I got out of\nthe car, it just like (whoosh) right onto the floor. It was really a disaster. (laughs) True story. So just be careful, because this thing is kinda slippery. And what I love about the topping on this, is the border kinda create a bowl for that blueberry topping\nthat we're gonna make. So let's get working on that real quick. It's fast and it's easy you guys. You're gonna love this. So we start out with one\nfourth of a cup of water. Cold water. Two tablespoons of sugar. Two teaspoons of corn starch. And a tablespoon of lemon juice. And you're just gonna whisk that together. You wanna do this cold, not on the heat, because if you do it on the heat, that corn starch before it's\nmixed into the water real well, it'll start to turn jelly-like, and then you get chunks in your sauce. You don't want that. Alright, mix that together. Put that on the heat, over a medium heat. You see how it's starting to thicken? Let's go ahead and add in the four cups of frozen blueberries. Alright, and once those are in, you wanna just continue to mix it, until you see a light bubbling. You want to get rally hot, but you don't want it to boil, because if you boil blueberries, they kind turn to mush, and we want these to keep their form. Alright, that blueberry topping is done. And it's perfect. And you know, this is great, not just for cheesecake, but you can put this\non pancakes or waffles. It's delicious. Alright, now the important part, the taste test. So we're cutting big slices here. And there's two ways to serve this. You can, especially if you\nhave cracks on the top, which this one doesn't, it's perfect, but you can put the blueberries on top, and just make a topping out of it, or you can serve individual\nslices of cheesecake, on the plate, and then top each slice\nwith some blueberry sauce. And that's the way I like to do it. (upbeat music) Mm. This is delicious. Wow. I hope you guys love this recipe. It's definitely a family favorite.

(upbeat music)", "z8INl31nexs": "hey what's up everyone and welcome back to another episode from my amazing food series my name is Derrick from Simeon Nutrition we're back here in the kitchen and I'm about to talk to you guys all about blueberries so the idea with these videos is to get you excited about food and help you to understand why we are eating certain foods so in these videos to do that I like to highlight some cool fun facts about the food it'll be blueberries in this case talk about some of the nutritional benefits of it how it's gonna benefit our health and then I also like to go into some of the ways that you guys can incorporate them into your lifestyle some ways that you can eat them I mean with berries it's pretty self-explanatory but I will show you guys a couple recipes at the end like I always do so definitely stay tuned for that so we've talked about some pretty amazing foods in this series already but blueberries have got to be one of the most amazing especially as far as benefiting human health so hopefully in this video you guys will understand why you should probably be eating blueberries and if you're already eating them why you should be eating more don't show a lot of you out there I really love blueberries as do I and as a Canadian I think we hold a special place in our hearts for blueberries it is native to Canada is one of our largest food exports we're one of the world's largest consumers of blueberries like we love blueberries here in Canada and not to mention the fact that almost everybody knows somebody who has a blueberry bush or at least has some memories of their childhood you know from picking blueberries from when they were young it's it's definitely like a common thing here in Canada and actually just out on my run today I came across a blueberry bush so it's just out here on a run and this caught the corner of my eye right here we have but a highbush blueberry bush pretty cool and crystals mom actually has a blueberry bush so we went over there the other day as you can see here and we grabbed some blueberries from her and you can see how much these things produce this is actually like the second or third harvest of these blueberry bushes and they're only a couple years old so after about six years blueberry bushes become mature and they can produce anywhere from like 6 to 7 pounds of blueberries every single year and they will live for about 40 to 50 years producing there are a few main types of blueberry bushes that we get blueberries from so there's the highbush blueberry which is the most common here in the north and then there's the low bush which is also common in North America and there's a couple hybrids that they've made between the two of them where they have selectively bred them for certain qualities there the rabbit eye blueberry bush which is more common in the south and is better with hotter temperatures and then there's the wild blueberry which grows in the wild didn't have to be Einstein to figure that one out but it should be noted that's what some companies are doing now is they are taking that variety that wild blueberry variety and they are farming it and wild blueberries are known for having the highest antioxidant amounts of any of the blueberries however that only applies to them when they are actually grown in the wild it's not anything to shy away from if you do see farmed wild blueberries it's not a problem at all and in fact most of the research that has been done on blueberries have been done on the more common varieties like the high Bush and the low Bush varieties so yeah they're also good for you they all really similar nutrient profiles but the wild wild blueberry is definitely like the best so I'm sure many of you have noticed the white powdery film that sometimes on the outside of blueberries and I never knew what that was I always just thought it was like some sort of pesticide residue or something that was added to them to help to preserve them to make them last longer and it actually does help to preserve them and make them last longer but it isn't added it's a naturally occurring thing it's actually called the Bloom and blueberries produce this in order to help to keep their moisture content and retain nutrients so it's actually a sign of freshness when you do see blueberries with that white coating on the outside because through handling and shipping and all a sort of stuff it does get worn off so it's always a good idea to wash our berries and our you know fruits and vegetables and everything but with blueberries you want to wait until you're just about to eat them because that protective coating does keep some of the nutrients and moisture and flavor and everything in there or you know another cool fact about blueberries is that they're one of the only foods that are truly blue in color and that's thanks to some of the antioxidants that they possess and what's also really cool and I learned this the other day is that I'm growing some tomatoes in my yard called blue tomatoes and I learned that those have been selectively bred to contain lots of that antioxidant that gives it that blue pigment now antioxidant is called anthocyanin and what else is really cool is if you look at the word anthocyanin we actually have two roots in there so if you look at the first one ant fell it actually comes from the Greek word anthos which means flower and then the second part of the word is Cynon and you guys probably recognize this it looks a lot like the word cyan which we know as a bluish green color and it actually comes from a greek word which means deep dark blue blueberries are definitely best known for their antioxidants but they do contain some other nutrients as well they're a good source of vitamin C vitamin K manganese and fiber and of course they do contain some other nutrients but generally we aren't eating enough blueberries for it to be very significant so I know what you're thinking after looking at that you're like this doesn't look that good for blueberries like they're not very nutritious Derick but here's the thing blueberries have been extensively studied and are understood to be one of the best foods for human health for helping to ward off disease and helping with aging and any degenerative conditions that come with that so yeah antioxidants for the way and you definitely want to be eating as many berries as possible so we know that antioxidants help our bodies to combat against oxidative stress and there's no way to completely avoid them of course there's things that we can do to reduce our exposure but you cannot avoid them completely they're everywhere they're in the environment some of the toxins that are just floating around in the air products that we put on our skin even just exercise creates oxidative stress like there's absolutely nothing that we can do to get away from it but we definitely want to combat it the most that we can and having berries is a really really good way to do that especially important for athletes so being able to recover faster is like the Holy Grail for athletes I mean the sooner that you can get out there and start training again the better you're gonna be the more time you're gonna be able to spend perfecting your craft the stronger you're gonna get the faster you're gonna get and you're gonna be that much further ahead than the next guy who's not recovering as good as you and blueberries can definitely help you to do that so I found this study here that found much better recovery for athletes who consumed blueberries prior to intense exercises versus those who did not but whether you're an athlete or not you should definitely be consuming blueberries because they have such a wide variety of benefits to human health there's literally thousands of studies that have been done on the consumption of blueberries and they all show incredible benefits so I'll put some links down below if you guys want to check out some study on blueberries and nutritionfacts.org actually has some amazing blueberry videos as well if you want to learn more but some of the areas that they've been proven to help are heart disease arterial function diabetes insulin response DNA repair blood pressure mood memory immune system and also helps to fight off countless cancers including colon cancer which is the second most prevalent cause of death from cancer in men and women after lung cancer in the USA this review here says that in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that berries and their bioactive components exert therapeutic and preventive effects against colon cancer so I know a lot of you guys are probably thinking what is better Derek is it fresh or frozen rewind so I know a lot of you guys were wondering Derek what is better is frozen better or fresh better and you know years ago I would have jumped at the opportunity to say fresh fresh is best all the time but as I learn more I've actually started to change my opinion a little bit so this goes for a lot of fruits and vegetables but what we have to understand is that when stuff is picked to be sent to a store fresh and not frozen they usually pick it a little bit early so that it has time to ripen along the route and it's also less susceptible to like bruising and that sort of stuff if it is you know not quite at its peak of ripeness so generally produce isn't at the peak of its nutritional content until it is at its right best point so you can imagine picking food early means that you're already starting off with a lower nutritional profile and then when it ships you know across country or however far it is that nutritional profile will start to taper off as well because we know that you know vitamins and nutrients denature over time but with frozen berries they pick them at the peak of their ripeness so this is because they're the most flavorful and the most sugar rich and tasty then and they want people to enjoy the product of course but along with that they're at their peak of nutritional content as well and then what happens is they are usually frozen right on site they're taken off the bush or the tree or whatever and they're frozen right away flash frozen and this preserves and locks in a lot of the nutrients so I actually found this on BC blueberries website they say Studies on blueberries and nutrition have shown that since blueberries are frozen soon after they are picked they are equal in quality to fresh wear antioxidants are concerned researchers analyzed the anthocyanin content of blueberries frozen for one three and five months and found no crease in antioxidants over the fresh berries they also retain similar or greater concentrations of thiamine riboflavin b6 folate and fiber and while I was reaching roll and while I was researching for this actually learned that frozen berries and their other foods as well often contain less pesticide residue than the fresh counterparts so this is likely due to the fact that they have to spray extra fungicides and pesticides on the food in order to help preserve it for its you know long-haul shipping cross-country to your grocery store or whatever it is and how often are you in a grocery store and you see fresh berries that have gone all moldy and slimy and all that and just are inedible where frozen blueberries have a far less chance of that happening so there's a lot less waste as well so really just get whatever ones you can get of course wild blueberries off the side of the mountain are probably going to be the best but I think a really good second best would be organic frozen ones and then conventional frozen blueberries I think those are really great options but honestly just get whatever ones that you can so in this last part of these amazing food videos I always like to share a few ways that you can use the food that we're talking about in your day-to-day life and I mean berries are pretty self-explanatory not many recipes involving well maybe there are actually everybody knows how to just like pick up a berry and eat it that is my favorite way to have berries but there's definitely lots of different ways that I incorporate them into my daily routine and because they're like so low in calories you can just have a ton of them and they're really not gonna add much caloric content to your food or your meals so smoothies are probably the most common way that I use blueberries we usually buy like a bag of mixed berries and I'll usually throw a couple handfuls of that in there after my workout but today actually came home and made it really neat blueberry mango banana smoothie I'll show you guys so this is a really basic smoothie recipe but it is really delicious and it definitely does the trick and what's cool about this smoothie is that these three ingredients the banana the date and the hemp seeds have all been featured in this amazing food series so if you guys want to learn more about these three foods definitely check back in the playlist and watch those videos they're good ones so we've got a cup and a half of frozen blueberries about the same amount of frozen mango we've got one ripe banana we've got that medjool date and then here we have some lemon zest so I like to cut this off the lemon and use it whenever I can because there's so much nutrition left in a lemon once we like squeeze the juice out of it and you end up just like throwing it away or composting it or whatever so I like to use those in smoothies and lemon vennett banana mango and blueberries all go really really well together so I've also got some hemp seeds here the hemp seeds are just gonna help us to bump up the protein content also add some healthy omega-3 fatty acids to the smoothie and then we're just gonna add some unsweetened almond milk there to help it all get going and if you guys are like me and you're going to the gym trying to make some gains you can always add some more protein to this by adding like a protein powder so this is my choice so that people like perform plant-based protein powder the Madagascar vanilla flavor goes especially good in a smoothie like this so I am an ambassador for these guys which means I have an affiliate link and a discount code those will be in the description box down

tastes amazing so yeah but yeah definitely check it out if you want and let's blend this up so good so it's so good they're also really good to sprinkle on top of your oatmeal and they go really well on top of like cereal or granola if you're having that of course on top of smoothie bowls they're just amazing berries are also really great on top of salads I always forget to do this but whenever I do I do not regret it they add just this like really nice sort of sweet punch of flavor and you can actually make a really good salad dressing out of blueberries as well which I'll show you here really simple super delicious so I've got half a cup of frozen blueberries there got one pitted medjool date and I'm gonna use the juice from half of this lemon a little bit of water into the Magic Bullet here and if you guys want you can add a little pinch of salt as well and helps to bring out some of those flavors one thing that's really nice about using the frozen blueberries for this recipe is that it makes the salad dressing nice and thick so you don't have to add anything to thicken it all right so I think that's probably it for this video thank you guys so much for watching I hope you

thing if we can recommend with blueberry wine is let it sit a little while you let AJ year in the bottle and it tastes a hundred times better than if you start drinking it rate as you bottle it to get started we're going to need a few basic ingredients we're going to need ten pounds of blueberries about four gallons of water a packet of ec1 one one eight wine yeast between eight and ten pounds of sugar seven and a half teaspoons of acid blend four and a half teaspoons of pect Akins I'm four and a half teaspoons of yeast and energizer and five crushed Camdon tablets the first step in this process is just like making every other wine sanitizing everything our stirring spoon our bag our bucket everything is sanitized with one step I can't stress that enough on our other wine video we talked about it quite a bit just make sure you sanitize everything the next step is we're going to take our blueberries we have ten pounds and they were frozen and we let them thaw overnight in the bag and we're going to add that to our straining bag that's in our primary fermenter and once you get that done you're going to take the nylon straining bag now you can pick up at any brew supply store and we're going to tie it real tight and we'll do a double not just ensure when we're stirring every day when we're checking our specific gravity that it doesn't come open the next step is adding our four gallons of water to the primary fermenter that has our berries in it we use reverse osmosis water that we pick up from our local grocery store you can do that you can buy bottled water or we could use or you could use your own tap water if you don't feel like it's too chemically or two quarters too much chlorine in it if you do use your tap water we suggest pouring out the four gallons the night before and letting it sit without the cap on so let's go ahead and throw this into our primary fermenter next we're going to take our sugar our Camden tablets our acid blend our Peck t'k enzyme and our yeast energizer and add it to the must alright now that we have our 8 pounds of sugar added go ahead and take whatever you use to stir and stir up the must really well I would suggest doing it for about two to three minutes and pressing down on the pulp bag without breaking it just to get everything mixed well because once again we're mixing together our sugar our acid blend our pected pected enzyme our yeast energizer and our five crushed Camden tablets we're not going to add our wine east yet right now what we're going to do is actually cover this and let it sit for 24 hours with our airlock on filled with one-step water solution and we're going to let it sit for 24 hours after that 24 hours then we can add our wine yeast what we're going to do after that is every day we're going to stir for about two to three minutes but before we stir we're going to take our specific gravity reading and we're going to record it after about five to eight days once the reading hits one point zero three zero we're going to pull our pulp bag out and we're going to twist it and try to every last little bit of juice out of it that we can and what I even do is I'll take a pasta strainer put it on top of the bucket and with a potato masher press on that Paul bag even more just to make sure we got as much juice out as possible once you've done that you remove the bag we're going to take the wine from our primary fermenter and siphon it into a secondary carboy so make sure to take everything from the bucket because we're only going to have it in the secondary carboy for a little while I just going to keep / menteng in there but once the specific gravity has dropped to about one point zero zero which is about four weeks out then we're going to siphon off everything except the sediment that will be on the bottom of the carboy into another clean carboy and make sure to put an airlock on every time so what we do is we'll take a little turkey baster and at once a week will pop out put it and measure this up the specific gravity and then pour it back into the carboy and it's literally been about four weeks plus or minus a couple of days until we get our specific gravity to one point zero zero once you drain it into another clean carboy as like we've talked about before make sure everything is cleaned with one step or some sort of sanitary solution that's including your siphon your filter whatever you're using during that transfer process we're going to let it sit in that carboy for about two months again and this will help in the clearing of it you'll notice all the sediment start dropping to the bottom of the carboy and what we really do is two months is the recommended timeframe from this recipe book which by the way is winemakers recipe handbook which you can pick up at any brew sort this is an our own recipe but it's still one of our favorites we let it sit for between two and four months and what you're really looking for is all the sediment in the carboy will fall to the bottom after that two months you're going to siphon from the carboy into a bottling bucket and you're going to add and you're going to add four and a half teaspoons of stabilizer during this time you're also going to take four and a half pints of red grape concentrate that you can pick up from any brew supply store and you're going to mix it in the bottling bucket then go through and just like every other beautiful wine you've ever made or if this is your first time it'll be like every other wine you're going to make in the future you're going to take it you're going to bottle it and you're going to try really hard to not drink it for a couple months as we talked about before try to let it sit for about a year before you really start drinking it we end up with a beautiful purple you end up with a beautiful colored wine that tastes great it's super sweet and if you chill it a little bit on a nice summer day you won't regret it and you'll be making this every year from here on out as always feel free to ask any kind of questions post comments send me a message we love doing this and we've had a lot of positive

live what's up everybody welcome to another video and today we're going to be talking about one of gummies check it out you want a gummy yeah I want a gummy so one of gummies are gummies that are produced by luck I believe I know they've got a bad rap but the gummies are different story folks and so is the key that's another video you got keeping out where because the keep video is common and you don't believe the experiment god it's lined up for that I've teased that later so let's talk about one of gummies but I decided to go with is the one of gummies blueberry and because it was $45 I think that's still kind of pricey we're talking 10 milligrams each gummy 100 milligrams total again comparing the Michigan that still kind of falls short of what we all think we should be able to get for this price I like the container let's look at what the gummy looks like and then I'm going to eat one and tell you a little bit more about it so I the container is a little weird to open but you have to push in on on each side here to get over so here's the gummies and I'm gonna take another one out for better view and it is blue folks you see a little bit sugar on it and you know I'm I like them i'ma say it tastes better than a bro how gummies compared to gibsonburg dummies I'm going to give it similarity but I'm going to say I do like to taste folks I can think it's one of companies are tasty in my opinion and the views expressed in any of my videos are selling my opinions based on my own personal experience and knowledge I work for none of these companies I do not represent anyone other than you guys so I just wanna make sure we clarify that any music you hearing in these videos if the music that I made myself I'm on a tight budget many of you know that is why I'm still wearing the same white t-shirt eventually we'll have Ohio cannabis live t-shirts and hats someday and maybe even business cards but we're not really in business right so we're just trying to get the word out about these products and we want to make sure that you are up-to-date on stuff when it comes out one of gummies are new let me give you our another close-up of it and on the back is the label here tells you about the dosage where are these at right now I know you know how cannabis company has them I know that Terra Center Columbus has them and there may be a few other dispensaries that actually have these comes as well so check your online menus check weed Maps check everywhere and there's three different kinds there is the indica the sativa and the hybrid and each different version has a different flavor god none of the other flavors that they had was watermelon I posted some more information some literature about the one of gummies on my Facebook page so you can check out a couple more screenshots some of the other material that came with the gummies but I'm gonna tell you I tried one last night and it definitely came in I was saying for a person like me and the way I've been in a lot of pain I'm probably a too gummy person at a time you might be at income ten milligram person I'm probably more of a 20 milligram bilities person and in extreme cases probably thirty milligrams really good for me I don't recommend you eat five at one time at me fifty milligrams of THC and in my experience when I see people take 50 milligrams you see that's pretty pretty much put you to sleep but you can get you in a really lazy tight mode depending on what kind of edible it is and 100 milligrams you eat the whole thing up oh my you're gonna feeling really really sleepy and probably really relaxed so yeah if you just want to if you could afford to eat them a whole pack in one day I mean go for it but if you want to make them last I think that one two gummies each session is probably appropriate based on my own personal opinion folks but I think the wanna gummies are a good product and congratulations Buckeye relief for making a nice product and you know making something to taste better I'm not gonna tell you tastes amazing and I'm not gonna say it tastes as good as regular gum use they don't have THC in it you're gonna taste THC close they're gonna taste medicine in there but it's not overwhelming you do give some flavors like I said this one is blueberry so I think the flavor was good and like I said I definitely compare it to the gibsonburg gummies and forest the texture in comparison very similar type of gummy so you know it's one better than the other right now I'm not ready to make their conclusion I would say they're probably very much similar products from two different processes so now we have a little bit more variety of products now yeah gibsonburg gummies and now we have one of gummies and we have Robo Ohio guns so if you want to see here we go this is the container or grow hi Oh gummies here's the one of gummies and here's a container for the gibsonburg guns so again folks when I tell you things I don't just speak from just other people's opinions I speak from my own personal testing of these products and that's why I wanna make sure you guys get to the information and I would say all three these guys are doing good here congratulations to staring the Wellness buckeye relieved in goo Ohio for making halfway decent products the first batch of these I did not like and second batches a lot better so I think didn't they grow Ohio is definitely improving on their alternative products and like I said I think I'll be within like gibsonburg gonna sigh I know I think so with that we're gonna head to wrap this view with the final conclusion that Ohio got some gummies yeah the price could be a little bit better so if my growers are out there listening see what you can do in the price man we can get these cubbies down like maybe $29.99 I think we would see him go out a lot faster this is my own person yes thanks for all the support and we are going to have more videos to come we appreciate your support make sure that you click the like button smash the subscribe button and make sure you're following us on Facebook for more updates and more videos and more reviews again thank you for watching oh hi of

"ESZJqAePrCc": "you if you're lucky enough to have enough blueberries to go past the fresh stage you need to choose which method you wish to preserve them we have there are a lot of alternatives that can either be frozen canned you can make jam or preserves from them today we're going to try it a little bit different method one that's actually older than any of those we're going to try drying them in a couple of ways now you can see that the blueberries themselves have a waxy coating now in order for them to dry fairly quickly we want to get as much of this waxy coating off this is really is something that you can do to speed the drying process if you don't do it your berries will dry you'll be very successful in all probability but it will take longer and as a result of the lengthening of the drying process you'll get a little bit lower quality of dried blueberry and you'll also have less nutrition in those dried blueberries so we want to remove this and in the process of doing that we also want to crack the skins a little bit which will give us a way to get some extra moisture out now all we're going to do to do that is to put them in some boiling water or some really hot water and we'll do just a few here today and we'll let them sit in the in the hot water for about thirty seconds and we're going to assume that that amount of time has passed today and then we'll drain them well and you can see the difference in the color that we've got already between those that we have done freshly and those that we or that have not been blanched and those that have we get much of that wax enos off here and a lot of difference in the color itself now these then need to be spread out on a dehydrator you could do this in the Sun it will take substantially longer in the Sun however because you'll be interrupted by night and this this year it looks like you'll probably be interrupted by rain at some point in time also they can be close together but preferably not touching these are on a dehydrator tray they're on a screen you may want to if you have it at home and they're very very moist you may want to also treat this the screen with some kind of vegetable spray and that will keep them from sticking we want to put these in a dehydrator about 140 degrees for the first two hours I've been lower the temperature to about 130 this works really well in the hydrator because you have control now what you have here is you can see what we've got if we do them with the two different processes these are the blueberries that we dried blanching them there's not a lot of difference in appearance between those that I'd ride without blanching these took about three hours less to dry than those over here so we've got less exposure to heat and so on and these will be a little bit better flavor better nutrition as well as far as using them or telling when they're dry you need to check them to see when there's no longer any moisture present you may want to squeeze them they need to be leather early leathery not hard then you probably should condition them for a few days because you'll have large blueberries or small blueberries mixed together put them in a jar a glass jar is nice where you have a lid on it close the lid down check them on a daily basis if you see moisture on the sides of the jar you need to put them back in the dehydrator the drier the oven or back in the Sun for another day or so are a few hours in a dehydrator so that you get the moisture evaporated this also allows the moisture to equalize between the big blueberries and the small blueberry so you don't have some that are way over dried and some that are still too moist in the middle it will help reduce the chance of mold and spoilage later on if you've done them outside you should pasteurize them otherwise you're probably going to find bugs hatching out later on simply because the eggs that have landed that have been deposited by bugs as the the berries were drawing the second thing I want to try for you real quick is also a drawing method this one works real good for kids it's called fruit leather in this case blueberry leather we're simply going to put the remainder of the blueberries in a blender and this you kind of are going to have to judge the amount by the amount you have on hand and so on now blueberries themselves don't make very good leather the flavor is very very bland so we're going to add some apple puree now apple puree in this case is simply apple sauce and then to make it sweet enough we're going to add a little bit of corn syrup the amount of corn syrup you add is going to be dependent on your own taste if you like it without corn syrup that's fine don't use granulated sugar however because it's apt to crystallize on you later and cause the leather to spoil we're going to blend these well enough to just get them blended if you use fresh apples I would blend them separately blend the blueberries separately and then combine them but since our apples are already pureed we'll go ahead all right you notice we left the peel on obviously we're not going to try and get that off of blueberries we're going to spread this on a sheet again you may want to treat this with a vegetable spray ahead of time try to get it even thickness and also no more than a quarter of an inch thickness you may want to shake the tray a little bit if it's a little bit thick in one place or to help spread it out a little bit then this again goes in the dehydrator at 150 degrees for two hours then lowering the temperature to 130 until it's dry it works very well in the oven so if you don't have a dehydrator this is one that you can start with withdrawing spreading it on a cookie sheet will work real well again treating it with the vegetable spray otherwise it may stick for you when you can peel it up or lift it up check it when it's cool when you lift it up and it's no longer sticky in the center it's ready to go I roll it while it's warm and if you can get it to the freezer if you need to store it for a long period of time that's the way they do it my experience is however we never get at that bar proclaim'd are denis

blueberries with the biggest variety of blueberries species being found in North America one of the challenges farmers face is ensuring the plants experience enough cold weather during the winter months to allow the leaves and flowers to properly form depending on the species anywhere from 350 to 900 hours of extended cold temperatures is required for the plant to properly develop and produce a bountiful product don't let this crop small size deceive you growing this delicious little berry takes a lot of work and farmers diligently care for these plants year-round North Carolina ranks in the top 10 across the nation for blueberry production the organically rich acidic and sand based soil typically found in the sand hills of North Carolina is great for growing this tasty fruit many local blueberry farms give folks the opportunity to come out and pick their own berries which is a great way for consumers to connect with their local farmer this activity provides a great on the farm experience with a fun family atmosphere for guests of all ages it also allows visitors to gain a better understanding of where their food comes from and the care that goes into producing it blueberries are also versatile in the kitchen and can be used in countless recipes they can be easily stored in the freezer so that their great taste can be enjoyed year-round interest in blueberries continues to grow mainly due to research demonstrating the superpowers of this little blue giant part of what provides blueberries with their spectacular flavors aromas and colors is their unique combination of phytonutrients bursting with antioxidants blueberries have been shown to reduce inflammation as well as decreasing the risk of certain types of cancers and cardiovascular disease growing blueberries is a full-time year-round job with many risks and challenges involved in the process strong wind storms and hurricanes can destroy a year's worth of work and devastate a farm family's livelihood in a matter of hours fruit flies can devour an entire crop if not properly managed diseases can wipe out whole fields that took years to grow farmers are constantly managing these issues and doing the best they possibly can so you as a consumer have access to a high quality crop that is locally grown supporting and buying locally grown products like blueberries is important

time to brew a wheat beer and unlike its German counterpart which has esters of banana and clove an American wheat beer is bready grainy and a little bit hoppy it's brew 1 hi I'm Martin kina this is my homebrew challenge to brew 99 BJCP beer styles one per week this is my fourth one it's 1d American wheat now the grist for this beer style typically consists of about 50% white wheat malt and then the other 50% is some kind of barley typically either to Rove or fills the malt I'm going for a very simple mix of 6 pounds of Touro and 6 pounds of American wheat and because this beer does contain a large amount of wheat I'm using rice hulls as well [Music] so let's talk rice holes when you're brewing with wheat beer you don't get the husks when you mill that wheat in the same way that you do with barley and that can mean that you end up getting a stuck sparge the way I can tell I have a stuck barge is when the sight glass starts dropping in the mash tun so to address that issue I'm using a liberal amount of rice hulls these effectively supplement the husks that we're not getting from the wheat grain and if I use enough it really does need to fix my stock sparge issues hops are a mixture of Centennial and Hallertau and I'm using 0.75 ounces of Centennial at the victory cup [Music] the rest of the hops go in at flameouts at that's one ounce each of Centennial and pallet ow okay everything seems to go pretty well the barrister at 10:48 we were going to 1049 so that looks good to me now let's talk the east normally I make a starter a couple of days ahead of brewed a cold crash it and then to Kant and pour it in I only got home from a trip yesterday's wouldn't have time to do that so I just made a starter last night and I am going to pitch directly from that starter into the work stealing a bit of that starter so I'll have some use to harvest for next time the yeast I'm using is WL p 0 0 1 so that's California ale yeast and we're going with that because we want this really clean profile from the yeast we don't want any esters giving us sort of banana or Flo flavor [Applause] [Music] so bit of a surprise on this beer here in its appearance this beer ended up being repurposed for a first birthday party for Zoey and we all had a pink beer so what we did is I took four pounds of raspberries i boiled a bag put the raspberries into the bag the wrestlers were frozen so they're already sanitized drop them into the keg and in three days took a tasting and immediately decided no aspect yes we needed to put it out like it we've got very raspberry very quick so we have already tasted this beer a few days ago but I would give it a bit of time to settle thanks so and to carbonate yes it was it was flat so first of all appearance this definitely doesn't look like your average wheat beer it's got some color to it it looks exactly like a raspberry color okay baby gone right so we have what do you think about the appearance well the appearance like you said it it's meant to be a whip there is that yes it's a American wheat American wheat so yeah first parrot I would never think that it would be an American wheat it's not like your average like him bleeding or something no when I saw how deep of a red color it is yeah and I thought we I thought it was really a lot longer no all right so a Roma raspberry I think is the definitive on that one very yeah there's no mistaking let's try the taste [Music] Oh doesn't taste like raspberries at all just kidding tastes phosphorus that tastes really good that tastes a lot better than when we tried it for each it the raspberries out it doesn't taste like a regular wheat beer would now it does have a kind of like I said ghosts or a sour it type type taste to it but it's not overpowering like I could drink a full pint of us so just a note on this beer by the way because the fruit went in post fermentation there is a ton of sugar in this cake so if this beer was not kept cold it could reefer mint and I mean in a cake it's just going to get a bit busier but if you were bottling this beer it could be somewhat of a disaster so yeah all right well I think this has turned out to be an improvisation that was quite successful and happy birthday to Zoe happy birthday Zoe", "_835IcXpLYg": "Hi I'm Tricia a California organic gardener blueberry muffins, blueberry pie, blueberry ice cream, blueberry pancakes, plain old blueberries if you like them you can grow them in containers or in the garden bed I'll show you how! for successful blueberry garden its important to choose the right variety the number of chill hours in your area will help\nyou make a decision on what varieties to plant and you can contact your local ag\ndepartment to find out the chill hours in your area for example if you live in a cold area\nwith a thousand chill hours or so get a northern high-bush type for warmer climates go with lower chill\nhour southern high-bush get at least two varieties for optimum yields and pollination growing delicious blueberries all starts with the soil blueberries are an acid loving plant like azaleas and rhododendrons if you're not sure of the \nacidity of your soil you can do simple pH test blueberries like it to be \nbetween four and five on the pH scale controlling the pH of your soil in contaniers is very easy and blueberries do really well going in\ncontainers like these thirty gallon smart pots a great recipe for blueberry container\nmix is one part organic potting soil for nutrients and one part peat moss or coco peat for moisture retention and to help create that low pH were going to add a half a pound of this acid fertilizer to every cubic foot that we have of potting mix now the fun part i get to plant my chandler blueberry make sure and plant the blueberry up to the same spot that it was planted\nbefore and then water I expect an abundant harvest of blueberries\nfrom these plants in the future but this year i'm going to pick off these\nlittle flowers so that i can encourage the root development but that's okay because i have established blueberries planted somewhere else and I'm going to show you how to care for those so here we are with some of my\nestablished blueberry plants and they're just starting to flower and to keep them healthy and happy I'm going to do a few things Im going to make sure that there well mulched and watered I'm going to fertilize them and I'm going to do some moderate pruning so I've buried emitter line all along\nthe fence line here where the blueberries are planted so i'm sure that the\nblueberries are getting adequate water they like about an inch of water per week I'm also going to make sure that theres no weed competition around the base of the blueberry plants now that I've cleared \naway all the weeds and competition I'm going to go ahead and fertilize according to the instructions on the package your going to want to fertilize early spring and late spring and then about half rate in fall just a little top dressing for each plant after fertilizing heavily mulch to keep the roots moist and cool so after top dressing if you don't\nexpect any rain in the forecast be sure and water your plant you want to make sure and water the fertilizer into the soil now I'm going to show you a few tips\non how to do some pruning for the season be sure to prune off anything that was\ndamaged during the winter be sure and clip off any dead twiggy or blotchy branches like these and trim off any low growing side shoots at the base so you want to keep the nice bright green upright stalks and get rid of the dead or dying dried up branches blueberries are also beautiful in the ornamental garden they have pretty white flowers in the\nspring and they have beautiful fall color in the fall so plant some blueberries and Grow Organic for Life!", "RaKTDhlhrMQ": "welcome to the rest of garden today's tomato profile is on the indigo blueberries and they have this dark dark purple color on the tomato that's anthocyanin it's the same pigment that's found in blueberries it gives these Tomatoes the dark purple color the more sunlight they get the darker purple color will be in there these are red berries with the purple tops they're a beautiful looking fruit I'm going to show you what the fruit looks like in a second and talk to you a little bit about it but you can see that great red color the purple color on top this plant is an indeterminate plant it's ready with the first fruit about seventy-five days after transplant let me back up a little bit this plan is now about seven feet going on eight feet it grows really well here in Maryland Zone seven today's July 31st so it's taking the heat well it does have some disease on it I've had really weird weather patterns here I've been spraying it but leaf spot is starting to come back because the nights are cool again we're getting 55 60 degree nights cool days we've had our share of really hot weather one hundred one hundred on the heat index this plant has done well in the heat so I do like it for I do like it for its disease resistance I do like it for its ability to set fruit in the heat and its really really prolific the more sunlight the tomatoes get the darker purple the more dark purple color will be on the fruits if you look up in there you can see not a lot of Sun lights getting to them they don't really have that dark purple color like the tomatoes up here here's a good example right there and again it's anthocyanin is what is bred into this plant to give the tomatoes the dark purple hue let me come down to the fruit and tell you a couple tips that I learned I've been growing several varieties of the Indigo's and they are a little bit tart but if you let them really ripen this is one that's really really ripe and you can see if I press it kind of looks rubbery and it feels like it's packed you know with fluid in there but it's soft to the touch this tomato is a little bit lighter that is going to be tart this one is the next stage in it you know it has the the feel to it like it's almost ready but if you just let it go a little bit longer till it gets to something like this a little bit darker just you know maybe five days later this tomato is so much more sweeter than these two so that's just a tip let them really stay on the vine as long as you can to let them ripen up this is what they look like on the inside the color doesn't really go through deeply and this is a indigo Sun or indigo sunburst I'm not sure what it was what's interesting is I only bought the indigo blueberry so I was trying to have two plants so one seed from the packet produce the yellow indigo tomatoes with the tops and this one here again didn't get a lot of Sun so you see it's more yellow this one got more Sun so it has more of the purple hue but from the same seed pack I got yellow Indigo's and these are the red Indigo's I do recommend this for your garden please give it those couple extra days of ripening and you can just see all the fruit that's on there it's a nice looking tomato it has a good tomato taste and it will have a nice sweetness if you leave it on the vine I hope you enjoyed the video and consider the Indigo Tomatoes for your garden please check out my blog at", "zsmbmRpSLTM": "hi everyone i'm going to show you how to make two smoothies that both kids and adults that can

with the blueberry dutch baby that's right i've been seeing a ton of\nDutch baby photos on the internet and I'm not exactly sure why but I'm\nguessing it's because people are stuck at home looking for things to do but\nanyway it did inspire me to make this blueberry studded version and if you're\nnot familiar with this beautiful big pancake you are in for a huge treat\nsince not only is this gorgeous and delicious it's also as fine and simple\nto make as a real baby so with that let's go ahead and get\nstarted with this very basic batter which will begin by tossing some\nall-purpose flour into a blender along with a pinch of salt as well as a little\ntouch of vanilla extract the real and the pure and then we'll go ahead and\nfinish this up with three large room-temperature eggs and some equally\nroom temperature milk and if you're wondering why room temperature eggs and\nmilk work better than cold I'm not exactly sure but it probably has\nsomething to do with science and that's it we'll just go ahead and blend this on\nhigh speed for about a minute or until completely and utterly smooth and by the\nway if you don't have the super duper fancy blender like I do you might have\nto go a couple minutes but don't worry it will still work and that's it once\nblended our batter is ready to use and I know it does seem very thin but that's\nhow it's supposed to be and then what we'll do once our batter is done is move\nto the stove where we have a 9 or 10 inch cast-iron skillet set over high\nheat into which we're gonna pour three tablespoons of clarified butter and once\nthat's in there I like to take a pastry brush and kind of grease the sides and\nall clarified butter is as butter that we've melted and then skimmed off the\nmilk solids from the top which leaves us with just a pure butter fat and then\nwhat we're gonna do here is wait until we just see that butter start to smoke\nokay you see that just a few small wisps and once that happens we're gonna\nquickly but carefully pour our batter in right in the center followed by a\nhandful of the sweetest freshest blueberries we can find and yes of\ncourse if you're not into blueberries any other fresh berry will work okay so\nuse what you want I mean you are after all the dwight\nschroot of this baby's fruit and that's it as soon as our batter has been buried\nwe'll turn off the heat and quickly pop this into the center of a 425 degree\noven for about 20 to 25 minutes or until it's\nbeautifully browned and provocatively puffed which like a souffle does not\nstay that way so be sure to get your pictures quickly and also make sure you\nleave that towel on that still very very hot handle and then what we want to do\nas soon as this comes out is brush the top with some more melted butter and if\nyou're thinking we already put three tablespoons into the pan\nisn't that enough no it's not brush more on and then after the butter this is\ntraditionally squeezed with a little bit of fresh lemon okay some nice sweet\nMeyer lemon if you can find it and above and beyond doing this for the flavor it\njust sounds super cool and as you can see that really helps finish off the\ndeflation shoot I should have worked in a Tom Brady reference oh well and that's\nit we will finish this off with a nice dusting of powdered sugar which I'm\ngenerally not a huge fan of for breakfast items but here it does make a\nlot of sense alright remember there is no sugar in that batter and the only\nsweetness is coming from those blueberries so I think this does need a\ndefinite dusting plus it looks nice on the pan and that's it our Dutch baby is\ndone and ready to enjoy which I'll be doing right now I have this hot pan and\nonce I get this piece cut let me get you a closer shot so you can get a better\nlook and that my friends is just a gorgeous bite of food and while it is\nrich and satisfying whoops appearances to the contrary it is\nsurprisingly light and the true magic of the Dutch baby is that contrast in\ntexture between that crispy crusty outside and that soft custard a fruity\ncenter it is just simply amazing with the emphasis on simply and I really\ncould have easily did that entire thing out of the pan but I didn't think we\nshall would appreciate that plus I'm contractually obligated to take a few\npictures of it plated so I cut a nice piece and placed it on a plate and fresh\nended up with a little more powdered sugar and since like I said this really\nisn't sweet at all especially with that little touch of lemon I finished this\none with a little drizzle of maple syrup which is how I would enjoy regular\nblueberry pancakes and that works just as well with this big variety\noh and in case you're keeping score at home this Dutch baby has nothing to do\nwith the Netherlands all right the name comes from the word Deutsche as in\nGerman and for more details on that just ask any of your friends from\nPennsylvania and they will explain it to you in fact they might even be able to\ntell you why this is called a baby but slightly confusing names aside I really\ndo hope you give this a try soon so please follow the links below for the\ningredient amounts a principle written recipe and much more info as usual and\nas always in you", "_Q8FtNO0hi0": "[Music] [Music] you", "USIKoRhCPDY": "[Music] [Music] oh hi there today welcome

you just want to start with the berries just take a few blueberries a few blackberries and some raspberries and put them right into a bowl I can mash them together with some sugar and some cassis which is a blackberry liqueur I know not everyone's going to have it a lot of different liqueurs would blend well with this limoncello would be good or any other fruit liqueur but if you want to leave it out don't worry just put a little bit of lemon juice in there just to add a little bit of brightness to it mash those together until they're really well blended everything is coming together and

everyone and welcome back to my channel. Today I\u2019m sharing with you how to make blueberry\nmuffins. These are super fluffy and soft on the inside,\nfull of juicey blueberries and topped with a crunchy crumble so let me show you how to\nmake them. To start preheat your oven to 220C or 425\nF. This temperature might seem quite high but\nwe\u2019ll turn it down while the muffins are baking. It\u2019s just to get that initial crunch on\nthe muffin tops. In a large sized mixing bowl sieve in 2 and\na half cups of all purpose flour to remove any lumps. This is quite a lot of flour but this recipe\nwill make 12 very decently sized muffins. To the flour add 1 and a half tablespoons\nof baking powder and 1 teaspoon of baking soda. This recipe requires both baking powder and\nbaking soda to achieve really light, airy, and super fluffy muffins. Use a whisk to combine the dry ingredients\ntogether. If you would like the full recipe for these\nBlueberry Muffins it will listed in the information box as well as on my website, just click the\nlink on the screen. If you are using frozen blueberries for this\nthese muffins like I am, here is a trick. Add the blueberries to bowl now and toss them\naround to coat in the flour. The flour helps contain any juices that the\nfrozen blueberries might leak out into the muffin batter, stopping that purple tinge. Set the bowl to the side to the side while\nwe prepare the other ingredients. Measure out half a cup of salted or unsalted\nbutter and melt in the microwave or in a saucepan. Leave it to cool before pouring into a medium\nsized mixing bowl. To the butter measure out a cup of granulated\nsugar and add. This recipe is a lot easier as there is no\nneed to cream the butter and sugar together. Crack in two good quality medium sized free\nrange eggs along with a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a cup of buttermilk. Mix the wet ingredients together with a whisk\nuntil well combined. I almost always love to use buttermilk with\nbaked goods, they just turn out so much softer, lighter, and fluffier than if you use regular\nmilk. Having buttermilk on hand can be quite a pain\nso if you don\u2019t have it you easily substitute by making your own. I\u2019ll have the recipe linked on my website,\njust click the link on the screen. Once the wet ingredients are well combined\npour it into the bowl with the dry ingredients and blueberries. Use a wooden spoon to gently fold the batter\ntogether until there are no more clumps of flour. Try not to over mix as these will result in\ntough muffins. If you are using fresh blueberries now is\nthe time to add them. Line a 12 tin muffin tray with liners or spray\nwith non-stick. Use a spoon to fill the tins almost to the\ntop, this results in the muffins overflowing a small amount, creating a really lovely bakery\nstyle looking muffin. Sprinkle over a generous amount of the crumble\ntopping. It\u2019s a mixture of flour, sugar, and butter. The recipe will be in the information box\nas well as my website. Place the muffins into the oven and Immediately\nturn the heat down to 180 C or 350F. Cook the blueberry muffins for 15-20 minutes\nor until the tops spring back when pressed. Cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring\nto a wire rack. These muffins are best enjoyed the day of\nbaking, they\u2019ll fill your house with the loveliest aroma. But they will stay fresh for up to three days\nin an airtight container. Let me know in the comments below if you\u2019re\ngoing to give these blueberry muffins a try, I would love to see a picture of your recreation\nof my recipe and I may feature it in my video next week. Thank you for watching, I hope you enjoyed\nthis recipe and I will see you in my video next week.

incentive to grow your own and the best bit about growing your own and pick him from somewhere like an allotment or even the garden is that there's always a treat before you get the produce to the

Yellow star fruit According to Authority Nutrition, star fruit\nis low in calories, high in fiber, and loaded with vitamin C.

Elderberries Most of the elderberry plant is actually poisonous,\nand contains a cyanide-inducing glycoside in the roots, stems, leaves, and seeds. The berries also contain a small amount of\nthe poison in their seeds, which is destroyed when the berry is properly harvested and cooked. Then, it can be used in syrups, jams, pies\n\u2014 even wine. So pick your poison properly prepared. Pangium edule fruit Native to Southeast Asia, the pangium edule\ndevelops a large, brown fruit that is often called a football fruit. Prepared properly in many Indonesian dishes,\nthe football fruit's seeds are filled with hydrocyanic acid, which can cause sleepiness\nand delirium. But when the seeds aren't being used for rat\npoison, they're boiled down or fermented to remove the poison, and made into a cooking\noil. Yew berries The yew shrub is a popular plant for landscaping,\ndue to its ease of care, evergreen nature, and drought-resistance. But tucked into the plant's little red berries,\nis a highly poisonous seed. While some wildlife may be able to consume\nthe berries by passing the seeds intact in their droppings, humans should never risk\neating this highly toxic berry. Just a few seeds can cause convulsions, rapid\ncollapse, and fatalities. \"Whoa, no way. We are not eating that.\" Rhubarb One bite of rhubarb crisp and you'll forget\nall about the plant's poisonous leaves. And yes it's a veggie in the scientific sense,\nbut it's often prepared like a fruit. The glycosides and oxalates in its leaves\ncan cause burning of the throat and mouth, stomach pain, kidney troubles, and even coma\nif eaten in large quantities. Only the stalk of the plant is edible, lending\na sweet and sour flavor to jams, pies and sauces. Aside from that, there's not much more to\nknow about the rhubarb, except, well... \"Never rub another man's rhubarb!\" Cashew apples Cashews are technically not a nut. They're part of the seed of an apple-like\nfruit, and grow on the outer end of its host. The cashews that we eat are surrounded by\na toxic hull that must be roasted off before the \"raw\" cashew can be extracted. The fruit, known as a cashew-apple, is popular\nin its native land of Brazil, and is even made into a much-loved juice. Cashew-apples are too delicate for travel,\nso are only sold in areas where they're cultivated, like Brazil, Nigeria, India, and Southeast\nAsia. For now, most of us will just have to settle\nfor simple cashews. \"You got any cashews in there?\" \"No. I picked them out.\" \"Typical.\" Thanks for watching!

but you can collect the seeds out of blueberries yourself and you can plant them yourself I have done it before I don't like blueberries very much so I did not keep the plant but I've done this I've started them and I've actually grown them so you can do this it's very simple the things you need is a piece of paper towel and some blueberries and what you do is you simply cut open the blueberries and the seeds are in there and we come close here the seeds are there very very tiny little oops sorry for the focus right here very very tiny little pieces of seeds right there and you're gonna have to be very patient now there's another fast method which I do not recommend the fast method is that you buy your half a pound or a pound of blueberries and just throw them into a blender and then you just collect the seeds that way but I do not recommend that because out of all the hundreds of seeds you might be able to get a couple good ones so this is easy just need some patience now right here I have the easiest way that I figured as you get the seeds and you just put them on the paper towel let me see let me show you sorry for the focus here but to see there's one seat right there and then I'm going to put take another one out of this one just put it on there okay let me put pick that well here so you can actually see there's a couple seats right there right now can actually zoom in there we go and each each blueberry has just about a few seeds in and sometimes you get the little goo but it's okay there is another seat right there it's not a big seeds just has stopped all of it but that's why you use the paper towel and there you go so there so it's pretty easy this one had only one two three four five seeds and then you open another one just the same way this one let it focus right here there this one has a few seeds like you probably sorry fruit if focus here my camera is having a hard time focusing for some reason right there if you can see a few seeds in there and all you have to do is just simply go and collect them and just be patient and hope that you have good eyes to do this because these seeds are very very tiny so there I have a few seeds now I actually last time planted only four seeds and all the four of them germinated so it is very simple guys I encourage you to do this I encourage you to play around with things and just start your own garden it's not that hard it's simple and one of the other things I want you to do is to get the jiffy pellets let me show you one of them I had another video that I made a few a couple weeks back of with 100% germination rate and you can go take a look at that I bought these jiffy pallets pellets from from Walmart or you can buy on Amazon and you just follow the instructions and you can plant your seeds in these guys and you will have a 100 percent germination success I guarantee you that so just give this a try and if you have any questions or comments leave them below and I will be happy to answer them thank you if you have enjoyed this video please subscribe", "N5lIG6yEo4M": "[Music] so guys nito nakami is a blueberry country [Music] we will pick blueberries here okay guys yeah see you

"u5dfuOkBuzU": "good morning from our backyard we have not filmed here for a while but in today's video I want to talk about plants that at the moment we only have here in our backyard and those are blueberries blueberries have become very popular in Europe both to do to their good taste and their high antioxidant content and I think about nine times of out of 10 when I'm designing a garden the owners will ask me to put in blueberries but unlike other kinds of berries blueberries have very specific requirements when it comes to soil and they can't be grown just about anywhere blueberries prefer light sandy soil but that is rich in humors but most importantly they need acidic soil so if your soil is acidic they're one of the few plants that will truly thrive and here in the Netherlands there are areas with peat soil and that's where they will really grow well but in most gardens the soil is not really suitable because it needs to heaven pH if it really needs to be acidic and it needs to have pH around four to five five and a half maximum so if your soil is more alkaline than your best bet is growing blueberries in containers and this is what I will recommend to my clients usually and that's also what we're doing here in our backyard and here I have some plants growing next to each other that you couldn't grow successfully in soil because they have such opposite requirements when it comes to soil acidity on one hand I have all these Mediterranean herbs such as rosemary thyme lavender here and these really need alkaline soil and then I have the blueberries right next to them which need acidic soil and in containers you can accommodate these their needs but you wouldn't be able to grow these next to each other in a garden these two plants I have here were planted in store-bought ericaceous compost that is suitable for acidic planted in acidic soil but the problem is the potting mix that you buy that is suitable for these is based peat-based and since Pete is a quite as a bit problematic resource I prefer to avoid it and I have experimented with creating my own potting mix for blueberries and I want to show you the results these are two varieties of blueberries growing in a potting mix that I made myself and when you want to do that it's often recommended to use pine needles which are acidic as their base composted pine needles so that's what I did mix with lots of compost because the blueberries need humans rich soil and you can see it's not going quite well the problem is that while pine needles are acidic when they're fresh or decomposing when they are fully decomposed they become quite neutral so in the beginning these plants were planted two years ago I think and they were for a year they were fine but then they started yellowing and that's that's a telltale sign of that the acidity is not appropriate for these plants I have two varieties here the taller one here is called gold trouble 71 you can see it's bearing quite a lot of fruits and it's not yellow unlike the other one so that probably means that it can adapt to a more alkaline soil than the other plant and that's sunshine blue so yeah not not really a success I'm afraid and if you have any tips for me how to avoid using peat I would appreciate that but for now I'm sticking to the commercial mate potting mix which is more suitable and much more successful here's the same variety sunshine blue that looks so miserable and yellow in my own potting mix here it's grown in commercial acidic potting mix and you can see how healthy and well it is looking and how laden with fruits it is it's going to give us a really good harvest this year it is also it is a Southern High bush variety which means it's partially evergreen so and also like most blueberries it has a lot of ornamental value it has pretty ping blossom in early in the year or in spring it it has lots of fruits and it even remains evergreen and there are other varieties like the gold rabbit that I showed you before that also have a really good fall color in the next pot I have a variety called pink lemonade and it's actually not a blueberry but a pink very maybe you can see the berries they're getting pink already but they're not ripe they will be they will ripen quite late in the season in August or September which will prolong our harvest season but you can see another problem another possible problem with blueberries and that's pollination the highbush blueberries are partially sell for child though they will give you a better yield when you have a pollinator but the pink lemonade is a cross between a northern highbush blueberry and a rabbit a blueberry and that's probably the reason that it's not getting pollinated by other blueberries and because the the plant flowered really profusely in spring and we have just a handful of berries on it so what I want to do is add a pollinator and the suitable one for this plant should be berry blue which also ripens even later in September possibly beginning of October so that's also a great thing that will prolong our season even more now two more things I want to mention and that's watering and container size when it comes to watering the don't never let your plants dry out they really need quite a lot of moisture especially when grown in containers they will dry out easily so right now when we have had no rain for weeks I'm watering them daily but I'm only watering them with rainwater that we catch in a rain but and the problem is our supply is getting quite low because there has been no rain in many many weeks so that's one another one its container size and same is true for all container grown plants give them as big a ghost container as you can and in blueberries it means at least 30 centimeters but possibly when the plants are older it's better to give them a bigger container and the bigger volume of potting mix also means that it will not dry out as easily so this is how we're growing blueberries in containers and the varieties that we have if you have any tips for me please leave them below and I hope you enjoyed this video if you did give it a thumbs up and I'll see you next time happy gardening", "yhMZLQIZ_0Y": "hey everyone welcome back to the awesomer channel today we'll be making more glass fruits using blueberries apples and Kiwis after this quick

like blueberries? If you don't like this berry's sour flavor,\nits amazing benefits might change your mind. Blueberries contain a series of nutrients,\nvitamins, and minerals that are essential for our bodies. An important aspect of this fruit is its intense\ncolor, which could be blue, brown, or a deep purple color, almost black. These colors come from the anthocyanins, the\ncomponent that gives blueberries their health benefits. Here are some of this fruit's health benefits: Blueberries fight urinary tract infections\nRecent studies have shown that blueberries have properties that help prevent and treat\nurinary tract infections. They reduce cholesterol levels\nNew studies performed at accredited laboratories in the United States, have revealed that blueberries\ncan lower bad cholesterol levels, and in many cases, are even more effective than medications\nprescribed by doctors. Since our cholesterol plays a big part in\nthe development of heart diseases, blueberries are great for our hearts. They fight cancer\nOur DNA is constantly being exposed to the day to day oxidative stress, caused by free\nradicals. The factors that contribute to our oxidation\nlevels are our diets and lifestyles. Countless studies have shown that blueberries,\nsince they're rich in antioxidants and other anti-cancerous properties, are great at preventing\nand fighting breast, colon, lung, esophagus, skin and intestine cancer. They improve digestion\nSince they are rich in fiber, blueberries are great for your digestion, and prevent\nproblems such as constipation. Furthermore, the vitamins, minerals and acids\npresent in the berries stimulate the gastric fluids, improving your digestion. They improve memory and coordination\nNormally, blueberries' antioxidants improve memory, coordination and prevent nervous system\ndiseases. Their nutrients, vitamins and minerals also\nprotect your brain cells and help restore your central nervous system. Studies have proven that this fruit can prevent\nAlzheimer's and combat memory loss, and the loss of cognitive abilities linked to age. They care for your vision\nSeveral studies performed in Europe have documented that blueberries have very high concentrations\nof vegetable compounds that improve night vision and reduce tired eyesight. Furthermore, this fruit can help prevent eye\nproblems, such as macular degeneration, cataracts, nearsightedness, farsightedness, dry eyes,\nand retinal infections. They improve your immunity\nStudies have shown that resveratrol, found in blueberries and grapes, is able to improve\nyour immune system. Furthermore, blueberries are rich in vitamin\nC, which promotes and stimulates several of our immune system's functions.", "d5mtwvkdwvM": "fresh-picked blueberries are a wonderful part of summer but i've had people wondering how do you clean your blueberries because you want to make sure that they're pretty germ free so after we've picked them and bring them home we take and mix white vinegar with cold water and be the rule of thumb is three cups of water to one cup of white vinegar so in here i have six cups of water and two cups of the white vinegar then you take your little colander and you gently fill it with a few blueberries you don't want to have an over full because if you do then you're going to have to run the risk of squishing them you put them down into the water bath and you just roll them around with your hands trying to just wiggle off all the germs and dirt that might be on there and the nice thing is you get a lot of the little tips the stems off too then bring them up roll them around in your colanders so you can try and get as much water off as possible and then you're going to take and lay them flat on a any type of a tray a metal tray could be a cake pan if you don't have trays covered with a paper towel just lay them as flat so they're only about one blueberry tall put them on there you can then roll through and find what other stems there might be left on them and as you roll them around you'll know that your paper towel will start picking up the moisture and it really doesn't take much there's a couple stems right there and if you find a green one that you don't want in it makes it easy to take them out and now you're going to have your blueberries drying depending on your home you know might take an hour or two to have them dry on the paper towel once they do then you're going to take and transfer them over onto another tray and what i would probably cover with the paper towel too as long as they're all nice and dry and then put them in your freezer so they're only one level thick probably freeze them about overnight and then you can either put them in a ziploc bag or i use a lot of the little glad one thin court ones but anyway that's the safest way to be able to wash your blueberries they are delicate so you don't want to stuff them you want to gently move them around because when you're gently doing it it's going to help them keep their nice firm shape and by the way the vinegar will also help them keep their shape even a little bit better so again you're wanting to use three cups three parts water cold water not hot water cold part hot water excuse me not hot but cold water to one part of white vinegar and they are amazing we just finished our blueberry picking from last year they're great in pancakes they're great in syrup they're in breads blueberry bread blueberry muffins um throw them in with banana bread and things like that or make a cobbler so enjoy your blueberries this season feel like they're nice and clean with a vinegar water bath have a good day bye bye", "Uc8kR0bkhnw": "hey good afternoon ever wanted to Joe from the northeastern native plant digest so yesterday I did a video on removing some Virginia's sweet spire and the reason I decided to take it out is because for one reason two reasons really it's not native to Ohio and the second reason was even in its in its native range it only supports one species of moth caterpillar and so to me I just wanted to remove some I took out about seven plants and you know I want to replace them or something else that's gonna have a higher ground value so in thinking about that you know I've been looking at a lot of different candidates and what I've settled on is is blueberries so I'm going to be planting three lowbush blueberries today and that's what we're going to be talking about in this video so loop low bush blueberries vaccinium angustifolia is related to the highbush blueberry you know they produce the same edible fruits that we all know and love you know these fruits are I apologize for the traffic today these fruits are you know delicious people love them birds love them they're rich in antioxidants you know so that's that's one very good reason to plan blueberries another reason is that they are native to Ohio they're native to Summit County where I live so but this particular variety the low Bush it only tops out at about two feet tall and two feet wide so you talk about a lot smaller shrub compared to the highbush blueberries which can get to be you know six to eight feet so so you know this is gonna hope and this is gonna make a nice ground cover another reason that I like it and I want to use it is that it gets in a beautiful fall color nice Burgundy's in red so it's gonna complement you know shrubs that I'm gonna plant it next to like witch hazel the turn yellow another great reason to plant this plant is that it's pollinated by native bees so it's a good nectar source for native bees and and one of the main reasons is that this blueberry plants actually support about 223 different species of butterfly and moth caterpillar and a couple those those butterflies that of course are the red spotted Admirals Snowberry clear wing and the apple Sphinx you can find out more information at the National Wildlife Federation's plant finder website and I'm gonna put a link in the description okay so that being said I'm gonna go ahead and pause this video and we're going to go out and plant these and I'm really excited today I've been waiting for these in the mail and we're gonna get these planted I'll meet you out back alright I'm back so I'm gonna be planting these in front of this witch hazel that I have here it turns a nice yellow color in the fall and I thought these with their burgundy colors will fill in nicely here one thing about blueberries in general is that they do like acidic soil they like looser soil now that's one thing I'm a little concerned with here because this soil it does have a little bit more clay in it I dug out some soil some holes here I mended it with some compost with some peat moss so we're gonna see how they do here so I'm just gonna go ahead and get that in here fill it in and over time you know as more leaves decompose around these it's gonna Brett help break up the soil let's get these other two planet here so I think this is the biggest one I'm gonna put this one in the middle here somebody's down someone nice now these these spots that I had here I had Virginia sweets by here so I took these out I took the Virginia sweets buyer and I'm putting in the blueberries in hopes that they fill in this area and give me a nice pop of color in the fall not only do I hope they give me a nice fall color but I'm hoping that they attract caterpillars and some fruit wouldn't be bad either really the fruit for me is secondary I ate some of the ones from my highbush blueberries but most of the birds probably got and that's okay all right so that's all I got for you today this is a lowbush blueberry vaccinium and Gustov folium hope you like this video subscribe to my channel leave your requests leave your

are blue berry trees by the way I used to not like blueberries I grew up around them harvesting them amongst other things and I hated blueberries I didn't like the taste of them it's just something about them that I didn't like and as I became a man and got out of my childish waist and I began to like so I just love blueberries because of the benefits that I found out that they have I'm kind of that way now because when I find out something is high in health benefits then I just I just can't forget about how it tastes because I'm all about the health benefits right so I'm gonna talk about

are the Fountain of Youth that's not me just making something up if you do research additional research you'll find that out that blueberries will give you and help support overall healthy living essentially they are the Fountain of Youth so get your blueberries please because I'll just pick the whole cup full this is prime look your best do your best be your best [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "S4_tvkWk25E": "WE'RE HERE TODAY AT A MICHIGAN BLUEBERRY FIELD. COME SEE WHAT'S GROWING! Hi, my name is Larry Bodtke and we're here on one of our family's farms in Grand Junction, Michigan. Our family has been in business since 1969 when my parents first started our farm and then it\npassed along to the second generation which three of us were actively involved\nmy brother and my sister and I and now we've got four people from the third\ngeneration of our family that are actively involved in our farm.\nWe're here in a field of a variety that we call Aurora. We've got about 30\ndifferent varieties here on our farm. There's hundreds of varieties in the\nnation.  This is a late season fresh variety that we have harvested twice\nalready and we'll probably harvest them two more times.\nBlueberries along with cranberries and concord grapes are three fruits that are\nnative to the United States and blueberries are a wetland plant and so\nwe need to keep plenty of moisture to them. We have overhead irrigation in this\nfield. Again about 50% of our acreage is harvested by hand and 50% by mechanical\nharvesters and a lot of that depends on what variety it is and whether we've\ntargeted it for the fresh market that you'll find in your grocery stores or if\nit's something that goes to the process market where you might find berries and\na pie or Pop-Tarts, yogurt, smoothies different things like that and so we'll\nharvest this field again here in just a day or two and this field will be hand\nharvested.  And what we look for in fresh blueberries is a bigger size and what we\ncall \"the bloom\" on a berry the nice powdery blue look to\nthem and with a process variety that's not\nquite as important because a lot of times in the process variety you don't\neven really see the berry.  Fresh berries and process berries are all of equal\nhealth to you blueberries are high in antioxidants and\nthey are very good for your health.  We enjoy being in the blueberry business\nand being out in nature I have one of the best jobs on the farm as the harvest\nmanager I get to go out to the fields and check the berries and see if they're\nready for picking and ready--have the right amount of ripeness--and they're\nready to go.\nCAMERAMAN: So are these ready? \nLARRY: These are ready I certainly enjoy that part of the\njob there's a lot of things that go into growing blueberries these bushes: that\nwere standing by here are about 10 years old and we've got some bushes on our\nfarms that are as much as maybe 80 years old now everything that you see above\nthe ground even on those 80 year old bushes are probably not more than 10 or\n12 years old because we go in and prune bushes every year and so that sparks new\ngrowth from the cut of the old cane we take an old cane out and a new cane will\nsprout up from there and so our premium production comes off of canes anywhere\nbetween 7 and 10 years old and so even I'm like I say on those old bushes\neverything that you see there is probably only 8 to 10 to 12 years old\nthe blueberries grow in acidic soil we like a pH between 4.8 and 5.2\nyou know most of your other grain crops will grow in six and a half or seven pH\nsoils so blueberries like an acidic soil they like to have moisture but they\ndon't like to be have their roots in wet soils all the time they need to dry out\na little bit and then we put more water on and takes a lot of different things\nto manage your blueberry crop besides harvesting we go clear back to\nthe beginning if we want to plant a new field we have to order from a nursery\nprobably about eighteen months in advance we have to let them know how\nmany plants that we need and what variety and then we'll prepare the field\nfor planting once we get the plants we generally plant in the fall because\nthat's when the soils are dry enough to get into a lot of times in the spring\nit'll be too wet but we'll go into the field and mound up a ridge with a\nmachine and plant about fifteen hundred bushes per acre so these are planted\nhere on about a three and a half by ten spacing and so you get them planted and\nthen you have to nurse them along for about three to five years before you\neven start to get a crop off of them and they don't really develop into full\nproduction until they get into about the seventh or eighth year so if you are\ninterested in planting your own blueberries it's a it's a long term\ninvestment it's a long term thing to wait out the time it takes when you'll\nactually be able to enjoy them we how would this field look different in the\nspring how much different is that would it look so in the spring we have you\nknow all the leaves are gone and you just have the wood and then when spring\ncomes along and temperatures get warm enough the leaf buds\nstart to pop out and then also you have blossoms and you have every every berry\nwas a blossom at one time and all the blossoms of a blueberry need to be\npollinated by some type of insect we mostly use honeybees that we actually\nrent from beekeepers and they bring in hives of thousands of bees so we they\nstay in the field the bloom will stay there for about four to six weeks and\nthe bees stay there and they visit the flowers and transfer the pollen from one\nflower to another and that's what helps blueberries get bigger and produce a\nbetter crop once the once the bees are done doing their work with the blossoms\nthe blossom falls off and just you'll start with a very little green berry and\nit sizes up over the over the course of the next eight to ten weeks and pretty\nsoon it starts to turn pink and then blue and then I come out and taste them\nand make sure they're ready to go how has this year's crop down we've had a\nnice crop this year I wouldn't call it a bumper crop but it's been a good crop\nthe winters of 2013 and 14 if you remember we're very cold here in\nMichigan and that hurt our crops and even some of our bushes and the bushes\nhave recovered from that now and we've got a very nice crop this summer there's\nbeen an abundant supply of blueberries here particularly in the state of\nMichigan and really all over North America and we're pleased to bring those\nto your table and we we mark at all of our berries wholesale we don't have any\nretail outlets like some of our neighbors do\nyou can go into just about any of your local grocery stores and find find\nblueberries in there and enjoy them like I say they're they're very healthy and\nvery tasty blueberries are one of those fruits that you don't have to peel or\npoor or pit you can you can buy off the shelf take them home rinse and start\nstart eating so it's it's one of the greatest things to be able to be a\nfarmer and be out here and God's wonderful nature and be able to produce\nsomething that's healthy and consumers generally enjoy", "64Le4BNjvJA": "[Music] so this is the lineup going to strawberry

this involves a sweet biscuit topping kind of crunchy on the top and almost cake like underneath with the fruit and bumble berry isn't actually a type of berry it's a mix or a jumble of berries whatever happens to be in season but instead of just using berries you want to have a little bit of fresh pear or even apple because if you cook just berries into a cobbler they'll collapse into virtually nothing the pear absorbs the juices the color and the flavor and gives your cobbler structure so I'll add my 4 cups of fruits now I have some berry jam and you really can be flexible here any type of berry jam you have on hand I'm looking for about half a cup but the idea is instead of adding granulated sugar I'm just gonna use the jam to sweeten the berries but also the pectin within the jam helps thicken the sauce a little bit and just add a splash of vanilla and you're just looking to coat the berries try not to mash them up too much they will bake down there we go and now I'm ready to put them in the dishes I've got individual ramekins here and you really can use just about any type of vessel you wish all right now these are filled I'm ready to make the cobbler topping I'll start with a cup and a half of all-purpose flour and since I'm making a biscuit not a cake you don't need to sift your ingredients three tablespoons of sugar a teaspoon and a half of baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of salt I'll just give this a little stir with my fingers and I've already cut up 6 tablespoons of unsalted butter it's not ice-cold from the fridge that way it's easier to work in with my hands first I coat them and then I start squishing them into the flour a little bit should be an even crumbly texture there we go all right now I'll get the wet ingredients ready what I like about all these desserts is that they tend to be made with ingredients you have on hand like 6 tablespoons of milk so that would be 3 ounces and then since I only put 3 tablespoons of sugar in the dough I'm gonna add a little added sweetness with 2 tablespoons of maple syrup a single egg yolk for a little richness and just a teaspoon of vanilla just blend that together and I add it all at once to the bowl you might find if you've made scones or biscuits before that this is a little softer than your typical scone dough which you would roll out and cut into wedges this is why it's more on the cakey side less on the flaky side and then I'll just use my spatula and you want to doll up your bits of cobbler topping on so you're not looking to completely cover the fruit you want to allow room for steam to escape just like so because this will expand a lot as it bakes I definitely call this family of desserts rustic which is why you can't be afraid to get your hands in there a little bit there we go that is just the right amount the finishing touch before this goes into the oven it's just a little sprinkling of sugar right on top that just adds to that crunch on top of each cobbler so when your spoon goes through it cracks through the top breaks into the cake and then discovers the gooey fruit underneath beautiful now this is ready for the oven it takes a hotter oven 375 and I give it about 30 minutes to bake and it'll turn a nice rich golden brown on top [Music] [Music] Oh beautiful and it's amazing it's such a familiar and comforting smell but completely different from that apple crisp all about the berries and the vanilla and even the buttery biscuit topping now what's important is to check the doneness just break between a couple of the cobbler droplets and when you see it's cakey all the way through to the bottom oh and look those beautiful juices then you know it's perfectly cooked and because the dish is hot I want to put it on a saucer just like the apple crisp it is best to let this cool for about 15 minutes before you eat it oh look at that absolutely delicious", "WIYqehVEQTU": "blueberry fruits a cropland org there is another video about how to sew on flowers and this is the moment about fruits I will do another video about the plants so in order to get a fruit you need chilling hours it's very important and you need to give the right condition that I said it is another video sorry and so about the fruits main mainly most of the fruits of what it will be in the spring and the summer I have from the beginning of the spring until the end of the summer late August even September rarely a major pest rzf is pairs of course and other insect it doesn't matter you don't really need to protect it if you grow it outside of the zone there isn't major pest mostly I eat it by myself I don't really know about past here and I don't feel them but I have problem with cold and pH and the heat that it's crazy that kills some plants in the Sun and then it's a really the hot summer days it's take minimum two years to three years to bear some fruits mine started after a really small amount in the first two years in the first after two years after three years it was like it was very lame I gave it a little bit more Sun and I gave it a acid soil and I took care of the condition and stood that something I done wrong right now it's bearing a lot of fruit it's a really big amount for this area of course it if you live in a very cool area and you have the amazing condition it will bring much more fruits in here it's very a lot of fruits I still didn't done with it anything else except to eat it because I just loved it and of course you can do so many things with the blueberry and I know that a lot of people apparently doesn't like the taste don't like the taste or e yeah so if you don't like the test it means that you better blueberry so switch by new varieties the better start with cuttings or plans to buy something that you know that fit for your area and of course the flavors because there is so much good flavors and I saw that a lot of times they sell horrible flavors of blueberry so it's you know the only things that you can do from this it's not really true just everything else except it so mine are so good here and I choose a good variety and now I started some new variety to try them but if the won't be good I will start another one and again and again just grow something good because there is in the market very very good and tasty and you don't need to make it just gems or cakes or whatever that's all from grow

of joy baking calm today we're going to make buttermilk berry muffins and as the name implies these muffins are just bursting with fresh berries and they also have a really nice moist and tender crumb so to start pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit that's 190 degrees Celsius and then you will need a 12-cup muffin pan and either line it with paper liners like I have done here or you could just simply butter or even lightly spray with an on cook vegetable spray and then these muffins are really easy to make we have mixed the dry ingredients together in one bowl and the wet ingredients together in another and just mix the two together and we're done we don't need any electric mixer for these muffins so we'll start with the dry ingredients you will need two and a half cups that's 325 grams of white all-purpose flour and to that add 3/4 of a cup that's 150 grams of granulated white sugar and then 2 teaspoons of baking powder and a half a teaspoon of baking soda and a quarter teaspoon of salt and just whisk that together or stir it you want to make sure all that baking powder and baking soda is all mixed in with the flour and then you need either the zest of an orange or a lemon either one and I this microplane is really handy tool to get the the outer skin off of the fruit and just stir that in okay the either orange or lemon just really kind of perks up the flavors of the berries it's a nice addition to these muffins and then you will need about one and a half to two cups which is three hundred and sixty milliliters to four hundred and eighty and you can use fresh like any two I've used here blueberries and raspberries and blackberries you know you could use one fruit different a whole bunch of fruit and I'm using the fresh now you could use frozen berries do not defrost them before you add them to the flower and just keep in mind that if you're using frozen your muffins will take a little longer obviously to bake and then just gently toss the berries in the flour mixture and that's it for the dry and then for the wet we need one cup that's 240 milliliters of buttermilk if you don't you can buy like a buttermilk powder that you just kind of add add to and use water with that or you could just take a cup of milk and add stir in like a tablespoon of either vinegar or lemon juice and leave it to sit for ten minutes before using and that's just as good as buttermilk and then you need a large egg and then just lightly beat that I'm going to break it up a bit and just add that to your buttermilk and then we need 1/2 a cup 120 milliliters of flavorless oil now you can use a vegetable corn canola even a safflower or you can even use a light olive oil and last we need 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract now a lot of muffins use butter and milk and what for this one we're using buttermilk and oil and what this does is give them up in a really nice moist and tender crumb a little bit of Tang from that buttermilk which is nice with the berries whisks all that and then just add it pour it into your dry ingredients and then I'm just using going to use my spatula to fold all this in and kind of be gentle especially if you're using frozen berries because you don't want the berries to bleed too much and color your batter end up with blue muffins although they still taste really good even if that happens and there you're going to have a little of that especially with frozen berries and as always just stir until you all the flour is moistened you don't want to over mix this because if it's you over makes you the muffins tend to be just a little tough which we don't want okay so there we have it now I like to use a an ice cream scoop to pour put the batter into the muffin cups but two spoons does just as good a job and you want to really fill these these are going to be quite urghhh muffins because they don't rise that much so now if you don't want really large you could just fill them both 3/4 full and you'll probably get about 14 or 16 muffins throwing nice for breakfast or packing the kids lunches okay so into the oven between 20 and 25 minutes he'll turn nice golden-brown and a toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean so are buttermilk berry muffins are now done as you can see they're a lovely golden brown color and a toothpick inserted into the center will come out clean now just let these cool for a little bit and then they're ready to serve course muffins are always at the best the day they are made but you can cover and store them for a few days or they you could even freeze them so until next time I'm Stefanie George gave joy baking calm", "rtvTNhaVvoQ": "hi and welcome to the wish farm fairy kitchen today we are gonna to different snacks using Aries and Greek yogurt the first is going to be bark kind of think of peppermint bark that we make around the holiday time but instead we're using Greek yogurt and berries so the kids will love it and it's really healthy and the second one are going to be individual bearing bite dips in the Greek yogurt mixture so to get started first we're gonna start with 16 ounces of nonfat plain Greek yogurt so then we're gonna pour about 4 tablespoons of honey your choice of honey next up is the juice from half a lemon pour that right in it'll cut the sweetness just a little bit but it's a perfect combination and then 2 to 3 drops of vanilla extract so that's our Greek yogurt mixture give that a good stir we're gonna take an 8x8 pan and I recommend taking parchment paper and laying it down inside so we're gonna take our Greek yogurt mixture and pour it on in make sure it's nice and smooth and laid out evenly half a pound of fresh fish farms blueberries and you're just gonna sprinkle these throughout laying them right on top half a pound of a wish farm strawberries now time to pop it in the freezer for 4 hours so while our berry bark is freezing we are going to do the individual berry bites which is perfect for kids this would be so fun to do as a family project too so we do need a cookie sheet and either too thick or I have some skewers here it's gonna put a blueberry on the in averse viewer roll it in the Greek yogurt mixture and then pop it off onto the cookie sheet so for the strawberry bite you do want to place them so they're a little thinner and just dip them on in you're gonna lay them right on the cookie sheet so once I get these berries out on the tray I'm gonna put them in the freezer for about 20 minutes and they will freeze pretty quickly all right our berry Greek yogurt bar has been sitting patiently in the freezer for about four hours so remember we put the parchment paper down inside the pan first just to make it easier to take out now you're going to peel the paper back time to break up the bark so take a large knife and very carefully we are going to break it up this is such a sweet treat your berry bark is done but don't forget about our individual berry fights which are still in the freezer little cuties we've got our frozen blueberries and strawberries dipped in that same Greek mixture but that's part about these as you can stick them straight into a baggie throw them in the freezer and you can just snack on them all week long two frozen treats for you to try out thank you so much for watching and for your love of fresh berries", "NeCQAnS854s": "[Music]

garden today I'm gonna show you how to plant blueberries I'm gonna plant three plants now it's a great time it's early September I have a good 90 days if not longer before my ground really freezes this will let the new plants establish these are one gallon blueberries and I actually got them at Lowe's they were three for $21 that's a pretty good price for this size plant number one the most important thing with blueberries is you need two varieties in order to get nice big clumps blueberries you want them to cross pollinate and if you don't if you only use one variety you'll get blueberries but they're kind of small and you know scrawny looking I'm planting two star blueberries and the other one is blueberry sunshine blue now your blueberries can get four to six feet tall if you want to grow your blueberries to full size you really want to plant them about four feet apart five feet apart and put them into place that gets six hours plus of sunlight I'm gonna put them into my raised bed this is a eight foot raised bed I'm gonna plant them about two and a half feet across and I want them to grow into a hedge I'll get plenty of blueberries but I'm not growing for them to get to the massive size so they're gonna be put together or they're gonna be planted a little bit more closely together than you would if you want them to get to full size the second most important thing to know about blueberries is they love soil that has a higher I'm sorry a lower pH value or more acidity so in the case of blueberry here you want to respect what they like soil wise and that's a more acidic soil or a lower pH value to set the soil up I'm going to show you how I do it but we're going to put down an organic fertilizer staying around the five five five don't where if you're a little bit higher a little bit low it's basically a couple handfuls in this space right down the center I've scraped away the wood mulch that I use to the outer part and I'll put that back after we set the soil up good to put down one bag of soil conditioner this is a leaf grow that's really locally available in my area Maryland zone seven it has a high huma's content great for drainage great for organic matter you want your blueberries to be in the soil that has that yeah I always get confused I was want to say a high pH value but it's a low pH value and it's acidic you want it to drain well and we're also going to use a water soluble fertilizer for acid loving plants and that's by Miracle Grow if you don't like that company go ahead and find a different product but we're going to really respect the acidity needs of blueberries we're also going to use peat moss in the planting hole we'll put in maybe three or four shovel fulls of the peat moss that's more acidic so we're going to give the plants exactly what they need to get them established and growing and again you can plant them in the fall you know you want at least 90 days of time for the ground to be able to not freeze and really let the roots grow and get established and come spring you'll have some nice growth I probably won't get a lot of blueberries next year but I'm doing this now looking two years down the line okay let's get to planting so it's pretty straightforward if you have mulch down with mulch pull it back because you don't want to mix wood mulch into your soil it will actually compete for nitrogen with the root plants as it decays to pull the shredded hardwood back in this case away from your planting area I put down one bag of the leaf grow just across there this is an organic fertilizer 5-5-5 one handful sprinkle it on the first third one handful middle third one handful over there and that's just to put this into the soil now let it break down over the fall winter it'll be there for the plant come spring we're going to plant these about two and a half feet apart try right there and right there and we're going to add the peat moss this is the easiest way to do it three shovel pulls in each planting area and I would go ahead and do that for each one but I'm just going to show you how I'm setting it up now turn that under and this will help get the pH a little bit lower a little more acidic and that is the general setup for the raise bet so let's plant one of them now I have two of the same variety the like varieties one will go here one will go here and the other one will go right in the middle dig your hole another thing at Peapod maybe like a tooth tune-up fertilizer mix it into a nice depth let me make sure I grab the right variety you're going to plants to the same level of the container to right there where my pinky is we'll take all the tags off later press it in and we got the first plant established I will do it for the rest of them and we'll come back and we'll water them with the water-soluble fertilizer and I'll talk about that okay we have them planted we respected their need for more acidity in the soil now we're gonna water them in with a liquid fertilizer and I'm gonna do this once a month for September October and November then let them go please subscribe to my channel because I shoot all my videos in real time so as I'm doing things in my garden you could be doing them in your garden also I'm in Maryland zone 7 and I will be showing you how to care for these how to take care of them so birds don't get the blueberries and all that kind of stuff two gallon container just followed the liquid fertilizer instructions as stated if you don't like Miracle Grow pick a different company but you want a water soluble fertilizer that adds acidity to the soil each of these are gonna get 3/4 of a gallon just water them in just like that give them what they need and then come back and water them in a little bit more with just regular regular water from your hose now just real quick these are the two different varieties that's the star blueberry on the outside and you can see that leaf is different than the leaf here so there are two different varieties and the planting area do not forget that you don't want to put all of the same variety in one area you need two different varieties so pollination will cross and your blueberries will be bigger and plumper hope you enjoyed the video please check out my seed shop at WWDC garden com thanks", "v7rRvZGYhWw": "\"Benefits of Blueberries for Artery Function\" A single serving of blueberries can\nhelp mediate the arterial dysfunction induced by smoking a cigarette. They investigated the effect of a single serving of frozen\nblueberries on young smokers. Smoke a single cigarette, and the\nability of your arteries to relax naturally drops 25% within two hours. But eat 2 cups of blueberries\na hundred minutes before, and that same cigarette causes\nless than half the damage, demonstrating that a single\nbig serving of frozen blueberries could counteract the artery\ndysfunction induced by smoking. However, of course, it should be\nnoted that blueberry consumption cannot be considered a means of preventing health consequences\ndue to smoking; this can only be realized\nby stopping smoking or even better, not smoking\nin the first place. Two cups of blueberries is a lot, though. Yeah, you could easily chug\nthose down in a smoothie, but what's like the minimum dose? We didn't know until a group of British\nresearchers decided to put it to the test. To enable them to do a double-blind study, they had to create a placebo\ncontrol fake blueberry drink. So they used a freeze-dried\nwild blueberry powder to give people the equivalent of three-quarters of a cup\nof fresh blueberries, one and a half cups,\none and three-quarters, about 3 cups, or 4 cups. They concluded blueberry intake acutely improves artery function\nin an intake-dependent manner. OK, so what's the optimal intake? After the placebo, nothing happens. But after eating one and three-quarter\ncup's worth of blueberries, a big spike in artery function improvement\nwithin just one hour of consumption. And that seems to be where\nthe effect maxes out. Less than a cup is good, but\nbetween 1 and 2 cups seems better, with no benefit going beyond\nthat in a single meal. Can you cook them? What if you put them in a\nblueberry pie or something? The same remarkable improvement\nin artery function baked into a bun,\njust spiking an hour later, since solid food passes more\nslowly through your stomach. And then if you eat blueberries week after\nweek, you get chronic benefits, too, in terms of reduced artery stiffness and\na boost in your natural killer cells, which are one of your\nbody's natural first lines of defense against viral\ninfections and cancer. But wait a second, how can blueberries\nhave all these amazing effects, if the anthocyanins, the blue pigments\nin blueberries purported to be the active ingredients, hardly\neven make it into our system? Women were given more than\na cup of blueberries to eat, and they couldn't find hardly any in their\nbloodstream or flowing through their urine. Here's what's called a chromatogram, with the spikes showing all the little\nanthocyanin peaks in blueberries. Here's your blood before eating blueberries:\nobviously no signs of the pigments. After one hour, you start to see them appear, and a few hours after that\nthey become a bit more distinct, but, all in all, just a few billionths\nof a gram per milliliter show up. So either anthocyanins are extremely potent, and therefore active at low parts-per-billion\nblood concentrations or somehow their bioavailability\nhas been underestimated. So researchers decided to radioactively tag\nthem and trace them throughout the body. What happens is that blueberry\npigments are metabolized by our liver and our microbiome,\nthe good bacteria in our gut, into these active metabolites that are\nthen what's absorbed into our system. So it's kind of a team effort\nto benefit from berries. And that would solve this mystery as well. Anyone notice this second\nspike in benefit over here at 6 hours? How does that make sense? Well, some of the metabolites peak\nin the bloodstream within an hour, but others ramp up more slowly, especially if the berries have to make\nit all the way down to the colon. And it's not just spikes\nat 1 hour and 6 hours. If you track them out even\nfurther, some go up even more. So like a day later you may still\nbe experiencing berry benefits as our gut bacteria continue\nto churn out goodies that get absorbed back into our\nsystem, feeding us as we feed them. Eating blueberries can so\nfeed our good bacteria that it's like taking a natural\nprobiotic, a win-win all around.", "hzwv57qAs_0": "good morning everyone this is david to grow and eat this

the side over here that actually gets the sun most of the sun directly on it and as you can see the number of blueberries here is mind-boggling now i built this i put poles in the ground drilled holes half inch pvc then built these tops and then there are one two three four 14 by 14 pieces of netting protecting all of this and what i did was right here there's a little thin area here that i can get into so that's my entrance in so i'm gonna get the tripod and get it set up and then wiggle my way in and we'll start seeing how the blueberries look all right i've made my little hole here and i'm inside and to start with i just put the container underneath and let them pluck and fall this will work for a good while the size of the blueberries is at least twice what you see in the grocery store but the clusters are just magnificent but the beauty of your own blueberries is a lot like the beauty of strawberries and this variety is many many years old we've got it at a master gardener plant sale and these have this particular one has very very few seeds always welcome these blueberries down low decide to go get me a chair absolutely beautiful absolutely beautiful these are not quite as big as the other bush so we'll need to see what a triple tastes like oh they are just as sweet though so we can sit here immense the bugs in the bushes look at that one what a beauty [Music] another nice batch of three that will never see the inside of the house now these are a little bit on the downslope from the garden so they get some water run off and i'm using only organic fertilizers and mostly worm teas and stuff so i don't know how much fertilizer runoff they get but it's incredibly good soil right here so other than that i may give them a little warm tea but that's pretty much it we've had an excessive amount of rain this year which i think is why they're so nice of huge huge size yet usually when you get really big fruit they don't taste very good these are outstanding these are the blueberries and it's just amazing what an incredible number of blueberries and the really the really cool part is look at the size of them look how big they are not like the grocery store at all look at these gotta back the camera up to get them all in the picture oh here is the fun part oh until you've picked the blueberry and popped it in your mouth less than a minute later who just never really had a blueberry and they're easy to grow and they'll grow from north florida i think all the way into canada why are you denying yourself this i really need to stop this and start picking for taking in the house oh absolute that was a giant handful time to get back to the picking easiest way i push the netting up so i can get in here the easiest way to do it is to just push them off and let them drop into the bowl when there's a lot of them when it's onesie twosies you can pick them but when there's lots of them you just won't want to plop in the bowl", "0IJdf0WQFrM": "[Music]

breakfast, snacks, and desserts", "ZxuTJ6Quta4": "welcome to Norris farms 1/8 Norse sales director and Barry plant expert today I'm going to demonstrate how to properly plan and plant your blueberries planning starts with a soil test to determine your pH we also want to create the soil as a weed free and high organic content for your blueberries we also want to have wood chips seasoned three to six months or older we have our soil sulfur 90% there's several products out there that are only 50% so make sure you have 90 percent elemental sulfur the combination of the sulfur and the wood chips feeds the microbes to lower your pH we want to make sure that the carbon compounds that we add and I like wood chips because they have no nitrogen we want no nitrogen a lot of potting soil have nitrogen it has calcium to raise the pH we want pure unadulterated carbon compounds leaves peat moss but wood chips sustain for the longest time in our planning guide we discussed preparing a 1 foot square area for your plant this is adequate however I believe preparing an entire area 3 to 4 foot wide the entire length of your bed with the woodchips at 25 to 50 percent in a depth of 6 to 8 inches is what's going to make your blueberry planting fabulous the easiest way to incorporate the wood chips is with a shovel the shovel is about six to eight inches deep we can dig out the soil we can pull in the woodchips we can stir that up it's not a big job we bring back the soil put in some more wood chips again we're creating a soil that is 25 to 50 percent carbon compounds wood chips and it can be any kind of wood chip hardwood softwood we just don't like cedar and black walnut we're gonna broadcast our sulfur over the entire area not just where we're planting because your root zone will eventually get three or four feet from the center of the bed in the planting guide we have a chart that tells you exactly how many pounds of sulfur per square foot to add to to correct the pH now this isn't instantaneous it takes six to 18 months if we can do this in the fall of the year we'll have a head start but this process only occurs with the soil microbes during soil temperatures above 50 degrees we talked about adding peat moss to the hole prior to planting the peat moss needs to be pre wet it did it can't be dry or it'll dry out your plant so we pre wet the peat moss we make our hole the one foot one shovel maybe two we poured some peat moss in and mix that or some more peat moss in so we're putting in approximately a half a square foot or a fifty percent peat moss with the wood chips and the peat moss we're ready to plant our plant comes seller wrapped this is a two year old dormant bare-root plant and we want to be careful not to disturb the roots too much we dig a hole and put the plant soil contact is really critical we don't want it fluffy we want it packed in and especially around the top of the plant we want at least a half inch to one inch of soil covering the plugs so it doesn't dry out the last part we add wood chips to dress it off we can put three four inches around the plant and the entire bed with all the wood chips we're gonna create a weed free zone the plants going to be really happy we got water going into the soil from the woodchips and we have our plug covered over with the soil so it doesn't dry out a well planted blueberry will last 30 to 40 years and deliver hundreds of pounds of blueberries you", "NeikYD7SQgM": "welcome to Hort tube my name is jim putnam this is the final video in my how to grow blueberry series we've covered this the basics of blueberries container planting blueberries how to pick blueberries how to plant them in the ground and this final episode I'm going to cover propagation I have shot another series on propagation which I'm going to link right here I would advise that you watch that because I'm going to go pretty quickly through the details of propagating blueberries I won't cover every single detail of how to propagate things in this video and that video series has over 10 videos and would be very very helpful I'm going to put this flat that I'm sticking these blueberries in into a mist house which I showed how to construct in the other series if you'll follow along with that you'll see how to do that I'm also going to stick some in a more basic little high humidity structure I'll show you that at the end of the video so let's get started so let's cover the basics of what I'm using I'm actually using a 50 sell trade these are 50 individual cells in these trays the mix I used in here is 50% peat moss and 50 percent perlite you can route pretty much anything in that I cover that in the other series if you want to take a look at that there's some additional things you could use if you want to but for these blueberries 50 percent peat 50 percent perlite is absolutely perfect kind of hard to wet the peat moss so it takes me a couple times watering this I just watered just like three times to get this thoroughly wet throughout the entire depth of the media I'm using dip and growth which is a liquid rooting hormone you could use a powder if you choose to the cuttings are being taken in early summer which is kind of the ideal time to be taking the cuttings we're using semi hardwood cuttings which I'll show you in just a second and for that we use one part dip and grow mixed with ten parts water I just cut down a little plastic cup to use as my saucer to dip the cuttings into I definitely label every tray that I ever make that labels tend to stick up too high and will block the water from getting to the flat so I'll usually cut them in half and mark them with the variety there are hundreds and hundreds of varieties of blueberries so it's important that whatever blueberry plant you're taking the cuttings off of especially if you're going to sell them obviously be keeping them for yourself it doesn't matter what variety it is if you have any intent seldom you need to know what variety it is it's very important we make sure we use a permanent marker of some kind because anything else will get washed off very easily in a very wet humid propogation setting and I'm using this pair of corona snips they're AG 4930 all of these items I have linked below in the description of this video if you're interested in taking a look at them and getting them for yourself so now I'm going to show you how I went about collecting these cuttings so here's a blueberry plant like you would purchase from any nursery you can take cuttings off blueberries planted in the ground but if you're going to I would make sure you fertilize them in the late winter early spring the year you're going to take the cuttings on them and make sure they're very vigorous if they're anemic or off-colored or have disease issues or just not thriving you'll get a very low percentage on your rooted cuttings these container plants you can see this plant was cut right about here in the late winter we're not very concerned about getting blueberries on the plants in the nursery we're trying to get nice full plants and it has grown from the time it leaped out in April until now it's probably grown 14 inches this wood that is now green right here that's kind of firm it's a little more difficult to bend it is the absolute perfect material to use for rooted cuttings this material up at the top is very soft and it will route you could actually route this material but it's kind of difficult it takes absolutely perfect conditions to do so so I usually will dispose of that material and use this piece from here down to here and we can probably get three even four cuttings off of one of these single stems so this is a pile of cuttings I had collected earlier this centerpiece in this one I'll collect that whole piece but I'm not going to use the center part of this it's an older piece of wood and we'll definitely root much slower it will route but I'd like to take consistent cuttings and I'll take this year's growth that's maybe two months old it's very important that we keep this material moist I'll usually keep a mist bottle close by and hit these occasionally if I've got them laying out on a table or just keep them in a plastic bag I showed how to collect cuttings in a plastic bag in one of the videos and the other backyard plant propagation series videos if you want to take a look at that but I'll take this piece and just come back to this main stem with the object of just disposing of this Center heavier woody stem I'll discard that this material here is actually hardened off all the way to the top I don't have any new growth on this I could actually take this one all the way to the top I'd like to have a couple of places where I'm removing leaves right on the bottom of the cutting like this the area where that is wounded is a plot spot that will play get roots from I'll keep about two leaves maybe even three I'm going to keep three leaves on this one that's an ideal cutting right there I'll put a fresh cut angled cut on the bottom of it and then if you want to you can go along the bottom and just scrape off the side of that cutting but this is an ideal piece it's a slightly rigid piece of material from this year's growth that I took off a very vigorous plant which is very important I'm going to dip that into the dip and grower for just a second tap that off a little bit and then when I put this into this tray I'm only going to stick this cutting about halfway down and pinch it in it's very tempting to slam these cuttings all the way to the bottom but the bottom area of these flats is way too wet and you will get disease issues if you do that the roots for the most part will just come out near the surface anyway and root downward so it doesn't really even do you any good to anchor them all the way to the bottom but again I'll take the bottom two leaves off of this one put an angled cut on it scrape it off let's make a little scrape like that that's where we'll get our roots coming from is where we took these leaves off and where that cut is and where that scrape is I'll stick it in there and pinch it in now there's no real difference in blueberry varieties at all so once you learn this technique doesn't really matter what variety it is again the main issue with these blueberries is the best time to do it is in the early summer as this wood is slightly hardened off you can do hardwood cuttings in the winter time it's very possible you will get a very low percentage typically I'm going to take the bottom of that one off leaving three just like that taking my little piece off the side dipping it sticking in halfway and pinching it in I'm going to go ahead and fill out the rest of this tray okay I completed this flat most all these cuttings are very consistent across the whole flat I put my label in here these are Tiffany berries so I just put TB on that tag and the month and year on there so I'll know when I stuck these cuttings I took some additional cuttings that I'm going to stick in a different technique that I'll show you that it's not quite as involved this plat right here is going to go into my mist system here's the flat of blueberries we did the other things that I've stuck in this house is a mixture of other flowering shrubs and trees and again you can follow that other backyard plant propagation series to learn how I built this little hoop house and how this irrigation works which will come on in just a second I'll show you that and then I'm going to show you our alternative technique for rooting these blueberries so there you go I've got it coming on about every seven minutes for just a few seconds here's the other technique I'm going to be using to route these blueberries I have about 10 or 12 more cuttings I'm going to put into here this is just a wooden frame it has a weed control fabric liner in it and then under this plastic container I've put the same mix into this flat as well which is the perlite and peat moss fifty-fifty after I put these cuttings in I'm going to stick them about halfway down in the soil and pinch them in exactly like I did on the flat after I put these in I'm going to put this back on it and I'm actually going to slide it under my deck I'm going to lift this cover up about once every few days and I'm just going to spray a little water under it and I'm going to seal it back up the main thing is that don't want this in the full Sun if this is in the full Sun it will definitely cook the cuttings that are under here all we're trying to do is hold some humidity in so here here our cuttings already prepped and ready to go and sticking them maybe inch down in there and pinching them in I'm giving plenty of room from the edge for this cover to not hit them when I put this cover on I'm gonna get about two rows of these blueberries and so we're going to have some in a little more sophisticated house and then some in just really a humidity chamber is all this amounts to but thank you for watching this video if you have any questions on routing blueberries or any other types of things that need to be routed fruit plants ask ask questions in the description of this video and I'll do a follow-up video later in the summer and show you how these have routed [Music]", "GL-EgloSROg": "welcome back to gooseberry homestead reba here so i'm out here and we're taking a look at the peach sorbet blueberry and we're going to do a quick taste testing and right up under here we've got a ripe blueberry i noticed it last night but i wanted to wait till today to try it so this is how it's looking go ahead and take it and then you can see how it looks so we'll do a quick taste testing all right oh wow i like the flavor of this one so i would um give it about a four for sweetness i will give it a four for size it's about a medium sized blueberry again this is a young blueberry plant right here and so um probably next year the blueberries might be a little bit bigger but uh yeah and then for um um flavor i'll give it a five it has a really good flavor now i also just brushed my teeth so it kind of made the flavor taste a little bit different but based on what flavor i did get i'm giving it a five it's a really pleasant flavor um this one's called peach sorbet and it goes through a transition of different colors as you can see from green to a reddish color than to a blue a dark blue so that's how this is looking i'm going to go ahead and put that back around kind of keep it protected from the robins so let's come down here and check and see how the um the jelly beans doing i think there's one in here it's not quite ready yet but we can take a peek and see how things are looking so it's getting close in a day or so we'll do a video on this one and while i have you guys for a moment i wanted to go ahead and just take a look and show you what i'm doing with the raspberries and the blackberries so yesterday and the day before i was doing some like uh downsizing i got rid of one of the um raspberries that i had here and i'm in the process of selling this blackberry this one is the marionberry and it has decent flavor but um the thorns are killer they're like you know like a rosebush thorn and um i know there are some other varieties that are bred to be thornless that are like ancestors of the marion and i um actually had a dream about one of them i had gotten some of them for my sister-in-law they called like the columbia star and so forth so there's um two different varieties that are baby offspring bread at a um oh at a university i think down in oregon and so columbia star and there was another one i can't remember it off the top of my head but i do have it on my computer um backed up so i know which what the other one is too but i just can't remember it off the top of my head but columbia star is one of them um and so that one is a thornless variety and so i'm really liking the thornless varieties for my garden now i picked up a loganberry last year this one is it here right here and all the berries had already ripened on it and it was advertised as a black raspberry and it really doesn't get as black as it shows here this actually shows you some black raspberries on this right here but the berries on this bush look nothing like the picture that they have depicted you know at the store um this ripens to a darker um purplish red color and it doesn't have like on raspberries it has that like dip inside where it comes off clean like a cone this takes after the um blackberries more and it doesn't make that concave inside it doesn't pull away like that it stays intact more like a blackberry so a little bit of false advertisement for a lot of the box stores who purchased the um these berries last year to sell and this year as well so just know that when you get your logan berries blackberries or raspberries that it's not going to look like what they're trying to advertise in the box stores so but it is a very good berry um it tastes more to me like a raspberry than a blackberry so that would explain why it's categorized in the raspberry um category but then again the shape on the inside is more of that of a blackberry with the the way it pulls away from the plant when you harvest so there is that to keep in mind i do really really love it that's why this one is staying in my collection this one is a thornless variety which i absolutely adore so that is great and then again right here next to it i have a polar berry and it is a wild white blackberry variety and i have some new stocks that grew up and what i've done here is at the very bottom down here you see all these little leaves all over the place i cut off all the leaves and i stuck them into the ground to try to see if the old wood will actually send up roots and new branching so it's still summertime here so i figured you know what there's a chance they could root as long as i keep them watered keep the soil moist and that sort of thing and they have the warmth to create roots and there's a possibility i know not all of them will take but there might be a chance that one or two might take so i'm going off of those one or two chances of actually getting some rootage going on down in the containers i did that with the majority of the raspberries in my garden as well because i want them to put up more stalks so i can get a little bit more fruit in my containers so right here like i said i have the polar berry it did not set any fruit out this year even on the older branches so i went ahead and cut those up the older branches stuck them down there to try to see if they would root and i did the same thing with this one here we got a lot of growth on the variety this is called snowbank i got some little plants last year from bakers creek and those are still really small and i had a lot of die off on those and they're still very tiny so some of those are down in here so some the ones with the leaves that you see down there those are all from baker creek and then i cut all the leaves off of the ones i'm trying to root down in here from the old growth from this one from from last year so i'm trying to do the same thing with this one here so this is the snow bank created by burbank himself um in his growing system so that's how this is looking got a lot of growth on it so i'm excited hopefully next year we'll see some blossoms on it so i'm excited for that i'm moving on right here we have the heritage and i'm really really excited about this i got this from tractor supply and this was the new growth all of this is the new growth from this year from down there and i think i cut off the old growth and stuck that down in the ground but this came up from new growth and we've already got blossoms on it so this is a two cropper you get a crop from on the new growth in the fall and then you get a crop in the spring on the um old growth so next year i'll have a spring crop on this part and then it'll send up some new from the base so this is really exciting i cannot wait so it goes all the way down we're putting on fruit blossoms all the way down so there'll be a few fruits so we'll get to do a taste test on this later on maybe i'm thinking next year we'll probably do taste testings on the raspberries that i currently have in the yard this one is falling away raspberry just coming off and this one's a tulamine and the tulamine is a really great great raspberry i love this one by far one of my keepers um i got rid of the ones that were the that i had traded with um for some um i she traded so i gave her some gooseberries and she gave me some raspberries and the flavor on those were just kind of blah the tulamine has excellent flavor so this is all last year's growth all three canes and i only have a small cane part coming up this year so i really don't want to cut off the the canes yet because i would really love to have more fruit in the future so i don't know what's going to happen um i'm kind of sad that i didn't get more growth coming up but we'll just have to watch this and see i may need to add some more soil some of the roots are showing and then right here we've got the fall gold it's looking really great i did cut off the old bit and stuck it in the ground right here and um from what came from tractor supply and so that's how that's looking i did the same thing with this one right here this is the cascade gold and i cut out all the older branches that were kind of spindly and like look darker and the new growth is the lighter green colors and so that's all this year's growth from at least three new canes possibly four and a half or three and a half so that's how that one's looking and this is this year's new growth from this one right here this is the um cascade delight and i've already picked all the fruit off of the old wood and cut that up and put it down in to see if any of it will root and push up any new um growth in the future so that's what i'm hoping for whether or not it pushes up new um uh canes this year i'm not so worried about i'm wanting i'm hoping that it'll root and then next spring will push up new canes for the following year so that's what i'm hoping for with all with me trying to root some of the older growth then right here is a black jewel raspberry i got this from mi gardener i have it in a little container right now i'll probably end up potting it into um this pot that i have it set in and then right here we have the royalty raspberry we already harvested from it so i cut that one off because this was the new cane that came up this year and i will be getting fruit on this next year and then this is the other royalty raspberry that i have and those are all really really really really small that one was really butchered back i thought it was completely dead i didn't see any live roots on it but lo and behold it's making a comeback and then lastly but at least is my wonderful favorite of boysenberry i'd probably have to say the boys berries by far one of my favorites and if i had a choice i will probably only do boysenberries from this point forward i don't know if i really will get the black star or columbian star i mean but i might get it just to try to see if i like it but i'll just wait my sister-in-law has some and um she'll be um rooting hers i might be able to get some cuttings off of the ones she has and then we will go from there um at a later point i know she was getting some bigger container pots to put hers in so they don't spread in her yard because blackberries in the pacific northwest can tend to get a little bit out of hand and we have a ripening blackberry bush back here behind the shed wild ones and the flavor on those are really good so anyways you guys um and then also down in the bottom here i have a um emerald carpet so it's like um a yellow raspberry doesn't have a whole lot of flavor but it's a ground cover so anyways you guys thanks for watching comment like and subscribe click that bell button as always have a wonderful day um

blueberries it's they're my favorite food and so I picked them as long as I can remember I think most of my adult life and this blueberry field is my absolute favorite for starters the blueberries are enormous they're like the size of quarters and they're really easy to pick and it makes filling up a basket super fast so I want to show you a simple tickle technique of how I pick blueberries this ensures you get just the right pused berries and you leave all of the green ones to ripen further so you take a cluster like this and put your hands under it and you just start to kind of pull on those dark blue the really denim II blueberries any that don't come off are not quite right these guys still have a little purple in them and you just get beautiful perfectly right blueberries this is a very fast and efficient way to pick pounds and pounds and pounds now when blueberries are in season here in Oregon it's generally July I will pick 50 70 80 pounds fill our freezer full of them and then all year long we have smoothies and pancakes and muffins and scones and cobblers and all of the goodness from summer throughout the winter now one of the key strategies for picking blueberries is to have your hands both your hands free so I just take a belt loop it to the handle of my basket and then I can just kind of put my basket if it's blueberry season where you live and you have a blueberry farm around you go out and pick a couple buckets and fill up your freezer you'll be so glad you did thank you for being here thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video you", "egv4AnWw2oA": "what is going on YouTube it is spiritual nutrition back here today and in today's video we are going to be discussing the health benefits of blueberries and not just any blueberries mainly organic blueberries so many fruits are famous for their health promoting properties of course we've all been told that an apple a day keeps the doctor away and another good one is that the vitamin C and oranges will keep you healthy we've only recently begun to understand and appreciate the superior nutritional value of the blueberry in May of 2019 the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition published proof that daily blueberry consumption had a positive impact on cardio metabolic function in patients with cardiovascular disease so in simple terms what this means is that blueberries had a positive impact on people who are struggling with heart disease pretty amazing if you ask me although we do need a more research on this topic so basically consuming one cup of blueberries each day improved heart function in subjects with heart disease the study was able to determine improvements in cardiovascular function by looking at arterial stiffness and lipid profiles among other factors while the organic blueberries in particular improved endothelial function and resulted in a 12 to 15 percent reduction in cardiovascular disease risk so let's take a look at some of the history of blueberries to understand their antioxidant properties and pretty much why they're so great so blueberries are in the same family as the cranberry bilberry Azalea berry mountain laurel and roted Onderon they are native to the mountains in woodlands of North America and they were common in the diets of North American Indians wild organic blueberries were not cultivated extensively until the beginning of the 20th century today however blueberries are finally getting the recognition they deserve as the purveyors of super nutrients in a study done at Tufts University where 60 fruits and vegetables were analyzed for their antioxidant impact the relatively tiny blueberry led the way tough study proved that blueberries are great at reducing free radical damage so an example of free radicals would be like cigarette smoke which is going to negatively impact you blueberries contain the antioxidant phytonutrients anthocyanidins these antioxidants have been tied to counteracting the damage caused by free radicals that can lead to a host of conditions and diseases cataracts heart disease cancer varicose veins and ulcers are all caused by free radicals blueberries have also shown promise in protecting against macular degeneration colon cancer and Alzheimer's disease with all of this going for it wouldn't be ashamed to pass up this luscious marbled shape fruit in your grocery store I mean one cup of blueberries contains over 14% of the daily value of fiber a nutrient that's often neglected blueberries are also very high in vitamin K they represent a significant source of other vitamins minerals phenol Ickx and flavonoids if you're not convinced that the blueberry is the fruit for you how should you go about selecting your berries of course blueberries are summer fruit and you cannot go wrong purchasing during this season like many other fruits and vegetables blueberries can be purchased year-round with pleasing results look for berries that are firm in uniform in color if the berries move easily in the container when you shake them take this as a sign that they are fresh Passover berries that show any sign of mold damage or have a dull color also avoid berries that appear watery as moisture will cause the berries to go bad at a faster rate blueberries are also an excellent frozen fruit so you could always buy frozen berries you can check the quality by shaking the bag if the berries move freely by them they feel as they are clump together this is usually a sign that they have been thawed and refrozen in this case you may want to wait another day to make your purchase if the blueberries of fruit you have neglected in the past you may want to reintroduce yourself a healthy heart will make a happy you for many years to come try to choose wild organic blueberries whenever possible as they come straight from the source thank you guys for watching this short informative video on the health benefits of blueberries if

tissue paper both work fine and we're going to put the blueberries onto the tray and evenly distribute the blueberries onto the paper that way it can dry properly for when it freezes to make sure the blueberries won't be sticking in the freezer we will be drying it one more time with another piece of kitchen or tissue paper next you're going to take a piece of parchment paper and put it onto

evenly distributed we're going to put it into the freezer this is how the blueberries look once they're out of the freezer as you can see since we've dried them they aren't sticking together and will

blueberries blueberries are one of my absolute favorite fruits and you want to know one reason why they're the only fruit that's blue and that's one of my favorite colors there are some veggies that are blue like blue corn but blueberries are the only fruit that's blue blueberries grow in a bush in the summer when blueberries grow best you can find farms that will let you pick the blueberries yourself which is really fun you should definitely try it sometime blueberries can be pretty tiny or they can be almost as big as grapes but that doesn't mean that the bigger ones are sweeter sometimes the little tiny ones are the sweetest like all fruits blueberries come from flowers blueberry flowers are really pretty they're white they almost look like little tiny ghosts and they grow and grow and then eventually the petals fall off leaving behind a tiny green berry that gets bigger and bigger until eventually it becomes like the blueberries that you eat they have itty-bitty tiny seeds inside which you probably don't usually see because most people just pop them into their mouths whole but if you cut a blueberry in half it looks like this do you see those tiny seeds on the inside because blueberries are so small they're really easy to add to baked goods like muffins or pancakes my dad makes the best blueberry pancakes some people like to freeze blueberries and use them to make smoothies but my favorite way to eat them is just by popping a whole handful into my mouth i hope you enjoy your blueberries", "w_FmdkuQ1PY": "[Music] [Music] okay campers rise and shine and

taking a deep dive into harvesting blueberries yes blueberries already in it's time to harvest look at this blueberries ready to harvest Wow look at their color and hey if you notice here you see those little stems with missing blueberries right there that's because this is already the second time of me harvesting this blueberry bush so I've already had a first run at harvesting blueberries from this bush and today this is the second time harvesting this blueberry this is the second run in from what it looks like I'm gonna have at least two additional runs of blueberry harvesting from the same blueberry bush and look at these very beautiful deep blue purple color these blueberries are perfect and as I said this is my second run so I know these blueberries are super sweet super delicious so let's get right in there and it's time to harvest and really all you do is you grab the blueberry very gently and you pull and there that's all you gotta do lightly pull and you've got your blueberries so this is the fun part coming in and harvesting your own grown food and the blueberries they're just not any other food blueberries are superfoods they are loaded with vitamin C they are also loaded with antioxidants and it is the anthocyanin that is responsible for giving the blueberry its blue deep color and blueberries are also loaded with vitamin K and fiber and they're good for your heart they're good for your brain and they're an excellent energy booster so these little blueberries are true superfood and you can grow them right there in your garden they're not only a superfood but they're also very fun to harvest very fun to grow like I said I the best way to grow these blueberries are in containers the blueberry bushes are excellent container plants and the reason why is because you need to maintain the acidity on the soil and look at these beautiful blueberries so as you can see the ones that we want to pull are the deep blue ones there are some pink ones and some light blue ones some light green ones and some white ones so you just want to pull the blue ones leave the other ones alone the green ones and then the pink ones will come back and harvest do another harvest run and again look at these beautiful blueberries and you can do this in your own backyard in containers or in the ground however you wish these blueberry bushes are just so fun to grow and every year you'll have a nice blueberry crop look at this harvest for today and let's check out what what are we going to do with that harvest we're gonna prepare a blueberry parfait so this is our blueberry parfait and as you saw we added strawberries raspberries granola yogurt and of course our blueberries from our garden and look at this more blueberries a little bit more blueberries and here you go this is our blueberry parfait delicious this is a great dessert for today and blueberries grown in our backyard and these are to go parfaits so don't forget to Like comment

Georgia in 1983 this is my favorite rabbit eye cult over because the blueberries are so sweet they taste like blueberry candy and they're sweet even when they're under ripe which some of the other rabbit eyes are not sweet until they're very ripe but these are very good they get dime two nickel-sized this is a first year plant this I planted this in the spring I've got some nice growth on the tips here use a pine a pine log that I found that was rotted as mulch rabbit eye blueberries are more drought heat tolerant I have had to water some this year especially being a first-year plant here the berries are nice size very sweet very delicious I'll go over here to my other bright will blueberry plant this one I planted last spring not this last spring but at 2017 spring it's not doing as well this year the berries did put on some berries but they're small and I think a lot of it is that I didn't realize that needed water until it was too late the berries didn't develop big like the other one that I was paying attention to and taken care of because it was first year plant this one I thought would beat have more roots and be better adapted and we just have been really dry we had very much rain at all this spring very unusual for us not a few getting ripe here this plants not doing great and like I said I think a lot of it is I didn't water take care of it until just recently but some of it may be the soil acidity had this isn't is not in a woodland setting like some of my other blueberries I used a pine needle mulch last year and I used the same rotted log pine tree mulch as I did the other bright well this year it is a longer term soil acidifier to use mulch because it has the breakdown soak down to the roots and acidify the soil a lot of people recommend peat moss sulfur amendments but when I plant a blueberry plant if I dug a hole and fill it with peat moss even if that hole was 2 feet wide 2 foot deep I filled it with peat moss what happens in 2 or 3 years when the roots of the blueberry plant go past the peat moss and start going into your soil it goes into soil it's not acid so in my mind if I can use a natural forest floor mulch top system for a plant using using pine mulch pine needles and as the plants roots grow I can move the mulch out away from the plant keep going all the way around the plant until I get out far enough to where the roots are for that specific year and then as that breaks down it creates a forest floor top system for the blueberry plant this one has only been in the ground for a little over a year it is night it hasn't had time to develop that way I do have some I have a climax plant that is three years old in ground and I did the mulch system this way with it it's very healthy this year put on a lot of berries but they're not ripe yet so it's gonna be a few days before that video they are a really dark blueberry almost black but these are bright wills like I said these aren't as big as the other plant but they're still sugary sweet tastes like blueberry candy it's the best way I can say even when they're a little under right they're still sweet unlike the Premier some of the other types of blueberries that need to be really ripe before they're really good but rabbit eye blueberries are great they bloom a little later in the season I escaped those a lot of those late freezes and this year we had a late freeze serious one and these the blooms did great made blueberries anyway thank you very much for watching bright well blueberry", "jYgVg6_1rHs": "Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm\nshowing you how to make Perfect Blueberry Pancakes. I'm gonna teach you\neverything you need to know to make the perfect blueberry pancake every time so\nyou can enjoy this classic breakfast. Start by whisking all of your dry\ningredients together in a mixing bowl You'll need 1 1/2 cups of\nall-purpose flour or you can use wheat flour 2 tablespoons of sugar,\n2 teaspoons of baking powder,\n1 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. \nWhisk this together. Then we'll whisk in our wet ingredients starting\nwith 1 1/2 cups of either milk or buttermilk Buttermilk will give you a\nbit of a fluffier pancake.\n2 large eggs and 1/4  cup of melted butter and\nwhisk this in until your batter is smooth. Last we're gonna fold in about\n1/2  cup to 3/4 of a cup of blueberries. and you can use either fresh\nblueberries or frozen. If you're going to use frozen blueberries I recommend\ndefrosting  them, draining them and patting then dry to remove as much of that extra\nmoisture as possible. Then I'm going to use a 1/4  cup measuring cup as my\nscoop and scoop up some of the batter and then scoop it onto a nonstick\ngriddle and you want that to be heated over medium-high heat. You'll know\nthey're ready to flip when they start to bubble and puff up and look dry around\nthe edges. Then just give them each a flip then cook the other side until it\nis golden brown as well. I like to serve mine up hot with a pad of butter and\nsome blueberry syrup. Thanks for watching!

big pies you will ever eat you have picked or picked your own berries corn on the cob local honey homemade jam children are welcome with their adult and they love picking blueberries even on the hot summer day there is always a nice breeze at the farm and they also take debit and credit so we took the smallest container the one that i'm holding on the video it's the smallest one it's only cost me nine dollars just because we're very few in the house i don't want it to get spoiled and not eaten so that small container is nine dollars and we also did bought some some pies and we checked out the farm like the surrounding areas and it was beautiful out there we took some videos and whatnot then we hang out there for a few minutes uh it wasn't that much of people just because it was a weekday on a friday morning around maybe nine so we were kind of early over there but there was maybe around 25 people in there and you they will tell you where to go like we're all separated from each other so social distancing was really observed and you also have a washing station like sanitizing hand washing and all that and they have this line up for so all in all it was a nice day trip just to hang

pastime of so many people going out and harvesting wild berries but if you look at this patch around me right now I wonder if you notice the hazard that's in here every year you know tens of thousands of people go out and forage wild berries blueberries and raspberries specifically and I find even people that would never think about foraging any other wild plant still feel comfortable going out and foraging berries I did it as a kid growing up but what a lot of people don't realize that even things like blueberries have a poisonous look alike so if I look in close at this plant right here you'll notice that there's three berries that are a lot bigger than the rest of the ones that are in there and if I pull this out you'll notice that it's a totally different plant that's growing in amongst the blueberry patch this right here is called clue tonyia borealis or commonly known as Ruby lily or some people call it corn Lily and I commonly see this plant growing in amongst blueberry bushes up here in Muskoka in our region and I know a lot of people that harvest blueberries that have no idea what this plant is and that the berries from that are actually toxic now I doubt that anyone is going to come along and pick these berries on their own thinking they're a blueberry although that's not impossible either but you can tell that is a very obviously different plant and looking at the berries here they don't look anything like a normal blueberry that we think about eating but what if you have this catonian going right in the middle of a patch and as you're harvesting you're talking to your friend maybe you're paying attention looking around for bears you're enjoying the Sun you're just not 100% present with what you're doing harvesting do you think it wouldn't be possible to grab a handful of youth berries and a couple of these in one scoop and throw it in the berry basket and then maybe you would notice it in the berry basket later but what if you put it out at a dinner table what if one of your children came around and reached into the berry basket and threw it in their mouth because they weren't even looking or weren't thinking so but the point of this lesson today is that we want to be really present when we're harvesting wild plants and we want to know what there's any potential hazards all the time leaves of Catania some people actually harvest them and eat them as a food in the springtime so Plutonia is a great example of something we call the three rites of harvesting it shows all of them really well you got to have the right Bart you got to harvest it in the right season and you got to prepare it the right way so we harvest the right part we harvest the leaves and we do the right season for harvesting them and we do the right preparation and we stay away from the berries so please don't go and eat Catania after watching this video make sure you know this plant really really well before you'd ever consider harvesting it and more importantly the focus this video is not about eating claytonia leaves it's about the fact that there's a toxic berry on them and there's a they can sometimes go around blueberries and that could prevent hazard especially the children or people that aren't out foraging all the time so hope you enjoyed this video everybody and have a great day happy foraging have a great summer Cheers [Music]", "bF9jGmvWFoM":

patients with brain trauma coming out to the blueberry farm is something we've been doing for the last 7 years because it gives our clients a chance to walk around on the dirt uneven surfaces a chance to actually use their hands if they need to work on practicing you know fine motor kind of coordination and things like that gets me active gets me out moving you know doing things using my hand to hold this so they spend the day filling up their baskets and enjoy a snack or two I pick one you want you pick one yeah just being outside in the in the you know Sun and in this beautiful area is very therapeutic as well so it makes you feel a lot better about life the owners here at Tyler blueberry farms say they don't spray any pesticides on their berries meaning you can eat these right off the

swinging by and watching another beer review tonight's episode features one out of a platform Brewing Company this is one that I've been trying to get my hands on and it's been sold out everywhere that I've went so I was able to get a couple jars on draft cans forming this here is they're blueberry Martian slushy sour 9.1% - ABV and 19 ivu so a little bit about this here beer is untapped scouring other rating 934 ratings for points Cuban hmm four point two out of five they're calling it a fruited sour it says a platform blue Martian slushy sour written on the written on the cap they're the jar cap see it says this is a slushie style sour that is fermented with all of the blueberries okay over two tons of blueberries were used to create this thick and smooth sour that hits all the fruit notes additions of lactose and vanilla give hints of sweetness to round out this refreshing brew so this is something that's very difficult to get your hands on at least in my area it's proven to be very difficult I did have a couple uh 16 ounce jars canned on Draft at one of the shops I go to to get the get some of my beer so we're gonna go ahead and crack this open and I'm gonna get the towel out here cuz I don't know what type of mess this is gonna make they're calling this a I'm slushy sour or a fruit beer slushy sour fruit beer I own it I do one dump it into K that glass here and see how pretty that color is so just looking at that oh my god that looks so so good [Music] looks like grape juice just a pinkish white head up on top of that about a fingers worth this looks absolutely fantastic good amount of carbonation still in there it held up well given this was canned about or jarred about about six days ago really so man this thing looks pretty damn tasty to me so heads sticking around fairly well still got a second jar of it so I'm really hoping there is no a disappointment on this but just by looking at that Wow smell yeah it's a blueberry I get a blueberry raspberry aroma very very minor hint of an alcohol aroma just a sweet sweet berry aroma on this thing so now I'm gonna go ahead and get a drink on this and this is something that I've really been looking for so I'm really hoping it's not a letdown here's to a good one fantastic Wow yeah very very good no alcohol present a sweet tardy blueberry raspberry type of aroma going on here or a flavor going on here sweetened with lactose and vanilla there is a sweetness to it almost like a a pie filling sweetness to it that makes any sense yeah just wow all the blueberry that you can imagine is in here just straight-up tart blueberry there's not really a bitterness to it there's just a tardiness to it mouthful straight on medium medium creamy juiciness if that makes sense there is a a creamy but yet a juicy juicy mouthful to this almost you know what almost a a sweet soda like a blueberry soda pop almost a soda sweetness to it no it's fizzy mouth fill or anything like that just a soda flavor to it juicy soda flavor but just a lot going on here super super impressed with this thing I was really hoping this wouldn't be a letdown I waited so long and looked so much for this and I missed out on getting it into Cannes because it's already sold out after half a day sold out at one of the shops here local when not local but one of the shops that I go to waited two weeks kept waiting for it to go on draught so I could get a couple of jars cans so very very good I can't really rate the artwork on this like I normally would we will go to the rating on this up here on the

cause damage to cells that eventually break through and lead to premature aging and cancer blueberries are widely believed to contain among the highest antioxidant counts of any fruits and vegetables which makes them extremely effective at slowing aging and preventing cancer those are two extremely compelling reasons to get more of them - they're high in flavonoids blueberries are also extremely high in flavonoids these are substances found in many earth grown foods that have a host of beneficial properties not only our flavonoids often antioxidants themselves but they are also extremely useful at boosting the metabolism and strengthening the immune system they have many more miraculous properties that we have yet to fully explore 3 blueberries combat bad cholesterol contrary to popular belief cholesterol is not a bad thing in itself cholesterol can become harmful under certain circumstances however such as when it becomes oxidized for this reason blueberries have been shown to lower the bad kind of cholesterol LDL by as much as 27% over 8 weeks they can also lower blood pressure for the support brain function antioxidants and blueberries has been shown in several studies

wildly popular berries are often labeled as superfood because they are low in calories and still are packed with a lot of goods blueberries contain a lot of antioxidants fiber that improves gut health potassium vitamin k vitamin c and folate benefits of blueberries high in antioxidants often called the king of antioxidant food blueberries are packed with a lot of antioxidants that protect the human body from unstable molecules also called the free radicals which damage the cells and contribute to the aging and diseases the cells themselves produce free radicals as waste products and these free

high cholesterol level is dangerous to the heart and can choke up the arteries blueberries lower the low density lipoprotein or the ldl the bad cholesterol that can clog arteries blueberries contain a compound called phytosterols that helps to lower the ldl levels consuming blueberries daily significantly reduces the oxidation of ldl cholesterol manage high blood pressure the high blood pressure in people with metabolic syndrome can be reduced by consuming blueberries regularly and thus protect their cardiovascular health according to the current hypothesis the body produces more nitric oxide

post-menopausal women with blood pressure issues improves insulin sensitivity blueberries may help people who have problems of insulin resistance such as type 2 diabetes insulin resistance is a phenomenon when the pancreas produces too much insulin and the cells stop responding to it the compound called anthocyanins present in the blueberries are responsible for improving the insulin sensitivity the fasting blood sugar level in type 2 diabetes people is reduced by third when blueberries are consumed thus helping them to manage the blood sugar levels however the blueberries should be consumed in moderate quantity for people with diabetes as it is important to not exceed the recommended number of carbohydrates per meal act as prebiotics prebiotics are a type of dietary fiber that keeps the gut healthy blueberries fall in this category the healthy bacteria need to flourish and outnumber the harmful bacteria in the digestive tract without the good bacteria outnumbering the harmful ones the bad bacteria cause inflammation that can negatively affect the immune system the prebiotics in blueberries are indigestible carbohydrates that feed the healthy bacteria residing in

This is John Kohler with growingyourgreens.com. Today I've got another exciting episode for\nyou coming at you from my backyard garden and today we're going to talk about a problem\nI know I have and probably you guys have also. That's why you're watching this video, that's\nwhy you clicked on it. It's the birds! What we're looking at here is actually my\ntree collard plants that every year they seem to go to flower which they're actually not\nsupposed to and they make seeds. They make lots of amazing seeds but unfortunately\nI failed to cover them up and basically the birds come here, they peck the little pods,\nthe seed pods and they eat the seeds because after all that's their natural food. So I'm glad I could feed the birds some of\nmy extra tree collard seeds. Some of them I do get to save, some of them\nfall on the ground because they don't get each and every one, looks like there's actually\na lot on the ground that I could sweep up. Sometimes they fall onto the bed next door\nand they get all these little sprouts come up. So I always have continual plants but I don't\nhave any to send out to you guys in any large quantities because the birds get them. So beside the birds getting my tree collard\nseeds, sometimes they'll pick out seeds that I plant in the garden under soil and sometimes\nthey'll even eat baby plants. But most of all, what pisses me off the most\nis when they eat my damn tomatoes. So let's go over to my little tomato patch\nand share with you guys how I'm going to prevent the birds from eating my tomatoes for just\none buck. So now we're looking at my tomato bed here,\nI think I have maybe almost a half dozen plants in a four food circle or raised bed. I got some, actually smallerish tomato cages\non them, they're about four feet tall and I got all these little cherry tomatoes coming\nup on me. So what happens is on these little baby cherry\ntomatoes that you guys are seeing the birds will see that they're red, they'll see that\nthey're ripe, they'll see that there's food, they contain seeds, they contain water and\nbirds in nature, especially here in the desert they are hungry little creatures. They'll go in there and they'll peck it once\nor twice and they'll go somewhere else. Meanwhile I got pecked tomatoes which is not\ngood for me because I don't like to eat pecked tomatoes, sometimes I'll cut off the pecked\nhalf, compost that and then I'll eat the good half. But why do that when you can protect your\ntomatoes with just something as cheap as one buck? This is what I got from the dollar store right\nhere. It's actually this stuff, it's actually called\nthe garden netting. This garden netting was at the 99 only store,\nthey have stores I think in California, Nevada, I've seen them in Texas and maybe some other\nstates. A lot of other dollar stores may carry some\nthings like this and some others may not. If you're a dollar store owner, yeah carry\ngardening stuff man, us gardeners will be buying your stuff especially for a buck to\nprotect our valuable tomatoes. So what that this garden netting is do, is\njust create a barrier over my plants so that the birds can't get in there. This is a very simple solution. I mean if you got some old fish netting if\nyou're no longer fishing and the holes are small enough, hey use it for your garden. Basically anything you can put over it to\nprotect your plants from the birds is a good thing. They also have fruit tree netting at like\na standard nursery and what not. It's going to cost you a lot more money than\na buck but your fruits are definitely worth it. So we're just going to go ahead and unfurl\nthis stuff right here, see how long this is. It kind of stretches out, look at that! I don't know if you guys could see that, this\nis nice and huge. So you could just wrap this around, tie it\nwith some twine or something like that. But I got something else at the dollar store,\nbut I actually usually have a lot hanging out. So I have extra ones, but I got these plant\nclips. So these plant clips I normally use them to\nbasically stake up my tomatoes, my peppers and other plants, cucumbers, and I have so\nmany around here, just hanging out. I'm just going to use these to clip down the\nnetting to my tomatoes, to the cages so that I could actually just easily remove it and\nget it in there and actually harvest my tomatoes when I want to. So let's go ahead and put this on and wrap\nit around. Alright so as you guys can see I've been working\non getting this netting stuff all the way around my tomato cages, it's working pretty\ngood and I have man a lot of material left. This is really cool, I started trying to put\nit around and this bird netting is actually pretty cheap netting stuff, I mean what do\nyou expect for a buck right. I got a little bit more time than money. So yeah, this is working good but you have\nto untangle this and furl it out and be real careful, it kind of gets, your plants kind\nof get stuck on it so you kind of got to like push all your plants in and keep them inside\nso they're not running into the netting and that could be a problem later if you're not\npaying attention, you know your plants will grow through the netting and then the birds\nwill able to get the stuff on the outside then you won't be able to get it on the inside\nto take it off. So you just got to pay attention to that. The technique I've been using actually, I've\nbeen going around to the bottom of the netting, basically it's I don't, it doesn't tell me\nthe overall like length, but I figure if I stretch it out it'll probably be about like\n6 feet tall which is an amazing deal. It's like 6 feet tall by 32 feet, so that's\na huge piece of netting for just a buck. Now, they do have this netting that I bought\nwhich is in the long skinny pack and that's the good deal one, 32 feet. They also had a different kind of netting\nthat was like in a square pack, that was significantly less netting for the same price, although\nthe netting wasn't as thin, it was a little bit more thick, but I want to cover the maximum\nsquare foot area for the minimal cost. So this is the one that I got. So anyways I went around the whole bottom,\npinned that up, I kind of draped of the top and I got to pull this tight and use all the\nrest at the end to go up the top to make just a big enclosure so that the birds can't get\nin there. I'm going to go ahead and finish this up and\ncome back at you when I'm all done. Alright so as you guys could see I got the\nnetting all the way wrapped around my tomatoes and now they're protected against the birds. I had so much extra netting actually I could\nof went double high, so actually I just put a cage upside down in the middle one only\nto make like a little house or round hut shape, although maybe later I'll go back in, put\nupside down cages on each one of these guys and make it double high so that my plants\nhave more room to grow. The easy thing about this when I want to get\nin there I just clip off the bottom and roll it up and that's where all my tomatoes are\nat the moment, they're near the bottom, roll it up, get the good ones, roll it back down\nand then let my tomatoes ripen up without the birds getting them. Now whether you guys have problems with birds\nand tomatoes or whether you guys got gophers or rabbits this is an easy way to protect\nyour plants, simply put a covering on them, you don't need to use any kind of like anti-bird\ndeterrent, streamers, ribbons flying in the air, pinwheels, fake owls, although you could\nget an ally cat and let them roam your garden, they'll probably get the birds. But you just need to protect them and cover\nthem with some netting like this, I got for a buck or if you got the real stuff go to\na nursery get the real bird netting, that stuff's a lot easier to work with because\nit's lot more thick then this thin stuff, but hey, if this lasts me a season and I get\ntons of tomatoes out of my garden and the birds don't for a dollar I think it's definitely\nworth it. The other thing you could do of course is\nuse something like chicken wire to surround your garden, build that around your whole\ngarden to keep them out and if you got things like gophers and whatnot, put chicken wire\neven a bigger, thicker gage wire on the bottom of your raised bed so that they can't get\nin from underneath. There's always a way to protect your garden\nnaturally without using any kind of chemicals, pesticides or herbicides, anything like this\nby simply protecting them. That's why you guys lock your doors at night\nright? So the burglars don't come and break into\nyour house and steal your stuff. I don't want the birds stealing my hard work\nand eating my delicious beyond organic tomatoes and neither do you. So now you guys know how to protect your tomatoes\nfor a buck, if you don't have the 99 only stores near you check your other dollar stores\nor you'll just have to go to the nursery and spend more money, maybe some website online\nmaybe sells this stuff for a couple bucks, but nonetheless there's always a way to protect\nyour food today, all animals do this.

blueberry and this plant is about 5 years old from planting here and I planted this in a woodland area of forest setting if you look right over here there's a hickory tree some Cedars and there's a Carolina buckthorn Oaks Oaks Oaks another is a Post Oak and a pine tree an elm and it is definitely in a woodland setting this here is a another vaccinium this is one of the Arboretum's they grow wild here but the reason I showed you all the forest around it is the health of this plant is it's very good it's over here on it is loaded with blueberries and over here this branch here goes up and arches over and there's blueberries at the tip of that branch and I mean if that was standing up it would be around you know nine feet tall probably so this this plant has really enjoyed itself here and every year it gets the area around it mulched with pine needles leaves that fall from the trees and it is in a lot of shade and if you read about blueberries you know they talk about full Sun well this plant probably only gets about four hours of Sun a day if that and this is the healthiest plant that I have now it's one of the oldest plants that I have but I just wanted to show you the the environment that it is in because what you read and what they tell you about plants is not always not always the case this plant loves being underneath loves being in the understory underneath the woods here and last year it sent up a sucker blueberry all right there is the the trunk of the main plant and the last year sent up this sucker here and it actually has blueberries on it this year getting ripe so it's very happy here and I just wanted to show some of the blueberries it's loaded up with I mean most are not even beginning to be ripe yet here's some more it just keeps going and going so let's talk about rabbit eye blueberries for a minute vaccinium Hoshi aye and they get really tall and the the cultivars that they have are you know they get pretty good size this here I mean these get about the size of a dime two nickel-sized now the thing about premiere is it has to be really right before it's really good sometimes you know if you don't get them just right it's kind of bitter and also rabbit eye blueberries they're more drought tolerant and they're heat tolerant and I need both where I live so that's all I plant is rabbit eye blueberries they're very productive beautiful plants and they like my area and some my other plants that I'll be doing videos on I have to put the mulch and the pine needles and stuff around into it to help the soil acidify but this here in this woodland setting is per fect for this plant and it's taken off and never looked back it's very productive so I think I'm gonna plant more like this in the future in a natural setting where the soil is acid naturally from the force and the woodland area so thank you very much for watching premiere rabbit eye blueberry", "TrQJ52l5LcA": "[Music] so they are closed like three days so that the blueberries will ripen up so i will go there at the end so i woke up like 5 45 so guys my face is shiny because i put some block so before i pick over there i cannot see it because of the sun i think over there and uh i think they trim it that's why it became the bushes became short because they trim it and so i think this one is uh uh kind of sour because um this one is for a blue uh blueberry pie and so there were already lots of people and i'm gonna pass here this is surrounded with trees so they have uh like if you want to rest there and see it they have the tent and they have the where their cashiers are at so i'm here now guys not much anymore because they're all open they started open last week so okay i'm gonna pick here open last week uh saturday and then open saturday sunday monday tuesday no i think up to monday only and then three days uh they need to uh stop uh people to pick uh blueberries here close it for three days so that it will ripen up and so i'm back here i said i'm gonna add uh two more buckets okay guys uh i will start now hi everyone good morning blueberry farm uh the next town on the east side of uh you know uh west branch so it's uh lake euron on that side there that's the road if you can hear the sounds of the cars so guys it's eight o'clock and they're opening today is eight o'clock last week the first day is 6 30. so i'm here again to add more blueberries or to pick more blueberries okay yeah this is my second day i picked last saturday the first day oh yeah so yeah how long you've been speaking here oh i think i started peaking here in like 2014. oh yeah because the west branch uh uh they are closed there yeah they didn't have them here yeah since last year and all the way down to hammer and and this year i don't know why but it did not say that they are forever closed okay enjoy peeking okay guys uh i'm gonna walk on my favorite uh spot there by the end sunshine okay okay let's pick again and already show you guys oh my it's still what you call this uh wet so i need to dry them too that's how you put it there guys there's still do here ah it is covered with dew so i don't know if it is ripe or what because i need to look here i need to look here it's not pinkish but if it is okay guys i will show you if it is like this it's radish like that it's reddish you know the stock it's ready that's right not because it is blue it is ripe no you need to get it like dark and so i've been picking blueberries for many years so i know which one is ripe so you need to be fast i'll go to the middle i'll finish this uh this area here so it is wet so i need to dry them when i get home so people don't know the technique you should be you should go they should go to you know the end of the at the back of the you know uh blueberry farm i mean at the back here because people always go to uh they pick blueberries way near near the near the gate so the best thing is to go to the back so okay guys i will go to go to the

be outside with near perfect conditions the crop is growing just right and crowds are lining up to pick away but for our quest she says the best part is serving and connecting with the community again one of my favorite things is really seeing the families come back year after year and now that I have my own two kids seeing them pick our blueberries it's really great we've been coming here for probably three or four years I think it's just a summer activity you know especially with corn team being able to get out and do something and we're still social distancing and it's safe and you know

[Music] [Music] [Music]", "UQfOnQNSUKI": "hi i'm trish from honey pies recipes and today i'm going to demonstrate how to clean and prepare berries let's start with blueberries that's the easiest just take a bowl filled with cold water dump your berries in swish them around and then my detail work here we just need to look for soft berries and sometimes the blueberries have a little piece of stem left on them and you want to pull that off and throw it away these are beautiful that really plump mmm sweet dough very nice we always wash the berries because there can be bugs there's dirt I know there's a lot of controversy with the more delicate berries such as for blackberries and raspberries if you know the source don't bother to wash them but they still come from a garden with dirt that can be a few bugs so it could be something and I just prefer to wash them it makes me feel better it also gives me an opportunity to go through and look for anything that might be too soft or not quite right enough next the raspberries are pretty straightforward they just need a good little toss swish your berries around gently and pull up little scoops basically just Pat them a little see this one see it's very soft it's not holding its shape this one is on its way out too so I would discard those clean raspberries wonder how they taste mm-hmm those are good too next onto blackberries but before I open them I want to show you with raspberries and blackberries because there's such a delicate fruit they have this little white pad on the bottom and that just sort of absorbs any bruised juices but that's a sign that there are bruised fruit in there so what I do when I go to the store is I hold it upside down and I look at that little white sheet in there and to see that it is white if this in the case this were purple I would assume that there were a lot of damaged berries if it were raspberries and it were pink or deep red I would assume that there's a lot of damaged raspberries and I would go on and look for another package put into cold water gentle swish now see at the bottom it's very white want just one little tiny purple stain on there and that's up to sign the fruit is really in good shape swish them around for any damaged fruit he's a really great shape I prefer not to serve damaged fruit there's really nothing wrong with it if it had mold on it or something like that it would be different but the texture is very very soft and mushy it doesn't make a very pretty presentation and frankly it doesn't feel very good on the palate so I just prefer to throw them out last berry we're going to work with is strawberries these sweet and very light rinsing through a colander they don't need to be soaked I'm just going to take these right over to the sink give it a little wash and I'll be right back all the strawberries needed was a light rinse now we need to remove the hull I use a simple just little paring knife and just go right around in a circle to remove the hull and that's gone now with strawberries sometimes you want to use them whole but if you're making a strawberry shortcake or something else you want to slice them with this size strawberry I would cut it in half vertically and cut it in half again this just retains the shape of the strawberry as opposed to slicing it horizontally if you slice it horizontally it doesn't look like a strawberry anymore that's much nicer I think in your dessert than that later in lesson two we're going to make a triple berry crisp and that will have the black berry as the raspberries and the blueberries and it's one of my favorite dessert but it's also something that I make more often for breakfast I think it's a great way to start the day with a nice little oatmeal crust on top and delicious fresh fruit the strawberries on the other hand I never like to cook them there's something that gets lost about the berry when it's cooked so I would like to keep them around for just eating a bowl like this with whipped cream or some strawberry shortcake or make strawberry ice cream with some fresh berries that's delicious too thanks for watching honey pies recipes and letting me bring my kitchen to yours", "GeeSRFysVPY": "alright guys check the so this is blueberries can see how big their these are from I believe they say it's from Peru yeah check this out so a jumbo blueberries

right so this will give you a better idea what the what the how big they're so check the size of this right here you see the size of these blueberries so and they're all about this size look at this look at the size of that blueberry right there there's my thumb there's the size of louver so yeah so I'm going to be all the art bragging will wash them and then they go quick taste us okay so they're all washed and here we go Protista okay so first thing is they're very juicy and they're totally different than the North American blueberries North American blueberries doesn't give you a lot of juice it's more like the fiber that's in there this is like teeming with juice look at the insides there you have very little seeds in them is some seeds but not like as much as what we get North America texture is like a grape so think of it like a grape with mild very mild blueberry flavor and very juicy that's what basically it tastes like so definiteiy get out if you have a question

myself a homemade fruits mask all made from natural ingredients of course like strawberries raspberries and blueberries I've got here these the only fruits I had left in the fridge so I thought make myself a nice face mask with them I've been stuck in the house for approximately four weeks now and I feel like my skin is suffering a bit from lack of fresh air etc so what I'm going to do today is show you a quick simple recipe to brighten up your skin if you are still in quarantine and here it is so these fruits have all packed with anti toxins which helps slow down the aging process and helps maintain the balance of your skin if done on a regular basis it's also very good source of vitamin A B C and E I also try to eat fruit daily as it helps detox my skin and yeah so if you're stuck at home due to the quarantine and you have run out of face masks this is a quick and simple face mask to freshen up your skin if you haven't got these kinds of fruits available in your kitchen you can also use other soft fruits like bananas etc but I'm not using a lot I'm just using a few berries left over and I'm now going to cut them up into tiny pcs [Music] okay I'm now going to add a little bit of honey as honey is good for the skin especially if you suffer from red patches on your skin or if your skin's itchy it will help to soothe the skin and brighten it you don't want to use too much honey though as it will be too runny when you come to apply it and then put them in a bowl and start to mush them together so using the fork I'm going to mush the fruits if you have any left just put in a container store it in the fridge for up to 2 to 3 days it's also good enough to eat looks like I won't be storing this in the fridge at any time nothing goes to waste and ok I'm now going to apply it on my face doing sure your face is completely clean and free from makeup and creams to get best results I'm going to leave it on my face for approximately 30 minutes and then wash it off with warm water ok I'll be right back [Music] that's it I've completely removed the fruit masks from my face and my skin feels instantly refreshed and smooth I can tell you that now so let's get in closer yeah I've definitely noticed a difference there it's brightened up my face yeah it's smooth to the touch and I don't know what else to say that's a very good recipe to quickly revitalize the skin and

plan take bigger they become is it true oh and of course the water I see depends it depends on the variety this is called blue gold because of the color it's best just to leave them a little bit longer because they grow like this one oh look at that yeah compared to this model and if you look at the smaller ones and some something you have picked them together this one is the same color but you leave them a little while longer and yeah they learn else well so don't pick them so soon even when they turn close and they need water also they need a lot of water they like it yeah they drink a lot and these ones are actually in the original pot that we bought them I'm not changing yet and yet they are doing really good yeah I don't know it's about too much now I think we are harvesting that one and asked for two months", "bIKO3xCveFE": "hey sugar geeks lives here again today we're making a berry Chantilly cake my copycat recipe from Whole Foods sorry Whole Foods but I need to have this all year round coming up next on the sugar geek show alright so I have about a 1/2 cup of my berry filling you can also use raspberry filling whatever whatever filling you like I'm gonna add about a teaspoon maybe 1/2 a teaspoon of orange extract or you can use a teaspoon of Grand Marnier just gives it a little extra flavor mmm smells good okay so let's go ahead and make our frosting I've got some cream cheese and some butter and mascarpone cheese so good at room temperature if you didn't remember to bring this to room temperature then you can cut them into chunks and just like leave them underneath a warm bowl for five minutes and they will be at room temperature so I'm just gonna blend this together until it's nice and smooth and then I'm gonna add in my powdered sugar so I probably shoulda did this in a bigger bowl but you know I'm just gonna live my life I added a little bit of powdered sugar if you find that your frosting is like not coming together and it's curdling you could have over mixed it so that's why I'm doing it with the hand mixer it just feel like it's a little less intense of a mixing process and once you add the powdered sugar in and it's creamy just stop so we added our vanilla in just get that mixed together and we're done and just to answer those inevitable questions of is this frosting good to use in the heat the answer is no no you cannot put cream cheese and mascarpone cheese in the heat it's just just don't okay so now I have my beautiful cream cheese frosting here I'm going to add that to my whipped cream Oh and then we're just gonna fold so folding is just running your spatula like underneath and then folding it over that's literally why it's called folding and what this does is it just makes sure that you don't totally deflate your whipped cream because it's delicate it doesn't have to be completely completely folded just because the more you mix whipped cream the you know stiffer it gets oh that looks beautiful actually so this is the southern Chantilly cream version Chantilly cake and that's not what we're doing we're not doing that right now we're stacking a cake so I've got my vanilla cake here that's freshly baked super soft like mmm so good you can get my vanilla cake recipe are on sugar geek show.com slash recipes it's the vanilla cake recipe from scratch EO all right thin layer of our berry jam oh yeah then a nice big scoop of the mez car pony cheese filling mm-hmm seriously it's so excited to eat this cake this is just like my life now making things that I want to eat yeah a pregnancy so now I'm gonna layer up some berries in here and really you want to kind of leave them whole because when you cut berries they start to drip and get gooey but if you have really big berries like really big strawberries you might have to just cut them in half cut the little top off here and then slice it straight in half and then put the cut side down so it's kind of like being secured by the cream all the doors in there put this guy on top and I like to tort my layers which means to just literally slice in half lengthwise I do it on the turntable but you could definitely do it off the turntable I just kind of eyeball my knife going you know in the halfway mark and we're just going to keep going until it cuts all the way through don't force it let the knife do the work oh yeah all right some more of our berry filling [Music] [Music] laughs lair [Music] okay so now I'm gonna frost the outside of this guy with some more of this supersoft frosting that's funny when I was researching and Chantilly a cake I was like what is this Chantilly cake tastes like like is it some sort of fancy you know French term Chantilly turns out that Chantilly is just the place that the cream was invented and Chantilly cream is literally just whipped cream sorry to burst your bubbles it sounds fancier if you say Chantilly though Sean today I nailed it I know it I'm just gonna basically do a crumb coat and then I'm gonna put this into the freezer for maybe 30 minutes or so because I just really want this to kind of almost half freeze before I try to cut this otherwise it's gonna be a mess so same process probably not necessary unless you're like super anal like I am the slices must be perfect okay so this has been chilling for about an hour in the fridge because the freezer was not big enough but it's fine it's still perfectly chilled and nice and firm so now we're going to cover this and our final layer of the mezcal pone a cream cheese frosting mmm we're just going for a rustic look I don't think this is the type of cake that you really worry about getting super sharp edges that's just for eating and just enjoying so none of those comments like I put all that work into that cake you're just gonna eat it just can't stand the sides not to be strict it bugs me okay you guys like how I have arguments with myself I'm like you just have to be rustic and then I just like don't make it rustic this is what it's like to be in Liz Marik's brain all right one more smooth I'm not gonna worry about the top oh all right so now we're going to just decorate with some fresh berries you could go all the way around but you know typically it's just sort of like half so I'm just starting with my like large berries this is like true bakery style cake decorating right here guys when I was learning to bake in pastry school we weren't even allowed to use food coloring that was like not natural so you could never color anything like super bright neon colors because everything that you put on the outside of the cake was supposed to reflect what was on the inside of the cake so it's kind of fun to just sort of like do something that's kind of classic like that dee-licious hmm put a couple mint sprigs in there okay can we eat this so far my favorite part I get to eat the cake so that's it guys that's everything you need to know about making a delicious berry Chantilly cake go forth make one eat one thank me later I'll see you guys next week five oh yeah", "khJTFrL_pNU": "hey y'all welcome back to the heat shed and today we are at the Owosso Christmas tree and berry farm we are going to be picking fresh Sun ripened blueberries today and I do this every year I come out and do you pick because it's about two dollars cheaper a pound to pick your own and it's really enjoyable to just harvest your own you know by yourself and things like that I do have blueberry bushes at my house but nowhere near the amount that I need to process and can so we are gonna walk through these rows and we're gonna fill up a couple of buckets and hopefully get some blackberries it's a little late in the season for blackberries now but we are hopefully going to get quite a few [Music] okay guys so I'm using a new mount for my GoPro so that I can be hands-free one of the tips and tricks that I've learned over the years with picking blueberries is especially at a place like this where they're just in mass quantities you want to look up under the blueberry bush so you can see right here this is up underneath where it's hidden under the leaves and stuff like that where you can't it's not really easily seen so if you're squatting down and you're looking up you're gonna find some of the best blueberries now I will say this is not for the faint of heart if you want to spend hours in the Sun picking enough blueberries to make jams and jellies and dehydrate today I don't know that will pick as many as we would like because I started a little bit later in the day I'm doing this on my lunch break and of course I'm working from home so just a little restricted from time the great thing is is this is located right down the street from my house so I can come down here as long as blueberries are in season and pick as many as I want when I give you guys just a little preview of how beautiful these blueberries are this year we have had excellent rains we've had a lot of nice mild weather it has just turned out an amazing year for blueberries so I just want to give you guys a little close-up of those those are some fat blueberries y'all just dark beautiful beautiful blueberries when I'm filming here I want to show you guys if you're ever wondering man when I go to the blueberry farm there's no birds picking off all the blueberries it's because you see those lines that's knitting this whole blueberry patch is covered with netting and honestly I've been coming out here for years and I did not notice it until last year I thought man I wonder what they use to keep the birds out they use netting lots of knitting and you can just see how perfect all of these blueberries are and there's I haven't seen a single bird yet they are flying over the top but they are not in here which is amazing hey y'all welcome back to the heath stead and today is part two of our blueberry picking adventure okay I am about 45 minutes from home but I am so glad that I made this journey out here I am at Outback farms here in Prior Creek Oklahoma and I am telling you what I have hit the jackpot when it comes to blueberry picking I picked around Owosso in Tulsa for years I've never made it out here I've seen their advertisements a lot and let me tell you what this is the best decision I have made all here to come out here so I'm gonna take you guys around here we're gonna pick some blueberries I am just blown away I'm just blown away by the fruit and how amazing it looks so you guys hit that subscribe button leave me a comment like our Channel okay so a couple of days ago we were in Owosso and it's a berry farm that I pick out every year I've never been out this far before but I have never seen so many ripe blueberries in my life look at how giant these are you guys is that not amazing and we couldn't have picked a perfect day to be picking blueberries there's overcast there's a breeze it's only like 78 degrees I am loving it I'm gonna pick two gallons at blueberries I'm gonna pick until my husband tells me I can't pick anymore look at that these are going to preserve so well I cannot wait to make jelly out of this I'm gonna do some freezing we're gonna do some dehydrating and vacuum sealing that way you guys can get the full effect of how to preserve your harvest okay guys so I have almost filled a one gallon bucket but what I want to let you know is I did not realize that there are multiple varieties out here so I moved to the other side of the farm and I have found a variety called Chandler and these are literally the size of nickels dimes quarters look at that fruit is that not incredible so these are picked over because they ripen first but I am just blown away by these giant blueberries they do have a little bit more of a tart flavor which I honestly prefer I am going to mix both varieties in the both the buckets that I'm gonna pick that way I have kind of a sweet and tart balance for my jams and jellies and then when it comes to doing the dehydrating I will probably end up getting the sweeter varieties over there because they're standalone by themselves but I just wanted to show you guys some of these are a little less ripe than I would like but is

Natasha\nof natashaskitchen.com. Today I'm gonna share with\nyou how to make Panna Cotta. It's an Italian dessert. It sounds complicated but it's so easy, and it's perfect for any special occasion, and especially the holidays. So let's get started. (lively music) First thing's first. put one cup of whole milk\ninto a medium sauce pan, and sprinkle the top with one\npacket of unflavored gelatin. You're gonna let that sit\nfor a few minutes until that gelatin softens. Now we're gonna put that\nover medium low heat, and stir it until the\ngelatin dissolves completely, and your mixture is steaming. Make sure you don't boil the milk. Add in two cups of heavy whipping cream, half a cup plus a tablespoon of sugar, a splash of vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Keep stirring, stirring, stirring, until it's steaming again, and then take it off the heat. You're gonna let that cool\nfor about five minutes. Transfer your sour cream to a medium bowl, I like using one with pouring lip, it makes it so much easier to serve. Now gradually add your\nwarm cream while whisking. Also I've found that if you let it rest for about 10 minutes it helps to get rid of any bubbles that formed from whisking. I love how this looks in wine glasses, but you can use any pretty dish you like. Refrigerate these for\nabout four to six hours or until they're fully set. Now on to that berry sauce, which is even easier than\nmaking the Panna Cotta. Start by putting one cup of fresh berries into a small sauce pan. Stir in three tablespoons of sugar, and half a tablespoon of lemon juice. Bring that to a low boil\nand continue cooking it for four to five minutes\nor until it's syrupy. Now here's the secret to having the prettiest berry sauce\nyou've ever laid eyes on. Add one cup of fresh berries, just stir those in and\ntake it off the heat. Look at that, wow, my mouth is totally watering right now. once your berry sauce\nis at room temperature or just barely warm you\ncan divide it evenly over the tops of your Panna Cottas. Of course you can add a little mint or basil leaf to fancy it up. I had so much fun making this, but honestly I think I'm gonna\nhave even more fun eating it. So, let's do this taste test. I love this, every bite is covered\nwith this delicious syrup. Yum, the Panna Cotta is so velvety smooth, and you can kinda taste\nthat sour cream in there, it adds a great layer of\nflavor to this classic dessert.

It has a buttery, crunchy\ntopping, a juicy layer of berries and a soft and airy cake. No one has to know it\nwas super easy and there's a surprising liquid ingredient that creates a really\nlight and fluffy cake. Let's do this! Pre-heat your oven to 350\u02daF then in a large mixing bowl combine three large room temp eggs with\none cup of sugar and beat together on high speed for about 5 minutes or until\nthick and whipped. Now add 1/4 cup of light olive oil and mix just until\ncombined. In a separate bowl whisk together two cups of flour and two and a\nhalf teaspoons of baking powder. Add half of the flour mixture to the batter and\nstir just until combined. Add one whole Tbsp of lemon zest and this gives the\ncake an amazing pop of fresh flavor. Add 1 teaspoon of real vanilla extract\nthen stir to combine. We add 1/3 cup of club soda or seltzer water, the more\ncarbonated, the better the air bubbles make the cake super fluffy and airy. Add\nthe club soda while mixing. Finally add the remaining flour and stir just until\ncombined. Line a 9-inch springform pan with a ring of parchment paper and\ngenerously butter the bottom and sides of the pan. Transfer all of the batter to\nyour prepared pan, slightly even out the top then on to the berries. We cut the\nstrawberries in halves and leave the rest of the berries whole. Arrange the\nfruit evenly over the top and there's no need for perfection. Let's quickly make\nour crumb topping in a medium bowl. Combine 3/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup of sugar, 4\nTbsp of unsalted butter and 1/4 tsp of salt.\nRub the butter and flour together between your fingertips to create crumbs.\nSprinkle the crumbs evenly over the top of your cake then bake in a preheated\noven at 350\u02daF for 45 to 50 minutes. We found our sweet spot at\nabout 48 minutes and bake until a toothpick comes out clean. All right, this\nhas been resting in the pan for about 15 minutes and I just can't wait any longer.\nWe're gonna do a taste test. Okay, so we want to loosen it up from the\npan and just use a thin edge spatula to carefully go around the edge. Oh and I\ncan already tell this is gonna be a really soft cake. Okay, you ready?\nOh look at that... oh man it's as beautiful as it is\ndelicious. So let's cut into this beauty... generous slice of course. Okay,\nexcited! Take a look at that. This is so good. All right, let's eat this already.\nI just love that this is my job. Eat all the cake. Okay, here we go. Wow! I know I say that a lot but Wow! I\nlove that buttery crunchy topping. You can taste just a little hint of salt. It\nis so good and then that juicy layer of berries and I'm telling you -  baked\nberries are so good. Baking berries just really amplifies the flavor and it's\njust this flavor explosion in your mouth. I don't know how else to describe that\nbut they're so good and then it has that super fluffy crumb cake underneath. Oh,\nI'm so happy. This is easy because I can make this all the time.

share with you after we pick our blueberries that we wash them well and kind of go through them but I wanted to show you what we found at Lowe's and you can up here minute this is a one gallon there you go we can see inside hate pail for three bucks 298 at Lowe's and I'll tell you what it really helped us in the blueberry picking it's actually flat on that side and that's the side that we put by our body and my husband went and got some straps off of I think his tremor or something so it helps him hold it up anyway we both had straps and we just hung them right from the handle and boy did that keep our hands-free 298th can't beat that we got four of them we make it more but right now we're just getting four gallons at a time we will probably be picking again but after we wash them I lay them out on this towel just a bath towel and it's sitting on my freezer and I kind of roll up the sides here you can see so they don't roll off until you can see that I got that all up there and then create a buffer and they have to be totally dry so when we get to the next step which is the freezing them they will freeze we don't have fly you know freeze-dried fast stuff they'll freeze I put them on a baking sheet and I'll show you that in a minute okay so here we are I brought out those blueberries that I cleaned and dried thoroughly then I put them in this cookie tray and I get them all frozen and I put them in freeze-dried bag and I wanted to show you what they look like and what is nice about this way you put the camera down here second is that you can just reach in here and they're all just single they're just singling you can just grab what you want for a copper because I use them a lot blueberry pancakes muffins pies and they are full and they're separate let me show you what happens if you don't do that and you just throw them in without drying them thoroughly this is what happens I don't know if you can see that you see all that juice and the it's just soggy mushy mess which I'm going to turn into probably some jam and jelly but I want to be able to have my whole strawberries be able to use in other different things but this is all just mush and it's perfectly good but I would rather have them like this and very individually so I can use them another way that you can prepare a story your blueberries is I can mine and I rock an it what I mean is that I just fill up my quart jars with just the blueberries and when you can put sugar in it I don't but you can at this point however you much you want and I pressure cook it for 30 minutes and then just let it come down naturally and that seals them and this is what it turns out to be this is what you get you get all that wonderful juice with us not all diluted with water and you get the blueberries now I use these in jams I can use these also I just strain it out and for the juice then I could make them other than Jam and that can make jelly so there's lots of things that you can do with this and I love just to eat it but it's it's just another way that you can keep the blueberries that you picked and you cleaned you dried and so try that that's another way that you can store your your blueberries I am about ready to start 7 quarts of blueberries they're dry they're all clean they're sterilized that vinegar wiped off the tops and put the the rings on and I'm going to be pressure cooking them when it comes up to pressure for 15 minutes and let it come down slowly on its own of course I'm out here and I'm supposed to be 104 heat index today out in my backyard back porch kitchen and this is just one of the many ways that I'm showing you in this video of how to take care of blueberries where had 10 quart 10 gallons of blueberries you know we some along the way but we want to keep them and this I can take out and use for anything jams pies you name it and I'll have them even though I have frozen quite a few if something happens at least I have these and I can also put those others if something happens to our freezer so this is just one more way of doing blueberries to remind you that everything is cold so it all has to start together I have just regular room temperature tap water I just put in with the blueberries and everything was coming to come up to heat together that way you don't have any busted jars or anything exploding we know what exploding anyway just thought I put that in to share with you another way that I preserve and use our blueberries and this is a juicer steamer and it is the nifty if thing you put your your blueberries in the top and in this chamber is the three chamber let me bring this camera down and in this chamber so the blueberries are here this chamber is where all the juice is collected and in the bottom is where you put water and this is where you generate the steam let me get you down here a little further okay right here and you see that tube when it's all done and you're you look in the top that's why I like the the glass tops you can see inside that you have you put your juice in this is boiling hot so you just put this in your clean ball jars and just put a top and it just seals practically immediately because this the steamer is doing everything that you need so this is one that I did previously and no sugar now you can add sugar if you want you can add that up at the top with the berries I've also done grapes Oh grapes and what's nice about it is you just winced the grapes off putting the stems and all in there and you don't have to mess in them when it's all done it's cooled you can just put in your compost pile but this is a great way to get juice where you don't where you can put in there's no water down stuff you can put your own water if you need to but you know the all the exit antioxidants and everything are in this some juice is pure juice and same with the grapes you put concord grapes or whatever you can find and you can get those by the bushel and in whatever your area that you're in but that's how you use the steamer and I'll put a link down below of where I got mine they're around $60 free shipping and I use it for a lot of things you can put this take this metal part out and just use the steamer for other vegetables and it comes with a great booklet for what you do but this is how I also use my my blueberries to store them just in different ways and you can even make jelly on this pure blueberry juice and jelly so this is just another way you", "uqIje-e_FS8": "[Music] so this is the miracle fruit plant right here it's beautiful plant and has large berries now and there's a large seed inside of the fruit it takes a very small amount of fruit to get the miracle the miracle is that it changes the way you taste food miracle fruit also known as miracle berry was first documented in 1725 a French explorer was searching West Africa for undiscovered fruits and noticed local people eating miracle fruit berries before meals locals had figured out that if they ate miracle fruit first terrible tasting yet nutritious foods tasted much better so this is one of our miracle fruit and a pot we have another variety in the ground but this one just seems to do well where we have it and in the pot and mostly in the shade very right other variety that fruit is are not quite as plump and the leaves are smaller so our two varieties are the large leaf variety and the small mate ray the miracle fruit plant is classified as a shrub and is native to Ghana these evergreen shrubs prefer acid soils partial shade and high humidity but they can tolerate drought and full Sun they cannot tolerate frost miracle fruit plants have dense foliage and attractive leaves and berries the slow growing shrubs can reach 15 feet in their native habitat but are often about 5 to 6 feet tall in other areas miracle fruit is grown from seed typically plants begin to fruit when they are about three to four years old miracle fruit is a small red fruit with a large seed the plant produces rather inconspicuous white flowers a few times each year fruit forms in 35 to 45 days the bright red fruit usually hang in small clusters at the tips of small thin branches so it's easy to tell when these are ripe they if like another day from now these will be dropping on the ground but when they're red and plump you can just pick them off or just shake up them to shake the bush a little bit but those are already let's see if we can shake a little bit those are so we'll stay on I guess another day or so the flesh has a pleasant sweet subacid flavor but the fruit is usually not consumed for its own flavor or nutrition but rather for the effect it has on the taste of other foods miracle fruit contains miraculin which is a glycoprotein that actually blocks the sour and bitter taste receptors in your tongue the taste altering effect of miraculin lasts from 30 minutes to a few hours depending on the individual if you eat miracle fruit then eat a lemon the lemon will taste like lemonade or even like a sweet orange not only our sour and bitter flavors blocked but miraculin in the presence of acidic foods actually intensifies the sweet flavor miracle fruit also helps people who are receiving chemotherapy chemotherapy can make food have a metallic taste often after eating miracle fruit chemotherapy patients enjoy food sometimes for the first time in several months [Music] today I'm going to taste one of these and then eat a slice of lemon so when you eat a miracle fruit you want to slowly eat it don't eat it like say my dog's eat their food because you would never even taste it the objective is to coat your tongue with as much of the fruit as possible so try to keep it in your mouth for about two minutes yeah you know the longer it stays in the mouth the stronger the effect of course there is a large seed the seed takes up most of the fruit but that's okay you we need very little fruit for the effect just need to let it stay in your mouth for a while I want to eat it very slowly [Music] so have a piece of lemon I'm just going to take the seeds out because I'm that kind of person so this doesn't taste bitter there's definitely a tang to it and you know my brain is saying lemon but my mouth is not really saying lemon I think if I close my eyes probably I would say it's like a honey belt Angelou Mineola tangelo [Music] it's very good anyway this effect is just temporary so it depends on the individual because some people you know like your saliva is difference mostly the saliva that breaks down the miraculin and eye of the fruit but definitely if you have a chance to taste miracle fruit and experiment with it do it with other fruits with other foods it really is a fun experience although miracle fruit is most well known for its ability to block sour and bitter flavors and enhance sweet flavors miraculin also blocks salt receptors in the tongue the salt blocking effect is helpful to people who swim long distances in the ocean and people who are preparing for a colonoscopy some people actually throw miracle fruit parties where guests eat miracle fruit then taste an assortment of familiar foods especially sour and bitter foods miracle fruit is rather perishable at room temperature the fruit lasts two to three days if heated the miraculin is neutralized and the fruit will no longer alter the taste of other foods miraculin is still effective if the fruit has been frozen as you might imagine dieters and diabetics are particularly interested in miracle fruit in fact in Japan miracle fruit is often prescribed for people with diabetes freeze dried miracle fruit is available in many parts of the world in some countries miracle fruit is still being studied and is not

me what are you doing oh my god they're like three feet away bursting out of the ground my heart is going like 200 beats a minute anyways Here I am walking up to Blueberry Hill behind my house you have 300 highbush blueberry trees and when I mean highbush these are about 7 to 8 feet tall a lot of them they're huge and they're covered in blueberries we get about 15 quarts per blush and you have 300 trees these berries are huge and delicious best blueberries you're ever gonna eat this one that was eaten by some creature maybe a bird actually looks like a bee we don't use any kind of pesticides or herbicides we let the bugs and the bears and the other animals the birds raccoons we let everybody take their share and we collect what's left there's always more than we can pick so even with lots of bird damage and otherwise we we always have more than we need so we pick and freeze a couple hundred quarts a year and that's what I put in my smoothies for most of the winter and then the rest we sell my parents make pies and jam and and then I would just invite friends over and they pick their share this time of year I'll eat about a quart of blueberries a day and it's what I do when I first get up in the morning rather than just going to my normal green smoothie I come up here to Blueberry Hill and I'll pick a crapload of berries many of which I just put as I'm picking them and about a quartz worth and then the rest I'll bring in the house for other people to eat and to make a smoothie a little bit later really careful about which berries I pick I only like to really really perfectly ripe one so I kind of feel them as I go so this is one of the reasons that I stay here in Vermont on the farm it's not only to help out with the orchard but so that I can partake of it have my own fruit fest here unlimited blueberry consumption for a few months out of the summer can't beat that we have many different varieties of berries each with a different flavor and different characteristic like these are a little bit smaller and they're a lighter blue with smaller eyelashes I call this stuff right there the eyelash these guys have short eyelashes and they're not as sweet but they've got a really nice texture so we wanted to try as many different varieties as we could to see which ones would really take and they all took but it also gives us a slightly different nutritional profile for each of the different types of berries so we're not just getting one type of blueberry we're getting many found my thrill on Blueberry Hill yeah I don't need to take no pills cuz I got a blueberry hill it's my pills right here my capsules oh these are some good ones that one's huge I can pick a quart in about 20 minutes so I'm walking around I don't like to stay at one bush I like to pick a couple dozen berries on each bush and then walk to the next bush just because I like to move I don't like to stay in one place and also I don't want to pick each bush completely bare of berries I like leaving some berries on each bush for some reason maybe I'll bring a bunch of these berries to the Woodstock fruit Festival so people can try them out I'm not sure be nice to have some local produce there I'm not sure if they have any local produce this year but it'd be great to supply them with blueberries because they're my blueberries and they're full of love and care and no chemicals totally organic and inexpensive we don't charge a lot in fact our berries are cheaper than conventional berries in the store and our berries are also better they're bigger they're tastier they're locally grown totally organic always have been look at these fat boys one of the things I love about highbush blueberries is that they're my height or even taller so I don't have to bend over to pick them I can pick them right at chest level it makes it so much easier and more comfortable these are way over my head this variety has really long eyelashes I call those eyelashes I don't know what they call them in the technical blueberry world but these are the long eyelash berries in my world they're a bit juicier than the other varieties but not quite as sweet they're still delicious but not as sweet as the darker blueberries so here's the orchard you can see some way off in the distance to down there there's another 30 bushes down there and then we've got apple trees and more apple trees over the hill and peach trees and then this is the bulk of the orchard and they're right on one of my trails that goes up into the woods so I can go for a run or mountain bike right behind my house and the trails here are pretty much endless I can connect from my house to the Appalachian Trail so I could run for thousands of miles right from my back door and the best part of doing a run here in the summer is that I end in the blueberry orchard and I can stock up and renourish myself rehydrate myself with fresh berries right after the run paradise I hope you enjoyed that tour of the blueberry orchard it's one of my favorite places in the whole world and it's not just because I have an unlimited supply of blueberries whenever I want in the summer but it's also a sense of pride it's something that my family and I have put 35 years of work into we've maintained this with love and passion we haven't used a single chemical in that time we've just used natural mulches pine needles because blueberries like acidic soil and we've mowed and we read and when we see bugs we take them off with our hands it's a lot of work a lot of our summer goes into maintaining this orchard so when I come up here I really I see not just berries but I see a part of myself I see something that I've put a great deal of my life into so it's more than just a great supply of carbohydrates", "k1whN2a_oeg": "I love a cold snack on a hot summer day I just don't love the calories in ice cream one of my go-to snacks is frozen blueberry yogurt bites they're delicious they're low-calorie and best of all they're so easy to make you'll need 1 pint of blueberries preferably organic you'll need 1 cup of nonfat vanilla Greek yogurt and 1 tablespoon of agave maple syrup because honey really depends on what you like you'll need a baking sheet with parchment paper into the place this is side um super easy you're going to start with your wet ingredients first you're not a fat vanilla yogurt you're going to just place in the bowl and you're gonna add your agave and you're just going to mix these two together then you're gonna place your blueberries you're gonna gently just fold them in to the liquid so to make sure that the blueberries don't crack you really just want to really be gentle you're just simply coating the blueberries then you're going to take the baking sheet with the parchment need fork this is kind of the most tricky part of it you're just literally going to kind of raise your blueberries and you're going to kind of tap it to get the excess yogurt off and then you're gonna gently just kind of spread them on sheet doesn't matter how messy it looks you just want to get them coated separate them from each other main thing you want to do is make sure that your blueberries are coated this is great when it's really hot outside is something that feels good it's cold kind of really satisfies that kind of like when you want something chocolaty or something cold or you just want something kind of sugar the key now is to really separate them making sure they're fully coated so once they're separated all you're gonna do is pop them in the freezer for an hour until they're completely frozen once they're done enjoy them if you have any leftovers which I doubt you will just store them in an airtight container in the freezer there

need to start them indoors all you will need is a small bowl to start them in or you could start them in a seed tray if you would like to do it that way too you're going to need a squirt bottle some water and um we want to have Canadian spagna peat moss the reason for that is because blueberries require a low pH a four point five to five point two and that's the best kind of soil to have or you don't want to use regular soil for this and some blueberry seeds you want them to be non GMO and stratified seeds for the best germination all right I'm going to take my bowl you wanna make sure there's good drainage so I'm goes in the bowl you can get um useless knuckleball or you can buy some styrofoam bowls in the dollar store and choose um make sure it's well drainage you want to make sure the soil is moist the sphagnum peat moss is very dry so you have to make sure that the you moist of the soil before you go ahead and put any seeds in it so I'm going to show you how dry it normally is this is already pre moistened it's much more moist we're going to be fluent in 500 seeds in this bowl over the top we ship our seeds and little cellophane packets so that the seeds don't get everywhere and it's easier to plant and you want to plant them with eighth of an inch thick sprinkle them across the top of the soil and mix the soil around a little bit and you can plant them in more than one Bowl 500 seeds is quite a bit of seeds to put in one Bowl because sometimes they go a little bit deeper then what you would need or you could plant them in planting trays that would help to spread your seeds around and you want to make sure you mix them in and you only want to stay about 1/8 of an inch thick because they have to be closer to the surface because they will that blueberry seeds are not fast growers um so they will germinate they take a little bit of time to germinate usually takes about eight weeks for them to germinate a little path down a little bit see I've got the soil quite moist a little water to that and all you have to do is keep them keep your soil moist all you need is a squirt bottle miss them to miss your soil that way your seeds stay moist until they can germinate this is what your blueberry seed should look like in about three months this is when you want to start fertilizing them you can use if you're going to go organic there's plenty of organic products on the market that you can use their nests and loving plant so you can use mere acetic miracle-gro or non organic plants and they do have like a worm casting you can use for

if you can see that they're just on the end that's gonna slowly grow into a blueberry now you can see all the flowers here have been blooming and trying to pollinate and when they do pollinate successfully they fall down into the dirt to show you that they're ready to make some berries I can show you the two stages here see this is actually one I don't know usually when they turn brown like that that means it didn't pollinate we're gonna find out I'm gonna keep you posted but you can see the one next to it see that little blueberry fruit off the back that's gonna turn into a big juicy blueberry this summer I will keep you posted as it grows just wanted to give you a super quick update on how my braz blueberry bush is progressing through this summer season", "M1NOfHgU30U": "hi today i'm going to share a recipe with you for my favorite snacking blueberry cake it's very easy to make with very few ingredients and it is a blueberry cake here it is so this is what it looks like with blueberries infused throughout the cake and give the recipe a try and let me know how you like it in the comment and if you haven't subscribed yet please do subscribe so you can get more recipes and more videos like this to your home page when i post it so let's get started okay so um here's how we're going to be making a blueberry snacking cake you're going to need either an 8 inch or a 9 inch pan any pen will do but i like a removable one like this where you can remove the bottom easily it makes it easier for you to take the cake out and you can butter and flour the pan and that will be fine but instead of doing that what i like to do is i do use a piece of parchment paper that i folded in half and then into quarter and into smaller pieces like that and then i just line it up to the center cut it out and i like to make it a little bit bigger so that the size overhang and it comes up like that okay it makes it easier um for me so i put that aside and don't forget to preheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit or 100 degrees celsius okay and then we're going to start with the wet ingredient and i also put like to put a rubber mat underneath so everything kind of stays in place it doesn't move around okay so let's get started so you're going to need one egg at room temperature okay so next you're going to need a three-quarter cup of granulated sugar which is about 115 grams of sugar now if you don't have granulated sugar uh where you live it's also called caster sugar or you can even use yellow sugar brown sugar whatever sugar you have okay so three quarter cup which is about 115 grams of sugar you're going to put that in and you're going to take a whisk and you're going to whisk it together until the sugar is dissolved until it looks a little bit lighter in color [Music] okay that's it and then you're going to need 4 tablespoon of oil any flavorless oil would do can be vegetable oil i use avocado oil you can put that in a little whisk you're gonna need a quarter teaspoon of vanilla paste or half a teaspoon of vanilla extract okay and then um you're gonna need 125 milliliters of whole milk or half a cup of whole milk i want to get make sure everything goes in [Applause] whisk it together until it's fully incorporated okay you're gonna put that aside and then in here i have um one and three quarter cup of all-purpose flour which is about 225 grams of flour and i'm gonna put in here a tablespoon of baking powder okay and i'm going to put in a half a teaspoon of coarse salt now if you have fine salt i would use um a quarter of a teaspoon or a little bit less than a half okay and i like my cake with a little bit of cinnamon flavor so i'm gonna put it in and this is optional you don't have to put it in but i like it a bit more cinnamon so i put in a i'm gonna put in a half a teaspoon of cinnamon but again it's optional you can put instead of cinnamon you might want to put a teaspoon of lemon um or grated lemon peel that's really nice too and you're going to just give it a quick stir to get it all incorporated i mean if you want you can use a fork to uh put it all together okay and you're going to add all of this back into the the wet ingredients okay and you're going to whisk it gently just until everything is incorporated don't over mix it i would not use a hand mixer at this point now if you have a hand mixer you can do that at the beginning when you're doing the wet mixture but for me i um like to do things by hand so that's it so you can kind of see that it's almost fully incorporated there's some still some lump but that's okay too i just want to get make sure i get every little bit in here i don't want to waste anything that goes in so i'm gonna go um trade for the big uh spatula so you can kind of see that it's still lumpy but it's um not overly mixed right because you don't want to over mix it and then i have 340 grams of washed and dry fresh blueberries which is about 12 ounces or um two cups of fresh blueberries now if you don't have fresh blueberries you can use frozen blueberries but keep the blueberries frozen and added in to the um the wet batter well to the batter when you're ready to use it okay don't thought because it will get kind of soggy and watery so i just add it all in and it's gonna gently mix it together and i'm going to add that to my pan now some people are um afraid that the blueberries might sink to the bottom and and um with this recipe you don't have to worry about the blueberries sinking to the bottom so not to worry you just add it like that and that should be okay okay you don't have to worry about it because the batter is quite dry so the blueberries will not be will not sink to the bottom so i like to make sure everything goes in to the batter and not waste anything so then you're going to you can use an offset spatula here if you have one otherwise a smaller spatula like what i have here once too so at this point you're just gonna spread the batter out it doesn't have to be perfect but you can just kind of like press it out so that um it's kind of like sort of evenly spread out and that's it and you're going to put it in a preheated oven at like i said 350 degrees fahrenheit or 180 degree celsius and you're going to bake it for 40 minutes between 35 to 40 minutes or between 35 to 45 minutes between uh depending on your oven or until when you insert it in with the skewer and it comes out dry okay so i will put it in the oven and i'll see you back in 40 minutes okay so it's been exactly 40 minutes into my oven and i've let it sit um to cool down on a rack for about 20 minutes so it's still very very warm but i'm gonna open it up and pop this open oh it's still hot just gonna actually i'll lift this up pull that over so if you have a little bit of an overhang you can just lift it and pull it off the pin like that and um you can kind of see that uh you can eat it like that and you can actually have it done it's like perfect now you can actually leave it or put a little bit of um powdered sugar on it just to kind of dress it up right or you can even put dress it up with a few blueberries like that just so that people see what is actually in the cake and that's it there you have it it's a great blueberry cake and i'll cut a slice for you so you can see what it looks like on the inside and you can kind of see that the blueberries are still evenly spread throughout the cake and it did not sink oh that's not a very nice cut let me just cut it again there it is so you can actually eat it like this um you can even add a few more blueberries on the side like this or you can even drizzle it with a little bit of cream on it like that or you can even add a little bit of a whipped cream on it okay and it will make a great snack and if you like this recipe please give it a try and let me know in the comment how you like the recipe and if you haven't subscribed already please do subscribe so that you can get my

It's Dzung, and welcome back to day five of our 30\ndays of healthy eating and living. Today, I'm gonna give you five\ninspiration to drink more water. I'm calling this vitamin water, because it's gonna\nbe infused with all the essential vitamins and nutrients that your body needs. I've been giving you a lot of recipes to fuel your body, but drinking water and hydrating yourself\nis just as important if not more. You need fuel, but you also need fluid\nto keep everything running smoothly. Get it? Get it? If you guys are excited for the next 25\ndays of healthy eating and living, be sure to hit this subscribe button below and don't forget to give this video a thumbs up\nbecause this video is gonna be epic. So the first water I'm gonna do is\nreally great for the winter season. I'm gonna be infusing grapefruit and pomegranate. In my mason jar, I'll add a handful of pomegranate seeds, and a few slices of grapefruit. Fill it up with water. Grapefruit is great for preventing and treating the flu, and pomegranates have antioxidant,\nantiviral, and anti-tumor properties. I'll call this the Cold Buster. I like to refill this jug about three times with all the fruit, so once you're done drinking all the\nwater, you can totally eat the fruit! So refreshing! So next up, we have raspberries, orange, and mint. In my jar, I'll fill it with a handful of raspberries, some orange slices, and a sprig of mint. Fill it up with water. Raspberries have anti-inflammatory properties, and the whole orange can provide up to 130 percent\nof your daily recommended vitamin C. And mint can help freshen your breath. I love how vibrant this looks.\nWe're gonna call this the Refresher. Next up, we have blueberries and mangoes. Blueberry is great for skin care. It has anti-aging\nproperties and it keeps your skin nice and supple. I will be eating a lot of blueberries this year. And then in the overnight oats videos, I told you\nguys that mango improves eye health and it's really great for lowering cholesterol, too. So in my jar, I'll throw the blueberries in and some mango slices. Fill it up with water. I'm calling this one the Fountain of Youth. Next up, we have strawberry and lemon. This was inspired by a strawberry\nlemonade without all the sugar. So in the jar, I'll add a few slices of strawberries, and a few lemon slices. Fill it up with water. Strawberries reduce hypertension, helps maintain\nnormal blood pressure, and reduces cholesterol. Drinking lemon water helps absorb\nall the vitamins effectively. This reminds me of a warm, sunny, hot day in the summer. I'm gonna call this... the Warm and Sunny. Refreshing! And finally, our last one is great for digestion. I have some green apple slices and some ginger slices. Add both into the jar. Fill it up with water. Apples improve the functioning of good bacteria in our gut, and ginger regulates high sugar levels and calms the stomach. I'm calling this one Smooth Move. (winks) And here are our five vitamin waters. We have the Cold Buster, the Refresher, the Fountain of Youth, the Warm and Sunny, and the Smooth Move. Tell me you guys, which one would you try first, and also just to let you know, all of\nthese you can drink right away, but it tastes better if you let them infuse\nfor about 15 minutes. You can keep refilling them until you pretty much\nhave extracted all the flavors from the fruit. And then just eat the fruit! If you guys want to see eight more ways to drink water, I have an old video for that that I'll link towards the end. Thank you so much for watching! Comment below\nand let me know which one is your favorite. Don't forget to subscribe to see the\nnext 25 days of healthy living, and I will see you guys tomorrow. I'm, thinking I'll make a healthy\ngranola bar. What do you think? Bye!", "4rI3NQkFRNs": "hi guys in today's video i'm going to show you how i made actual blue pancakes with blueberries i'm also going to show you how i made blueberry compote tasty and i'm also going to show you how i made blueberry frozen yogurt together this makes a very nutritious breakfast because uh blueberry is a superfood and did i mention that it's very very tasty oh my god you need to try this you definitely need to make it it's delicious and you will love it [Music] i'll be friend with you guys i've actually never had blueberries until a couple of weeks ago when my friends invited me to come blueberry picking with them blueberry is a fruit or berries that is native to north america and it is british colombia's largest export um we went to cairo blueberries farm in richmond and um you know it was such a good time even though it was my first time of coming in contact with blueberries i did some research and found that it has so many numerous it has numerous nutritional values it's a superfood it's um it has antioxidants vitamin c potassium it helps you to reduce your risk of cancer heart disease and the likes and i managed to pick a bucket full of blueberries i made smoothies for like two weeks and decided that i wanted to try something new with the blueberries and i act on instagram and based on some of the replies that i got i decided to make pancakes compote and frozen yogurt okay so the first thing i'm going to do is get a plate full of blueberries and i'm going to blend half of it when blended the blueberries look have this reddish purplish look and i'm going to put that aside for now and the first thing i'm going to do is make pancakes and i'm using this anti-jemima pack pancake mix i'm going to add one egg and a cup of milk and i'm going to stir it one of the key things i know about making pancakes is when you start staring stay on the same side like don't stare randomly just stare at the same side especially if you're using like a fork use the same direction while you're stirring your mix and stir till it is smooth and all the lumps are gone um i think i added this too much milk so i'm actually going to add more of the anti-jemima mix to this and afterwards i'm going to leave it for a bit because i also added a little bit of baking powder so i'm going to close it and leave it for about 20 minutes normally i like to leave it longer than that but i just want to get this over it i'm just going to leave it for like 20 minutes um and then when i get back to it you will notice that it is a bit thicker i added a little bit more mist mix and even after this i still felt the consistency wasn't hard enough for what i for the kind of pancakes that i want and added a little bit more mix as well but at this point i'm going to add the blueberry blend that we did earlier look at that just look at that and i'm going to stare for some reason i was just i wasn't expecting this to turn blue but it made like a stirring it turned blue guys this was actually an experiment when i looked online i actually didn't see any recipe that mixed the blueberries with the mix like this so um this was an experiment that turned out good so at this point i'm going to fry my pancakes i'm putting some butter in my pan i already fried a couple before this um so i'm putting some butter in my pan i'm going to spread the butter in my pan and i'm going to then uh put a little bit because i want my pancakes to be quite small so i'm just going to put a little which is why i needed the mixture to be a little bit thick i'm gonna put three small placements into my pan and i'm going to let it fry for a bit i'm also going to add some blueberries guys i have what's called trichophobia so i cannot stand small circles in a big circle that's how i had to space the blueberries out i can't stand small circles clustered together in a big circle it makes me so nervous um and so that's why i spaced the blueberries out this wide um and yeah i'm just going to allow it to fry for a bit twist it to the other side and my blueberry pancakes is ready okay now we're going to make our compote and the first thing i'm going to do is squeeze out some lemon juice i'm doing this by hand because i don't have a juicer but um squeeze out one lemon juice with your hand or with a juicer if you have a juicer next you turn on your gas cooker and put it on low heat then you put blueberries into your pan add your lemon juice um we're also going to add one spoon of sugar because that's what compote is compote is pretty much boiling fruit in sugar and so we're going to add one teaspoon of brown sugar and then i'm going to also add that blueberry blend that we blended earlier [Music] then we're going to stir it in the low heat for about 10 minutes and just allow everything the mix to kind of boil and become a little bit thick is pretty much like jam actually someone suggested on instagram that i make blackberry jam but after doing a little bit of research i felt like comfort might be easier and maybe better for me to do so yeah just stir it in um in low heat for about 10 minutes and your compote is ready people use compost to maybe put it in between their cake or put it in between bread or as even some people use it as jam um the list of what you can do with compost is endless in this video i'm going to be using to eat my blue pancake and you'll notice that i am licking my spoon non-stop because this is actually very tasty the mix the sour taste of the lemon mixed with the sweetness of the blueberry and the sugar just makes it a very tasty dessert to have you should try it so next we're going to make our blueberry frozen yogurt i have some natural yogurt olympic natural yogurt and i also have some blueberries which i had frozen earlier i'm going to put the yogurt into the blender my blender is not dirty this is the blender that i used earlier to blend the non-frozen ones so i'm going to put some yogurt into the uh to the blender you kind of want to have a lot less yogurt than your fruit whether whatever fruit you're using you want to have a lot less yogurt than your fruit but i actually want to make the entire and use the entire bucket of yogurt so i'm going to have a lot more yogurt than my actual fruit and i'm just going to freeze it again afterwards so you add your frozen blueberries um and you blend the two together [Music] again like i said if your frozen fruit is a lot more than your yogurt it will probably be take enough for you to have immediately but i added a little bit too much yogurt and so i'm going to pour it back into the container of the yogurt and i'm going to put it back in the freezer to harden up bits [Music] there you have it guys your blueberry pancakes blueberry compo and blueberry frozen yogurt what do you think about this i was so glad to finally be able to finish my blueberries and um this was actually very tasty to have i had a very like i couldn't stop eating it um and uh yeah you should definitely try it guys let me know in the comments if this is something you've seen before because i sure hadn't seen it before i made it especially the pancakes i've seen the compo but the pancakes and never seen it made like this before let me know in the comments what you think and if you're going to try this and also guys do not forget to subscribe to this channel

we start this recipe please subscribe to our channel cooking and style now let's start this recipe the ingredients we are using are blueberries cherries mangoes vanilla ice cream and almond milk we will also be using raspberries [Music] now let's start the first milkshake for this milkshake we are using mangoes blueberries and raspberries bananas and almond milk we will also be using ice cream at the end after chilling it [Music] first we'll add mangoes to the blender [Music] good after adding the mangoes into the blender now we will add oldman's milk now blend this milkshake alhamdulillah the milkshake is now blended now chill it and after chilling it decorate it with ice cream and serve you can also add sugar but we did not since the mangoes are already sweet it is your choice [Music] now let's make the second milkshake for this milkshake we are using bananas berries and almonds milk add blueberries into the bowl [Music] after adding the berries at the bananas after this add almonds milk [Music] once you've done adding the milk you can then blend it make sure it is properly blended before you pour it out and serve it now pour it into the glass but before serving gets chilled first decorate both of the milkshakes with ice cream on top and more fruits and flowers [Music] these two delicious milkshakes are now finished we hope you enjoyed both of these recipes if you

strawberries and blueberries three times per week a significant study associated eating berries with improved heart health and you cannot get the same benefit from a supplement or pill you will not be needing a spoonful of sugar to help this medicine go down eating more and strawberries and blueberries may be a tasty way to protect your heart [Music] study the finding comes from a recent study led by dr eric rim an associate professor at the harvard school of public health and harvard medical school he mentioned that the sooner people go on the type of diet that includes a higher intake of strawberries and blueberries the better dr rims team gathered data from about 93 600 women whose ages range from 25 to 42 signed up for the nurses health study over the course of 18 years the participants reported how often they consumed various kinds of food so why study relatively young women because these groups are at low risk of a heart attack factors that increase this risk should be easier to factor out in this population as compared to older people with various heart attack risk factors also risk factors present in young women are likely to apply to older men and women a risk factor did turn up women who ate the fewest strawberries and blueberries were at increased risk of a heart attack those who consumed the most were 34 percent less likely to have suffered a heart attack as compared to the women who ate the least of these fruits how many berries do you have to eat there was not much difference between women who consumed just a few berries now and then and those women who did not eat any at all there seems to be a threshold effect and that is one has to consume a minimum amount of berries to get heart benefits the participants with heart benefits had three or more servings of a one-half cup of strawberries or blueberries each week but why just blueberries and strawberries this is because these berries are particularly rich in chemical compounds known as anthocyanins the study suggests that anthocyanins have various effects on the body they make blood vessels more elastic and lower blood pressure also not only are strawberries delicious and juicy but these fruits may also lower blood levels of c-reactive protein crp which is a signal of inflammation in the body high crp levels are linked with an increased risk of stroke and heart disease and levels often go up when people with lupus or rheumatoid arthritis have a flare as well start your day with berries in your cereal oatmeal yogurt or smoothie always leave the produce aisle with berries in your shopping cart berries are good in green salads you may also consider adding walnuts sunflower seeds or garbanzo beans for added protein strawberry shortcake and blueberry pie don't count these contain too much sugar and fat consume very flavored desserts sparingly and opt a dish of naked berries for dessert instead [Music] you", "rFHkqwWWhNU": "get your tickets in Eric the bond is gonna speak again up selections from the BC Writing Program for blueberry and strawberry forgive it's this on-screen pointer it's because of an incident last year they trusted me with the pointing one and I got a little crazy with it so they made it on the screen though again so if you weren't did the cane bury me being just prior I'm filling in for Michael Dossett today he's away at another beating since his regrets and he sent his unworthy understudy to present for him so he's the breeder and I do other work some in support of what he does so looking at the the the BC BC very breeding program we've got some priorities that we call primary priorities to look at developing machine harvestable varieties that have an improved growth habits so that we can develop varieties with firmer fruit that can be marketed in the fresh market after having been machine harvested having earlier later cultivars is also a priority and having concentrated ripening for each particular cultivar some secondary characteristics that are being pursued are resistance to shock and scourge virus which are very difficult to target to hit as as Chad alluded to as well as bringing in some tolerance to root rot and in that regard Michaels done some traveling around in the marshlands in New Jersey and other places to get wild germ plasm that might have those sorts of traits that can be integrated into the the germ plasm and then with the plethora of bacterial fungal diseases that we deal with breeding for improvements in those regard are also key targets so just an overview of the process it's a it's a long long breeding process to go from making crosses but Queen cultivars and parent material until final release when the first-year varieties are crossed and then the seedlings that are generated from those crosses are evaluated in the third and fourth year and made as selections and then those selections are put out into a range of different types of trials to figure out whether or not they've got potential the typical process is to put them into a replicated yield trial typically on the on a research station and evaluation for a couple of years before then taking it out to grower trials and we're actually trying to speed things up here a little bit short-circuit the system and jump over a couple years by taking three to five selections each year out of his program and getting them out to growers ASAP so that we can figure out sooner than later whether or not they're going to end up as cultivars and so that means sending out a lot more duds than there are than we normally would but it also means trying to cut out a couple of years and more quickly identifying those that are going to end up having cultivar quality some of the fimo typing work that Michaels program does and female typing is looking at at the what we see in terms of the actual fruit itself from quality is a major concern and so one thing that has been added to the program recently is is bruising tendency so this is somewhat different than firmness and it's different than splitting and that it is a measure of the degree of damage that that a berry will sustain in a simulated machine harvesting situation so what they've done is developed a protocol where they take a berry and drop it from one meter of height and then they go and store it for 48 hours cut it open and then visually score it for the degree of bruising and so the reason why this is important is because this is not the exact same thing as firmness you can take it use one of those little firm tech machines that is kind of like a it's kind of like Guantanamo Bay for your blueberries I guess but it's a kind of a torture device for blueberries you can get a measurement the firmness from that but bruising is slightly different trait and so that's why this has been included in in the breeding program another aspect of food quality is splitting tendency and just to highlight some of the findings over the last couple of years the program has done something called heritability analysis where you look at the degree to which a trait is likely to have to be carried forward from one generation to the next and the the degree of splitting has been found to have a considerable amount of heritability moderate heritability estimate which means that the program should have success in making progress in decreasing tendency for splitting in the future so some data that that michaelm I worked on last year this is a coordinated system of grower trials to take his material and the material from breeding programs like Fall Creek that we'll hear about next and and other programs around the world when we take that out to grower fields we tried to do some general evaluation of quality and so one thing that Michael and I worked on last year was to look at fruit firmness using that firm tech machine I mentioned to compare some of these selections against material coming from other regions and then also some industry standards and so the different colors here are different harvest dates and these are across different sites so we had we we were just doing our best to be able to make apples-to-apples comparisons different colors are different dates and then you can see firmness being pretty high for some of these perspective varieties coming out of our program and in comparison to say Duke which is way down there at the at the far end of firmness and then in the mix there if you look across the the red bars particularly you can see some comparison of think comparing comparison of genotypes like top shelf and blue ribbon against clip so in here on going forward any cultivar that is released it's basically going to have to have fruit quality that is as good or better than anything that is out there and then hopefully with added adaptation to our region better disease tolerance may be easy is a greater ease of management or better yields in general some first round of selections that that micro made and that we're now trying to get out to grower trials are these listed numbers which won't provide too much context to you so I'll just try and give you a couple of highlights about these varieties some of these selections rather sorry working up about my notes but Michaels here so these are three selections that are kind of the second round that have come out even more recently than those first set of four and these ones we're getting out to grow our trials also as quickly as possible in order to get as wide a range of observations across soil types and micro climates and more importantly to get growers opinions as soon as possible so we can make informed decisions as to what is going to make it in the industry one of particular interest the Select in 2012 is you can tell by the first number there in that string as 12 6 35 not going to detail all of the traits here but what was really interesting is that it is likely one of the it's one of the permits things I've ever seen this is what data we generated in 2014 so very recently after this was selected you see the new crop there on the bottom this is firmness after five weeks of storage so we looked at at firmness at every seven day interval after harvest you can see the blue crop is lower of course Duke is that next one up Draper is even higher and then this be c12 635 kind of blew it out of the water so this is that with some very early evidence to show that you know we're making good genetic progress in regard to an extremely important trait for developing a fresh market processed industry for shipping across the world another selection you can see by the quality of the photos here these are photos I took and and add it in here I'm a terrible photographer in comparison to Michael this this selection and you can see the size there in relation to the to the loonie and that's our dollar in canada this this one similar to Draper in firmness but not quite as high as 12 635 but if you look at that previous chart we saw there it doesn't necessarily have to be as firm as 12 635 to be a cultivar as long as just beating whatever else is out there seasonality is going to be key if we can find replacement for midseason varieties that's going to be a strategic move for us a couple of selections are going to breeze through here are 14 41 58 and 14 42 1 both of them said a lot of flower buds which is likely going to be important for us because we're a very high latitude region one of our challenges is having genetics for material that that that tend to shut down at an appropriate time in the summer and start converting their vegetative buds over to floral buds and so having selections in the process that have got a high degree of Bud set is important this data that generated this year under replicated comparisons of firmness and and just a plug for our BC short course presentations and at the end of January I'm going to be presenting some data that that that was part of a larger project that this is just a little side shoot off of looking at firmness and fruit quality in mostly Fall Creek varieties the top shelf the cargo lasts called blue ribbon and clockwork in comparison to some standards as well as Calypso and a couple other genotypes so we're I'm going to be giving a presentation in a couple of months on that if you were coming to our our event in BC but one little bit of data that came out of that to compare some of our BC selections this is firmness at one three and five weeks in cooler storage and if we look I can use the use the magic for red dot here there's blue crop at the bottom there that's the only standard that I can included in this particular set of genotypes and then we've got these this broad range and quite high firmness exceedingly high firmness I would say even though this is unreplicated so there's not a whole bunch of data to back this up we are we are making progress and in firmness going on to strawberries it's a relatively small program in comparison to raspberries and blueberries and that's related to our not so large industry in in strawberries the the primary objective is to maintain selection pressure on de neutrals and that it requires crossing with June bearing varieties because there's not enough genetic variability within de neutral germ plasm to permit just breeding with de neutrals so Michael makes about 2,000 seedlings of strawberries each year and and has to include a neutral and each of those crosses and then de neutrality or mont\u00f3n C segregates in populations those can be selected in the spring in order to determine whether they've got potential as the June they're or it being neutral and then they're monitored throughout the rest of the season to differentiate between the day neutrals and the June bearing types problem there is that propagation is a bit of an issue in that as Chad was mentioning some day neutrals are exceedingly difficult to get to runner and that's the way that we get new plants to evaluate further issue if you've seen any of my close talks over the last three years we've been talking about you see ten to one for quite some time now it's been hanging around and virus cleanup for I think two and a half almost three years now and so we're hoping that that will be released from that process very soon so that we can get a good look at it here in BC it had good feedback in Quebec where it was about 10% higher yielding than Albion it and and but not quite as good as seascape so we're excited to see whether or not that's going to have potential as the day-neutral in the pacific northwest some brief pictures of a few of the the wonderful fruit coming out of the seedling plots and i walked through the plots a couple years ago with michael we tasted strawberries until we could taste no more and i mean i comment was to him Wow for some stuff here that that really rivals albion it's a question of whether or not we're going to get the type of productivity that album gets so for quality size flavor firmness those are all key criteria that are being used for selection and evaluation of selective advance elections and with that Michael thanks all the funding especially the BC blueberry Council and BC Strawberry Growers Association so as all the other people that support the work that he does and he always says I'm sorry if I missed anybody inadvertently so I will repeat that for him and put up his contact information if you would like to get in contact with them and otherwise I can answer any questions to the best of my

blueberries raspberries hi strawberry", "Hq9fCxh6NGw": "today we got three reasons you should grow blueberries as you see from this slide blueberry plants are perennials so they will provide you food for around 50 years which is crazy so you'll just have to plant your blueberries and then not have to worry about replacing it year after year like annuals there is some pruning um and nutrients you have to add but that's not as big of a deal as they will produce you a lot of fruit after they become mature in around five to seven years and each bush will produce about five to seven pounds of blueberries which is quite a bit of blueberries especially if you have a few bushes or multiple another reason is blueberries provide health benefits they're known as superfoods and they have low number of calories sodium and cholesterol and they provide high amounts of vitamin c and fiber and they contain one of the highest levels of antioxidants of any fruits or vegetable research has shown blueberries to be linked to slow age related memory loss they also have a lot more benefits that i didn't put on here there's a lot of research going into blueberries and these are just a few that they've found true blueberries can be eaten in many ways this point number three they are delicious just by themselves you can put them on pancakes eat them with waffles or not waffles oatmeal you could eat them with waffles make jams and jellies they're actually i think even better for you when they're frozen which is crazy and um smoothies is the last one i own this list but there's obviously a ton more that you can do with blueberries they're obviously are they are one of my favorite fruits and i did just plant a few of them at my garden and i plan to get more once i get my own house but that costs money so and i don't have that so but thank you for watching and uh appreciate for tuning in and make sure you check out my other blueberry video um i'm gonna be trying to at least get one up each week um if not more i can try to get more um i'm just in school right now and it takes a little bit of work but thanks for watching and see the next video", "Ig8OyG6587M": "I guess after very long about time that's actually dissolved now so we are gonna start with a lemon oh I just okay so I've cut up a little bit oh my really that's now we've come a little bit of a lemon Leben abbas gonna see they're very sour it did not take the pits out okay that tastes like lemonade but there's still a tiny bit of sour in there with us oh I've read this whole video just going to be going that's really sweet which is ridiculous but it is like like the taste of the lemon is still there so it tastes like you've got a lemon you put sprinkled later sweet and relators shaker right there that tastes really good let's try a segment you could lecture this up can orange I stay weird so busy in that segment that oh it's like a tiny bit sour like you're still sort of makes your glands go like oh you know you know that oh that's really good it tastes a lemonade like just really sweet that was really good the next thing I hear is pineapple look Penn pineapple oh my god that aftertaste laughs later like lemon is so good it just tastes like like a lemon mal arm or something but tastes pineapple isn't really sour but in my book a my little handy dandy Burke it's it's said that pineapple tastes like sweet okay that is so good oh my god oh my god the thing is I didn't taste the pineapple before so this could be really sweet pineapple like it could it's probably oh my god this is so weird it's like it's been covered in sugar oh my god yes yes that tastes incredible that I'm gonna eat all of that that's gonna be my dinner oh my god I was really eating this before dinner never mom cook something and there's no raspberries and I don't really eat raspberries because they're too sour I always end up getting really sour one so I never liked them this is so weird that tastes so almost like was the vesicular it's so sweet oh my god this is a really good way to eat your fruit uh-huh if someone doesn't like fruit the miracle berry and you'll be you'll be sweet you'll be sorted this is so weird so far the pineapple is still my favorite I've got I have another little I cannot go over that right next we have Harry based on plastics so they looked really really sour that just like really sad sweets I thought if I can tell this now I'm so confused when you first put it in it's like it's so sweet that it's turn the sour Oh like when you this is a little bit weird this is probably the harrybo's like the most similar to the real ones without the miracle berries like these are a little bit similar because they still like a little bit sour no I find these aren't as fun to eat without a big sour had the whole point is that as really Sara and don't bite good though I prefer them as sour though I just I eat a normal hurry bar what's the Marmite I think we'll have to skip the mama I can't actually open that oh that was really easy to do this isn't sour so I don't know why I'm trying it but so for those who don't know Marmite does it have got lots of Philippine may Watchers this is just like it tastes like salt it's like yeast and salt and that's pretty much all it is genuinely it's very strange I like in small quantities so normally I wouldn't be able to just look like I really wouldn't but that's it's like got air just toda going off it's still kind of taste aside it's still kind of taste very salty but it's not got that like really really strong flavor weird I quite like that I let's see how that tastes on toast mmm that's good oh my god this berries so weird so weird up next I've got some salt and vinegar crisps whoop-whoop the best crisps in town tucked not fiction absolutely again these are MIDI sour so I don't know what they're gonna taste like it tastes like someone has put honey on a crisp no it it tastes like honey I'm not being overdramatic for once in my life that tastes like honey that is so sweet there's like not a savory at all I'm really confused by that one not one was really weird have some vinegar here but this just is not good at everything so hard to open I'm just going to squeeze I mean to my mouth I think okay that was that's giving me like a heightened digestion that was not a good idea there's a little bit sweet but you can tell this is vinegar so her eyes walked up okay that wasn't a good idea I'm gonna try tiny bit okay it's nice rid of small up I don't know but I somewhat like that okay night vinegars not a good idea steel does it taste good my throat is honest about burn now I need some lemon to cancel those pips everywhere mmm that tastes so good oh that's not really sweet I mix I'm not sure this is gonna go but I have some sweet and sour sauce we ordered a Chinese last night for birthday and I some sweet soy sauce this very day let's go down lift over and literally saw was in the name so no no no that is so sweet it's just sweet and sweet when you turn the sour and sweet in it sweet sweet sauce that is ridiculous now that's not a bit of me know this might be ridiculous by God but on the butcher here and I'm gonna join us like a tiny bit because it might make alcohol be nicer you know I'm gonna try that you the tiniest bet the tiniest tiniest bear that's not really changed it that much no that's still really bad to be fair no it's not sour so I guess I thought I thought that would be a good idea to be honest so try some gin I've got some lemon drizzle cake gin here I'm just gonna dip my finger in oh that is nice that is nice that was some tonic or lemonade and some lemon that would be so good and I hope to have a miracle berry before I go out on a night out cuz that tastes absolutely incredible lastly Mother's Day is trying little orange I've already tried a lemon ever dream is gonna probably be the same as that my favorite was the absolutely pineapple dye all the lemon least favorite was the oh my chosen ketchup um orange key little I love that so quick um those really good I said she was like in a sweet it's not such a good way to if I have a day is so good whoa I'm gonna get some ketchup [Music] this is ridiculous um I'll try the other way this is being we love that we know that for us this is really sour sir oh this isn't sour so it might not change that much or it might be disgusting um I love ketchup so I hope that it's what it always tastes like barbecue me that was absolutely stupid um it tastes tastes really good you can still tell this tomato it tastes more like a tomorrow like a real tomato this is really weird definitely is ketchup this is weird I don't think I prefer it but it's nice weird weird weird weird right I'm gonna go finish the rest of my pineapple I have a great great time I hope oh god I hope you guys enjoy that um this is me eating stuff and that's really it that's really sad um feeling like video hmm",

and in today's clip I'm just going to be running through how I like to feed up the soil for our southern highbush blueberry here in the self watering wicking barrel and also run through a few other pointers like how you can help maintain a healthy ph range for acid loving loving plants like the blueberry so she can give you a bountiful harvest just before we get started I thought I'd give you a bit of a look at the plant herself she's got a load of fruit on at the moment we're pretty chuffed with the amount that's been set this year now she is a Southern High Bush variety this variety in particular requires less chill hours before she'll start to flower and set fruit I think the northern hi Bush variety does prefer a cooler winter but as we're in the subtropics this variety does very well for us here now she's growing in a self-watering wicking barrel what that basically is is a little self watering container there's a little fill tube over there to the left you pour water in there it collects in a reservoir and then it comes up through the soil so the plant always has moisture available to it so a very nice neat little arm compact growing system most of our soil beds are actually made like this all self watering before we start talking about the fertilizers that I like to add in we might have a bit of a quick chat about the pH so blueberries are an acid loving plant they like the soil pH to be around about 4.5 to 5.5 so that makes them perfect for growing in containers because with such a small volume of soil it makes it very easy for us to regulate that soil pH we can do so in a couple of ways when we first plant them out we can buy a commercial azaleas style potting mix that has a very low pH or we can make our own using a blend of 50% sphagnum Moss if you have it available to you and normal potting blend that will give you a fairly low pH blend that you can pop your plant into now the pH level in this barrel at this point in time at least about two inches down or 50 mil down is roughly around about 8 on the pH scale now I know the reason for that and it's pretty much well because I watered it from the top last night using the cow the water supply our council water supply comes out of the tap anywhere from eight to roundabout 8.3 depending on how they've been treating the water so the top layer of the soil is um yeah fairly basic it can't be hurting the plant too much though because we have a load of fruit on but just to make sure that I'm not slowly bringing up the pH over time there is an additive I can put in here that will keep the pH nice and low for the plant so what I've got here is elemental sulfur what this does is over a period of time it will lower the pH in the soil at a gentle pace just quickly before we add the sulfur on there are a few other amendments you can pop onto the soil that will bring down the pH the first one is cow manure well-aged cow manure over time you will find it will bring the pH down in your soil sphagnum peat moss probably act a little bit faster and it will do the same job both of them I'd probably pop on top of the soil maybe mix them in a little bit and then cover over with mulch there is a little bit of a fur fee a bit of a myth out there that using pine needles will do the same job because they are acidic when they're on the tree unfortunately when they break down they don't really lower the pH of your soil much at all you can check out a clip put out by Patrick from one yard revolution he spoke to Stephen from another YouTube channel Alberta urban gardens he's a biologist and Stephen gave a little bit of a lowdown of the science behind why pine needles don't bring the pH down in your soil so there'll be a link down below for that one what I like to do is just add four or five scoops of the sulfur around the top of the soil and over time it will break down and as the microbes act upon it and it will slowly drop the pH in the soil so one of the reasons I do think this Bush has done alright even though we have very high pH water is because I'm adding the sulfur onto the top and it's breaking down slowly slowly raising the pH of the soil not only that the bulk of the water is going through the fill tube sitting in the reservoir down the bottom and then coming up through the soil so the soil is acidic enough to count the alkalinity in the water and yeah by the look of these berries I don't think the plants too upset as I said before just quickly the soil test I'm using is one I was put on to when I was doing my PDC with Geoff Lawton it's developed by the CSIRO soils division you can find them online it's a very accurate kit I've lent it to a few people now and they've all found it very easy to use so I might be something for you to look out for if you are working with plants that require different pH levels now as for amendments I'm adding here some some minerals some rock minerals because this is a container plant and doesn't have access to the soil beneath it it does need the addition of some trace elements I think I'm also popping in a combination of chicken organic chicken pellets and also some worm casting pellets as well I'm just going to basically top dress this over the top of the bed I'm not going to add all of this because you don't really want to overfeed your blueberries and if you do add too much nitrogen in you can end up with more leaf growth than actual fruit growth so I think that's more than enough and then on top of that I'm adding in some saved compost from our compost cage this is very well aged compost I'm just going to put that in as a thin layer over the top try not to cover up too much of the trunk of the tree here and that's pretty much roll it as to I'm feeding up the the soil itself so I'm just adding on some loosened mulch or alfalfa hay basically and what that will do is not only break down over time and feed the microbes which in turn feed the plant but it'll also help stop moisture from evaporating from the surface of the soil so we've added some flowers a sulfur to help keep the soil nice and acidic and added in a couple of um fertilizers as well now about the only other additive I'll be popping in here is a potassium rich fertilizer just to help with the fruit formation you can add in all sorts of things you can buy a commercial potassium fertilizer if you want there's a sulphate of potash you can buy and another option which is pretty much what I'll be using is if I can just grab the bottle is a seaweed blend that has sixteen percent potassium by an Aussie mob here so I'll be using this every second week or so from now on just to make sure that this plant has a lot of potassium available for it yeah because the last thing I want is not to have a decent fruit set after seeing how promising it's looking with all these berries on here now for you folks in the northern hemisphere who are coming into winter just a couple of tips for overwintering one is don't stress if the plant loses all its leaves if this is the first year you've grown blueberries but most varieties are deciduous in cooler climates second of all don't keep the soil wet only keep it moist water it very rarely just enough so when you push your finger down there you can feel a bit of moisture in there you don't want the roots to be going dormant and sitting in a lot of water another thing you could do is top it off with a little bit of mulch like we have here and that'll help stop any evaporation through the surface of the soil the last thing you could do just to keep it nice and happy is to pop it in a position that gets a fair amount of your winter Sun even though the leaves will die back it just means it'll be faster out of the gate come springtime when things start to warm up and she wants to put on some growth if she's in a nice warm spot it'll be a little bit of a head start on the season for you so I forget to play actually plan out your blueberry I've got another

with local maple syrup and so it's uh it's a great sunday breakfast blueberries are really one of the healthiest foods around they rank really high in antioxidants which are cancer fighting compounds

be opening up in a few days each one of these blossoms these little bell flowers will be a blueberry when you come in here there are both honeybees and bumblebees which is music in my ears because they're the little insects that do the pollination they're on the job one of the biggest predators to blueberries is birds and as you can see over our head here it's netting we like to install it before the blueberries start to turn color if the birds see the berries turning color they will be in here before the net gets up and then once they know they're here it's very difficult to keep them out we don't have to net our our bushes here because in the forest nearby the birds have natural food sources i mean we do get some birds in but it's not uh huge problems enough for the birds enough for the people we all get along blueberries are harvested perhaps three to four times we have different maturities on one stem we have the dark blueberries which are ready for harvest now we have the smaller green berries which would be another three weeks before they matured one of the questions i often get asked is how do you pick blueberries what do you have to watch for you look for the the bluest fruit and they have the greatest sweetness and the most flavor i'd like to share with you the technique for picking blueberries what you really need to do is cup your hands and then roll the berries off with your thumb into your hand and then you have a whole handful of blueberries well we promote children and family outings in the patch the children just love this and they love to get in and sample the blueberries right off the vine you can't get it any fresher than right from the farm or or picking it yourself the flavor the freshness and the fun family outing make it really a

like do you like a really big Apple it's not like the juiciest Apple go for a middle size little size okay it kind of looks like a tiny blue pomegranate if I'm gonna be honest quickly at the bottom

are going to be trying the snack pack these are sour patch kids i have the red berry and the blue raspberry these were 2 48 at walmart and kevin spotted these i was like have we ever tried those before and they were in a weird place they were like hanging on the side of it not even an end cap they were like they're on the side of him yeah so yeah it was an odd place but it was it caught his eye so when we brought them home we put them in the refrigerator because we like this kind of dessert we like it so it wasn't refrigerated in the store it wasn't in the refrigerated section but we just like this kind of thing called just like pudding or jello or anything else so these are made with real sugar no high fructose corn syrup um it says they're called they're juicy gels so they're not jello they're snack packed juicy gels but if you know the snack pack brand you can normally find those in the with the pudding and they sell uh you know just chocolate and vanilla and all kinds of things but then they have these so it says there's six servings in the container so you get six cups and each cup is only 100 calories that's the same for me uh they're gluten-free these are made by conagra brands in chicago illinois i wonder if you can just slide this out without opening it yeah oh conagra oh huge big business big business [Applause] normally they just pop normally they do but sometimes you get that one that's stubborn i like the pictures on the top that's what they usually do yeah that's what they yeah they do yeah that's cute like mine are like i'm gonna have to oh i tore it can you get scissors no because i've already torn it now there we go this one's fine but yeah literally i tore that one i would of course you're right i'm getting the one in the middle i didn't think i would need scissors why do i get the special one [Music] yeah this is a broken one so we want to open this one okay red berry it smells good yeah if there's a box that needs some special help or something i get that one yeah or the package okay i smell it when it was cracked up literally yeah i wonder how this is gonna compare texture wise i tell you what it's a little softer than a jello but it's good it is softer um sometimes especially when the jello is pre-made in cups like these it has more of a rubbery rubbery um texture to it um that flavor is strong just like the sour patch kids it's a good one gummies it's good i like it it's very good um i actually absolutely love sauerkraut's kids it makes me wonder if she would like something like this they're good because she really does i mean she keeps a ball full of different bags you go in her place and there's a ball of different bags by her door and it just makes me wonder if she likes the texture of this i i truly don't know it's not jello in cups like this is not something that we bought because kevin and i always thought the jello brand had more of a like we said that rubbery bouncy almost yes texture so we bought pudding but not juicy gels so i would like for her to try these to see if she likes these uh this is blue raspberry it's 100 calories as well smell it for you it smells really good and the sourness level is not super sour i mean you get that that typically it's candy sour you know i like that in a gummy yeah because it's really small it's a little strong but if for it to have that uh very strong powerful flavor in that cup it's a lot it's a strong overkill i like it but yeah i agree it's too much but the red ones are really good yeah it's just you know something that's in that little the gummies it or on a worm you know you'll get those worms with multi colors like a orange and a blue it works because you're not getting an overload of it the blue raspberry it's it's so it's just an overload of that so for me personally i would not get that one again i think if you like the blue ones that's like your favorite you'll love those oh they did a good job they really did yeah it's really strong and it tastes just like what you get with the sour patch kids they think these are good yeah i do too i mean i think the textures are good i think the flavors are good it's got a little tartness to them but you know it's more candy-like than anything yeah oh yeah this is this is candy in a gel form that's exactly what this is that they did that they did a really good job now they need to come out with like drinks they haven't had drinks yet i don't i don't think so i don't think they've had drinks yeah now they need drinks in like a squeeze packet like a squish i don't know have they done a squeeze it version of that's been named with the sauerkraut i don't know that that's what they need to do so uh because we've gone from candy and now gel it just makes sense that they would buy liquid uh yeah they've had an ice cream uh so they need to do drinks next definitely but yeah both of these are good if you like the candy you're you're gonna like this so i hope you enjoyed

exact same thing hey everybody back from picking blueberries kind of wanted to share a real quick tip with you guys the trick to freezing blueberries is not to wash them before you freeze them just I go through your berries make sure you don't have any bad ones in there no sticks leaves or debris or anything and just put them directly into your ziplock bags seal them up and then freeze them what's gonna happen then is is they're gonna freeze individually and that way if you're making a recipe like blueberry muffins or blueberry pancakes where you only need a couple of ah berries you can just pour those right out of the package and then rinse them off and I'll make sure they're clean before you use them that way you can use just what you need and you don't have to commit to using the entire package now if I was to rinse these berries off right now and then put them in the ziplock bag and freeze them they're gonna turn into a gigantic frozen glob and you're gonna have to use the whole package and when you take them out of the freezer but I just kind of want to share this tip with you guys that way you can make your berries last a little bit longer and you don't have to waste

blueberry season I've been picking quite a few blueberries and man we've had some good ones this year we had a lot of rain and we didn't have a late Frost so big big nice sweet blueberries this year but I wanna talk about a few varieties here some information this first one is a new one this year it's a lap aha and it's one of the releases from the University of Georgia and it's you know very vigorous plants supposed to be and everything but you know I've tried a few these blueberries and there's a couple of ripe ones on here and you know they haven't had any sweetness really almost like I mean not lemon really not that sour but you know they haven't been near as sweet as the climax and some of the others but you know they're supposed to be very productive and I think the I think the flavor will improve over time because like says the first year in ground it doesn't have all the nutrients it needs yet its roots are not in the soil good so I'm going to try a few of these lappa haul blueberries and see been a couple of days since I tried any I'll see what it's what they're tasting like here yeah there's no sweetness at all I'm really surprised it's almost lemon like that's very surprising to me but anyway that's a lap ahall and maybe it'll make up for it in vigorous growth habit and maybe the flavor will improve over the years huh now this one this one here is another new one another georgia a University of Georgia release oka lockni and it is the latest season the mall it was released in 2002 I believe and we have a fairly ripe one here now on the trials of rabid eye blueberries where I live this one was the sweetest and I believe it may have been the most productive it was either this one or a lap aha is the most productive so I'm gonna this is the first one that's it's not real ripe oh but it's fairly ripe I dropped it here we go I found it and while I was getting that I see another one down here that's a little more ripe I think so we'll get that one too yeah there we go I'm glad I dropped that one I saw this when it's even bigger and it's more ripe so we'll try the Ochlockonee here Wow night and day yeah this had the highest Brix the highest sugar content and the trials around here and that is sugary sweet that is both of these plants came from the same place o clock nyan and laptop so they probably had the same fertilizer they're about the same size and do they bend the ground the exact same length of time here so how but it's super sweet flavorful that's going to be a good one that's gonna be a good one alright we're gonna go over and check out Vernon alright everybody this is the Vernon rabbit eye blueberry and it was really sweet University of Georgia in 2004 and it's supposed to be an earlier season and it did wrapping earlier than the Aleppo Hall and but it was later than the climax and all that but it's pretty healthy Bush it's getting some new growth on here and I've eaten several off here and I debated on whether to do even do a video on this because some of them were locked the oka lockni and sugary-sweet and some of them were locked the OLAP aha and tasted like a lemon so I don't know if it's going to always be that inconsistent or if it's just you know just the first year in the ground so this one is really ripe I've let it on here let it stay on here for several days and glad a bird didn't get it so I'm gonna try this one right now I've had several already yeah I don't know that's like the OLAP aha just like a lemon I'm here some more down here but I'm telling you the first couple I had were sugary sweet like the oka lockni but this is Vernon and I think I think the flavor of all of them will improve over time once they get established but they they're very healthy plants and I mean in the trials around where I live here I don't think Vernon was even in the trials I don't remember for sure but a lap aw no oka lockni outproduce all the old varieties so I'm excited about that I think that oka locked me man that's the flavor winner that even beats bright well ii mean really really good thank you very much for watching and thanks to all the subscribers and this has been another rabbit eye blueberry video thank you", "MXOn6bh2lrM": "hi I'm Gavin I mean and I'm Levon and we are the shallow kids today we are going blueberry picking and it's gonna be a challenge to see

directly squeeze it to the jam actually I don't have a fresh blueberry,\nso I use the frozen one But it's look good for me Add granulated sugar Well..300 gram is quite sweet You can reduce the sugar if you want it less sweet Turn the heat to low heat first So the sugar can melt, \nno risk to burn the bottom part of the pan As the sugar start to melt, \nyou can use potato masher to mash the blueberries And you can turn up the heat It become half from the beginning volume Don't wait too long to take out the jam from the pan It get hard quite fast and make it difficult\n to put inside the jar While doing the video and cooking just by myself Make it quite hard I wanna straight to taste the fresh made jam The bread is getting burn!! Ohh.. sound good? So yummy!! Thank you for watching my video :))", "n082Qv27x8Y": "[Music] take a look at what's going on here just rain got my day lilies I'm going to eat those and I want to quickly show you my blueberries and take one they're coming in look at these Costas blueberries these things I mean there look at them more more than grapes there's more blueberries on this thing and grapes so I'll see if we will find a nice ripe one this one looks good here that's almost right taste it mmm it's a little part because it's it's not fully ripen so it's got a little tardiness to it it's okay though you can't still eat them there's no one that's how I look at them when they're blue all the way through even to the bottom and you know they're ready let's write out mmm little better look at this look at this I'm going to try to raise right here yeah there's still very slightly purple on the bottom light purple they're still going to be tart you gotta wait till they're like blue all the way through and then are all sweet almost no tardiness mmm that's good another week they'll be I'll be eating these like they're going out of style but if you look around down here you can see all the clusters and clusters and clusters and clusters everywhere from this one Bush I'm is unbelievable how many blueberries this thing put out this year this is like three times a way to put out last year plus the birds didn't need them usually the birds are picking them off but I guess because all the raspberry bushes my grapevines you can see my graph lines are grown literally out of control my my blackberry bushes are gone out of control too has a wild blackberry that just came in and this is not my native blackberry cuz here's my native here's my bought not native does my bought blackberry and it's soreness and it gets it throws a huge pain ZZZ I've seen these canes get as big as 10 feet tall and maybe taller I mean just I have to show you this I did they look like they're going to go 10 feet this year I never seen a blackberry bush straw thankful canes but they throw these huge canes out but this one here is a wild blackberry you can tell by the thorns and I don't know where it came from it's definitely not a raspberry at least I don't think it is it's not a raspberry I don't believe no it's not because you could see the cane on it it doesn't have that blue color to the stem like you know raspberry here has that blue color this doesn't dislike a blackberry sim so that's blackberry it's a wild one we'll see what it puts out I don't know if it'll put out blackberries this year but you can see over here I got tons and tons of blackberries I'll make another video for blackberries I don't like mixing my videos up this is really about the blueberries just wanted to show you my my blueberries are ready I'm going to have one more these are that good yeah you see it's very slightly purple that's still going to be tardy when that's fully blue like it is on top then they're really good mm-hmm oh my god and it's unbelievable I noticed that they definitely picked up in growth since I put these wood chips down on the bottom down here I loaded the back up here or wood chips man these things are gone out of control everything over here is going out of control my grapevines are like holy smokes they're probably 40 or 50 feet maybe 60 feet long by now dural going alloy up to my tree over here the what do you call that thing right there the Green Giant all the way up to the tree and they're going to go up the tree I have to prune it it's unbelievable so anyway I just wanted to show you my my blackberries again my blackberries my blueberries there's a good one right here almost 100% mmm when you let them turn hopefully blue they're very sweet very very that tartness turns into a sweetness but yes that's my blueberry just wanted to show you how the highbush blueberry grows in relation to the the smaller blueberry bushes that you see in a wild which I have a couple of those in the back oh I'll show you them really quick and just compare the difference between high bush and Ilocos alright so I'll be back in a minute alright so this is actually like a week later since I shot that video talked earlier part of the video of the highbush blueberry that was at the top my property these weren't quite ready yet so I didn't want to really bring the video online until I was able to get something worth shooting back here and the birds have been picking the blueberries off of this thing like grapes so anyway I got a few on here that are ready and let's give it a taste test and look at it at the berry okay you can see it's a considerably smaller than the berry up at the front of my yard and this variety of blueberry is called fat actually I do different tags on it at one time but this is the tag that I I figured would suit the name of it best believe that was what it matched best so that is the tag for that that's this blueberry I bought this plant from Lowe's and these berries aren't a hundred percent right but let's give it a try mmm very delicious there's another one this one's a little riper let's try that this one looks real right see how it's you wipe away that that little book that dust that's on there see how that's black on the bottom that's a good blueberry mmm perfect there very good except eating one or two of them really does nothing for you got to eat them by the handful to get anything out of these blueberries this is so small there's not it they're not very satisfying and just to eat one at a time is better than nothing if you're hungry but it's like very unfulfilling you really want to eat like a dozen of them you know and just stir all around here I mean there's one here pick that one you pick that one pick these for the birds again alright I'm going to pop all them in my mouth mmm man I literally can eat these things non-stop all day until I get sick this is something I can never get sick of I could eat these things until I throw up there that good but as you can see the clusters really then give me too many that's because the birds are picking them clean and other animals the deer come through here and so I'm lucky to even have what I have right now and the other blueberry bush which is over here is even less now these are nowhere near ready unfortunately this is in the shady or part of my yard it's on the other side of this trellis so these are going to take a lot longer to ripen up and it is what it is I'm not going to move it now I didn't plan for that I didn't think it would be a problem but yeah we want to keep these in much sunlight as possible so they can produce a lot of berries so it's in the shade it doesn't produce that many berries but that's ok but you could see these berries are much bigger than those so those blueberries were much smaller those are the smallest these are the next size up together maybe a quarter of the size larger than those berries I don't think I can pick one that's right I should show you you know I mean these teas can be as small as that what you see right here - a little bigger one I ate them all guys I am on you I'm like a blueberry monster one of the Blue Meanies anyway give you an idea this is like a little smaller than the average size for that berry but just to give you an idea of the size difference you can see these are really small a lot of times they're this size this year they got a little bigger real big it out these are usually around this size and then these are always around this size which are medium size and of course the blueberries in front of my yard are can get as big as grapes they just get absolutely enormous so mmm leave not little one but like I say with this bush I don't get very many berries off it because it's kind of in a shade and I had a lot of plants around it so I got removed all those plants want to make sure I got all the weeds out of here you know it's kind of growing on its own and see there's something popping up over here oh that was a branch to the plant not an idiot I am let's see if we can root this I just broke a branch that came up off that blueberry bush right there I just but I thought it was a weed so being we took off very fresh cutting in it we're going to stick it in with our onions that I got to find a home for and we are going to root that blueberry cutting out how about that don't want to waste something that could be perfectly good so maybe we can get that rooted now get down on some soil plant it in another part of my yard I was a mistake I mean I thought it was a weed I yanked it but anyway that was just the backyard part of the blueberries of this video I just want to show you what they look like by the time I get these get around to ripening you the birds are going to get them because soon as a two-book turn blue they start disappearing and it looks like they a lot of disappeared off it already tell you the truth because there were more than what you see on here so it looks like some of them already disappeared but as soon as they get ripe I got to eat them but they come out and clusters like that basically you know and then I munch them down soon as they get blue I got to pick them Indian because if I don't eat them the birds will eat them all right so don't forget to Like share and subscribe and I'll see you on the next one take care [Music]", "j7WqooWlUug": "[Music] I spotted a question online recently and it was how do you know when a gooseberry is ripe when it's ready to pick because they actually do look pretty much the same when they're unripe as to now when they're soft and squishy they feel kind of gelatinous on the inside and they're ready to be taken home to be made into pies and preserves and all of that and that's really all it comes down to how squishy they are if they feel rock-hard leave them on the plant to ripen a little bit and just pick the ones that feel really squishy no I was thinking about things and I realized that I grow a lot of different berries on my allotment so what I'd like to do is introduce you to not only the gooseberries but the eight other berries that I grow here and I guarantee you that there's gonna be at least one that you've never heard of before [Music] these really should be netted and I should have learned my lesson because last year they were completely stripped by birds because birds love them almost as much as I do these are black currants and they're small black berry that are sweet yet tart so again they're going to be paired with sugar and a lot of prepared food so there's gonna be lots of jams and jellies and even wine featuring black currants and they're delicious and my favorite recipe is actually to use black currants as a base of a lid here now if you fill up a jar with black currants at least half full throw in some sugar and then throw in some rum and let it infuse for a while it creates the most delicious and dangerous look here because you can't really taste the alcohol in it friend of mine gave me the recipe years ago and it is a winner for sure you're interested in making it learning a little bit more about the method head over to lovely greens calm and I'll leave the link down in the video description black currants and all their relatives can easily be propagated by cuttings and sometimes it's accidental and in this case it was accidental I'd cut off a piece of branch and I was using it as a plant marker for actually for a string and I thought it was dead but it actually started growing and this is a new plant it was as easy as that just sticking it right into the soil so keep that in mind if you want to get any of these plants that I'm introducing you to because they easily propagate if you've got a friend with one you can have one too [Music] this next berry is relatively uncommon even here and it's called a just to berry and what it is it's a hybrid so it is a cross between the gooseberry and black currants so it has a little bit of each it's a bit bigger than a black currant but also sweeter than a gooseberry and I absolutely love these guys and if you can bear to leave them on the plant or if the birds don't get them when they get really dark and big they get really sweet and delicious I have two joste berry bushes and both of them are suffering from this this year and it is a disease specific to this hybrid it's called the joste berry netting leaf netting disease it doesn't affect Goose breeze it doesn't affect black currants as far as I'm aware and there's not a whole lot about this online they don't quite know too much about it apparently so if you have any information please let me know because I'm not quite sure whether to just let them go or to remove these leaves and take them off and burn them which is what I suspect but it could be relatively harmless who knows they're still producing berries though so that's the good news [Music] loads of new shoots are coming out on my thornless blackberries heard me rattle on about these before and I've even shown you how to make a trellis for them but thornless blackberries are pretty much my favorite berry they're not quite ripe yet but it looks like it's gonna be a really good harvest now the main difference between thornless blackberries and brambles so the wild ones is that these don't have any thorns which is amazing because you don't get pricked while you're picking them these also will grow easily along a trellis there's a couple of different types of thornless blackberries mine will actually be trained really well other ones I think are a little bit more upright but these make a really nice boundary fence and they really are the most delicious blackberries that you'll ever taste sweet and juicy and perfect for eating fresh putting in smoothies or making into blackberry gem thornless blackberries grow on second year wood which means that these berries are growing on canes that grew last year so all of these new guys that are starting to grow so this one over here for example I need to keep an eye on them pick the best ones out and keep them trained into the trellis because they're the ones that are going to give me fruit next year [Music] the birds have had their way with the red currants as well again these are related to the black currants they're related to the goose breeze they're related to the joste berries and they're also a tart and sweet berry and they make an excellent preserve red currant jam I've got a recipe for that as well over in lovely greens calm it's really easy you don't even need any kind of pectin or anything like that and it's one of those preserves that you can use in both sweet and savory dishes although most of the red currants that are along the sides at least the ripe ones are AWOL if you look inside you'll see plenty that aren't and this is probably because pigeons are not spotting them from above [Music] you know how I said that the thornless blackberries were my favorite berry it actually might be strawberries on second thought yeah it must be strawberry I've been meaning to make jam but I just keep picking them and eating them we've bought some in the fridge at home and we've been putting them into smoothies as well and oatmeal and everything they're just so yummy but I've got quite a few still on and I've got a special variety up here at the top and these are mar'ied applause and you'll know from a previous video that I planted these up last year they're smaller than other strawberries but what makes them really special is that they're day neutral and that means that you'll see that there's flowers still on them and they'll continuously put out fruit all summer long as long as the conditions are right I'll have some strawberries in this bed beside the mardet was I have a few other varieties so first off I've just got two plants of these ho noise or honey eyes and they were a spontaneous purchase and they've put out a few red berries this year and then beyond them so further on that row those are el Santa's and then over here I have a full row of little baby mulling centenares and you can just make them out through the straw these guys will come into their own I think next year and the year after [Music] the in this jungle of green leaves there is another fruit another berry that is actually a type of strawberry as well but a very unique one and these are pine berries pine berries are white strawberries and this entire row is about three years old and it has so many berries in here you just wouldn't believe it and there are a lot smaller than other strawberries and they don't really keep as well either so you've got to pick them quickly and you've got to use them quickly once you have them at home but the flavor is quite unique it's called a pine berry because some people think that it tastes like a combination of pineapple and strawberry now for me I think it maybe just tastes like a slightly more citrusy strawberry so it's got a little bit more zing to it and when I use these I often combine red strawberries with these guys just kind of offset that flavor to sweeten it up a bit and also because they look really nice when they're combined it's hard to believe but all of these plants began with just six plants that a friend gifted me something like six or seven years ago and these are not actually the original plants I replace my strawberries and the pine berries every three years and the way I tend to do that is through these guys this is a runner and wherever it touches the ground a new strawberry or pine berry plant will form and as you can see there's loads of them coming off the pine berries at the moment so I have no need to worry about having any more plants in the future just need to let these grow and then transplant them [Music] there are two main varieties of raspberries there's the summer fruiting and then you have the autumn fruiting and I grow the autumn fruiting here but that doesn't mean that I'm not getting any berries right now my main harvest is mainly in August and September but I've spotted quite a few little berries dotted throughout the lower levels of these canes and that happens every year it's kind of the precursor the taster of the harvest ahead now I've got two different colors here as well so over here these are a yellow type of raspberry and they're called autumn golds and then back behind me I have a more traditional red variety and together when they are on a plate or in a dish they look and taste incredible I don't tend to have that many issues with birds getting the berries so I don't have them netted but I do have them supported what do you think of my support system it's really just some posts and then they're connected with bamboo canes and I've just tied the men using baling twine and it seems to be holding them up really really well I think it looks alright as well what do you think let me know as a comment down below [Music] every single one of these blueberry bushes that I have growing along the side here is a rescue plants just either abandoned on another plot or given to me by friends who basically given up on them but they really really love the acidic soil or slightly acidic soil over here and last year it was a bumper harvest and it looks like this year is going to be much the same if I get these netted in time because the pheasants do love these blueberries and they're really starting to get to the point where they're gonna be very tempting for any bird that walks past so that's one of my tasks I would say for the next week is to get a structure up and over this entire patch and make sure that these blueberries are well protected I just wanted to get a little bit closer in to show you how covered my blueberry bushes are with blueberries just look at them I know that some people find it a challenge to grow blueberries and if your soil pH isn't right you can grow them in containers so in that case you can get acidic soil and keep them well watered put them in the right condition and I know that a lot of people have had success in growing blueberries that way [Music] in just a few minutes we've picked all of these it's a pretty good hole but as you saw there are loads of berries that need picking so I need to come up here on a quiet morning and get to work on the netting as well because I want to come back in about a month's time I pick those blueberries in particular now my question for you is did you know all of the berries that I introduced to you was there at least one that you didn't know was I right if so leave me a comment below and let me know which one or ones were new to you or if you knew all of them let me know that as well now I'll be back in a week with another video and in that one it's gonna be a little bit of a fun and special announcement and I look forward to telling you a little bit more about that later but in any case thank you so much for watching this video and I will see you next week bye for now [Music]", "cZcxTUHfAxc": "[Music] so [Music] so so [Music] me [Music] [Applause] so [Music]

dad started as a hobby actually right here in this section just as a hobby planet maybe four rows of blueberries and he invited his friends to come and they would come and get berries but the heat cabin come back again and they wouldn't they come back new they felt guilty because I think he did all the work and they were just coming at the blueberry so he started charging and they came back so that's how we got in the blueberry business well we're open now prati Saturdays and Sundays daylight hours which is about 6 15 the morning until nine at night we have the bucks to pick in the back the bag them up there 250-pound take cash or checks yep this tree is full of sweet ones I've tasted okay time to tell the secret of its Patti how do you pick the perfect movement well think about blueberries anything pink green or anything that's not blue is going to be parked and so what I do is I look for the pump pump and if it comes out easy my so that's the whole secret of it my secret is make sure it's blue and once you do that you get these nice plump ones that we can get that in there but you're looking your bucket you got some pink ones there you need a possum out to try out our blueberries because we're very proud of them and we want you to be happy but you got your bucket and like a joke we will just like way what's in your bucket not yourselves so that's kind of little Parker delivered formula nisha pick this be our 39th season and we've had families come for all these years to pick the blueberries it's really a nice bonding moment for the family instead of going to the mall or supermarket or a theater you can come out here out in the country where there's not any cars and skyscrapers and get to know your family much better really just by doing that and people come year after year and its really kind of sweet to see like I remember seeing the parents with the little girls little boy and they've grown up and now they have a little boys little girls you know like multi-generations coming as a family to come back and pick blueberries and and give them the memories that they got when they were children so the farm itself is located about halfway between the woodlands and kingwood so there's different ways to get here their website has all that information as far as the best for you it also has a lot of recipes because you're going to need to help

highlights report for gardeners from the 2016 Blueberry Research Field Day. The event is a showcase of OSU research hosted\nby the Dept of Horticulture's Dr. Bernadine Strik. The field day geared to commercial growers,\nbut there are some interesting results that might apply to your backyard blueberry patch. First stop was OSU\u2019s organic research plot. This mature field was planted in 2006. Dr. Strik along with graduate students including\nJavier Fernandez-Salvador have been studying the best options for organic fertilizers. They are comparing fish emulsion and feather\nmeal along with different mulches for their effect on yield and plant health indicators\nlike biomass accumulation. It is clear that the cultivar Duke does not\nrespond well to fish fertilizer. Compare that to Liberty which has done equally\nwell with fish or feather meal. Mulch type has affected how much hand weeding\nis needed, but has had little effect on yield. Next up was a set of demonstrations on bird\ncontrol. Now most gardeners won\u2019t need to hire a\nfalconer, invest in noise machines or put a laser in their backyard, but there were\nsome good tips from this session. Birds easily become habituated so those plastic\nscare owls and metallic fluttering strips need to be moved around frequently. Netting also works and can be cost effective\non small backyard plantings. It\u2019s most important to protect your plants\nbefore any fruit shows blue color. Once birds get a taste it\u2019s hard to get\nthem to leave! Graduate student Joy Yang presented her work\non how different irrigation techniques can help reduce fruit damage due to heat stress. This work is not finished, but preliminary\nresults show that microsprinklers can significantly reduce the fruit temperature. Additional research is still needed to determine\nhow this technique might affect the fruit quality. Mid-way through the field day, we were offered\na sweet treat. A tasting of fresh fruit and a processed puree\n(served over ice cream) that was prepared by the OSU Department of Food Science and\nTechnology. It\u2019s pretty amazing to experience the diversity\nin blueberry size, texture and taste! My favorites were Duke and a newer cultivar\ndeveloped here for processing called Baby Blues. It\u2019s the smallest fruited blueberry available\nGraduate student, Patrick Kingston, gave an overview of his project on growing blueberries\nin containers. He\u2019s investigating the best growing media\nto use and is comparing different combinations of fir bark, coconut coir and peat moss. He\u2019s also trying to determine which nitrogen\nand potassium fertilizers have the greatest effect on growth, yield and fruit quality. This is a project to keep an eye on - there\nwill be more results to report next year! The self-described, Stink Bug Guy, Nik Wiman\nstopped by to give an update on the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug. This invasive insect can attack blueberry\nfruit at all stages of ripeness and can reduce the sweetness of berries as well as induce\nuneven early ripening. A recent discovery of a biocontrol wasp in\nWashington State is great news for management! The field day wrapped up with walkthrough\nof the Blueberry Variety Evaluation and Selection Program field. Dr. Chad Finn of the USDA-ARS and Bernadine\nStrik of OSU provided information on the latest breeding efforts to produce brand-new blueberry\nvarieties. Exciting to get up close to advanced selections\nthat might be new future cultivars. I hope you enjoyed this research update from\nOregon State University Extension and check back for more videos soon.", "tvS4XBkmouw": "our blueberry stems edible while they are not usually eaten carrot greens are perfectly edible and tastes a lot like celery beet greens and Swiss chard are eaten for the leaves but the stems are also edible blue buried honeysuckle a variety of Hanukkah with an edible blueberry like fruit you", "QprhIVPGFpU": "hello everybody we've had this blueberry bush for almost 12 years gotten pretty big I come out to pick some this morning and I want to talk to you about this particular bush what I have discovered is that if you will wait until the berries on here get bigger like this one versus let's say this one and I'll go ahead and pick it and show you the difference one is really small and the other one has gotten bigger we were told if you allow them to get flu like this one that they were wrong that if they had a pink or red on them not to pick them because they wouldn't ripen after you pick them so we thought when they were this size they were right but what I have figured out is that if you allow them to get big on this bush below them to get big like this kind of flatten out like a doughnut they're a lot sweeter the smaller berry is bitter it's not sweet the bigger the bigger very it's sweeter it's right they won't ripen after you picked if you pick them red like this one this one is red and it's not right at all starting to turn but it's not right there's a few more they come out they start green like that and then they start getting some red on them and then they they get they get blue but they're little but if you let them ripen fully they get big they are so sweet I'm going to show you another wish that we have this this is one too but it's smaller it comes in in June but it's it's pretty much all been picked it kind of looks rough now but this is another blueberry bush that we have and it is loaded said the limbs are bent over from all of the berries on here but we're letting them get right to we're letting them get big as well some of them are ready to go some of them are ready to pick and I'll pick some of those today but again this is a different variety and no matter if these are small or big on this particular bush and I don't know the names of them when we planted on we didn't keep the names but this particular bush you can pick them when they're small and they're still sweet but we're letting them get big so that we have more fruit you know like this one this one is you know a bigger size berry versus say this little one here so we're gonna get more fruit but pick weighting and be patient and letting them get big because this berry on this particular plant will taste just as good as this one but you get less fruit see like these are big and ready to be picked and see like and this is mixtures this is new growth and next year this will have fairies on it and these are older limbs like I said these this these particular blueberry wishes are like 11 to 12 years old and so I'll also show you we are trying to make a new plant off of this one because this is our most we feel like this is the plant that tastes the best so I'm putting I put a bottle on here to try to get it to root and once it roots I'm going to cut this off and this right here will be a new bush and that's something that we're trying is to get cuttings off of this blueberry bush and this bush is way up in the air in it I'm gonna have to get a lighter to pick the tops but yeah I discovered he left those berries get big on that other bush it tastes amazing versus the little BT berry I just wanted to share that information with you guys thanks for watching bye", "rqx9Ca_6Q28": "Three, two, one.

Oh.", "UaXucaNrHTU": "sour starburst howdy we've got mini starbursts today sours michelle these are not that easy to find so please tell the people where they can find these um i think i found those at walgreens i want to say i feel like walgreens walmart and giant are typically where i find them but they're not always there they're not always there no because i don't think i've ever really seen these in the store when i've been with you so you've always found them on your own but um yeah these are kind of a replacement for your traditional sour starburst which you cannot find anywhere i found them like one time in the beginning like when you and i started dating and then never again after that that was like over three years ago and i believe that those ones were still also bundled up in a pack it was like half of them were sour half of them were sweet or something yeah and i used to just love love love sour starbursts so um yeah anyway we're gonna go ahead and give these guys a try they're not packaged up in anything so you can literally just grab a handful and pop them in your mouth but it's more fun to actually watch us do that versus hear me talk about it so would you like a little handful yes please there you go thank you and in case anybody is interested to see uh that's kind of what they look like and there's a few different colors so you have pinks and blues and greens and trying to think if these actually taste different they have different flavors in the package it says there's different flavors it says there's cherry blue raspberry watermelon and strawberry but to be honest when you eat them they all just kind of blend into one sour taste especially when you eat them because you just pop them all in your mouth yeah that's right i mean minimum 10 at a time or you're not doing it right you're not gonna have all those my teeth can't take them occasionally depending on the handful that you put in your mouth i just like had some saliva go flying um you do get different tastes so that's one of the advantages of these anyway whenever you're ready three two one definitely a thumbs up on these i don't think that i like these as and i like i i have to say not trying to step on your shoes or your toes or anything but i think that i am more of the sour candy connoisseur of the two of us that's very true with every other category i think i'm gonna defer to michelle like when i say something and it's an opinion you can kind of ignore it but with the sour stuff that's where i usually know my stuff yeah i usually can't handle super sour i mean these ones are definitely good but you definitely like a lot more sour things than we than me right so what i would say about these are i like those nerds more than i like these so if i had to just give up one or the other and these two things are still available as of now so you should hopefully be able to get both of them i would go with the nerds over these but like definitely like two weeks of nerds one week of these two weeks of nerds one week of these and i can do that for eternity and i will say because we haven't had these for like maybe a couple weeks now or maybe even a month but this is like a pretty good batch because they're not like hard like they're actually still chewy that's so true yeah you can tell so like i'm holding this in my hand like i do not feel any that are stuck clumped together or anything like that um the one other thing to be careful of with these those is that these have given me toothaches before that might be from eating too many of them but in the back of your mouth if you're always using those back teeth you might get that pain every once in a while well you do try to finish a bag in like one sitting yeah one sitting or a weekend yeah

or a container [Music] blueberries are a superfood the nutrient dense meaning they ain't got a lot of calories but they're packed full of nutrients and vitamins especially vitamin c and k and full of magnesium and fibers as well yum yum now you combine your blueberries in a supermarket or restore but most of them will have been treated with pesticides and things like that and they ain't gonna be as good as the ones you can grow at home organically free of any chemicals like that the fact that we can grow our blueberries in a container gives us no reason at all why we shouldn't start growing our own blueberries today it'll save us money it'll give us her endless little supply of fresh tasty organic blueberries that all benefit I know with 3 or 4 plants you should have enough blueberries if you want to grow blueberries go and check out your local garden center it's being recommended that you have a few different varieties so that the cross-pollinate and you'll have blueberries more often throughout the year also I've included a few amazon associate links if you want to help me out there it's not going to cost you a penny extra but you can maybe have a look on on them links see if there's any plants to your liking so what about the potting mix well blueberries are a seed loving plants and that's why a lot of people have problems with them sometimes you just put them straight into the garden not knowing that they're soil that they have is alkaline and the blueberries don't flourish those are slowly weaver and and die that's why it's recommended to grow me in a pot because you can control the acidity of your soil much better that way so what you want for blueberries is acid loving soil you go to your garden center and have a look around pH 4.5 to 5 soil for azaleas Oduya 4 we mix up our soil I'm gonna put some stones in the bottom of this pot so that the pot gets good drainage blueberries like good drainage we're going to be adding also sand to our soil mix what these stones all do is just ensure that those drainage holes at the bottom never get clogged up with rocks and the water can't escape free and what I've got you some banana peel powder and a peel powder that's right banana peel powder in another video I'll show you how you can make your own banana peel powder is full of potassium now you don't want to be adding too much nitrogen to your soil mix otherwise your grill plenty of leaves but not too much filled tascioni so what's going to be helping that plant grow good fruit so we want to get as much in there as possible this is organic it's made from leftover banana skins that have been eating so it'll slowly release the potassium into that soil and benefit the soil microbes and life like that so we're going to add this into the soil we're going to also add some more chips into the soil and some sali so we just gonna mix all this up the sounds going to help the soil to be more drainable and airy and also the wood chips as well now I have to say that is looking wonderful scoop that into the pot now what I'm doing is I'm just gently packing it down but not overly packing it down just a little bit put this pot in to measure it up I'll do it so we're just gonna sit this pot in here like that bury in and then fill all around tucking it down around the pole now you probably thinking what's he doing is he mad he's left the plastic on patience grasshopper this is where the little sweet trick comes into play I'm just going to gently lift that pot up by this and we lift with the shape of the pot just slide this out now you little be impressed after seeing that out yeah I can tell so we're gonna add a little sprinkle of salt for powder around the surface you can buy that quite easily stead cheap sort of how powders are always great to have in your gardening kit great as a pesticide and what this is gonna do is our water this plant we've obviously an alkaline water that sulfur powder is gonna help to acidify as the water mixes with a sofa over time the the microbes are going to break down that sofa powder and cause the soil soil soil to become more acid so it's going to help to counteract the alkaline water that's going to be water in this soil now we're just going to top dress this with some moles to protect it from the Sun help retain some moisture if some pine box and any you can use anything you've got on hand really so there you have it how you can easily grow blueberries in a container make sure you give your plants a good watering afterwards blueberries like water but they don't want to be wet and soggy either if you enjoyed this video you found it useful please share subscribe and like the video as well we'll be having plenty more gardening videos coming out home care homesteading beekeeping

Make sure that there's no mold growing in the blueberries or there's\nnot a lot of squishy blueberries. That is how you select a blueberry.", "dEBwlj6KCDM": "so I'm always looking for more ways to get collagen into my diet every day and what a great way to accomplish that is through just simple gummies on this episode I'm gonna show you how easy it is to make some delicious blueberry gummies whoa [Music] [Music] okay so blueberry gummies this is going to be so ridiculously easy and simple then it's almost gonna shock you blink we're gonna be done but anyway what we're going to be using is Lakewood pure blueberry organic no added sugar just straight blueberry juice this is my favorite supplier of beef gelatin this is by with proteins what we're gonna do is I'm gonna pour one cup just one cup okay shake it up just a little bit one cup okay to 6 tablespoons of beef gentlemen now what's so important why is beef gelatin so healthy this is predominantly collagen and you're gonna start seeing a theme that I try to get collagen in my diet is often as possible why because it's the most abundant protein in the human body and we're talking about the memory that's being responsible for skin hair nails all the connective tissues with carla tendons ligaments at collagen so as I poured this in here I'm gonna stir this up okay I don't know if you can get in there and see that it's starting to come Joe already and that's okay that's when we tell her what you happen then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna let this sit for three minutes so and three minutes I'll be back it has been three minutes so as you can see what it does is kind of look solid right but you still see it's kind of grainy in there so what we're gonna do is we're now gonna keep this stuff okay let me get this going medium to high heat we're gonna do this until it actually starts to melt and it gets hot we don't really want to boil but we want to do we do want to get this hot so add this sitting here and it loosens up a little bit and starts to melt I'm gonna start stirring this stuff to get it ready to actually put it inside the mold so you know the cool thing about this not only is it super nutritious but this is a project that you can actually involve the whole family especially kids this is actually kind of fun so well we later on go into where I'm actually putting the concoction inside the mold you'll see that where you know some kids will actually probably enjoy this and then we'll do the taste test to reveal all that good stuff and these things are actually phenomenal um you don't have to just use blueberry juice you literally can use them with any type of juice you want I've made all kinds of gummies before and some later episodes i'ma be doing some very very cool gummies probably gummies that you've never really combination never even thought about but like for instance a good combination with collagen so remember the most important ingredient in the beef gelatin is collagen vitamin C and collagen go together very well so you can make a gummy that involves you know a good organic orange juice and gelatin those are a phenomenal gummy but this is all about blueberries today so now it's starting to loosen up a little bit so I'm gonna start stirring it and if you can get in here you can kind of see it's melting right so I'm gonna completely melt this start to stir it and like I said we don't want to boil we just want to get nice and hot okay and now it's completely melted okay see some smoke coarse obscene coming out of there so that lets me know it's pretty warm etat I'm gonna give it just another 30 seconds of salt that's good all right now the next part the final part almost upon the part the final part would be a kneading action but the second-to-last part is gonna be actually getting this bad boy into the mold so I will see you in two point two seconds again now it's the fun part the wriggle fun part so I got my son he's back again this is Tristan if you missed the first episode and then the second episode so now we're gonna do is when you decide drop it right here okay word of advice for whatever reason don't turn these up after you pull up the actual solution because if you do for some reason they projectile explode all over the place Flynn at the hard way a couple times right so what I'm doing right now is gonna suck this up alright come on over and we're just gonna start filming off each one of these so even some of the younger kids I think would actually enjoy this after the process of making some good fantastic snacks and then even educate them along the way collagen is very very very important for kids because they're constantly growing and like I mentioned earlier collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body a good way to keep your skin healthy your nails healthy your hair healthy your joints healthy is with collagen in your diet every day I can't stress that enough having 400 all right and now what we're gonna do is put these bad boys in refrigerator takes about 60 minutes for these babbling stick and gel and then I will see you on the other side the taste test and see if these things actually are delicious be back shortly so it's been approximately 60 minutes I just pulled these bad boys out of refrigerator son are you ready yeah you ready yeah you ready yeah all right so what you do is grab the tray and then it's real simple all you do is just pop these out okay oh isn't that cute thank you all right but now do they taste cute Cheers no scared me for a minute man all right so a delicious way to get collagen in every day if you really want to you can't let your own companies um the next thing that I want to talk about like I don't have any sugar to this okay so and I usually don't add sugar too many things but if you wanted it to sweeten it up a little bit get some organic turbinado sugar organic cane sugar even use honey if you want to just a little bit sweeter but if your being conscious about losing fat losing weight you might not want to add that for sugar these taste fantastic just the way they are but anyway so let's recap this final proteins beef gelatin you can take your favorite juice I actually use to feel good live good you know some Lakewood pure blueberry organic juice like I said if you want to get a little extra bump in vitamin C vitamin C and collagen work synergistically together you can use orange juice in collagen it's very simple use about one cup of juice to about six tablespoons and voila you know all within about an hour and what probably ten minutes of prep time you have delicious snacks that the even the kids can enjoy these are young men and young women growing up they need more healthy options and collagen remember is the most abundant protein in the human body so we need this new connective tissue suitable skin you see what does for my hair you know me alright so like always help me help you and let's just get healthier one day at a time", "-kvKO-E1A-A": "[Music] hey guys it's anna here welcome

blueberry season I was using a blueberry rake so you can see there's a lot of twigs and stuff in here so I'm going to winnow them using a little wind tunnel fan and you'll see that when you pour them the debris will just kind of fly right out of the berries [Applause] [Applause] you can see all the stuff that came out of the berries [Music] and there is our finished windowed blueberries and there

welcome to another very exciting episode here on the mi girder channel I know you're going to love this one because in this episode we're going to talk about how to sprout blueberry seedlings from store-bought blueberries it's a real easy way to get free plants from blueberries that may have gone bad so I'm going to show you how to sprout them I'm going to show you how to harvest the seeds and I'm gonna show you my preferred method of sprouting them and there's a quick quick tip that a lot of people that have tried to sprout blueberries probably would have had more success had they known this quick tip so I'm going to give you that as well so stay tuned don't miss it you're going to love this episode I guarantee it let's go [Music] alright so the first things you're going to need to make this happen is a blender some old blueberries some paper towel and just a little bit of water here so this is all you're going to need a matte white actually and zip lock bag but I'll grab that a second um so the first quick tip about your blueberries this is the quick tip I was talking about here so quick tip of why many people fail at sprouting blueberry seeds is this it all comes down to the blueberries themselves you need to make sure the blueberries come from the United States if they come from out of the United States during the off season many blueberry growers are down in South America and because US quarantine laws state that anything coming from you know coming from other countries in the United States need to be radiated and that means they just take a low level of radiation and it kills off any bugs or pests what it also does is it makes the seeds enviable so you essentially have a fruit that you know is is by our standards fruit but the seeds are dead any pests are dead any molds board you know things like that they're all dead and so your seeds will not sprout but if they're from the United States you're a-ok the next thing is you need to make sure that they've been put in the freezer now this is a very very vital step that a lot of people miss blueberry seeds are perennial and therefore their seeds need to be stratified stratification is the process of actually putting them through or simulating winter like conditions a lot of people will leave them in the fridge for too long and you kind of wrinkly and pretty that's what happened to these ones we forgot them in the back of the fridge when we're on vacation and we're going to take them with us and you know that goes where the blueberries go oh they're shoot they're in the back of the fridge and then you come back to a weird science experiment so we fry them in the fridge they got nice and wrinkly pruney unable to be eaten there it is we threw them in the freezer threw them in the freezer for about two two and a half weeks ish and that is enough time because they need at freezing conditions or below freezing conditions for at least three weeks the longer the better but too long after say about five to six weeks it's not going to do any good to the fruit itself so you want to just put it through a few weeks a winter light conditions that's going to do is going to tell the seeds inside the blueberries hey you know hey we've fallen from the plant winter has come now it's time to sprout so once you've done that that is the initial stage that takes some time then what you can do is throw the fruit into a blender you don't need that much to make it happen but I'll throw in about half this container or whatever you do this even a few seeds we're going to throw in our water and you want a fair amount of water here because what's going to happen is your blender is going to masticate all the fruit masticating is just breaking it up so it's going to break up the fruit turn it into kind of pulp and all of your heavy viable seeds will sink down to the bottom as you'll see so let's go all right and about ten seconds where the blending is all it takes he's got a kind of a really watered-down smoothie consistency here and all your seeds are going to in the bottom of this of the the pitcher here so all we're going to do now is we're just going to strain off the the liquid and the seeds will have settled down to the bottom and so what we have to do is we just have to rinse this with water continuously and the heavy seeds will have floated down to the bottom and as you can see all the seeds are actually down here still that haven't even come out so most of this liquid actually is is mostly just you know just blueberry pulp and water and stuff like that so we can dump this out and then most of your seeds are actually down here I thought I'd have to do some more straining but they sunk pretty well in this in this example so alright let's go ahead over to the sink and we'll get that next up done and we're just rinsing out the pitcher there and now you have your seeds which will have sunk down to the bottom and any pulp so we want to do is we want to just kind of mix this around and gently dump the liquid because the seeds are the heaviest component the seeds will sink to the bottom and any enviable seeds or pulp will float out we just want to keep repeating this step until we have just pure seed all right and at the very bottom you'll see there's all your blueberry seeds they're completely fine they've not been damaged by the blender and that's because the seeds are too small to be damaged by the blades of the blender but everything else is mashed up so all right so now we're ready to go to the next step which is to get them ready to sprout all right so all I'm doing is I'm just sliding into a ziplock bag here a piece of paper towel and this is what we're going to sprout on our seeds out I fold it over about three to four times actually just so that there's some thickness to it so it'll hold on to water pretty well and you're really good sprouting bed for our seeds because they do take a while to sprout blueberry seeds will sprout in in the best conditions around two weeks so they're going to be in here for a while so you want it to stay Dan we're going to put some water in here but just enough so the paper towel absorbs all the water and then we're going to let just hold it upside down and let anything else drip out you don't want any excess water you only want the paper towel to be holding the moisture that is the secret to using the paper towel sprouted method and the next thing we're going to do is we're just going to take a scoop full of our seeds as you can see they make a lot and we're just going to take our seed we're going to just smear it as evenly as possible over the over the paper towel here use my fingers here might be a little bit easier but you just want even dispersion of the seeds you don't want any seeds to be stacked up really heavily or you know clumped up you want to be able to see when they're starting to germinate so having having that dispersion is is pretty important so yeah so there we go there is all you need to do now all we're going to do is just seal it we're going to put it in a warm dark location extremely important a bit warm and dark so we're going to put it in our pantry in a in the stew pantry in our upper shelf in our pantry pretty nice and warm there and that's going to be all we're going to do we're going to start to see sprouts about two to three weeks and then we can move them into a into a soilless potting mix to get them growing alright so there you go there is how you sprout blueberry seedlings from store-bought blueberries hopefully you all enjoyed I really do hope you try this now as a side note even though we're going to be sprouting these and getting a ton of free plants we still will be buying blueberry seedlings because the thing about these is when you sprout blueberry seedlings from store-bought blueberries you never really know the variety or the the type that you're going to get even if you really like the flavor the blueberries that you had blueberries much like apples they're very unpredictable because they're open pollinated and honey bees will pollinate multiple types of blueberries and typically blueberry growers will grow multiple varieties of blueberries to better their production because when you grow more than one variety next to each other they'll actually help you help each other out same thing with apples and same with pears a lot of different things are like that so so when they cross pollinate you're going to have a hybrid you're going to have a hybrid blueberry so we're going to be getting some very dependable known varieties from you know from a in actual nursery and also to plus side to that is that they'll fruit sooner so these will fruit about four years we got four years to wait so we're going to definitely be sprouting these as well because we'll get a bunch of free plants which is great and want some stuff to give away to friends and family as well but then we'll also get some plants that will sprout and about article fruit in about a year or two years and that's so we can have some you know instant gratification so just keep that in mind and let me know if you plan on

we're adding the the flour and the sour cream ultimately okay scrape the bottom I guess okay now what does it say ultimately I dry gradients and sour cream add vanilla and combine thoroughly but do not over mix now it wants pure vanilla extract but I'm going to use artificial and it wants how much one and a half teaspoons one and a half that's what I spilled I really need to use a spatula that I rubber spatulas missing okay now once that say to do okay add vanilla do not over beat now spread half of the batter into the prepared star springform pan so half of the batter okay then does it say place a layer fruit on top of the batter so we need to have and then carefully put the rest on and bake it so we're putting all of our blueberries on it supposed to be a pint which it isn't it's really hard to do it's a camera under my necks I think I really need to find that spatula spatula okay and then this goes into the oven which is already hot enough okay and it goes in for using a metal spatula dipped in hot water to evenly distribute the powder to the edges of hands really need to read first bake for 30 to 45 minutes or until the cake is firm to the touch what toothpick inserted should come out clean completely no cool completely and remove from pan sprinkled with powdered sugar and garnished with remaining fruit okay so in it goes be careful not to open this pan while you're working on it put it in the center and set the timer for the early part thirty minutes right 32 45 then you should set your little timer that you're going to carry outside with you because if you're going to lie in your hammock you need to have your timer it's my timer I think my timer is already outside I wonder if I got rained on if it's outside where we used it last let's have a look we don't have time for this of course because this video may be too long see I painted the teepee black it's going to show that to you yep there it is sometimes when you go out you need to

ahead and add in like oatmeal and stuff like that so i'll go ahead and we will already wash the blueberries and make sure they're all dry and padded and everything so i'll go ahead and turn it around okay and here they are so i'm just going to go ahead and just sprinkle a bunch on there oh i'm just landed on the floor it's all right and then we want to make sure that they're further apart and they're not overlapping i have another tray here if there's any yucky ones i can just go ahead and pick any of those out okay just make sure they're all spread out and then once the process is about halfway i'll go ahead and kind of move them around on the racks anyway just to make sure that they're all evenly coated with the the dehydration process they're all so none of them are getting stuck or anything like that these are going to go on the dehydrator for 10 hours so it's going to be on 1 35 so once they're done then i'll go ahead and bring them back and see what they look like all right it has been let's see 12 almost 14 hours actually the 10 hours didn't work so i had to put it in for a little bit more and you can see all the blueberries so some of them are late looked they look kind of puffed up but if you squish them down they're actually there there's no juice in them or anything they're just very very soft and crunchy so i'll go ahead and take a look at these ones kind of move them around a little bit i'll go ahead and jar all these up i have my jar i'm gonna put them in and i'll be right back and there we go we have our dehydrated blueberries filled up a whole half

so and they're just popping out all over the place I guess these taller ones could be cut out or cut down rather than let them get too tall I think that's typical if you don't take care of them that

and i'm gonna pick some blueberries and today i'm gonna make some fermented blueberries fermented blueberries that's gonna turn into syrup uh it's gonna use sugar and one that's gonna use salt so lecto fermented blueberries and i'm wearing a dress and wearing blueberry concert makeup and my mom said i'm crazy and she's scared that our neighbors are gonna see me so i'll make this quick it's really hot today so i'm gonna sweat my ass off bye i should not buy because i'm gonna be here okay [Music] oh these are so cute they're tiny [Music] these are really big i've never seen such big blueberries in the u.s but i think there's some different blueberries here in south korea see [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] it's quite hot i have this much right now i'll tell you a secret my mom gave me some so i even take all these but i'm so i'm already so hot let's try a new angle yeah squatting and picking so that there's blueberry there are blueberries and my face in the same frame i think it's too much work but you know what my family does when we're thirsty we should eat the blueberries to drink water [Music] just kidding you need to drink some water by eating blueberries while you're picking them helps [Music] i have two cameras filming me right now i feel important honestly i think my makeup is on point [Music] today [Music] sometimes the blueberries are down here down below in the branch sometimes you gotta squat and pick i don't like squatting [Music] my back is a little itchy i'm not sure if it's the sunburn or if i'm getting bug bites the thing about organic blueberries is that there's a lot of bugs and i'm scared of bugs but you gotta do what you gotta do take blueberries there's a spider maybe a couple more [Music] i think i'm gonna call it a day [Music] that was quite successful i have a whole bucket of blueberries i think i can call it a thing so these bad boys are 2.3 kilos they're like five pounds so proud of myself okay but i'm not done gotta make stuff but what i make today it's gonna be simple so i'll be okay bye bye well sorry we're washing the blueberries let's then tie the jar first i'm gonna put this in water and then boil it so that the steam sanitizes everything in here for the blueberry syrup it's it's also going to be fermented i don't really know what it's called in english it's like blueberry syrup type of thing but it's also fermented in the meantime measure out 20 grams of salt so it's 20 grams of salt per 1 kilogram of blueberries i don't know what the ratio is 1 two one to one hundred fifty one to fifty ratio thank you sister i used to be good at math when i was in high school but i went to film school so i blame black when you use non-ionized salt so i'm using sea salt that's not iron i o diced i can't talk either clearly [Music] do [Music] i'll give it a little squirrel salt to mix one last time so you want to put something heavy on top of this like a fermentation stone but i don't think i have that i don't like using plastic but we can reuse this after we ferment the blueberries the cap is a little loose so that the gas can escape and there's my water in here leave this in room temperature for a few days i would say four to five days taste it and it's sour enough you can stop fermenting for the syrup try to remove any excess moisture so strain your blueberries i have one to one ratio of sugar and blueberries since my jar is small i'm just gonna use 200 grams of blueberries and 200 grams of sugar when you mix the blueberries and sugar save some sugar for later [Music] so i just realized the first time around i only measured 100 grams of blueberries so here's the second hundred [Music] instead of putting something heavy on top we top it off with some sugar the sugar that we saved [Music] so it takes a little longer for the syrup to be fermented i would say about a few months you can start using it in like a week or so seven days but it won't be fermented it will just be blueberry syrup instead of fermented blueberry syrup so we'll check back in a week so it's been seven days since i've made these lovely stuff most of the sugar melted so i'm gonna stir this so that the blueberry syrup and the sugar mix well and over here i'm gonna separate the liquid and blueberries i don't know why i'm whispering but i am it's so pretty pretty sour i don't know still a little salty [Music] but not too salty or you can't just eat them [Music] it's not it's not mushy it's still got texture it is pretty sour and salty adding a little bit of sweetness would be good i'll try the liquid [Music] yeah it's sour [Music] broads it's a success [Music] we need to mix all the sugar in the bottom with the rest of the blueberry they're all even and balanced [Music] now you want [Music] so i think it began to ferment a little bit it's got that little thing i'm gonna close it up now let it stand in room temperature for a little longer the sugar is sinking already that's okay bye [Music] you", "uSmrMOdGNJo": "I came about to get started on my project this afternoon and I'm going to plant four blueberry bushes and so what I have here is some peat moss and some potting soil my weed block right down there and some landscaping pins and I'm going to pop these in the ground course that makes it sound easy this is a hard clay ground but it's not in good condition so I'm going to probably spend two hours digging holes but at any rate I'm going to dig my holes twice the size of the pots the blueberries are in and these are just some I picked up at Home Depot and I think these are last season's blueberries so they're going to be very root bound I hope they come back okay they're on clearance so they're probably three-year old blueberry bushes so I'll pick them up I think they were like six dollars apiece or something so I got three different varieties about Eliot Patriot and blue-ray and if you know much about blueberries you have to have different varieties so they will cross pollinate and you'll get double the yield and double the size of your blueberries if you were to just as compared to just growing just one variety one thing to be careful of when you're purchasing your blueberries especially when you're purchasing the different varieties is you want to make sure that they are the same season or that they seasons overlap and what I mean by that is you have three seasons with blueberries you have an early harvest season you have a mid harvest season and you have a late season or harvest so these will overlap I have one early to mid season and one late so I should get some cross-pollination between all of them and that's what I'm hoping for so be aware that when you purchase your blueberries to make sure you get a couple different varieties they will still produce if you don't but you won't get near the yield and there's one variety that I did pick up that I research that it's supposed to be a really good blueberry bush it's very versatile as far as the places you can plant it the climates the elevation it's called blue crop and I think you can plant that with a couple of different blue crops and and it does fine you don't have to plant it with other variety so if you see some of those you might want to pick them up and try out this is first year I've tried it I can't you know say absolutely that it's a good Bush but from what I read about it it's great so fYI on that one and you also need to be aware of there's different kind of bush blueberry bushes you can get these are high Bush and I think the other ones are called low Bush so I have three different varieties highbush blueberries so I'm going to go ahead and get these in the ground this is my first hole and we'll test the sauce here and see how big in this compared to the pie so I'm gonna go ahead and start filling us in with some peat moss and organic gardening soil it's not packed with potting soil I thought I said potting soil but it's garden sowing off Barry's acid and acidic soil so I'm going to put that in there McGruff place my bush and some garden soil next let's see the depths now I still wanted a little bit higher I want the I want the bearish level or a little bit and it sure about an inch higher than the ground I'll use a little bit of the clay just a tiny bit of what was already in the soil I like that much better now let's see how rebound it is pretty right then I'll break up the roots just a little bit actually seven and a lot of people apply saying now what are you doing I just gonna pop it back don't like rip down plants they are not happy when their roots are just compacted all together and they have nowhere else to go okay now I'll feel finish filling it in little more peat moss my garden soil and let's mix this in really good I'll mix in a little bit more of a native soil just a tiny bit and I like to leave my tags on so I know how my plants are doing which ones do well which ones don't so it might not look that attractive in the landscape but that's what I prefer to do okay three more to go okay I finally have them all in the ground and I space them so that I wouldn't have to put the weed block down we should be able to get our lawnmower in between the bushes and have a little aisle space first I was thinking I wasn't going to have enough friends to put the lawnmower through there but with the push mower we shouldn't have a problem so I saved me a step of putting down we block I'm just going to take off the big tags on them I leave the I didn't find tags and like little yellow tag over here and then I am going a little bit of mulch down around it to you", "w0qDHkFKJcQ": "so this is something a little bit different than what we normally do we're exploring different parts of Texas and trying to find out what all we have available to us and we are outside of Conroe or just around Conroe and we have come to a blueberry farm so I want to show you all these blueberries real quick and you can see my husband behind me photobombing as normal yeah well he eats them oh by the way what you can do at this blueberry farm is whatever you want to eat while you're walking around picking them feel free and then they charge you for your bucket and if you fill this bucket right here completely full it's about 6 pounds and $3 a pound yeah so let me show you the bush right quick just turn this around like this these are absolutely gorgeous and they're easy to get to and for those of y'all that aren't aware of how this part works what I found that works is grab a bunch give a little tug you get all of them at one time drop them up the bucket all right I hope this gives you all something to do in Texas and have a great day [Music] [Music]", "Dhbh0yx4EKw": "I found that blueberries were really well in Texas the best varieties to grow in Texas previously the rabid eye or low Bush Fridays but some semi high Bush varieties can also be grown such as the legacy blueberries in Texas were often ripe around mid-july my favorite variety of blueberry to grow in Texas is the battle blue it is a very heat tolerant and I feel like it produces a large amount of berries in a short amount of time blueberries grow vigorously in the months of March April May and June but towards the end of the summer start to slow down a bit I grew my blueberries in a standard raised bed with a layer of potting soil on the bottom and some mulch on top but I also find that you can grow blueberries and pots which in the long run may be a little bit better since you can control the acidity in soil type and are less likely to be affected by bogs squirrels and other critters like that I use as a Lea fertilizer to fertilize my blueberries I usually tend to fertilize the blueberries in early spring and about mid fall and I feel like the fertilizer helps the blueberries and add some bigger and growth to the plant blackberries are some of the best berries to grow in Texas they produce large sweet juicy berries that do very well here blackberries also tend to be very heat tolerant they can survive temperatures up to 100 degrees for more libraries also are very heavy producers and their second and third years they can produce up to seven or eight pounds of berries and so in their fourth or fifth years can produce up to ten or fifteen pounds Locklear is usually tend to button flower in early April and ripen around midsummer the variety I have is thornless and called the pachi it produces medium sized berries that are very sweet there are also different types of black rose you can get you can get bush varieties or climbing varieties what I have here is a bush variety and does not need to be trust but some trellising is always good to help the very long branches and vines blackberries usually fruit on first year or second year Primal canes raspberries are somewhat tricky to grow in Texas because of intense heat but it can be done raspberries do best in late winter early spring and usually late spring into early summer but tend to kind of brown and kind of die off a little bit in late summer so it's very important that you take a raspberry indoor or put an initiated spot raspberries mostly fruit in late spring and after flowering seriously ready in three weeks some raspberry varieties from only four once a year but other raspberries such as the everbearing variety for fruit again in the fall and into early winter as you can see here these raspberries took some damage from the heat last week we surprisingly got into the 90s and I moved these raspberries into the shade but some of them still got damaged most of the plant was buying however I found that raspberries grow best in containers I like to grow mine in whiskey barrel containers because they're large and look pretty nice in her patio I mixed a little bit of perlite about 1/3 sand and regular potting mix to make the soil here raspberries prefer well-drained soil and need to be water about three times a week if you live in South or Central Texas I do not recommend growing raspberries finally the last berry to grow in Texas is the mulberry the mulberry is not commonly grown by people in the gardens but is a heavy producer their variety of mulberry you see here is the dwarf everbearing mulberry it produces tiny sweet fruit most varieties of blueberry fruit about four times a year this mulberry has just finished fruiting for its first cycle mulberries usually tend to look a bit like blackberries the one difference between mulberries and blackberries is the mulberry leaves are shaped differently and often tend to fruit more and produce more than your average blackberry blueberries are very heat tolerant as they usually grow in areas like India or Pakistan and some varieties of mulberry are native to areas of Texas and are commonly found in creek beds", "5k9OM1k_MmM": "at tata nursery we grow thousands of goji berry plants and greenhouses goji berries are packed full of more

category today they're number one by a wide margin in the cannabis edibles market in California the largest legal cannabis market in the world plus products makes gummies so how do you create such a successful brand and become a revenue generating company so quickly to find out we spoke with the company's two co-founders Justin crunchy Quinn and Jake hi mark we started in edibles because we thought that was the place where there's a lot of things that can go wrong and if you get them right what you've done is actually create a great brand however on the way to making gummies jaqen crunchy made cannabis gum with a little help from Jake's parents the only space that we could afford was his parents free garage so who we've moved there and we built a makeshift cleanroom for the first six months of the company it was basically R&D facility office manufacturing facility packaging facility it was everything gum eventually led to gummies with his knowledge of cooking from his career as a chef and his experience in the cannabis industry Crunchie was well aware of what it would take to make a great gummy these look really good cooking especially at a high level is the blend of art and science it's the ability to give people the experience that they want the experience that they didn't even know they wanted a lot of the infusion process is extremely scientific and the flavors and how we do special additions and how people feel about the products that's the artistry what we've done is taken gummies which can be a category where it's tossed into different bags or boxes that can sort of not be an attractive format and we've made them really small which was hard to do to make them precisely dosed and then put them in a really convenient when you turn the top off of the tin what you have is all of the gummies right there and their beauty and their deliciousness it's a really important part of the customer experience that has made us products so successful in California looking good and tasting great our only part of the equation one of the hardest things to do really well in a manufactured cannabis product is to get the dosing exactly right every time if a product is too strong people wind up in the couch and you never want to try the product again if the products too weak you don't move it on and so getting that balance really between the two is the most essential thing to the customer and having the right selection of flavors has definitely helped win over customers we look at what people are enjoying in other parts of the market not just gummies just you know flavor trends things that people are really into now with the special editions we look at the short term trends and also things that we've never seen before that we know that we can actually execute so we do both seasonal and we do things based around holidays because you're selling an experience it's tapping into the desires of people around specific times and what about tapping into markets beyond California as more and more states legalize it's really important to think through what's going to make a successful national brand a plus we do one thing to make manufactured cannabis products and it puts us in a unique position to actually do that same thing in every state and in other countries in a way that is simple for customers it's simple for partners our ingredient suppliers understand it and the focus of the company is all line on one goal which is making really great products but with mainstream success comes responsibility I think there's an opportunity for the entire cannabis industry to actually bring us from where we are today to be a more mature responsible and adult this tree if you look at the alcohol industry they put a lot of time and effort to make sure that drunk driving wasn't something that people wanted to do at plus we hope to be a leader in those companies who are helping others to understand the benefits but also some of the potential downsides of cannabis we think all cannabis companies should do the same we work every day to make products that we like to say would make our grandmothers proud there's a lot of heart and soul that goes into every single product that comes about out of our factory and that's why in every package it says made with love in California plus products has recently launched mints

talk about how to harvest and store blueberries blueberries are such a treat when they're in season it's always for to the end of the summer early fall and I just can't get enough of them i just love blueberries but they never last forever so i want to keep them and so that i can use them through the winter so here's a few tricks so first of all when the blueberries are maturing on the vines they're like a little bush and then they'll make blueberries all over then they'll turn a blue color but at that point don't pick them quite yet give them some time to sweeten up and to plump up so wait at least a week to two weeks after they turn blue to actually pick them because that way they'll sweeten up especially if there's nice sunny days will sweeten up quicker than if it's shady and cold out so the warmer it is the quicker that they will ripen and as soon as they got to the point where if you barely tap them they'll fall right off the vine that's the time that they're ready to pick so if they're really clinging on to the vine still then they're not ready to harvest quite yet so if you find a clump of blueberries you barely tap them and some fall off then you know it's ready and you can just barely touch them and they should fall right off at that point I like to bring them in the house and put them in water and wash them real well so that they actually hydrate because sometimes i get a little dry it out in the heat of the summer and then they'll get really clean and you're washing off any dust that might be on them and once you've washed them you can put them as long as you put them in a single layer they do better than if you pack them on top of each other and you can store them in the refrigerator for three weeks even a month and they'll stay really well and if it's longer than that i like to freeze them and the best way to freeze them is at one layer so if you just keep them in small little layers in a bag and freeze them that way then they will store for months even years and tastes really delightful through the winter", "PGLoNRM_7FE": "[Music] it hurts like this hello guys i'm here welcome to my channel guys harvest nang blueberries [Music]

baking calm today we're going to make a homemade blueberry sauce this is what it looks like you can see there's really the blue fresh blueberries or you can use frozen in a really thick sauce just going to give that a try it's really nice it's got the Tang eNOS of the blueberry I mean it really highlights the flavor of the blueberries with the little sweetness to it so this is really easy to make and it and you know you can use fresh or frozen blueberries I've done it both ways and what you will need is a medium sized saucepan and you will need about a pound which is 450 grams of blueberries like I said fresh or frozen and that would be if you want to go by volume three cups so just put that in your saucepan now make sure you wash your blueberries and pick through them and get rid of any soft ones and if there's any stems which I notice I still have a few I'll just pick those off let's take those off there and then to that we need some sugar now you can use anywhere from three-quarters of a cup to a cup of sugar that's a hundred and fifty grams to two hundred grams depending on the sweetness of your berries so taste them if they're really sweet which some of them are you could probably use less sugar and if they're a little tangy then add more you can always adjust your sugar later as well and then you will need some water I like to add about 2/3 of a cup hundred and 60 milliliters disap water now if you're using frozen though blueberries I find because there is a lot of water I kind of tend to cut that water back to at least about a half a cup 120 milliliters then we will need I like to add like just a pinch like an eighth of a teaspoon of ground cinnamon and I like cinnamon and blueberries to me just go together again you can leave that out and then just a little pinch eighth of a teaspoon of salt and then we need a thickener so I'm adding two and a half teaspoons which is 8 grams of cornstarch you may know that as cornflour because we need that will just help them thicken all the juices so now we're stuck together and put that on medium heat and we're going to bring it up to a simmer ok so now add a simmer so you may have to adjust your heat down a little so what we want this to do is cook away at a simmer until we the juices thicken the blueberries start to break down and the law of course the longer you cook this the more thick the sauce will be so I find at least ten minutes and just judge by how thick you want it to be but the juices should be clear and nice and thick ok that looks good this is about after 10 minutes so I'm happy with this nice thick clear sauce so I'm going to remove that from the heat now remember there's a couple things remember as this cools down it will thicken up so keep that in mind but if you would like it a little thicker then by all means just leave it on a little longer so now I like to flavor my blueberry sauce I'm going to add just like a little bit vanilla extract like an eighth of a teaspoon you can leave that out if you or not fine just adds to the blueberry flavor and then I like to add a little lemon zest and lemon juice you again you could use an orange or you could even use a lime or you could just leave it out so always wash your lemon really well use organic if you can and I'm just putting like maybe a teaspoon only great the odor yellow skin you don't want that white underneath it's kind of bitter tasting which we don't want our sauce to be just a little and then I'm actually going to add a little juice if you kind of press down on your lemon before you cut it it's softens it up it's easier to get the juice out I find you know maybe a tablespoon or lasts really you can just do it to taste and then just stir that okay so we want that now to cool down I actually if I'm going to make some I like to make it the day before and then cool it down put in some kind of jar I actually like to use these canning jars kind of look cool and nice way to store and then just let chill overnight and like I said it will thicken now if say the next day and this has happened to me you kind of look and go it's a little too thin all you have to do is just pour the sauce back in a pot and just cook it a little longer and get it a little thicker if that's what you want because sometimes especially the first time it's hard to judge how thick you want it to be so now I'm just going to let that cool down and then put it in jar and put it in the fridge it'd be good for probably about a week and enjoy and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking

suggesting people have lots of fruits and vegetables especially the ones that are loaded with color orange green blue red and after we have the fruits and vegetables in line whole grains low-fat dairy products lean meats fish and beans it's so important for people to get colorful fruits and vegetables especially the little blues in their diet every day while blueberries are her great little fruit they are loaded with antioxidants they have natural compounds what we know is that these compounds help prevent the diseases of aging such as heart disease and cancer and Alzheimer's and macular degeneration the difference between wild and cultivated beginning with sighs wild blueberries are about third the size they have a denser flavor they're more compact and they have different cooking properties they have more skin because they're smaller size and the skin is where the blue pigment is that pigments called anthocyanins and that's where the antioxidant activity lies so they're actually higher in antioxidants than their cultivated cousins the current research shows that diets containing blueberries actually can reverse some of the changes of aging that affect our memory and our motor skills there isn't one area of health that is not being looked into because of the preliminary research findings with the blueberries and it was just critical that we look at fruits and vegetables as one of the answers and to get blue pigments in the diet get all pigments but the one we overlook the most I think is blue frozen fruits and vegetables are as good as fresh they're as nutritious and the quality is extremely high does a misconception that fresh produce is always better which isn't necessarily the case when you think about how it's picked shipped across the country held in the supermarket for a week or 10 days by the time we consume it it can be two weeks the frozen are as nutritious or more nutritious because they are frozen at the point of harvest the nutritional quality is extremely high it's preserved all the natural cane have the health benefits so they really are nutritious buy as well as it economical buy I love wild blueberries I eat them every day and one of my favorite ways is my cereal and with blueberries I'm sure I'm starting off the day with the berries they don't have to worry about getting them later in the day and often with

other thing I definitely wanted to point out to you guys today was umm well one of the things that made this blueberry picking experience so awesome first of all I want you guys to see that all of the blueberry mounds all the way down there all on mounds the mounds run all the way down and the way he did it he did top soil with a layer of mulch over top of that and for the most part there are like no weeds anywhere there's no other obstructing bushes like I said before on yesterday's video the there's no birds out here and even the bugs are kind of like a little bit overcast so it's definitely gonna help as far as keeping cool and all that oh yeah guys these blueberries are huge they're delicious yeah you're right this is the perfect time to be out here picking them but I definitely want to make sure I pointed out how awesome these berries looked cuz I was so I'm telling you guys I was so excited yesterday when I got here I literally probably ate as many as I picked but I guys will definitely bring you some more plant footage as we get out here and gets the pickin we're just getting here and getting started Heather is way down there doing her thing and check it out alright guys I got work to do I'll be back shortly thanks for watching alright guys here we go here's our next blueberry harvest for today this probably took us about I don't know half an hour to 45 minutes to collect these are amazing we didn't we did kind of rush a little bit at the end because we thought they were closing so we got like lots of little sticks and twigs and stuff in there but there's a few leaves here and there but nothing you know nothing worth worried about but it's always like I said we're gonna go ahead and take these home and get to it we'll show you what we do it from here in just a bit what's going on blueberry Pickers we are back at the house and we've got all of our blueberries now one of the things that the owner of the blueberry field told us was to make sure that you do not refrigerate these the first night when you bring them home you want to bring them home you want to set them on your counter you want to cover them with something that's not airtight that'll keep the bugs from them so they can breathe so we're gonna use this this year cloth here but you can use something as simple as like you know just a regular sheet um if you're gonna use a sheet try not to use like a you know thousands sheet a thousand thread count sheet did you actually do want this to breathe and there you have it right there grandma told you you have to leave them out overnight because you want those starches to turn into sugars so they'll be more tasty and you do not want to freeze them the first night you want to wait till the next night that way they'll be sweeter for you so here we go ahead and cover these up and that's pretty much it you just keep these covered up overnight make sure that she is not touching the berries and in the morning the starches will be sugars and your berries will be even sweeter and better than they were when you picked them and I'll tell you what if there were anywhere near as good as they are when we picked them you can't go wrong you know guys now we're prepared for flash-freezing now as always we on the farm suggest that you use metal or glass never plastic I won't get into that in a different video but for the most part you're going to put all your blueberries into a container single layered and then you're just gonna set this in the freezer it's going to flash freeze it now the reason we flash freezes so the Bears will have a nice quick freeze that way you can put them in a bag and they won't be mushy if you put it in the bag before you freeze them then they'll get stuck together they get real mushy when you try to take them out and they're hard to separate but if you flash freeze then it makes it easy to separate when you go to use them later on when you're taking them back out the freezer it also preserves the structure of the berry and it makes it easier to peel them later on if you need to remove the peels and also the stems alright guys and we're back now that the blueberries are good and frozen rock-solid there won't be anybody I would get done with this cuz she's gonna eat them all but now it's time to bag them up and prepare them for storage and there you have it guys a bag of frozen blueberries perfect for an outdoor treat on a hot day or whatever else you want to use them for alright that's it for today's episode I hope you guys have a very great day thanks for watching

the first week of fall here and I wanted to make an update video on the aronia berry plants that I have growing back here this is the aronia melon oak kharkov viking varietal and i've done videos in the past talking about its antioxidant value three times that of blueberries now the berries themselves can be quite a stringent and that's why my preferred method for enjoying them is to throw them into my smoothies there are many other ways to utilize the berry but what I found is that over time as the berries almost dry up onto the plant they become a lot more palatable they get sweeter and although there's still a stringent I enjoy eating them out of hand at this point and I'll eat them as a snack skin and all so I felt this was worthy of a share just to continue the discussion started earlier on this plant so if you're not already growing aronia or you're not familiar with the berry you may want to look into it [Music] [Music] [Laughter]", "ero1zj0rkHs": "what's up welcome back to

Brett you know when I was at the park shooting that massage video before that happened I saw a bunch of Hispanic people picking something on some bushes that I seem to remember from having been to the park so many times before so I walked over to see what it was and it was blueberries but I got talking to them and they warmed up to me pretty quick because I generally I'm I don't know I I like Hispanic people and I've worked with them before I've hired them to help me with tree cutting and stuff but they said that they weren't necessarily against Donald Trump that he was just doing his job and not like I'm for him but I told them that I might think of moving to Mexico someday and they said no don't do it because if you live anywhere where there's money the Mafia wants to get it from you and so I've heard conflicting stories about that but they're from Mexico so they should know they said that they weren't totally legal I can tell you that I've seen so many Hispanic people doing so much great work in our country and that we would be really screwed without them they do a lot of work that Americans won't do like farm work and all kinds of stuff construction etc etc we would be really in trouble and so we should be really grateful for them but at the same time they know that a lot of Hispanic people that are coming into the country are not so good for our country so its pros and cons you know but I hope that you enjoy this video and I picked that whole bowl of blueberries and we got pretty much all the ripe ones that were on there and it was kind of fun and I am enjoying those too day so I've discovered a blueberry bush and I'm not the only one that's discovered the blueberry bush me amigos here I've discovered it I went and got myself a little bowl we're gonna work it baby we should sing like a blueberry song you know I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill you were my thrill when I found you I don't know the rest of the words though I'm sorry I got a good voice though huh when we're apart I'll follow you still cause you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill oh I'm glad I'm tall yeah you're tall too aren't you you can you can bend the branch and there's no breakage you can bend it yeah but I can't do that because I'm holding the bowl and my camera at the same time I remember what this bushes was like a like three feet high I was appalled he was lava coming here man and pick it he was going in the pool big big big big thing okay can I ask you all a question what do you think about Donald Trump do you like Donald Trump no yes no no your Amiga you know what I'll tell you something funny 25% of the American Hispanic population does like him yeah 25% according to the news the other night but but you guys don't think that he's like an [Laughter] hey everybody I forgot to mention that I really need your help many of you have enjoyed and really loved my massage products and my millet haul pillows etc and if you could help me to promote them by sharing them with your friends and family that would be so awesome and then they would get the benefits of those products and so if you could take them over to people's houses or to work etc let them touch and feel and try out the products then I'm sure that a lot of them would really go for it and want to buy them and so tell them about Brett's natural health and send links via email or whatever

is Sophie s2 these skills eeen hope you all are fine and doing well and enjoying my life today I thought making Jam and it's out of the berries I've got some fresh strawberries which have put it in the water for washing I've got blueberries and raspberries and I've got blackberries so here it is and rinse it well in water and I'll get back to you okay and I've just explained it's a five-step how much of ingredients of each one I need and the way how I'm going to do it okay so here I have just crushed it in the grinder the strawberries and also the blueberries the raspberry and the blackberries so either you can chop it finely or you can just give 2/3 twists in the grinder and you can just mash it up so this is around two kilos of both fruits I've taken two kilos of sugar too so if you want less sugar you can put one in a half kg or even one kg but because I've put both the fruits the strawberries sweet but the other fruits which I put it's a little sour so equal quantities of sugar I just wanted a little bit of flavor so I'm putting one piece of cinnamon and around four or five cloves just for flavor in the gem so I'll show you how I have cleaned the fruit in the fruit thoroughly and then I have just cut it can just take this out and it comes very well or you can just just put it just scoop it with your knife okay just go fit with your knife and you can just take it off or you can just cut it see from the side of this notch and then you can just take it off this way and it comes out you see some people who even take out the stem with by putting a straw true and then it just come up comes the whole thing comes out very neatly so these are the various ways you can just clean your strawberry and have it chopped it or you can just blend it totally twist and they crush it right for making the jam you need a very thick bottom contain or a pen so I have taken my pressure cooker and it should be fairly large because when it starts boiling it'll start bubbling and we don't want to hurt our fingers or hands so I'm just pouring the both the crushed fruits in the okay I'm putting the sugar in it okay I just let it stay for an hour or so you can also keep it overnight if you want to but I'm just keeping it for an hour so you know so it gets a better blended inside and all the juice will come out along with the sugar do you see how its loose a little bit okay and I'm going to put the the cinnamon and the fuel clothes which I just follow a taste the flavor and then you're going to take it out once your the jam is done in before if you can take it in between so I I like little chunks of the fruit so that it's so nice when you spread it when you choose the fruits see that it is because for Jeremy you need nice fresh fruits which is just ripe not overripe okay okay now I'm going to put it and I'm fire bottom and and see that we have to constantly stir it we don't want it to get burnt on the in underneath and it's high flame laughs so we cannot just leave this place and go so we have to continuously stir it because otherwise the jam will turn out to be something else so see that we constantly stir the the container with a nice long spatula so that it won't put on your hands now this is a container and using for once the jam is done because you can buy it in the store you should take it out and show it to you since you get these jars so you can nicely fill them up and gift it to someone because it's very convenient now sterilizing the bottle is a whole procedure completely sterilized before you can put the jam in it because after taking so much of pains making the jam we don't want any fungus inside the jam once if the bottle is not clean okay and I will tell you step by step how I do it because I need to sterilize all these bottles okay okay so you see yes what cinnamon peace I can just stick it up I just want the thrill of it so that you know it's a nice wave oh just reminds and it says but the other flu listen it tastes really good so I've just put the water to boil for sterilizing my bottles although they are new it has to be sterilized really well in boiling water till the brim and the inner ring should should not be put in boiling water because you will destroy the rubber ring round which is supposed to seal the bottle okay lovely natural color of it there are some people who blend it really well they just want the pure rate but I don't do it because I like to bite on it in between that's why I just give a little two three twists in my grinder mixer and I like the seeds of the raspberries to be seen and see you know it is it's boiling now so now you have to adjust the heat and don't let it spill okay so we just suggest the heat be careful we don't want any spillage okay it has to be a big boy and then when it comes to the brim you have to lower it and adjust the frame and this is the foam which comes and you can take it off with imagine let's be doing the foam okay so similarly from the sides you just have to scoop it out on the top this be okay and there's miserable and keep storing it see the lovely colour it keeps reducing canning is a big process it has to be shown in another video so I'm just showing the quickly how to make a jam so basically the container should be clean just rinse it in hot water after washing it thoroughly with running soap and water and then see that it though cadena the glass bottle are you going to pour the jam is boil or sterilized in boiling water before pouring it see it has reduced and see the color oh god it's so nice and see this is how it bubbles and you have to be ready careful that's the reason we need a big ladder so that it doesn't straight on y'all and okay and you have to keep starting much and if you cannot manage it then you just have to lower than actually so that it want to take your hand you see how it is could look at the color it's the natural color and I'm not putting any preservatives in it I bought it from the stores but if you add if you get organic it's much better from the farm so just keep stirring have patience and be careful while you're starving you can also put a glove keep both glove on your hands and stuff yeah I like these pieces inside the space event then you put it onto the toast or bread you get white effect and you can just I just love it after thankful people to give it away you just need all that and give it a regional my friends and Boyer comes to visit me hardly remain such as I know and sometimes my family don't even get a taste it that's a funny spot anyway I'm gonna taste it definitely weather my family tastes or not and before it gets over and I like my jam to be sweet I don't mind if in putting more sugar to it then they're required among because I like it sweet I'm not diabetic as of now I don't know whether I will be so I might as well enjoy my sweet relations whatever I'm having sweet I will have it till I am said that or diagnosed that I'm diabetic and even if you're diabetic you can have a little sugar okay just have a little jam don't have too much in on your toast that's it you see how thick it doesn't come now see how it's dropping right so you still have to keep stirring it probably probably so I'm just putting this plate in the freezer for 10 minutes just to check this is a method in checking the weather the jam is done or not there are several ways in checking whether the jam is done or not some say it's one string consistency but I don't know buy the one string consistency I think the best thing is by the look of it like it will be very quite thick when you pour it it'll just fall down its yet not done and also it's good when you put the plate in the freezer of ten minutes and you fold a little bit and then you just scrape it through a spoon or your finger it won't drip back so that's the perfect way of knowing whether the jam is done or not okay I've taken the plate now after I kept it for 10 minutes in the freezer and now we are going to do the jam test okay ladies we take some of it and then we just put it over here let it cool for some time it gets cold fast because it's from the freezer you see and then what we're going to do this we are just going to draw a line this way okay you see it doesn't flow back right so which means it's done you say no it's really done need to switch off the fire let's see the color and it's only Jam you can give it to your children and you know that no preservatives is added in it and you can it's pure fruits nothing else it's just sugar and fruits and you can put whatever floats you want and the sugar and they take some time be careful when you stir it and when it's done it's done you can just put it in containers give it your friends don't forget to subscribe ring button and give me a thumbs up if I can do it you can do it so please try it and give me a valuable comments I'd love to hear that okay okay so now I'm going to just pour it into the container it's hard to be careful okay see that it's only fair after so much so here I have just kept it in these containers I filled it up and I've got around each of these 250 ml containers first these lovely cute ones you see I'm thinking of giving this also Hwy 2 I've got four of these and I've got this much that is extra I'll just finish it today for breakfast so once you fill it what you have to do is take a wet cloth a clean cloth or a tissue and you have to just wipe the outside the rim and so that it's kept neat so you have to let it cool okay for some time and then you just have to take this lid put it on the top because it creates a nice a seal and then on the top of that you have to screw us okay and when he's calling it you have to screw it and then just tight enough when it gets tight just that and then a little okay and for canning you again put it again in the electric cannon or in the stock pot and put it again for another 10 to 15 minutes to boil empty adduct okay so now it's not cold I just wanted to show you how to close it so I keep it over them till the whole thing is cool and then I'm going to close it after cooking all the edges and I'll be closing it so this is how you make the jam it's quite easy little time-consuming but it's worth it because you know that you have made with which float and it's really real fruits which children would love having it and you know it's your own made homemade jam and you will really see how good it is it's so tasty so this is my display of my jams ready to go it's kept for cooling and I'll wait for it to cool and then I'm going to close it okay so here's my toast and you put some butter it's my breakfast so we each have to eat right and here goes my lovely jam see how well it is formed wow it's perfect see how it's great I can put some more Jam you know because I'm not diabetic I have to really enjoy what I eat and when I eat if I don't eat it's okay so I'm just gonna make a sandwich out of it and now I'm going to relish it what more you want with a hot cup of coffee let me just taste my coffee and my sandwich that's so cold it's better than what we buy such good flavor off the fruits and it's really not too sweet at all it's just so good just perfect for the jam sweetness thank you so much for watching don't forget to subscribe and hit the power button also I need your most valuable comments as I always tell you and you all have a great day thank you", "-_AC26OUfNQ": "okay guys I'm in the blueberry bushes now shoot these things are taller than me okay here's my height here's how far it goes up isn't that crazy look at these blueberries they are so amazing they have the best ever and so there's no chemicals they're getting really good well water when they water mostly they're just water by the rain and we're out here way out in the country this is about two hour drive from see some of them aren't quite ready yet it's gonna be he told me you know not they're not letting people come pick them right now you pick your own blueberries and you get just a phenomenal blueberry look at these amazing anyway he said they're about probably a couple more weeks two or three more weeks before they're really in season see most of them are real green see there's there's actually four colors of a blueberry before you pick it before it turns blue it's red green red and then purple and then blue so when they're this color they're good to go Molly's disgusted she says I've had enough of this mom I'm ready to go anyway we're we're gonna stay until it gets dark we may spend the night and Rhynie tonight my van my for white rainy van okay look at this oh my goodness they're just rows and rows and rows it's really kind of needing to be pruned out here the roads are getting overtaken and it's kind of hard to pull my wagon through here but it still works okay so I put the blackberries up there's my blueberry basket I got one to fill up and when I'm filling up so yeah this is now look there's a little hole here where I could go through and whoops I'm just fell off okay ah okay the fellas over there dr. Wallace and catfish were trying to get me all riled up about the snakes here in Texas uh so well there's not any poisonous poisonous ones oh yeah there is I see yeah well they love me I see them and they just usually just scurry on about their way they don't bother me and typically this isn't where they hang out so but you never know you might find one usually they're over there not too far by the little pond the like area they got about three ponds out here this is amazing place to come pick blueberries they do sell to some of the local grocers I believe he sells some of the Whole Foods because they're organic and they don't use any chemicals whatsoever I'm not telling you you should come here in fact I hope you don't so there's more blueberries for me haha he's just kidding so anyway there's the anyway word that's my favorite filler word I guess so what are the medicinal values of blueberries well call doctor blueberry he'll tell you there's all kinds of benefits from blueberries the darker the berry the the better it is for you and they're sweeter so what's the deal Molly you know I give you she was barking at me to give her a blueberry I give her a blueberry now she plays with him she crunches him up and she doesn't need them I told her if you're not gonna see there she goes nope yeah if you're not gonna eat them don't play with them okay well I'm gonna get to blueberry picking and I love this it's outdoor listen you can hear the birds you know I'm listening to nature I'm listening to the the occasionally an airplane will fly over I'm sure it's headed for DFW but not over this way way over there say you barely hear him but it was it's supposed to rain for the next seven to ten day so I thought well I'll get out here ahead of the crowds and let them get get a few blueberries so but I'm finding out see they're not really that many available yet there's some right there now the way you want to pick blueberries is you just you want to make sure they're blue not purple or that color that's this kind of ribbon green still but well that's why they call them blue berries goji berry dairy they gotta be blue okay well I'll maybe I'll get these

"Y8ZNi2C-Jd4": "you [Music] hey guys what is going on it is the middle of July the blueberries are just starting to ripen up so come along we're going to pick some blueberries we're gonna do something I've never done which is dehydrate blueberries all right let's get to pick [Music] [Applause] [Music] we got some pop balls up there that will be ready here first frost a couple months away alright now we got the blu-rays prick we're gonna get them what rinsed off and washed and then on to the next step so here's the blueberries that we're going to be dehydrating not all the ones that we pick but just some to dehydrate [Music] we can we give you three old sand blueberries to avoid disaster there you go buddy okay what I'm doing here is you got out before you dehydrate blueberries you got to freeze them to break the skin so they can G hydrate properly also it's gonna take forever from what I've read so we're gonna just go ahead and do just that be back with you [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so this is what we ended up with it went okay I don't know if I'd dehydrate blueberries again but I'm gonna use them in oatmeal cream wheat and stuff like that this winter maybe pancakes rehydrated mmm pancakes but I think as long as you have the freezer space it's probably just as easy to freeze them for freezing them before I D hydrated them to break the skin did not really work and it took longer than I thought so you know it took longer than I thought it would dehydrating because the freezing didn't make the skins crack or break so it's a good experiment I enjoyed it then obviously I knew we get less than we put in because dehydrating taking away with little liquid so but yeah thanks for watching guys I hope you enjoyed make sure you subscribe hit that Bell for

today we're going to be talking about how to grow blueberries in containers in Wisconsin why would you want to grow blueberries in the first place well blueberries are a very healthy fruit they are very high in antioxidants they are very high in fiber and other micro vitamins minerals and are a very healthy addition to any diet unfortunately the soil in Wisconsin has a pH of over seven and we need a 4 point 5 to 5 soil pH soil to grow blueberries we are going to create a soilless media for our blueberries in this pot we're going to use 1/3 pine bark 1/3 pearl light and 1/3 Spagna moss per video keep moss now we placed in our container 1/3 approximately 1/3 of the pine bark 1/3 of the perlite and 1/3 of the peat now we're going to can either use your hands or a trowel mix this boiling together kind of like making coleslaw yes or whatever fun now when you've got it pretty thoroughly mixed and you can see by the different textures and colors when you've got a good mix we're going to be adding that soilless medium into our container now this is a five gallon container and it has had extra drainage holes put in the bottom of it you want to be very sure that you have proper drainage otherwise the water will collect and will rot the roots of your plant they need a little bit more you want to mix up enough medium so that you have it to approximately the top of your container now if you notice the color of the container is green if you use a black container the black attracts heat and holds the heat and blueberry roots are very sensitive to the heat and will not produce well and will have plant die back so you want to make sure that you using a colored pot in this case it's green so it kind of blends in with the weeds once they start growing the cultivar that we're going to be planting today is called pink lemonade and I'm going to take it out of the container it's been on the market for about two years and it's got beautiful spring color with the white two turning pink little flowers and then in the summer if it's just gorgeous these gorgeous blueberries that start out green and then as they mature turn into a really beautiful dark pink and then in the fall it has a beautiful orange foliage so it'll be a nice attractive addition to your I'm loosening the soil a little bit and I'm going to put it in this soil of medium that we made and I'm going to put it about level with the container it does look like we need to add a little bit more of our soil look like we've got it about level with the container and now we're ready to do the next step see now that you blueberry has been planted in its container it is fine to lead as a patio container planted you can put it in an area where it's going to get six to eight hours of Sun a day you will have to water it thoroughly and that means not wet but moist and how would you tell that how often do you have to water your plant it's not on a schedule stick your finger there finger to about an inch into the soil if it feels dry then you need to water water thoroughly but gently until you see water coming out of the bottom of the holes let it thoroughly drain and it should be fine after a successful summer of growing your blueberry in a container out of the ground you are going to need to have to bury the pot to help you the entire container into the ground to the level of the container in order to insulate the roots from the freezing cold that's going to help your plant survive the winter your other option is to plant directly into the soil putting in the pot digging your hole putting in the pot and setting it directly into the soil and moving the soil around it that way you do not have to move this the plant year in and year out move it out in the spring move it in in the fall if you choose to plant your your blueberry bush into the ground you want to make sure that you're putting it in full Sun and that also applies to if you're going to keep it on your patio when we say full Sun we made eight hours of full Sun it's what the blueberries need in order to set up fruit and to have a harvest okay we've dug a hole then that will the container will fit in up to its rim but before we put the container in the ground we're going to want to add some rye and that's going to help with the drainage so that the soil doesn't block the drainage as it's coming out of our container so if you have some space between your container then you can fill it up with the soil that you took out when you were digging the hole we have the container now in the ground level with its its rim is level with this the ground here and the next thing that we're going to do is to thoroughly water it it's going to take a little while for this to to sink in establishing a new blueberry bush you're going to need to supply it with an extra sulfur source so we are going to be applying an elemental sulfur which comes in a granular form like this now for a new bush you will apply it approximately four weeks after planting sprinkle it onto the soil according the rate according to your package directions work it in lightly and then water once your blueberries have become established you're going to feed them in early spring with another dose of the elemental sulfur granules water it in apply it according to the package directions approximately three weeks after you have applied your elemental sulfur supplement which is a very slow releasing sulfur you're going to need to supply with a quick release sulfur and that is in the form of mere acid which is a plant food available at most of your plant centers you mix it into water according to the directions on the package in water with the mere acid approximately two and a half to three weeks throughout the summer from late spring until mid summer the site that we've chosen is our square foot garden and this gets our full Sun requirement and we I just wanted to show you some of the cultivars that we planted last year so this is our second year this one is Polaris this is our new one that we just planted the pink lemonade this is the st. cloud and this one is north blue what you might want to do with your plants to protect them from the rabbits is put a little cage around here that's what we have done and also we put a mesh II kind of top over it to protect blueberries from the birds if you want to harvest some of them so enjoy your blueberries", "P5yXeRsw88U": "hi guys once again it's Christine here wanted to show you my blueberry bushes which are doing stellar right now I've picked so many off of these blueberries already I'm like having people come pick them because I've had my full so I should actually make a blueberry pie I haven't really thought about that yet but but yeah so these ones are there they're really good size not super sweet but they taste real good and they get real real big and I'd had to put up this netting to keep the birds out because they kept getting in there especially the Robins hmm I'm really good with all this Sun and all this heat that we've been having here in Washington this summer it's just really been wonders for these berries now I always try to leave like an opening for this and I know where the openings up and then it makes it real easy to to pick the berries so it's just a matter of knowing where that seam is this one's totally loaded blueberries way down in there and this trust me this thing has been picked over you know I mean me and my stepmom both now we have picked so many berries off of this is just what's left and moving on to the granddaddy this thing's huge I've been pruning this thing now for probably a good ten years if not longer and it's doing real very good it's got huge berries these ones aren't aren't too big right now they picked most of the biggest ones off but blueberries all over and like I said this is nothing I've been picking off of this for probably a month now and this is everything that's that's left I've eaten thousands of blueberry and stuff of these bought these push it click them all they're everywhere I can hear that Robin there's two sparrows caught under here yesterday I had to rescue him I don't know how they got in there it's pretty uh nope where's the cat so yeah all kinds of blueberries it's hard not just down here and just eat them these are tiny compared to what we're on it millions look at them all and they've been getting right and falling onto this boxwood and I've been finding them and eating them or giving them to the chickens there's just so many all right and I got four more blue bushes this way below this one so this one's called till fat Barry I think they tasted really good they don't get real big but they're super flavorful so that's why I got those ones and this one I'll tell you what it's called in a minute because I don't have the tag right right near me but it grows the biggest berries in the world so um they get huge let's see you can't even really tell really how big they are until you kind of put your hand down by it pick that one fell right off in your hand I think they get way bigger than that I mean that's just that's a medium-sized one okay so the big ones are called Chandler blueberry I just think friends so and that's a real real big all kinds of blueberries blueberries everywhere this one is the same kind of the first one I showed you that's barely got anything left on it so we've been picking but there's some in here that are so big I've been letting this one go just to see how big it gets how it looks like something's been eating on it but uh but yeah they're just they're huge plump juicy I have a drip irrigation you can see kind of kind of part of it sticking out there it's all drip irrigated it's all it never goes thirsty again I just fertilize with an organic fertilizer granular when I planted it I've been really fertilized this since probably should have but I just haven't if I do fertilize it again it's gonna be with this stuff here because this is what I've been using for everything else fish fertilizer it's kind of stinky but it gets the job done and I also pair it with a tablespoon of this epson salt and that really seems to make a difference you do your research on epson salt just Google hips and salt for plants and you'd be surprised and what you find out and other than that I do also fertilize with organic bone meal yeah I'll tell you what man this stuff's um works wonders really good stuff trying to find the finding analysis here I know if you see that but it's a six percent nitrogen eight percent phosphate and seven percent calcium so yeah that works really good dumb just about anything so anyway so that's uh that's my blueberry blog I'll be back for another video I'm not sure what I'm going to do next I've already gone already done tomatoes and peppers and uh blueberries so I'm not entirely sure what I'm gonna do next so anyways hope you guys have enjoyed my garden tonight this is how things are growing

today's video we thought really fun to show you guys a full tutorial on how to make a really thick smoothie Bowl so for today's smoothie Bowl we're gonna show you guys how to make our island Bowl it's super hot pink and so pretty if you guys don't have these exact ingredients we're gonna make sure to give you guys some really cool substitutes so you guys can follow along at home and yep let's get right into it okay so a crucial part to making a really thick smoothie little everything has to be frozen it's so important and it totally will make your smoothie a thick smoothie yeah so we got some frozen strawberries here to get us started and then we got some frozen mango and then we also got a frozen pack of Pattaya you can order this online I think we just use Pattaya plus and then last but not least we got our almond milk which we use almost in every smoothie you can use any kind of milk that you want though yes so yeah that's pretty much it guys really simple ingredients and if you guys don't have to tie it at home where you guys can't find it at like your grocery store you guys can totally just do like strawberries and mango and almond milk it's gonna make a really good smoothie and yeah you won't miss the pattaya too much all right so we've been asked so many questions about our blender this is our Vitamix here we've had it for like almost eight years I think honestly the best blender ever but we've got asked a lot of questions about the speed that we use to make our smoothies so thick and we start on one and then we work our way out to like four or five which is like medium speed you don't want to go all the way up because then it's actually make it like a hot smoothie this can make soup so you don't want this - yeah we find it gets way too hot if it is blending way too hard yeah and if you don't do it high enough then you're not gonna be able actually blend and this guy right here is super important this is the way like you can actually blend up your fruit and it like moves it to the blade can still keep going we also find that if you layer your smoothie like if you put the liquid in first and then your frozen fruit and then your strawberries like try and make sure that things aren't gonna be like really frozen at the bottom if you don't have like a really strong blender that should help you guys out and yeah if you guys don't like mango or if you're allergic to mango you can just substitute bananas like frozen bananas you should get like the same type of texture okay so we got a cup of almond milk in here we're not gonna use it all at the start though we're just gonna add a splash and just to have like a base for our smoothie and then we can actually use more of this after once we start blending okay next we're gonna do our mango mango it's like a soft frozen fruit so it's gonna be really easy to blend in the blender and then it won't actually break it okay and then we got our frozen strawberries there we go and both coconut bowls are probably like two cups yeah frozen fruit will have everything written down below for you guys or maybe just link it on the blog and then you can make it your own alright now I just gotta cut the pink pataga in half and we're gonna just put that in here try not to get this on your hands it's very pink it stains for days okay perfect and now we got a full blender we're ready to blend [Music] and we'll be right back to decorate the bowl [Music] [Music] we're ready to be decorated we're gonna put some bananas online just keep it simple today and maybe a little bit honey [Music] [Applause] Aylin bull all right so that is it for today's video thank you guys so much for watching we hope you guys enjoyed watching us make our island bowls and we can't wait to see you guys

"IONtsj3gLFQ": "sold berries yesterday my wife did I sat there for a while and we had people taste the berries for their buyer really a young person like early 20s would not like those sweet berries because they're used to sour anybody else 90% of the people that tasted our berries thought they were better than anything they could buy in a store those berries over there went an average of twenty bricks and to give you an idea typical is 12 to 14 12 to 15 and that's an indication of sugar and it's also an indication of solids which is an indication of minerals so you're saying well how come everything's so green well I'll tell you what is coming from the compost that we put on which is a is a slow-release source of nitrogen and the one that nobody really understands is once you have a healthy plant with a good biological foundation they will get 80% of their nitrogen out of the air for free well take a look at these plants so the healthiest blueberries I think you're going to see and then on top of that I don't have insect problems I don't even come out and look for insects because I know I don't have them and the reason is the cell wall of the leaves are so strong the insects just don't want to have anything to do with it it's about bricks v r IX okay if you take a reading on the SAP juice of my plants the juice will have a Brix greater than 12 anything 12 or under insects will be here and it's all about the biology in the soil solubilizing the mineral and the minerals being in the plant which helps makes the sugars and gets your bricks up to where you're above that threshold of paint now that's a that's really a pretty simple concept a little complicated getting there it's taken us six seven years to get to this point but that's it's interesting isn't it", "ePFLgZeY-uQ": "what we do is what we're calling cultivar finishing or what Government of Canada for in their infinite wisdom is defining as cultivar finishing and we're calling that basically things that we are hoping or expecting to be about a generation or less from potential release that's all our top tier elite crosses and all the testing and yield trials and whatnot that goes with that and then the other half of what would do what we do is sort of split up more towards things that we see potentially being a few more generations down the road and also developing some molecular tools and that sort of thing that to help with the breeding program and then in within each of these categories I'll just add that raspberries is fifty percent of the program blueberries as forty percent and strawberries is about 10 so i'll start with the raspberries the objectives in the raspberries program basically we're looking for high-yielding varieties primarily for the processing industry so they have to be machine harvestable pretty much anything coming out of program has to have some degree of root rot tolerance at this point we'd really like to have resistance to raspberry bush you dwarf virus or perhaps something that's really slow to become infected a fit resistance is a goal and resistance to khane diseases and and like i mentioned about half to half fifty percent or so the crosses raspberry crosses we're doing are geared specifically towards this and the whole process takes about fifteen years if everything goes really really well this is a graphic i put together for something else but i stuck it in here just to sort of illustrate the timelines that it's taken from the time that a cross was made until a variety was released and these are raspberry varieties in the northwest or the last 30 years or so and you can see most of these there's a couple that come in under under 15 years most of them are 15 16 18 so if everything goes smoothly 15 years is a pretty reasonable goal to shoot for it may or may not happen and to give you an idea then how this looks in our in our program you know the 2015 we made crosses we planted seedlings from 2014 we evaluated seedlings and selected seedlings from 2012 and so on down this list and that gives you about an idea of how many planets we have or how many genotypes we have in the ground at each of these stages so we whittle it down and we put in larger plots of fewer plants more plants of fewer varieties as time goes on as we start to NOC list down and take hardware look at stuff this last year in review we planted a new machine harvest trial clearbrook substation we put in about four thousand new raspberry seedlings we did 97 crosses on the raspberries did not have very many seedlings to evaluate this year so we only made 12 new selections and we had four different yield trials that we evaluated we did not do root rot screening in the greenhouse in the spring because we have some issues with our tissue culture but we're doing that some in the greenhouse right now and we also have a big project screening through grafting for our b DV resistance and testing some genetic markers for Russia dwarf virus resistance the 2011 yield trial you know this last year was just a really weird year in a lot of ways and overall fruit size was down and i would say yields and our plots were down about thirty percent so that's really reflective of what we saw across the industry that said this 3 14 12 stood out once again as just being a tremendous yielder the downside is it's late it's about a week later than Meeker and it also does not have root rot collards so it's one of these things that we're going to use as a parent in the program machine harvest beautifully yields really well but it probably does not have much of a future as anything other than a parent I'll also point out seven twenty thirty whoop wrong button this selection down here seven twenty thirty is a selection that looked good pretty good in this trial and I'll have some pictures that in a little bit and then we also had squamish in this trial yield was not great on squamish but then again it was not that much different from saanich or malahat or to amine or Meeker so it was really kind of in the same ballpark as all those which was really terrible in this planting it was much better last year so there's a photo of chemainus machine harvested and then just a quick overview on squamish since it is a relatively new release it's early ripening we expect it to largely replace malahat although it's not quite as early as malahat at our site typically it's about four or five days later I know some people have said that it mal hats a good week or so earlier but i think they also have some malahat that is a little bit stressed from root rot and is pushed even earlier than the normal it has better tolerance to soil-borne diseases than malahat which is the big plus that's I wouldn't say it's anything close to like cascade bounty or something like that but it does hold up better than some things yields look okay it's probably not going to be a spectacular yielder but it looks like the yields are going to be similar to what we see from the other varieties that are being grown and it has large very firm fruit the fruit are firmer than malahat they have a really nice flavor and it has resistance to most of the eighth and bio types that we have in this area just again it was something is originally identified as having fresh potential but we see that it actually machine harvests really quite well and so it's a possibility of something to try for machine pick as well our 2012 machine harvested trial a number of selections that look good in here although that's you know maker this was actually probably one of the best looking plots of maker I've seen at the substation in a long time cascade harvest was near the top of the list for yield again though everything was down this year so the yield was not great I'll point out Rudy which was the top yielder in this field last year is way down towards the bottom of the list there's actually about 70 plots in this field so there's a lot of things that are not on this list Rudy was probably in the bottom quarter for yield this year in this field and WSU 1912 probably in the bottom ten or twenty percent and I'll just I forgot to highlight it here seven twenty thirty looked decent in this field as well here's a photo 7 20 30 we're starting to propagate this one to hopefully get a better look at it it is one quarter rubis niveus which is a species from Asia that has root rot tolerance and the maternal parent on this actually has very good root rot tolerance the pollen part is couch and so it may or may not have inherited root rot tolerance we'll see what happens and it may or may not have inherited bushy dwarf resistance either so it's still early to tell but it yielded fairly well it's slightly earlier than Meeker and it as you can see from the photo if machine harvests quite nicely our blueberry program we did a survey a few years ago to identify objectives in the blueberry program and really what it comes down to is fruit quality and machine harvest ability things that were identified as sort of next on the list would be resistance to cracking and splitting is also kind of in that tier so we have some projects in addition to just the normal program what we're doing to just sort of target some of these things excuse me this is some data from a couple years ago with the selections that we were looking at in cold storage you can see this is blue crop at at harvest here on the left and then one week two weeks three weeks four weeks and five weeks in cold storage there's Duke quite a bit firmer than blue crop draper a little bit firmer yet and here's one of the selections from our program 12 635 we are currently propagating this one for trial as well as some others I think that personally I think that some things that are in the next bush behind us probably look a little bit better in terms of the overall package of the plant but there is enough interest here too to move forward on getting some plants ready and we're hoping to have plants of some of these this and some other selections available for grower trial by next fall can see these are selections the it says 2014 selections actually I think this one down here was a 2015 selection we looked at about 8500 blueberry seedlings this last year a lot of those were in this second look we made 40 selections in that field a year before made another 40 selections in that field this year and looked at some other seedlings for the first time made a few selections in that field I mentioned fruit splitting splitting tolerance is something that we're looking at in the blueberries and it's one of these things that it really if you have a poorly tame poorly timed rain event it can really cause a lot of headaches this was not this last summer but the summer before where we had two inches of rain in two days the end of July and it just left a lot of split fruit on the bushes so we have a student project each summer where we're starting to look at what excuse me at splitting tendency in blueberries and heritability of that to see if it's something that we can select for and excuse me this is last year's data which basically the slope of the regression line here is our heritability of the trait and this is the technique we breeders used called mid parent regression where we're looking at progeny averages compared to what we would expect from what how the parents are and a heritability of point 62 is moderately high that tells me that we can make some decent progress through selection with this the four bottom for least splitting ones all had us 645 as a parent and a to the 11 worst splitters all had blue crop as a parent strawberries we still have some June bears in the program that we're evaluating but we're really making a push to move on day neutrals and gear things over we're evaluating selections that are already in the pipeline from before some selections and material from outside of the program as well as doing a small number of crosses to sort of figure out our our system on these and I think we're making good progress we're starting to do the crosses early in the season in the greenhouse we can get seedlings out in the fall and then evaluate those the following season we do have a selection ten to one that is currently going through virus cleanup it was reviewed very well from some grower trials that we had in Quebec where they were really impressed especially with the fruit quality it's a very very firm berry it's a very sweet berry we expect the fruit the fruit quality based on on our evaluations and what we've been told people like it better than Albion there's a little we think the yield is going to be roughly equivalent to Albion from what we've seen so far the one grower trial we had in bc there was a mixup on the plants and they into a June bearing field so a whole bunch of a few of these plant in the field with a whole bunch of puget reliance we really couldn't tell anything with that so um hopefully we expect to have plants back from virus cleanup around the first of the year and maybe some plants going out to trial next summer here's some photos of selections of the day neutral strawberry seedlings its last season it was just a really really challenging from the standpoint of there was a lot of really good looking things in that ceiling field and to try to whittle it down it it was a tough task that you know when you're when you're going through there somebody's got to do it right um it was actually a lot of fun to look at the strawberry seedlings this year because they all looked so nice a lot of people that we work with and collaborate within the program as well as our support people who write the checks up there at the top and there's my contact info if anybody

click on this link over here and right now all you have to do is two ingredients to make blueberry syrup are you going to need is 1/2 cup of apple juice and then one and a half cups of any sort of berry I'm doing blueberries today for my blueberry okay and then all you got to do is make this boil and then once it boils you will just you know turn it on to like a simmer for five minutes and if you want to look in here actually real quick it doesn't look like a whole lot like it looks like it's just like berries sitting in like a little bit of juice and the juice is going to cook out of the blueberry so don't worry you're doing it right just be patient at all it'll all turn out alright and these are the this is the finished product for the day pancake over to the blueberry pancakes oh yeah with that alright so this has been simmering for five minutes so we're going to take it off the heat and bring it over to here you can use a blender or food processor or whatever you want if you're kind of scared of you know heating up your food processor a lot then you know you can just wait a couple minutes it's not a huge deal but I've done this before it works out just fine so be careful when your Pokemon blueberries around then you just always blend up into those no chunks really really no side - it's pretty basic all right so it doesn't take very long the blueberries they're already pretty malleable but yeah that's pretty much your blueberry syrup right there I'll put onto a measuring cup so you guys can see exactly how much yeah I probably use a bigger measuring cup because uh I probably won't hold it I'm very unprepared so don't be so unprepared when you're making your videos oh God so then you got to just take the blade out you don't want to plop it all over me here ha this it's not hot sauce but it's a hot sauce so you want your hot sauce going everywhere oh yeah so that's that be careful because it is pretty hot you can see the steam rising off yeah it's like it's like a cup and a half of syrups so that's it that's all you have to do it's those two ingredients you just boil it until it simmers let simmer for a couple minutes put it in the food processor and then enjoy it on your blueberry pancakes here we approach this I'm Devon and natural habitat eating a vegan blueberry pancakes well I think she's", "AnIV8GTCiIk": "do you know that

and super easy to make before I get started don't you forget to hit that big guys cabinet down below and give this so the first thing you'll need is some fruit you can use any fruit you like here we use blueberries strawberries and grapes so next you'll need some yogurt Greek yogurt works the best for this recipe next thing you'll need is some honey you also need a ball also have a fork spoon and a measuring cup now get your one spoonful of honey and place it in the bowl next microwave the honey for ten seconds don't add the honey and yogurt if it's hot add your half a cup of Greek yogurt to your melted honey mix well have a baking sheet ready with parchment paper on it now you get your fruit and you place it into yogurt until the yogurt is all around the fruit and then you place it on the pan with the parchment paper repeat until all the fruit is gone you so we found out a toothpick works better to dunk the fruit into the yogurt you freeze for two hours or until it sets what we're

already harvesting blueberries tomorrow they're kicking off the you pick operation we caught the Michael Hill southern tell farms about why a commercial grower will go invite the public on to their operation during the busiest part of the year we feel like we have kind of a niche farm here with the location we're at not just our view it does it looks like rolling hills it doesn't really look like old Florida but it almost looks more like Kansas and we feel that it people would love to come out here and experience that with social media as it is there's a lot of free marketing that can really do better than most old marketing campaigns and its really cost efficient and free to get started it's a lot of burden to have a commercial harvest but as our price drops we feel like we can make we know we can make more money and you pick then when we have people as the blueberry industry grows and as Frey starts to go down and as Georgia starts to come in we can still sell our crop for something other than having to trim it off and let it sit there in the future I'd love to start bringing schools out here and having field trips because I know that kids and students will learn so much from being out here they'll understand where a blueberry comes from that it's not made in the made in a building it's it's grown on a bush and they get to eat it off the bush pick it they get to

north on State Road 39 in Missouri heading for Springfield and I'm heading north to Springfield from Arkansas and I happened on to this blueberry patch you pick it of course I didn't pick it because you know they'd be finding my dead body out in the middle of the field somewhere but I I turned around and then come back in and there's this little blueberry you pick it place and I thought oh and what got me was hold on this little caterpillar out here out of hey Bill heck he rolls and that the kid is saying they got some other cute things here too but let me get the cart turned around and I'll be right back okay you got this this little funny thing hey Frank quit fooling around and has someone sticking out of a center of a hay roll and then you got these three guys they painted it up but my favorite one is the caterpillar and they're cute okay I will be back when I can stop and tell you all about the blueberries and and everything I learned something it was very interesting and I can and I can go into Jenny about it when I get to North Carolina these are the blueberries I got from that you pick it place of course I didn't pick it the I got in there anyway anyway the the the kid that was helping me I asked him I said well do do I have to wash these or can I eat him you know he said there's never been any pesticides used in their fields and you know I saw them just you know pick one eat one you know the owners and stuff but he said he said a lot of people take these home and freeze them and he says the trick is don't wash him off before you freeze them see the white stuff on the outside of the blueberries focus focus focus it's not wanting to focus there it is you see that white film on the blueberries that's a protective coating and if you wash your blueberries they'll stick to each other in the freezer if you leave them alone and let them do these are wet right now because they've been in the bag so the moistures got him so I I really have to dry him out so the last longer but yeah don't don't don't wash them off before you freeze them the protective coating keeps them for it and sticking to each other and I thought oh I've never heard that before so that's kind of cool it's interesting and I've been munching on these babies oh they're so good calm down anyway take it easy take the long way home", "sk41dOjZHNg": "this is a blueberry variety flavor review the first one producing is star and you can kind of see them in the mesh bag if you remove the mesh bag you can get a blueberry out here okay so I'm gonna pick this one right here and I will try it you know it is delicious a star I think is my favorite see if I can get more berries while holding the camera yes they're delicious um they're beautiful big berries and you can see the star like structure and they're early and they're really delicious alright so that is star and I've got it all covered up with little Oregon's uh party bags to protect the blueberries they're real the bags are real easy to get on and off this is a younger kablooie kablooie and I didn't get the bags on quite in time but it's alright there's still one here to try and it's advertised as being the best tasting and it's certainly delicious there's some more here but I actually and here's a larger can blue in here there's some of the fruit you can see it alright and I'll open up this bag it's easier to open the bags with two hands but you can still do it one-handed it's a lot easier than Nets I tell you that I had I used to have big Nets over the berries and then it's really hard for for the person to get the berries - oops plus a chick monk got all tangled up and strangled in it and a bird got caught in it so anyway I don't like big Nets this way with the little organza bags you can also let the birds have some you don't have to cover every single berry but anyway so that was oh here we go there's actually some berries I see the mockingbirds in here all the time [Applause] no anyway it starts producing a lot entry delicious I'm letting the Mockingbird Sam Sam and I'm eating something myself and this is oh this is it kablooie here okay so let's try this sorry I have a little trouble lining up the camera the glare from the Sun is strong and I can't quite see where the camera is anyhow so I'm opening up this bag here you can see a nice ripe berry right there and I'll try it oh yeah okay this is a kablooey a more mature kablooey and one thing about kablooey it's very crispy it's crispier than any blueberry stars a little softer anyway to tighten the bags I just pull the little cords and then it's tight enough to keep the birds out but kablooey this one you're kind of tall and lanky this year I have had them before as very dense bushes last year this tree here had some branches and I think that's what made it lanky so this year otterby pushing this is a sunshine one of my Sunshine's and it's got one little fruit here but it's not really ready to ripen and just wildly anyway this is a larger healthier sunshine and let's see it gets really big bunches of blueberries they're not ripening up yet though so sometimes good not really outstanding as far as flavor

Prague more fresh blueberry farm I can give you a little idea what we're looking for when we pick a nice blueberry that's no no damaged or picked by a bird but it's also firm and it is doesn't have pink colors in it and yellow and green colors like this that's probably not quite ripe it's going to be too sour and we have some over here here's one that's called a greenback and it's it's not ready to pick yet it would have gotten a lot bigger and tastier and bluer so this would be a nice berry here so this is what we're looking for nice big blueberries that hit me rifled up they'll come off the bush a lot easier too if you're picking in it's hard to pull it off tip that typically means the berries really not ready to let go and so part of what we want to do is make sure that we're not wasting our valuable time out it brought more fresh picking berries that aren't quite right and picking all the berries up that are right so that they're not wasted [Music] [Music] really a way to get a lot of fruit for feeding Tampa Bay is to use both hands and you useless your your index finger and your thumb you just pick [Music] thank you everybody for coming out and we look forward to having a great Saturday [Music]", "j4t5mdDuzFE": "all right you guys so I'm out here at the blueberry harvest farm and just getting some super awesome blueberries picking all the dark blues eaten from the

super excited to be out here and pick up some awesome Zubair see these are not ripe yet you", "l7kPStBGtNw": "did you know that among other health benefits blueberries protect against memory loss a 2012 study suggested that eating at least one serving of blueberries a week slowed cognitive decline by several years one possible explanation as to why came from a 2013 study in mice which found that berries might protect the brain by clearing toxic proteins that accumulate there I have even more good news it's fairly easy to start growing your own organic blueberries 6 easy steps to grow blueberries 1 choose a proper place and prep the soil in order to start growing blueberries you need a sunny place with well-drained well work and weed free soil the water is crucial for growing blueberry bushes because they are requiring constant moisture which means you must have water available in any time if the soil is not properly drained or it is only partially drained you will make raised beds if you don't have a garden or you are living in an apartment you can use patio container for growing blueberries when planting the blueberries in a garden you need available area of 2 and a half feet in diameter and a foot deep for each plant dig a hole in the area and remove 1/3 or 1/2 of the soil and apply an even amount of pre-moistened peat moss and mix it well if you got raised beds apply a composite of even amounts of peat moss and rind make sure you are not using cedar or redwood tripe or planting mix for more recommendations and advice as you can visit your local garden center to space the bushes for optimal growth for solid undergrowth the space between the blueberry bushes needs to be 2 to 2.5 feet or 6 feet for individual blueberry bush if you intend to make rows the space between them needs to be 8 to 10 feet 3 planting the blueberry bushes are planting during spring or fall in some parts of the world they can be planted in any time of the year if you bought containerized plants gently pull out the bush from the contains and then rough up the cortical layer of the roots increase plants top topsoil for half an inch harden it well around the root ball and at the end apply some soil up alongside the subjected route at the end make sure you water it well for mulching the best wreaths for the blueberry are sawdust rind mulch grass clippings and acid tripe because of its shallow roots the blueberry has great benefits from Reed's only two to four inches of wreaths are more than enough for preserving moisture disabling weeds from growing and ensuring organic matter this procedure needs to be done every year and make sure you are not using any rind or sawdust from cedar or redwood tree 5 pruning pruning is crucial for blueberry bushes in order to be avoided over fruiting that can lead to small fruits when it begins to grow make sure your bush is strong enough before bearing fruits detach most of the flower blooms when they are appearing if you are pruning the bushes regularly you will have stronger and healthier plant tips on pruning remove the low growths around the bottom of the bush clear any Deadwood cut off short and discolored branches clear 1/3 to 1/2 of the wood of the bush 6 soil fertilization for organic fertilizers you should try blood meal and cottonseed which are proved as very efficient for this goal the manures shouldn't be used because they can harm the bush you", "YfTVM3p3OMY": "hey guys welcome to another episode here on me on my gardener Channel we're actually out in the you pick berry patch and so you had a really good idea that I loved in that she said you know hey why don't we do a series and you pick tips because you pick orchards are something that a lot of people like to go to they're definitely fun for the whole family and it also is really rewarding because you can save a ton of money by picking it yourself because you don't have all of you know the the costs of of labor and and materials and transportation and stuff like that so the first one that we're going to do today is on blueberries now blueberries are a super rewarding one to pick generally the premium for for blueberries is about a dollar fifty to two dollars a pound so by picking them yourself you're gonna see about a dollar fifty to two dollars a pound and that also depends on the location around here that's about that's about what you're gonna save so there are a lot of different types of blueberries here I just grabbed some right off the plant and they grow in clumps and you don't want to just pick any one here see you want to make sure obviously those are unripe those are almost ripe these are almost right but there's some issues as aren't huge deal but you want to make sure the berry is blue all the way through and that means top and bottom oftentimes what happens is people will pick and they just keep loading up their bucket and they will never check the bottoms and what happens is they're they're picking berries based on the top color and not based on them falling off the falling off the plant what you want to do the best way to pick berries is to stick your hand underneath and use your thumb to gently gently touch the berry if it falls off the plant without a whole lot of effort it will it will be ripe if it takes a ton of effort to pull off if it takes a ton of effort to pull off generally it's not ripe or be read on the bottom see like this one here this one had a little issue see a lot of people would pick that because it is blue on the top underside it's actually green so you have to make sure that it really just pulls away just ever so gently from the plant another thing that you want to look for when you're picking berries is that the I'll take Geneva so as you can see we're out here with the whole family it's a ton of fun and I love getting like getting the kid out involved with you knowing where her food comes from so one of the things to hear Geneva tell daddy how he did so one of the things about berry picking is that a lot of times people if you can go the extra mile you can actually pick a whole lot faster one of the big things you'll notice with a lot of yupik farms is that a lot of the top berries has been picked already but a lot of the lower berries are left because people don't like to bend over if you if you actually go the extra mile to squat down you'll notice check this out look at this all these berries here that are in squatting range look at these look how beautiful these are these are huge and ripe and absolutely perfect and look at the size of those and those were all missed because just because it's it's not in the most accessible location another thing that's really cool a really nice tip is get a bucket with a a little bit of balers twine that way you can wrap the the balers twine around the bucket these are just like a little one gallon ice-cream bucket and then you can actually wrap tie that around your waist so you can have unless you have a kid both hands-free so at least this way with a kid you can still pick which is great too and then always always always folks have a dump bucket I cannot stress this enough when you start getting you know half-full or so take it to a bucket that's designated as the dump bucket that holds a lot of berries that way you're not putting all your eggs in one basket if you trip and fall or the rope breaks or you know something were to happen you can dump them they're in the bucket so you're not losing all your berries so one last thing about picking blueberries is you want to make sure that you know on the chance you do it happens to everyone on the chance you do pick a red berry you know if you don't if you don't want a sour treat make sure that you drop them obviously it's not it's not it's not the most respectful thing that's why you try to pick the blue blueberries at their peak ripeness so you don't have to waste any fruit but you're gonna be paying for fruit that not ripen because blueberries are one of the very few fruits that do not ripen on their own once one's picked things like strawberries or things like raspberries and and stuff like that they will actually ripen once picked because they ripen with ethylene gas that's the the gas that's given off through the ripening process blueberries are not the case so blueberries you want to make sure that you pick them at their peak ripeness and that's why they're so expensive in the stores because they have a very very short shelf life so that is all the tips to picking blueberries hopefully you guys enjoyed I'd highly recommend getting out there picking some blueberries finding you pick you pick farm clothes by supporting local eating local and and you know eating as healthy as possible and obviously to grow your own that really helps as well so we don't have plants that are producing yet actually we don't have blueberry plants at all so we'll have to add some to our to our home orchard but anyways hopefully you guys enjoyed hopefully you will enjoy this series coming up soon di are gonna be doing a ton more yupik orchards we already did strawberries kind of missed the boat on the hunt but we already did sweet cherries so or sour cherries so we missed a couple but there's still a whole ton more including raspberries blackberries blueberries being this one peaches apples pears goodness grapes so there's a ton of them and we're gonna do we're gonna hit as many you pics as possible this year to help you guys out so stay tuned for the next ones subscribe if you're not yet already and we'll catch you later see ya bye and one final thing one of the great things about you pick firms is they don't wait you coming in and they don't way you coming out so eat away because it's your lunch", "kBscz0P4tp4": "we love blueberries not only because of the quality is also because the taste and we can mix it with anything so how about a lot of blueberries thank you this is the second year this one is here or third year second you and I have some other ones of course I will show you I planted these ones in the pot from pot to pot this one is later on but has not even anything yet so you have a chance to that's also another one this one is another one these are the ones that you can purchase to feel good as I saw bastard everything in the ground widget up to this one the name but I have the day before there's another one they're single this is another one here earliest use another everyone yeah we will see how that is it I can count you like sugar 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 thirteen [Music] Oh fifteen sixteen seventeen have three ones they're also eighteen nineteen twenty twenty twenty also very sick country yeah but blueberry bush is also full of footpaths this is a dwarf variety it's blueberry is already swollen but Senate blueberry taro what is from the prisoner sir I have some blueberries 12o 13o I think that I did one now because I'm planting now it was in this is the first blueberry that I ever bought was from a nursery for sure it was get trapped among the potato patch and because I could not reach there it was suffering from drought and this part of it died this part is a life and grow back last year again so I'm keeping it to see what food what will do this year already the buds are swollen so there is hope I've just transferred it from the vegetable garden to the orchard the only thing is that have to water from the rain water blueberry with so many food pots on it and some of them many of them actually have fallen yet it is food you see such a thing usually in the pictures well when the blueberries are shown in the natural environment in the North America Canada when the acid soil are abundant here you don't see that much use the second year or third year this is a kiss planted it a half years anyway and what I see here is that because added the mulch this part of the allotment little of wood chip and that blue chip is acidic practically and did a lot of acidity to the soil and the tree they push the blueberry is thriving in this environment the other one is like that also not as much but anyway good amount of food works looking forward for a good food industry [Music] I'm looking forward for a good truck a blueberry this year various window in the blossom to look at that and when there are the petals of the bosom fill they look like that that's the reason American Indians of the first nation of the Oh cold we're calling this relating this to the food that the God in his stars have sent him sent them down at the end bitter with the bottom of it looked like a star and as you can see all of them have this beautiful pattern and this will grow into a proper blueberry fruit this is the variety of the blueberry called blue gold look at the flowers and now the foods that's earliest fruits are I can remember this is May and look at the fruit early others are not swollen as much as this one but look at that and it's not even in the ground yet it's just in this original approach I'm really pleased with that to bluegolds and all of them show a good amount of swearing turning the public food and that's sort of our focus this is a video about a blueberry Pat Fiat Pat suit is the early season as the label says and now today is the 31st of May practically middle spring and look at the berries of the blueberry Patriot they are really getting fast ripened amazing at this time they are near ripe I will show the other examples of the blueberry that I have just for the sake of comparison okay this is the blueberry patio that I showed you just one meter away from it we come to this blueberry is green yet the name of the variety is Chippewa the oldest of from America I think this name it sounds a little to First Nation II American Indian as you call it now look at that that's the mid-season or even probably late season loose looks more probably like a mid season but they're already swollen so compare it with this one she's already getting dark and blue these two will give me a chance of have a continuous crop and that's if you have a space for more than one blueberry go for one early one mid season one late so you will have a continuous cropping is not good to have just one at a glut once and that's it it finished it's better to have a continuous cropping that's what I have done that's the 28th of the June and we have some crop I could easily take that also to the ROM for flower shop but unfortunately yes [Music] don't pick a movie for this variety of the blueberry is called blue Etta and we planted it in the first year in the grounds now the extreme well but I'm thinking next year I will try to make more of this world blueberry in the possible that's the best thing I've seen that really impress Peter are they doing the Mandarin apart I'm the flower show nobody had this nobody had blueberry so we could easily have a winning entry just being the only one can see here a few so I didn't expect that it would be so much this is almost a pundit now we collected right further to be just a few the beauty of it is that you collect what you need for that day and then the next day you will come and see more that's the beauty of blueberry harvest you picked a few the more comes yeah I see you that's one of the earliest blueberry blue eater is 20th of the June 2015 and we have a crop this time the rest for tomorrow can I see that please can I see the harvest that is beautiful I mean do you think that is one poet as you buy from the shop yeah it's a little bit more than opponent no no this is another blueberry I think this one is also no cheap ever the varieties cheaper one as you see do the hot glue it up very early this one is a bit later than that but yet is this another one is here hot grown blueberries as you see this is just in a pot and I were just watering it or you have to beat the amount of the blueberries you know can I just take it oh I see on the other one in the pot there are more blueberries also and these are the ones that always were falling the to the side because they don't have a big pot I didn't have the time or the soil order yeah pot all the time even to repot them so what I just bought them they were kept in the same place that it was in the original but I chose the good ones I didn't go for the bad ones I went for the good healthy ones I didn't try just to buy from one nursery wherever I went for holidays I visited the local nurseries and I try to collect the best the best specimens yeah sue don't do what you do with your blueberries may I just ask like my own yogurt mm-hmm and I eat them with it with a little dash of honey oh and it makes us super nutritious and low calorie breakfast that would be blowing so much yeah nice interesting I'm going to eat one of these things not the best right I think at the soil level I saw through here so I suppose that you are waiting every year for this moment of their time in summer that you can go and harvest your blueberry bushes counts in the old one that we had and the first year of our a lot but one bush is not enough you know you don't get oh there is a cherry here left yeah the good thing is that about blueberries they don't come all at the same time so you can pick the ones that are right and leave the rest eternal right for nature I think that is about 15 pounds of blueberry here good quality fresh let's go see what we have on that corner oh this is our pond by the way I will make a separate video but this is the largest blueberries you may have and these are in the pot these are the ones that you had yet to time to plant but now yesiree you can come I will go out you can go these are the ones we bought some party last year the studio almost as high as us what an athlete but I'm wondering that I should really make this so there will be more acidic or remove them put them in a pot I think you are I never did actually put them in a much what you think about the results there's a lot there I see there there beautiful day in a lot don't you harvesting some more blueberry and I see the sounds are really big it seemed that the more you watered your plan take bigger they become is it true oh and of course the water I see depends it depends on the variety this is called blue gold because of the color it's best just to leave them a little bit longer because they grow like this one oh look at that yeah compared to this model and if you look at the smaller ones and sometimes you have picked them together this one is same color but you leave them a little while longer and yeah they learn else well so don't pick them too soon even when they turn and they need water also they need a lot of water yeah they drink a lot and these ones are actually in the original pot that theory both them I've not changed them yet and yet they are doing really good yeah I don't know it's about too much now I think we are harvesting there one and a half or two months I guess Susan Matt asked you what you are doing now how much they've already harvested Oh they've been on a roll for weeks I just don't know how many how many other artists was about 10 kilos or something we've had such a good season and they're already showing some growth again yeah there's still some little ones this is what's good about failure they're giving you branches I already have flowers and you just get these little bugs we don't grow until the other once the other fruit has been picked then the little buds will grow they sort of Easter bait oh you mean they're coming succession oh yeah and I come in succession there's a few of them as you can see that little bunches and some of these buds will actually Easter day that sees they they sleep in a way well I'm going to eat them fresh you mean oh yeah and doing mixing with anything sometimes I mix them with my yogurt again I love my yogurt fruit fresh yogurt that you make they're so different to the shop it's creamy and it tastes a bit almost like a little bit gritty because you don't tamper with it you don't take anything out I'll put anything in where I shop brought yogurt I mean that's for yoga what the hell's that it's just water colored water yogurt should be full of fat it should be full of Leicester it should be full of cream and have that lovely creamy taste and it should be thick and textured no tell me about how long the blueberry can keep is canceled okay for several weeks in the fridge then brilliant they they are not subset tuple to pests very few times I've never known any please come and destroy them although I'm sure there are some human pests you mean human there go actually better in the pots and you'll find that you'll have your own home easy more easy than what people think actually yeah I'll have a few in the pot and they're really doing well as well as the ones that are in the ground of course I'll Forge them and put around them providing gas edicts environment but in the pot you have more control Thank You Susan this is over 16 2015 it's a cheap ever blueberry a surprise it's giving new pots at the same time having some crop from this season has given new pots saw the buds already have set I didn't see these things I just saw the growth and a photo that city is giving it a new growth but now look at the clusters of the foods and blossoms I mean that is going to fruit brilliant I hope that we'll have some good weather that they can come to fusion it's not just - this side also and that new fruit brilliant lovely nothing this is lovely looking forward some blueberries there yet left there there is a 15 of the October and yet we have Google that's one of the blueberry plants that we bought from the keepers nursery mostly the quality of the fruits the plants will reduce astonishing there's another one what that's another one is pink yet okay not bad can I see how they do oh yeah not bad for 15 of October having a blueberries the autumn colors of them as the weather gets colder they chlorophyll in the leaf stars gradually and what is left is the starch a little bit of the cell goes in just the color to get enzymes also caused this change of color of course some of the blueberries will not turn that quick the autumn colors this one is not done yet cold hardy varieties called vaccinium livery saw the Bluebird is already applause order leaves and almost all their lives and you see the news [Music] you", "EdG9y90xieI": "hi guys today we'll be making strawberries and

of year they're big some of the biggest I've ever seen saying try blueberries awesome blueberry strawberry cup awesome", "MqbIm8AVQAE": "Oh plus good base drop militia base drop keys here I'm your friendly neighborhood Negro and welcome to another episode of good eats in today's episode I'm gonna show you how to make blueberry muffins from scratch let's go ahead and get into it let's do it alright so this recipe that we're doing will make you eight to 10 big muffins or you can do mini muffins if you want to the first thing that we're going to do is we're gonna go ahead and preheat our oven to 400 degrees we're gonna start with our dry ingredients we're gonna go ahead and take our one-and-a-half cups of flour and put it into our mixing bowl the next thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and add the sugar the next step is we're gonna add our salt the next thing is we're gonna go ahead and put in two teaspoons of baking powder not baking soda baking powder that's what's gonna help the the muffins rise for us and so what you're gonna do now that you have all your dry ingredients inside of your mixing bowl we're gonna go ahead and whisk that up very nice and so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and take a measuring cup and we're going to go ahead and do our wet ingredients the first thing we're gonna do is we're going to go ahead and take 1/3 of a cup of oil and put it inside of the measuring cup we're gonna go ahead and put it in one egg after we put in the egg we're gonna go ahead and take our milk and we're gonna go ahead and fill it up until it hits that one cup line that's about a third of a cup of milk or maybe a little bit more but you're gonna fill it up until he hits that one cup line go ahead and put in one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract in and we're gonna go ahead and whisk that up making sure that everything is mixed the way it's supposed to be you want everything to be dissolved and combined very well all right so now that we've done that we're gonna go ahead and take our wet mix and we're going to pour it inside our dry mix inside of our mixing bowl now what we're gonna do here is we're gonna go ahead and take a fork and we're gonna go ahead and combine this together Norton I want you to notice that I'm actually mixing this and not whipping it you don't want to whip it you don't want to over mix it because that's gonna make your muffins be flat and heavy and that's not what we want so take a fork and you want to go ahead and combine your ingredients combine it but don't beat it mix it together until you have it this consistency right here this is about the rice consistency that you want to have it the next thing is you want to go ahead and take your blueberries now I got these right from the supermarket so what I did was I just put them in a strainer and I went ahead and you know wash them clean them just in case and so now we're gonna add our blueberries into our mix and I'm taking a silicone spatula and I'm folding the blueberries in you want to be careful when you're doing this because you want to try not to bust open your blueberries you know what I mean so you want to go ahead and fold it in and then at the same time remember you don't want to over mix your batter so go ahead and take a silicone or rubber spatula and fold in your blueberries that's awesome right there amazing the next thing everybody do is we're gonna go ahead and get our pans together now like I said you can do 8 to 10 big muffins with this I'm gonna do 10 big muffins with mine so let's go ahead and set up the cups I mean you can you could you could spray nonstick spray inside of the cups here or you can actually just put paper you know the paper cups in like I'm doing to make everything a little bit more cleaner whenever we go to take it out and everything so you want to go ahead and put your mix inside of your cups if you want to fill this to the top you know some recipes they call for it like two thirds you fill it up two thirds on ours we're gonna go ahead and fill this up to the top and so once you do that you can see that we've made 10 muffins which look amazing looking at those whole blueberries in today amazing with those cups that's open you see we have a cup open on each tray you want to go ahead and put some water in there one to two tablespoons of water in each one that's gonna help it bake evenly throughout the baking process and so once you have your batter put inside of your muffin cups what you want to do is we want to give this a little crunch on the outside of the muffin I'm gonna take some of this regular granulated sugar and we're gonna go ahead and sprinkle it over our muffin mix very nice now we have everything set up the way we needed to don't think we have to do now is go ahead and put it inside of our oven and let this thing bake we're gonna let it bake for 15 to 20 minutes this is actually gonna go for the for 20 minutes right here and so I'm gonna go ahead and let this go for 20 minutes and then we'll see you as soon as this is finished so let me go ahead and let this go and I'll be right back okay so it's been 20 minutes you know when it's time to take out your muffin by using the toothpick test put a toothpick in the middle of your muffin if it comes out clean or a little bit of crumbs they're ready to go so we're gonna go ahead and take these out we're gonna go ahead and set these up and put them on our cooling tray and voila that's it homemade blueberry muffins we made these from scratch so I hope that this video helped you guys out man thank you guys so much for watching I really appreciate you make sure you look at the other videos it's on the Good Eats playlist thank you so much as always peace", "u3J5__4I9sQ": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make blueberry muffins this muffin has soft and moist almost bread-like texture so to begin pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit which is 190 degrees Celsius and you will need a 12-cup muffin tin and you can either lightly butter the muffin cups or spray them with one of those nonstick sprays or I'm just using paper liners to do that now this is a really easy muffin to make we don't need any electric mixer we're just gonna make it by hand one bowl for the wet ingredients another for the dry and then you mix them together and you're done so we're gonna start with the wet ingredients you will need 1 large egg and then I'm just going to lightly heat that you can just use a wire whisk or you can use a fork and then to that I'm going to add one cup that's 240 milliliters of plain yogurt or you can use a vanilla flavored yogurt you can use the full fat or the reduced fat and you could even use a Greek style if you want and that along with a third of a cup that's 80 milliliters of a flavorless oil that could be a vegetable a corn a canola or even to sell our oil and then lastly one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract try to use a pure it's better flavor than the artificial and then we're just gonna whisk that together now it is the oil and the yogurt which gives these muffins that really soft moist red light texture if you would like a more cake like blueberry muffin I do have a blueberry streusel muffin recipe on the site if that's what you were looking for so that's it for the wet now for the dry ingredients in another large bowl put two cups that's 260 grams of an all-purpose flour or you may know that as a plain flour and to that we're going to sweeten it with a half a cup 100 grams of granulated white sugar and then one in a quarter teaspoons of baking powder a half a teaspoon of baking soda and just a quarter of a teaspoon of salt and then I'm just gonna whisk together with a wire whisk simple enough and then to that I'm going to add you can vary it between depending on how how full of blueberries you want your muffins to be about a cup to a cup and a half so that's about 240 to 360 milliliters and you can use either I'm using the fresh cultivated blueberries or you could use wild blue fresh blueberries or even frozen and make sure when you if you're using fresh blueberries to wash them and then pick through them and then discard any ones that are it's soft and mushy and if you're using frozen don't thaw them just be careful like we're gonna fold the blueberries in right here and just cover them all with the flour mixture if you're using frozen you have to be careful because how much you handle the batter because you don't want the blueberries to turn the whole batter blue I mean it still tastes great but you'll have blue batter so that's that now we're just going to add the wet ingredients now this is a really thick batter because of the yogurt so just if you're thinking it's too thick don't worry about it that's the way it's supposed to and then just gently mix them together it's a lot thicker than if you use milk that's a lot more runny batter than this but that's what's gonna off it's just such a nice bread like texture I really like it now if you blueberries aren't in season you could use raspberries blackberries cranberries and if you'd like a little lemon flavor you could add either some grated lemon the outside right of the outside peel of a lemon or of an orange or you could even add just a little orange or lemon extract good and use nuts I mean this is just a really good basic batter for muffins so you really got a mix of sins you can see it's really thick and also this batter does not rise a lot as muffin bakes so we're going to fill the muffin cups right to the top okay and that looks good okay so now you could use just a spoon mmm because what we're gonna do is really pack that in or I'm going to use you know a large ice cream scoop either way okay a few blueberries here so I'm just gonna stick them into the top of these okay so now that's it now we're going to bake them somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes so what you're looking for is they'll turn it nicely Brown and a toothpick inserted into the center will come out clean okay blueberry muffins are now done you can see they're nicely browned and they didn't get a lot of rise to them so that's the way it's supposed to be so I would let them cool on the wire rack fer you know maybe ten minutes before you serve them now the day they are made the outer crust is kind of crispy but if you cover them and store them overnight you will notice that that does soften but they're still wonderfully moist and flavorful even the next day so until next time I'm Stephanie jour ski of joy baking calm [Music]", "lBcS2tZ1eMQ": "hey everybody I'm dr. microcell and welcome to this installment of ask dr. Mike and in this video we're gonna answer the question what's the difference between regular blueberries and wild blueberries and so here I have some wild blueberries from Maine and I think one of the specific differences about wild versus regular blueberries is where they're harvested so wild blueberries are primarily harvested in areas kind of cold or more barren areas like Maine and also up in Canada and they're much smaller than regular blueberries their antioxidant power is a lot better as well in that they have twice the antioxidants as regular blueberries so you often hear about blueberries being talked about as a superfood so wild blueberries are like a super superfood and you know they're smaller and darker and that darker color is a reflection of their more antioxidant capacity so what we're gonna do is go over to the white board and we're gonna look at a couple of the other differences between regular and wild blueberries and then some pretty interesting research in four different areas you know I'm sure you've heard a lot of things about the beneficial effects of antioxidants in wild blueberries or regular blueberries but we're going to look specifically at some research with wild blueberries and some areas that you may not be familiar with you probably didn't even know that you'd get benefit from eating wild blueberries so let's go over the white board and talk about some of these things alright so here at the white board so let's review a couple of those differences again so we're talking about wild blueberries for about twice the antioxidant content now I think this is is really beneficial from a practical standpoint because let's say you want to reap the full benefits of these antioxidants and blueberries normal blueberries you'd have to say for example have two cups a day but we're looking at twice the antioxidant content we get down to one cup a day so it fits maybe better in a calorie controlled diet you still get that doubled antioxidant capacity but if for a smaller caloric punch you know which we're always trying to get the biggest bang for our caloric buck so we have twice the antioxidant content so they're smaller in size and also their flavor and intensity is a lot greater and if you've ever been out just picking you know wild blueberries going hiking and picking blueberry you'll notice that they are much smaller but they do have that great intense flavor and the dose that I usually do what I try to do every day is about a cup a day of wild blueberries there's just a handful of foods foods like kefir foods like wild blueberries green tea you know a couple different things eggs that I try to make sure that eat every single day and so for me a couple wild blueberries every morning as part of my routine so what is some of the interesting research about wild blueberries so four key areas that I want to touch on today and the first one is heart health so and all these things are really driven by the antioxidants that are found in wild blueberries so in heart health there's a whole you know because of the high any oxidants there are lots of different mechanisms and effects that can happen but what I think the ones that are kind of the most interesting is some studies show a decrease in blood pressure so and they're taking actually it was a blueberry powder that was made from frozen blueberries giving you it and it yielded a decrease in blood pressure so blood pressure being you know called the silent killer is something that we really need to work on controlling most people don't know about it it increases as you get older so this is a great thing but the key and we'll talk about this for all of them and this really has to do with any food or any supplement it's consistency and so you know having these wild blueberries every day it's really the key the other thing there's some animal research showing get decreases in cholesterol and then also in protection against strokes so kind of the damages of strokes what would happen and that's again due to that high antioxidant content so the next one when we look at cardio got a cardio metabolic health so this is really not just heart disease but looking at more diabetes and I like cardio metabolic health is good because it kind of takes diabetes and cardiovascular disease and brings them together which is really kind of the problem that we're now having with more people as kind of the merging of these two conditions but in people with diabetes one or two cups per day it was given again in a powder ain't usually just in research it's just easier from a convenience standpoint given in a freeze-dried powder led to improvements in insulin sensitivity and again this has to do with those high antioxidants so we get improvements in insulin sensitivity decreases in blood pressure potentially improvements in our blood cholesterol profile as well so memory probably blueberries are the most famous for their impacts on brain function again because of that high antioxidant content now this is I thought was one of the more interesting studies that with wild blueberries looking at older individuals who were already cognitively cognitively impaired that daily consumption of wild blueberries actually led to improvements over twelve weeks in their ability to remember things so when they're tested at the beginning of the end of the study they had greater improvements in their memory at the end after the daily consumption of wild blueberries so this shows that even you know if you're older and your cognitions already started to decline that the use of wild blueberries kind of as a daily nutraceutical almost can help maintain memory and maintain brain function so then the last piece and this is one that most people don't realize has to do with your gut or your digestive health so one of the antioxidants of these blueberries are rich with polyphenols and anthocyanins and one of the things that when we think about antioxidants that we never really consider is that they're actually poorly absorbed in our digestive tract right so all the antioxidants are eating aren't getting into your system they don't get digested but despite the fact that they have poor absorption it's not not as all lost here because what happens is those anthocyanins are actually end up being food for the bacteria in our guts and specifically the good bacteria so you can almost think of anthocyanins and these antioxidants and wild blueberries as prebiotics so prebiotics are fibers like inulin right which is often put now in yogurt and protein bars and different things these are undigestible fibers that feed preferentially the good bacteria in our digestive tract to kind of foster their growth and that improves your overall Podesta health and these good bacteria can actually have implications for your immune function and also the release of certain hormones that regulate metabolism and fat loss it's pretty amazing to think that the bacteria in your gut can actually the impact hormones that regulate your metabolism in your body but they can so just like prebiotics like in Ulan preferentially feed those good bacteria these anthocyanins in wild blueberries also feed that good bacteria so even if your body's not digesting just as the natural process it does with any of these antioxidants any anthocyanins from any source that it doesn't digest them all the bacteria in your gut are gonna take advantage of that it's gonna feed those good bacteria and it's still gonna go on to foster better health better digestive health and kind of better overall health so it's a it's a nice from an efficiency standpoint you get what you get from an absorption standpoint but then you also what you don't absorb the bacteria in your gut picks up and then they use it to help you get healthier overall as well so so some really interesting things I think we look at heart health memory gut health and also cardio metabolic health with wild blueberries and so again when you're looking at them it's really it's double the antioxidant content they're smaller in size they're more intense and flavor so if you've been eating regular blueberries you know I think go like I did and you switch to the wild blueberries you get a greater antioxidant punch and there's a lot of really cool science behind it and a lot of great health benefits that you can reap from it so that's gonna wrap it up for this installment of ask dr. Mike looking at what's the difference between conventional blueberries and wild blueberries and what are some of the benefits of wild blueberries so if you have any questions you just post them below this video and make sure you come back for more videos thanks a lot", "VDacBAI9yZk": "[Music] good morning hello people what are we going to do today we're going to harvest the blueberries let's go so

we'll remember these numbers [Music] grab your friends find your enemies and make amends", "IpLrqnVEeZI": "Oh last thing is the the vigor of the plant the size of the bush maybe that kablooey came as just a bear hey slow down man look chill look easy boy down hey slow down enough good god no okay anyway okay blueberry levers we have a special long-promised treat for you today is the day we do the taste test so we're gonna pluck all of our next big O'Neal's those are ready and we were waiting to see if Jubilee came around I don't think this one's quite ready to be in the taste test air Austin taste this it could be the official tester do you think we should let that one sweeten up a little bit more as I kind of tart yeah not quite ready okay normally when they're mixed like this it's it's on its way but this one yeah it's kind of pinkish I don't want to ruin it so we're holding out to see if we had a I wanted to get more than two but our hourly varieties here are gonna be the one'll and [Music] definitely the kablooey if we wait any longer we're gonna lose the kablooey what is this oh that was sharp blue okay this is this is short blue right that's where this branch is coming off of you have to kind of just follow him back okay let me try that on mmm nope still has a bitter pucker to it so we have two of Neal's so Neil's are these nice fat ones Hey are you gonna cheat that's a no Neil yeah we do and then this is kablooey we've been waiting as long as we possibly can for kablooie but pretty soon they can start falling off of here so we're gonna have to pull them out of here and then we're gonna pluck them and we'll probably do it and you know a little bit of fast forward video when we're harvesting it to not be as boring as possible so we're going to harvest okay first victim is O'Neal number one get pickin Austin well don't pick the green ones you leave them on I'm trying not to okay okay what are you doing relax all you okay crouch down some more down there just so you can get an up-close look if you wanted to look at the wheel this is what they look like we tried to leave most of these pinkish light bluish blueberries on and here is the second wheel and this thing's a monster you might have to trade places I think maybe we'll put this one in the corner this one's even bigger but let's let's see the hall all right guys this is our O'Neill blueberries - Paul I'd say that's probably at least a good pound or so yeah yeah okay so let's see what we get out of kablooey recording kablooie is this one right here the one that's all leaning over cuz I got so many blueberries on it now I put both of the O'Neal's on the end spot so I've enough to guess which ones the other one and over here we have blue here's what the table looks like underneath all those big beautiful blueberries over there [Applause] next year we'll cut this and we'll stick it up so it won't be quite so floppy the whole tree looks like that right there that's a good shot lots of blueberries there they look like grapes almost huh okay so I'll pick it and we'll be back you know eating the merchandise you can do that without me right just hold it up okay glad we didn't wait any longer it's getting a little hot but there is our haul for kablooey I think the one kablooey beat the two O'Neal's huh mm-hmm but this one ripened up like two weeks earlier so okay let's take a break I'm gonna move this back then we're gonna eat them okay guys we finally got around to our first blueberry taste test and just so you can see the stars of the show we have O'Neal on the right and there's a dime nickel and quarter can it give you a size perspective Hey no snacking on the blueberries I saw you pick get if I had a ruler I'd slap you with it and then we have the kablooey over here which yeah that completely on average is smaller it's a nice medium uniform berry the O'Neill's got a little bit bigger some of them so anyways yeah this is probably got the biggest of me like you see right here almost size of a quarter and this is about the average size for a kablooey right about here Canada right around a little smaller than the dime size actually okay so that covers the whole size thing he won't let me sleep it's been three days what so why do you target it's like 6:00 in the afternoon three days we picked them this morning you liar please help screwball so we're gonna grade these off of how sweet how tart size juicy or dry how productive the plant firm mushy and then when you harvest them so okay first off as how sweet and how tart which one you want to do first alright grab no meal let's do two so you can kind of balance it out nice and sweet no tart yeah a tart in yours yeah really you might have got one of these red ones here try these too we shouldn't have any tart some of these red guys are a little underdeveloped yeah one has a bit of tart there's still some tart but okay well for me I didn't get a tart so maybe a slightest a little bit of tart okay now let's go for the kablooey here give me three of those you need for even okay oh now these are definitely sweet I think these are sweeter than the O'Neal's what do you think they're sweet but small they're well I like what no no shut okay so the difference between these guys is like when you take a bite out of it O'Neal it's like it's like butter like trying to slice them butter with the butter knife but this it's a lot more firm I guess yeah well we're getting into that part okay well I guess we're well just jump right now we're just working out a sweet and tart but oh I agree these have a little bit of a snap to them a little bit of a crispness a crunch you can feel it I don't like thinking about it first link all these remote you though I'm just clarifying these these have a little bit more of a skin now they kind of snapped oh these are more watery those are more berry who more berry more water in here yeah okay so that kind of takes care of the sweet and the firm and the mushy sweet tart firm mushy size O'Neal definitely won on that one but size isn't really a big deal it's kind of this is quantity over quality this is quality over quantity hmm oh just bigger but we got more of these Kate production now mine now that the funny thing is and you know our blueberry bushes are a little new so this could get kind of weird or maybe one got more sunlight or whatever but we had to O'Neill blueberry bushes and we got that much that's everything now I think a little bit of snacking went on I wanted to weigh these but we had these little fingers that nibbled on a lot of these and that I don't know not me I'm sure who missed a couple of ounces here so we're not going to get into that off camera but we're missing maybe about a third of those because they looked so big and everyone just grab them now the kablooey made that much and this whole tray is full of kablooey so one kablooie bush made about three times as much as two O'Neal's hey you're dropping them all over the couch dude yeah I know they're good I like to pick the blue YZ hmm that's good you know one thing is I don't care which one of these you got they're both about a thousand times better than anything you buy at the supermarket yes definitely okay now that was production firm wishy we're pretty much all done the only thing left here is harvest time so we're in central California and kablooie came in about midway I'm not in each there hey we're almost wrapped up just stay put about mid-may so we let this one stay about a week after so we can let kablooey air I'm sorry let o'neill sort of catch up so kablooie was mid May and O'Neill is late May maybe early June until it goes in and we change clothes but this is the same day it would just picked them Oh last thing is the vigor of the plant the size of the bush maybe that kablooey came as just a bear hey slow down man look chill easy boy down hey slow down enough good god no okay anyways I ordered this is a bare root kablooie with somebody's special proprietary in the house thing I don't even remember but you'll find it but I ordered it as a bell root or bare root stuck it in the ground it caught up and passed the O'Neill's which I bought as live plants so for what it's worth more vigorous and more productive so if you can only do one my vote goes for kablooey what about you probably okay if you have a small limitation I'd say go for kablooey tastes just great really productive as vigorous as all hell but if you want to early varieties these are the earliest ones that came due and hopefully you know we'll get some more that comes on we've got about what 14 plants out there of all different kinds so they're gonna we're gonna keep up on this all the way through the summer so I see you later guys I gotta get these in the refrigerator before much before animal here eat them I'm gonna tickle you to death ah could eat not my blueberries you get all the photos these are my blueberry dig man okay I'll better get a few of these O'Neil's you makes me just finish them off no I like the the blue is better", "BWIK6ywld_w": "hi everyone the solo here from learn to grow today we are picking blueberries on our local blueberry forum its Mountain View Berry Farm and this is the same place I used to pick berries as a child and also where I would pick berries to earn money for school closer in the summer time so it's a great experience out here it's fun to be with the kids and other people and also a great lesson to teacher children and have given the experience to harvest their own hurts so and also supporting our local parks so we were paid five dollars per flat of berries who picked and I was really slow at it my sister actually would pick ten flaps per day yeah she was like a picking machine not me but you know what it was really fun to be with friends and family and it was a great experience and this tradition has carried on when my children so we hope we come here a few times per summer to pick our own berries and were prism and the last three spraying here's a view from afar of the blueberry farm there's a whole bunch more back there it's not two rows turkey they have some chickens and future keys in there I thought that white chicken was an egg it was little so when you're picking the berries you just kind of loosely you know pick the ones that are right and you just let them roll in your hands obviously you're not gonna pick the green ones oops so it's kind of like this that's how we were taught when we used to pick berries one more younger one they used to pay us mm-hmm so just loosely let them roll with your on your fingers in onto your hands mommy you see what you have so far good Ciao Bella keep it going you know yours oh yeah we're getting there oh my goodness look at all these areas hi I know I see just like that Laurie land call those I see you hi bud mm-hmm look at all these berries my head yeah I think I found the jackpot look up these check these out I'm going to be picking off this bush for a while so remember blueberries are one of the healthiest and repre has very high antioxidants than any other berry because of its dark color and I think you're cousins of bilberries so they're excellent fruit to eat and it's like we put them in our smoothies every time I make our smoothie news Bailey will combine it with strawberries so we got about nine pounds of fresh picked blueberries now we're going to make some blueberry muffins blueberry pancakes blueberry jam I'm not sure I don't know Bohol see thanks for watching guys I hope that you guys enjoy the show have a great day bye bye you", "rzivf23jtcU": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "feOUX--SBqs": "so here it is blueberries all wrapped up and we've got this deer fencing basically nylon netting on top of this cage and that'll keep these blueberries I'm getting eaten by birds instead of by me", "Gn94azOP1jM": "three-two-one hey there welcome back to another episode of this guy's thought so like I always appreciate swinging by and watching another beer review tonight's episode we got one out of a collective art Brewing Company this year is there a sour it is coming in at 5.1 percent alcohol by volume I don't know what the IBU is if I can find one I will have it down in the description below they're calling this an L brewed with cherry blackberry lemon vanilla and lactose right there on the can and it says collective art says this is imported by collective arts out of Stowe Vermont product of Canada collective arts brewing Hamilton Ontario Canada again it's 5.1 percent alcohol by volume and collective arts brewing.com if you're interested in their website as far as the artwork on this I'm gonna give this about three and a half out of five I like the bright color on there the bold is sour there it's definitely it catches your eye on the shelf so we'll go ahead crack this open and see what it's all about what I'm expecting from this I'm expecting probably a sweetness hoping for like with the vanilla and the lactose maybe like a creamy sweetness on this thing so crack this open see what it has to offer oh I was not expecting that although I guess I should have been that's a nice cherry looking color on that go ahead and put a little bit of that they're decent carbonation in it pink had just I mean literally that's uh that's almost a pink strawberry berry looking head-on that about a finger and a half right there color wise just a cherry juice just a dark berry looking juice almost like a cherry juice type of color borderline like a grapefruit like a sorry like a like a grape-juice almost so actually it looks like the head is actually faded a bit in color as well so about down to a about a finger left on this go ahead get our nose on this oh yeah I smell sour for sure definitely puts off a sour aroma in the air there is a hint of lemon and a lot of berry like a dark berry aroma coming off this perhaps a combination of the blackberry the cherry of the - I believe the blackberry is actually a little bit more evident in the aroma than the cherry is not really smelling any vanilla in there so let's hope that it's in the taste here so that's pretty much what the aroma has to offer you see that appearance there looks fantastic let's go ahead and get a drink on this first off very tart very very sour sour tardiness to it almost a blackberry juiciness to it not as not near sweet as I thought it was gonna be but this is good I mean man this is this is damn good this is something I could drink you know drink it straight down really well I'm more than impressed with this I wasn't expecting it to be quite as sour as it was with the vanilla and the lactose in it but honestly again nowhere near as sweet as I thought it was gonna be there is a a mild lemon background taste to this like a secondary taste to it but mostly again India Rome I picked up a little bit more the BlackBerry than the cherry I do get a lot of the BlackBerry almost like I said like a blackberry juice with the cherry tartness to it nice and sour mouthful I'm gonna say about a medium bodied mouthful but it does maybe a fuller side of a medium body at five point one the mouth bill feels a little bit more than that it's only five point one so obviously I'm not picking up any traces of alcohol in this the sourness and the dark fruitiness would would drown that out anyway not a lot of vanilla maybe on the tell in the tail end of the tongue there's a little bit of Louisville vanilla to it outside to that this is great a great beer as far as scoring it honestly I think I'm gonna score this four and a half out of five this is really good much much better than I was anticipating excuse me I wasn't expecting it to be as sour with the vanilla the lactose I thought that might knock the sourness out but honestly don't pick up a ton of vanilla it's nowhere near as sweet as I thought it was gonna be so definitely recommend this you've had this before let me know you think about it like subscribe comment check me out on social media that's my thought [Music]", "XFldL0c_imU": "hi guys welcome back I'm Elizabeth cranky and

only ready for tomorrow Sabo nine but that they the organic is more sweeter than their but there's a not really deep reply this farm is like popular that's the fun that I like to have fruits like up especially up again I do the apple tree and the other the rules do you like bronzer No they were going home yeah but nobody I'll see them with a cartoon I think it's someone buy it but see I see

pickle calculator god bless bye", "Pb_Ky37JbME": "We all know we should eat healthy food, and\nwe\u2019d eat a lot more of it if it didn\u2019t often taste like the front lawn. Instead of eating our veggies we scarf down\nthe good tasting bad stuff, but junk food junkies are about to become history. Soon, even Brussels sprouts could taste like\ncream puffs. This may look like your typical swanky midtown\nManhattan party but it\u2019s a little different, this is a taste tripping party, and these\nfood gatherings are popping up all over the country. The theory is that this West African berry,\nknown as a miracle fruit, changes anything that tastes sour sweet for the next hour. Sounds a little trippy, I\u2019m going to give\nit a shot, here we go. With this one little berry, red wine goes\ndown like juice. Oh my god, this is dangerous. Cheers. Cheers. The sweet, sweet wine. Meat will turn sweet. It\u2019s cool, it\u2019s like candy. Grapefruit is sour-free. And blue cheese on bread tastes like jam on\ntoast. They call me the miracle fruit man. Curtis Mozie has an orchard of 40,000 miracle\nfruit trees in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He\u2019s hoping we\u2019re all going to fall in\nlove with this little red berry. The miracle fruit originates from Africa,\nnormally it\u2019s found in Ghana and Nigeria. Some of the Africans use it for acute coughs,\nmalaria, also some of the women use the miracle fruit when they are breastfeeding. They would take some of the fruit and rub\nit on their nipples. When infants are sucking milk, they will drink\nmore milk. It was introduced to the United States in\n1952. The first time I tried the miracle fruit,\nthe seed was implanted in my head to make sure everyone in the world was exposed to\nthe miracle fruit. Well the proper way to eat a miracle fruit\nis to put one in your mouth, remove everything off the seed using your teeth and tongue and\nswirl it around in your mouth for about approximately 60 seconds and discard the pith. The lemon tastes like lemonade. That was delicious. To learn how this miracle fruit brings a fantastic\nflavor to everything, we head to the University of Florida in Gainesville, where a team of\nculinary crusaders takes its taste buds on safari. It continues to get sweeter and that\u2019s when\nyou know that you\u2019ve gotten the full effect. The savory secret is the berry\u2019s active\ningredient, a protein called miraculin. You got the miraculin protein and it\u2019s got\nsugar molecules up on it. Now, here\u2019s the sweet receptor over here\nand the sweet receptor is just out of reach, so you change the confirmation of the sweet\nreceptor and they hit, and then essentially the same sugar molecules pop on and off and\non and off and on and off, so you get a tremendous amount of sweet taste generated with a small\nnumber of molecule. As a senior professor of dentistry at UF,\nDoctor Linda Bartoshuk has a professional interest in convincing people to put the right\nstuff in their mouths. Do you mind having your tongue painted blue? Not at all. We know that the love of sweet is hardwired. You\u2019re not going to change that. And this is what makes miracle fruit so interesting,\nbecause it\u2019s a way to manipulate sweet. The human tongue has about 3,000 taste buds\nwhich recognize five taste sensations - sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and something called\numami. As best we can tell, miraculin makes the taste\nbuds that normally react to sugars also respond to acids, which are usually associated with\nsour. The result, lemons taste like bonbons, off-putting\nflavors become seductively sweet. If you put this in your mouth and the slightly\nsour taste of the fruit will turn deliciously sweet. Miracle fruit adds an intense sweet taste\nwhenever there\u2019s acid in your mouth. And this works on anything you eat, squash\nand string beans become as sinfully good as a sugary snack. We\u2019re just absolutely amazed that this berry\ncould have such properties, basically coats the tongue and fools it into thinking that\nsour things are sweet. Doctor David Clark, a horticulture biologist,\nknows that more people will pleasure their palates with healthy helpings if he can get\nmiraculin out of these berries and into our veggies. Since we know how to genetically engineer\na vast number of crops such as tomato and strawberry, we have the ability to introduce\nthis gene into those plants and make them taste sweeter. If it works, a stalk of broccoli could taste\nlike ice cream and eating your greens will be a tempting treat. To guide miraculin\u2019s properties into the\nstructure of food, Doctor Kevin Folta uses a molecular escort, a GFP, or green florescent\nprotein gene, the same stuff that makes jellyfish glow. So, each one of these green spots represents\na cell that has the miraculin gene along with this GFP gene. This way we know it worked. No, your dinner won\u2019t glow. The GFP gene is just a tag to show researchers\nthat they\u2019ve succeeded in installing the miraculin additive. These strawberry seeds now have miraculin\ngenes in their DNA. It\u2019s a laboratory line of strawberry that\u2019s\nrelated to a wild strawberry that produces a yellow fruit, so we don\u2019t get the traditional\nlarge red fruits. The strategy of a yellow strawberry is to\nmake it distinct from its traditional red relatives. You would recognize this as either the power\nberry or the flavor berry or some other kind of designation that we come up with where\nyou\u2019d eat this first, and then you could enjoy the rest of the strawberry that would\neven be sweeter than they normally are. Soon we\u2019ll just pop a power berry and the\nnext thing we want will be a sweet treat. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could pick the\nfoods we don\u2019t want kids to eat and make them disliked, take the foods we want them\nto eat and make them liked? If a side of lima beans tastes as yummy as\njelly beans kids at last will clean their plates. Now, let\u2019s try miraculin on something with\na bit more bite. I\u2019m about to drink Tabasco. That\u2019s crazy! But I got miracle fruit, let\u2019s see what\nit does. That\u2019s great.", "reayoUtJ0jU": "what's going on growers is James prigioni coming to you live from Jersey in my hands now I have more than 12 different kinds of berries today I want to take you through show you them how they grow what they taste like but before I do I want to try all of them at once for most growers this many berries is a true treat I'm gonna taste them all at once but I will go through and tell you how the individual ones taste themselves let's get crazy oh my gosh so many flavors so juicy it's like a shake wow I got to do that again that was amazing let me take you through and show them all though let's go because we're talking berries there's no greater spot for us to start then in the food forest that specializes in berry production let me bring it over to the table you're the boys and berries first let's begin with this table at a berry is actually a cross between a red raspberry and a blackberry it grows similar to the way a blackberry would well a trailing blackberry remember we've got three cards we've got the erect semi-erect and trailing four blackberries this one grows like the trailing it's pretty obvious why they call it trailing because this one likes to trail along the ground a better way to do this would be to cellist it up along a fence but I did this for a reason and the reason is for propagation when it comes to a berries you don't really grow them from seed when it comes to growing these Tabor e's like I said they don't grow well from seed so we'll propagate them you could either cut them and clone them stick them in the ground or you could just allow them to route themselves so I push these into the ground as they were growing and trailing along now we have different plants that I've rooted into the ground now we have multiple tables so this way I can just transplant to different locations or give them away to friends let's go in and try a couple right here we've got the tape berry bush this is one way you can see it's got that a lot of that red raspberry Crossin to it that's not just ripe yet a little tough to pull off when it's ripe that shook ripe it should come off pretty easily like this one I'll show you this one's a lot more ripe come off relatively easy and just like a blackberry you'll have that piece left over and look at that nice fresh tape airy and look at the size of them too pretty good size but again you can see the red in it it's not as dark as a blackberry would be let's taste it a little more tart I think than a blackberry really good flavor though not big seeds in it which is nice next up as a neighbor to the Tabor we have a boysenberry a boysenberry is similar to a table but still different it's a cross between a raspberry and a blackberry but it also I've read has some parentage with the Dubarry and the Logan berry the growth habits of a boysenberry are very similar to that of at a berry it trails along the ground and it will route if you don't pick it up so you can see this is trailing along but the ideal way to do this is have a nice fence up trellis up along it and weave it in the fence I've got that going on in the back with a marionberry let me show you that next before we move over to some of the other berries let's try one of these boys and berries for these I don't suggest wearing white clothing because you could really make a mess of your clothes with this let's taste it though boy what is it look juicy Wow I think a little I don't know maybe a little more tart than the previous one might not have been perfectly right but the flavor out of bounds next up we've got the Marion berry right now I'm in the chicken coop most people wouldn't grow here but you could see we've got plenty of berries growing along the fence line what I did was just take some fence bend it down to a hoop shape to keep it safe from the chickens let me take it over to this Marion Barry right here though and show you how it's very similar like the Tay and the boysenberry it's the same growth pattern where it's trailing alone on the ground but what we did is tell us it up in the fence you can see this keeps it up this gives it good air flow more light and it also keeps it from spreading in locations we don't want when it comes to planting things I often tell you guys not to buy things from the big-box store and to get bare root when it comes to raspberries and some other kinds of berries as well I don't really mind as long as they're cheap because they spread so easily let's get in there and try one you can see we've got a Marion berry here I don't think it's perfectly ripe but I'm sure it'll still be good I couldn't wait any longer I've got to taste it it'll be fun to see what color my finger is by the end of this video a little tart pie not perfectly right sweet though at the end really good to be honest with you I don't taste a huge difference between those three berries but let's move over to some other kinds of berries in the ribosomal II I previously just said family ribose but what I meant is genius Ryba stand we have a bunch of different plants in there fruiting delicious ones let me take you over to a gooseberry which is in that family a Reddy Hanamaki red one if you've grown gooseberries one of the first things you'll know is that they're super spiky they're delicious too but they do have a lot of thorns on them let me bring you in close show you just how spiky they are you can see along this we've got a lot of fruit and those thorns there so when you come out in harvest these you want to make sure you're wearing some gloves because they'll poke you quick kind of like the black cap raspberries behind it let's take one of these and taste them though we've got a lot ready gooseberries are packed with flavor and they're one of those things you won't really find in the store because they don't ship or store well amazing flavor I I don't know really what I can compare it with a little tart in the beginning very distinct though nothing like I've ever had what we want to do is if we have any laterals that are going off to the side like this we want to cut these off so it doesn't get too bushy and keeps those strong upright ones that's where all your fruits gonna be sometimes we can shorten these to strengthen them and look how loaded this is here so we'll grab another gooseberry you can see in the center there's a spider's web that's keeping everything safe in there for us there's also some dead branches here which I should cut out but I don't really want to mess with the spider's web I'll cut them out later over here I have another gooseberry plant and this one's gonna actually fruit later in the season I encourage you guys if you're gonna go gooseberries or any fruit get ones that have different seasons they've proven this way you can have a nice extended harvest and when it comes to propagating these you don't really want to grow from seed it's best off to take one berry one of the long arms into the ground next season will route up and you'll have new gooseberry plans I've done that in some sections but if you don't want that happen cut off some of that new growth keep it short compact and strong and also thin out the center so you can get light on that fruit oK we've talked gooseberries I would say in a berry rating of flavor 1 to 10 I would give these about seven they're distinct they're tasty a little bit tart and like nothing you've ever had next up though let's move to a different plant or a different fruit in that genus tribus the currants next up we've got black currants one of the main differences and distinctions from the gooseberry in this it's got no thorns which is great for harvesting these berries are known for being used in medicine their dark dark block when they're ripe and they've got kind of spiciness to them let me take you inside and try one these are just starting to ripen up as the season is coming and they get very black when they're super ripe like I said a little spiciness to them let's taste one like I mentioned black currants are often used in cooking but you can still eat them fresh too and I really enjoy them like that that spiciness tough to describe not overpowering a little sweetness on the berry scale flavor-wise I'd say about a six when it comes to black currants it'll primarily fruit on one-year-old wood so it's good to take out some of the old growth you can see the berries though they do look similar to a gooseberry seeing that they're in the same genus when it comes to planting a black currant and other currants it suggested that you cut this down pretty heavily and prune it when you first put it in so we can focus on growing its roots let me bring over to a white currant right here these are some of the most beautiful looking fruit in my opinion on any berry these white currants here are actually just the same as a red currant they're to have just different colors they're productive and a plane like this is a great one for edible landscaping just because if it's pure beauty and it fruits a lot let me bring you in and try some of these I like to pull a whole cluster when I do get them so let me harvest a cluster they almost remind me of grapes when you eat them you don't want to eat just one you want to eat a couple you can see by looking right through there's a good amount of seeds let me taste them much different than the black currant seed here but sweeter on the berry meter I'm gonna have to keep it as a six tied a little better flavor than the black currant but the seediness the texture just isn't as good when it comes to growing these white currants it's similar to the black one of the things they don't like is very heavy thick clay soil you got to have decent drainage for these and good to come back when you first plant - what if we combined the currants with the gooseberries and what would we get that's a joste berry let me bring you over to one right here we've got a joste berry which like I said is a cross it's got the American gooseberry in it the European gooseberry and also the current so this one it's kind of like the best of both worlds with the gooseberry and the current it's big you can see it's healthy it doesn't have those spikes on it like the gooseberry does but it's got that flavor at this thickness and not big seeds kind of like a black currant let me take you in taste one right here we've got a ripe joste berry I'm excited for this I've never had them because these plants aren't as spiky as the gooseberries but if they have that flavor the distinct gooseberry flavor I'd love that looking at it it looks more like a gooseberry than a black currant to me but let's try it so let's taste this joste berry and see if although all the fuss is about I can taste the gooseberry not really much of a spiciness from the blackcurrant very good flavor though I'll give this one an eight and a half out of ten before we move over to some different kind of berries I wanted to tell you something that's very important when it comes to this genus tribus the currants the gooseberries the joste berries they actually were illegal in a lot of Northeast States because they were causing some disease and a few of the pine trees and they may still be illegal in your state so make sure you call your local Extension agency they'll let you know if you can grow them or not before we move to a different kind of berry I want to show you these currents here they're pink like the white currants though they're just part of the red currant family the flavor is different though and the color look how striking that is I call that an edible landscape growth pattern is basically the same as a white currant the flavor I say a little sweeter than the white not as a distinct flavor to me but sweet in the beginning pretty big seeds I'd say they're seven out of ten I like them more than the white curve next up we're gonna go to our standard raspberry these ones are fall bearing or everbearing depends how you prune them this was pruned to be everbearing so we've got this early fruit and let's try one when it comes to raspberries they're not tough to grow you want to make sure you have a good thick mulch down one of the most important things is the correct pruning method that can make the difference in your harvest when it comes to raspberries I've got some videos on that so check them out if you're interested let's taste it and see how it matches up on the berry scale to some of the others amazing nothing like you'd ever take someone in the store then one of the stores are bland they don't have that distinctive raspberry flavor nine and a half out of ten it's almost top how are at the top it next up we've got another everbearing raspberry but these are the yellow ones like I mentioned before you could have one fall crop or two every bearing ones one in the spring like I'm getting here now and another in the fall I usually just go for the fall crop because it's bigger let me take you inside and try some of the yellows this is a white or gold or yellow raspberry this one in particular the variety is called the yellow and let's pick it and taste it you can see much different color than the red one the color almost reminds me of that white currant so soft not many seeds extremely sweet I would say 9.7 I like these even more than the red raspberries next up I'll bring into a berry I know you've seen before because I showed it it's one of my favorites all-time the black cap raspberries and if you're enjoying this video you're finding value in it getting something out of it or just pure entertainment hit the like button hit the subscribe button and bring that notification bell it truly helps out our channel if you're enjoying what we're doing you want to help us that's the way you could do it probably heard behind me tuck going crazy with the chickens sometimes he has a little too much fun but that's just what we do let me bring you to the Black Caps right here we've got the Black Caps as you can see by how much space I'm giving them they're one of my favorites because they're so productive so good just look at this one little section you've got about six the way they fruit I love it the flavor off the charts let me harvest a few of them and show you just how good they taste I'll just pick a few of these and we'll get to taste them this one you can see it's a little past ripe but you want to make sure they're black these are black cap not purple cap so let's taste one very sweet hand to tartness at the end a little CD but overall the flavor is my favorite flavor-wise I'd say like a 9.8 because it has these amount of seats I'm gonna bring it back down to like a nine and the berry scale but because of its overall harvest size it's one you just have to have in the garden when it comes to pruning these black cap raspberries I've talked about it before to make it simple for you take these one year old grouse-shooting up cut them two to four feet encourage that lateral growth that'll give you a fruit sex like I have under here we've got a blueberry because we're in Jersey you have to grow blueberries that's what's next this isn't your typical blueberry though look at the color that one's ripe you may be able to tell by the hint of color but these are the pink lemonade blueberries different than your typical ones the flavor it's different too let's taste it when it comes to blueberries one thing you want to make sure you do is keep them heavily watered because they have a lot of surface roots in New Jersey they grow native so we grow a lot of blueberries here if you can find a fruit that's native to you and you can grow with domesticated do it because it'll probably do well let's taste them though Wow a lot different than your typical blueberry a little tartness the beginning a great flavor I don't know how to tell the difference I get that lemon a tea I don't know if it's just because of the name but I can taste it in there and again that distinct blueberry flavor at the end I got to say ten out of ten blueberries are one of my favorite and a different version of it I can't beat it we're not just going pink lemonade blueberries we've got all different varieties especially the ones with the large berries like the Chandler and the Duke in front of me here is a Chandler blueberry absolutely loaded look at it so much fruit they're not all perfectly ripe but some are and they're huge let's try one I feel like this fruit set is getting so tight that it's hard for it to get bigger they'll get bigger than this but I'm too excited I got to eat this one as you can see this thing is a good size I like the big berries because it actually gives me a nice mouthful I don't have to eat like five of them to get some substance Wow sweet distinct berry flavor going the stores you'll never get that this thing blueberry flavor that you get at the end you only get a little bit of sweetness but it's like an empty sweetness to me that you can't copy that blueberry flavor great taste get a big one get a blueberry in and you can be eating them real soon just think about it you don't have to have a whole food forest you could just have a few blueberry plants in the front yard edible landscape nicely there are some currants and some in there some different raspberries berries can be your best friends because they're reliable they're delicious they're easy to grow that's today's video growers thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed it as we took you along
