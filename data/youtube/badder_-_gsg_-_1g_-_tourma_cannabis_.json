{"n7cP6YWO_nc": "Hey guys, Nick with Precision here and\ntoday I'm gonna teach you a brief overview on how to make every extract\nunder the sun. So what I want to start off talking about is live resin and why\nlive resin is so relevant in the market and why you guys hear this this term\nbeing thrown around rather commonly. So live resin, the entire process really,\ntakes into account harvesting the plant while it's still technically \"alive\". So\nyou're harvesting the plant, you're not drying the plant, and what you're\nactually doing is taking those flowers and putting them into a vacuum type food\nsaver device and freezing them right away. So you can imagine like harvesting\nfresh blueberries or strawberries obviously you want to pick at the peak\nof ripeness, so that you have the maximum amount of terpenes, the maximum amount of smell, flavor and all the positive attributes of that plant. And you're\nactually freezing that in time by putting it into a freezer once you put\nit into the vacuum bag. Now it's very common for some people to deep freeze\nthat could be all the way down to -40C or -80C. I would say most commonly\nit's somewhere between -10C and -40C, so once we have this\nmaterial harvested and we have it frozen in vacuum bags - ultimately what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to extract it and we're going to extract it with\nhydrocarbons. The reason that we use hydrocarbons is because it's a very\ngentle process. The process of using hydrocarbons will actually take those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes out without disturbing a lot of the other\nplant-based matrices that are in there, and our result ultimately is a extract\nthat is very, very close to the native plant. So when you smell the extract of\nthe plant that we've extracted via a live resin process what will happen is\nyou'll actually smell the original orientation of that plant, it you'll have\nthose original flavors and they'll be extremely robust, extremely profound in\nthe way that you're actually smelling and almost tasting it when you consume\nthe product. Now the best analogy is if we keep that\nfreshness preserved we eliminate the oxidation, the degradation, and all the\nthings that can kind of take that \"fresh fruit\" so to speak or that \"fresh cannabis\"\nand turn it into rotten cannabis so to speak or rotten fruit. And that's\noxidation, that's degradation from the environment that could be disruption or\ndegradation from high temperature solvents. So with live resin were always\nfocused on preserving that natural state of the plant. We're focused on freezing\nthat biomass right away, and we're focused on ultimately extracting it at\nvery cold temperatures to retain our terpenes, to extract the cannabinoids in\na very gentle fashion, and ultimately to have a highly, highly desired end product\nthat's artisanal and a vast majority of consumers enjoy in terms of theirs their\nsatisfaction of consumption as well as their ability to just actually taste and\nsmell the product once it's been on the shelf for a while. So that's just an\noverview on live resin and the next thing I'd really like to talk about and\ngive you guys an overview on is shatter. So you may have seen shatter in the\nretail dispensaries and things like that and ultimately with shatter we're trying\nto get that end product from a sort of a plant-based entrapment of those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes to a glass-like finish. So it's very common at\nroom temperature for shatter you hit it and it'll shatter almost like a piece of\nglass. To get that consistency there's certain aspects of extraction, certain\nthings that you want to deal with. Shatter first and foremost is always\nmade with hydrocarbon, and the preparation of the biomass is almost\nalways under every circumstance dried very, very, very, very well almost to a\nfive percent or lower humidity. We want to avoid a lot of that water that would\nbe pulled out with the solvent, and we ultimately want to extract that product\nat a cold temperature in order to avoid a lot of the lipids and fat profiles\nthat you might create by extracting with a warmer temperature solvent. Hydrocarbon is obviously ideal for this because not only can we extract with hydrocarbon\ncold but it's hydrophobic so that the water is going to be separated very\neasily from the hydrocarbon, but in addition to that it's going to extract\nthat cannabinoid profile and it'll extract those terpenes with leaving\nbehind,  because of the cold temperature, a lot of those fats, waxes, and other\nadulterants that we don't want in our end product. So when making shatter are\nultimately extracting the dry biomass with the cold solvent we're going to\ntake that to a finishing process which is called vacuum oven purging. So once we\nhave our shatter and we want to vacuum oven purge it, what we do is we we spread\nthis out on vacuum oven trays and we go into a very low vacuum, very deep vacuum\nwith a mild temperature increase from atmospheric. So a temperature increase\ndepending on methodologies it ranges vary widely depending an operator but it\ncould be anywhere from 75 Fahrenheit to will say 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be\na common operational range, and we're always trying to get to a very deep\nvacuum we're talking about 28-29 inches of mercury - very, very deep in terms of\nbeing able to purge out those residual solvents. So not only do we have a\nsolvent free product but purging out the residual solvents and the terpenes is\nalso going to take away some of that some of that added viscosity and\nreally get that product to the point where it's like a glass-like consistency.\nAnd we commonly call those as they're coming out of the oven \"slabs\", sometimes\nthey look like Swiss cheese, sometimes they'll they'll be you know a perfect\nslab of glass, sometimes they'll flip over. And it can vary between a\ncomplete glass-like type consistency and it can also vary to you know sort of\nlike Jolly Rancher or warm Jolly Rancher type consistency - but the good part about\nthis process is to make shatter using hydrocarbon you can generally\nstill make a very good end product on biomass that's been properly dried\nproperly preserved even though it does have maybe a little bit of degradation\nit does have a little bit of oxidation of the cannabinoids and loss of the\nterpenes it's okay because you can still make a very very credible saleable\nproduct that's widely consumed in the form of shatter. And optimizing that\nprocess as a way that you can create a lot of revenue for your\nextraction company. So the next thing that I'd like to talk about is diamonds.\nTerp sauce. There's all sorts of crazy names, \"the sauce\" -  that they coined for\nthis type of extract and really what we're after on this type of extract is\nterpene preservation. So it starts off very much like a live resin\nprocess in the fact that we're harvesting these these buds or these\nflowers in a live state, we're freezing them, and we're ultimately preserving\nthose terpenes. Because terpenes are very volatile compounds in general. Too much\nheat they evaporate and they get degraded by heat, they get degraded by processes, they\nget degraded by solvent - so we want to use a very light solvent, like a light\nhydrocarbon, and in this case mostly moving towards a propane dominant blend. Propane has a much lower boiling point which means it's much more volatile in\nterms of removing it from the end product - easier to remove from the end\nproduct is another way to word that. So ultimately extracting this\nlive resin like prepared biomass with a propane dominant or a lighter\nhydrocarbon dominant blend at low temperatures and ultimately what we end\nup with is we end up with this extract that really becomes a sort of miscella of the cannabinoids but also a very amount high amount of terpene\ncontent. And as I stated before the terpenes are quite volatile and any sort\nof heat, any sort of degradation, even just being an atmosphere for too long\ncan degrade those terpenes. So imagine this kind of cannabinoid and terpenes\nsludge coming out of the machine because we've preserved them up to that point.\nImmediately usually what's done with sauce and live resin is you're taking\nthe terpenes and generally spinning them off in a classified centrifuge. The\nreason we use the classified centrifuge is because there's still a little bit of\nsolvent in there, so we just want to be cautious, but what that ultimately does\nis it spins off the terpenes and it separates a terpene layer from the\ncannabinoid layer. You separate those two now there's a variety of different\nproduction processes that go back into this. In some cases if you're if you're\ndoing crystallization you can leave a little bit of solvent in there and you\ncan ultimately recrystallize the THC-a through a supersaturation method.\nYou can ultimately take the cannabinoids off from that terpene fraction and\ndecarboxylate the cannabinoids and then add the terpenes back in - and that's how\nyou make live resin pens. So for example you know once that decarboxylated\ncannabinoid profile is there you take your original terpenes blend them back\nin and it's going to give you the viscosity in order for the pen or the\nvape cartridge to be able to uptake and atomized that extract. And make, again\nthis is an extract that is absolutely in line with the original orientation of\nthe plant, the original smells, flavors terpenes, and the uniqueness. It's very\ncool because you have such variety within these plants and to capture the\nnative essence of that plant and to reconstitute it and to several\nconsumable forms is a massive value add for an extraction business. And if you\nlook at some of the best extraction companies in the world that do this, this\nis exactly what they do and this is exactly how they do it. So on the flip\nside of what we've spoken about here which has mainly been artisanal\ntype extracts and hydrocarbon extracts. Let's talk about crude oil, let's talk\nabout distillate, let's talk about the high-value type extracts. So crude oil is\nexactly what it sounds if you think about crude oil coming out of the ground\nin like petrochemicals or something like that.\nIt's an oil that has a lot of adulterants in it. It needs a lot of\nrefinement. It needs to go through further processes in order to be\nconsumable or in a consumable form. So what we're looking for with crude oil\non an extraction is really any type of biomass but preferred dried biomass\nlow-grade biomass that can be purchased cheap and ultimately refined into\nsomething of high value. So if we've got for example you know a thousand pounds\nof biomass sitting it's been sitting for six months, we're not going to be able to\nmake really a credible shatter product out of that, we're not going to be able\nto make a credible live resin, definitely not going to be able to make any sort of\nhigh terpene extract or anything out of that. But what we can do is we can\nmaximize the extraction of the cannabinoids out of that biomass with a generally\nwarmer solvent - of course there's ways that you can do it with a cold solvent.\nAnd this can be done with hydrocarbon or ethanol. This is where ethanol becomes\nreally applicable it becomes really easy it becomes really user friendly and\ncost-conscious. And this is where you can still use hydrocarbon but not as\nefficient of a method as ethanol for bulk crude oil. So what we actually do is\nwe take our biomass we load it in and we'll saturate it with ethanol for\na given amount of time. Ultimately we take that miscella stream is what we\ncall it which is the cannabinoids and all the other stuff that comes out of\nthe plant along with the solvent and we evaporate that solvent off. Once that\nsolvents evaporated off ultimately we have our crude oil. Now this crude oil\nhas got all sorts of chlorophyll and whatever came along with the plant and\nany sort of adulterants in there. Generally it'll have a lot of fats, waxes,\nand lipids in there that generally come out of the plant in extraction. So\nthere's a variety of refinement processes. One of the most common\nprocesses to refine is to get to distillate and that's what I'd like to\nchat about next. So let's talk about guys how that distillate actually gets made.\nNow distillate is a process that's made through distillation so quite commonly\nor to break it down in really simple terms if you're putting a pot of water\non the stove and ultimately that water is boiling and turning into vapor - \nthat's a process of distillation. That water is being distilled into the\natmosphere in the form of vapors. So that's exactly what we're trying to do\nwith the cannabinoids in the crude oil. We're actually trying to take those\ncannabinoids, we're trying to vaporize them, and ultimately we're going to\nrecollect them in a more concentrated form. But before we can distill there's\nseveral other things we need to do. We need to make sure that there's no\nadulterants in that distillate or in that crude oil that are going to inhibit\nmaking the distillate. So those things can be waxes, they can be chlorophylls,\nthey can be fats, lipids, all sorts of weird stuff that can come over in a very\nrough crude extraction. The way that we refine that is we commonly\nuse winterization processes, we also commonly use fine filtration, there's\nguys that use what are called adsorbent - which could be diatomaceous earth or\nactivated carbons in order to clean up some of these undesirables from this\ncrude oil in order to make it into distillate. But ultimately once it's\npassed through a distillation process it's normally used a what's called a\nfractional distillation, or a wiped film distillation process when you're at\nscale. We're taking those cannabinoids and we're evaporating them and we're re-concentrating them. So what happens is we take this very, very poor quality\nbiomass, turn it into a really rough crude oil, but ultimately extract the\nwe'll call it \"the goodies\" - but the cannabinoids out of that crude oil and\nconcentrate them in a very refined format. That can be remixed in and\nreconstituted into several different products. This process is awesome because it can literally take any grade of biomass and turn it into a shelf-stable,\nreplicatable, scalable, repeatable product that has a consistency across the board\nfor end-users expectations. For example, you get Pepsi every time it tastes like\nPepsi every time you don't want it to taste like Coke one time or taste like\nyou know RC Cola the next time. You want consistency and a repeatable fashion for\nwhich to make your product. So last product that I want to talk about is\nisolates and isolates are made from actually in almost all cases distillate.\nSo we're taking this crude oil remember as we spoke about with distillate,\nrefining it into a distilled product. So we have this distilled product and the\npotency of that can be anywhere from say a little very low-end 75 percent on the very high-end 95 percent - but it's not 100% pure. And what\nwe're gonna do with that distillate is we're actually going to go through a\nsecondary refinement process called crystallization, isolation of\nthese individual cannabinoids. So each one of these cannabinoids has a\nmolecular structure and based upon what that molecular structure looks like we\ncan come up with ideal ways to actually crystallize and crash out of solution\nthese individual molecules. This is a very common process in chemistry. It's\nused very widely and it's ultimately how CBD isolate is made, it's ultimately how\nTHCA diamonds are made, it's a process of crystallization. So how we do that is\nwe use a selective solvent the selective solvent most often used is hydrocarbon.\nVery often it's either butane or pentane in order to make these isolates.\nAnd what happens is you actually take your distillate and you mix it into\neither the pentane or the butane if it's THCA depending on what you're trying to\ndo and you have your distillate or your fine cannabinoids back in matrices at\nthat point it's back in that now that miscella of hydrocarbon and\ncannabinoids. And what happens is over time and over a temperature ramp spike\ncurve and over a slow period of time these cannabinoids will start\nto actually crystallize. And they'll form one little crystal and it will grow upon\nitself. As we reduce the saturation of the solvent they actually fall out of\nsolution. So what will happen is you'll almost see like rock candy or crystal-like formation growing. Once those crystals are fully formed they can be\nharvested and once you optimize this process you actually have nearly 100%\npurity on any given compound. Now there can be adulterants you know that gets\nstuck on the crystals that need to be washed off but in ideal state this is\nsomething that you can refine up to say a good benchmark is 99 to 99.5 percent\nif you're a really good chemist you can get it up close to 99.7 to 99.9. This is where that last little bits very, very\nhard to get, but there is ways to do that. So if we look at you know the the world\nof cannabinoids in conclusion. There's several different ways to make extracts.\nThere's a lot of different ways to make very, very viable market products. There's\na lot of ways to drive revenue in your extraction business with these products.\nUnderstanding this knowledge base and understanding how you're going to occupy\neach one of these market niches, what access to biomass you have, what\ndiversity and methodology do you have in order to create these products and\nultimately drive diversity and revenue in your in your business. And then really\ntaking that to the next step and taking the next level of understanding of how\nto create these products. That's something that we do here all day long\nat Precision. We absolutely understand all these processes very intimately. We\nhave a very robust team of install / integrators that\noptimize these processes, so again not just selling you the pieces of equipment\nbut actually coming out training you on these processes, sitting there with the\npieces of equipment with you in order to get these processes integrated until\nyour business is up and running and on legs.\nSo in conclusion, a tremendous opportunity ,I hope

years concentrates have become the biggest thing to happen to pop culture since well pot but as the popularity of Deb's continues to grow so the questions about the many forms these concentrates can take all concentrates are made through a process called extraction where marijuana's main ingredients are concentrated into an essential oil the main three solvents used to create Deb's are butane co2 and ISO isopropyl alcohol after extraction the resulting Deb's can look very different today we're taking a closer look at the three main types of concentrates shatter butter and oil oil is a gooey sticky liquid that can be kind of hard to handle while butter has a creamier consistency from being whipped finely shatter is smooth clear and solid all three can be used in vape pens and oil rigs but finding the right concentrate for you is a matter of preference shatter is the purest and most potent form because it involves a second extraction process that removes fats lipids and waxes this can result in over 80 percent THC however it also means that some of those tasty terpenes are removed therapies are responsible for marijuana's unique smell combined with THC terpenes create the flavor of the pot or concentrate your smoking butter retains more terpenes so it tends to be more flavorful but less potent with THC percentages in the 70s oil tends to be the least refined of the three this form also known as honey oil or butane hash oil can retain a full flavor profile however THC levels are generally less consistent unfortunately availability often determines what type of concentrate you smoke but hopefully this little guide helps those lucky enough to have a choice thanks for watching and stay tuned to hi x comm for more Deb related content including how to select a nail and the

rosin along with the pros and cons of dab rigs and nails dab pins vaporizers emails and nectar collectors you can find all these products and more at the wizard puff com online head shop and you can save money with the code roughhouse I'd like to thank wizard puffs for sponsoring this video perhaps the og of ways to do dabs is the trusty dab or oil rig fitted with the titanium nail or quartz banger and is truly one of the most effective ways to do a dab you'll get a huge hit instantly and usually get the most out of your wax - as it's fully vaporized in seconds dab rigs might be one of the most effective ways of doing dabs but there are drawbacks such as needing a torch and gas to heat the nails and also a recovery time to reheat it now for the next tab also when you introduce open flame and exposed high heat into the process you also sacrifice safety to some degree dad pens on the other hand are probably one of the safest ways to do dabs these types of pens usually use quartz ceramic or metal coils to heat the wax enclosed inside of a sealed glass or metal cap these types of pens can be effective and give big hits but usually will take several puffs to smoke the same amount of wax as doing a single dab off of a nail another common drawbacks to wax pans is that the unvailed wax builds up and they require constant cleaning to keep functioning properly some vaporizers that are made for dry herb can also be used to vaporize wax to these devices usually provide a cup or pod that inserts into the dry herb heating chamber to vaporize the wax these types of devices can be very convenient but the cons are that they often do a mediocre job of vaporizing wax as they lack the heat that's required and the small pods can be cumbersome and leaky so it can be hard to keep the heating chamber clean for dry herb nectar collectors or vacuum systems could be considered the Dark Horse of DAB methods these types of devices use a heated tip on the end of a handheld device that you dip directly into the wax there are both electric collectors as well as those requiring external heat sources such as a torch one big advantage of the collector type rig is that you can get huge hits when you're dipping the tip directly into the wax but they can have a bit of a learning curve and a little bit awkward to use perhaps the biggest favourite among divers is the email emails are very similar to the standard titanium nail on an oil rig with one key difference the emails have an electronic control center to set a precise temperature and a heating element that will keep the nail continuously heated and ready for a dab the pros of emails are that it's ready for a DAB any time that it's on and you can set to precise temperatures and you also you can do back-to-back dabs without having to reheat the nail they may also arguably be safer than using open flames and are clearly more convenient than needing a secondary heating torch cons are that they usually require a power source to operate so it may not be as portable as the other methods and it's also very convenient to use so you might find yourself smoking through your wax very quickly and passing out on the couch very early whichever method you choose dabbing wax or rosin so long as it's free of impurities is actually healthier than smoking cannabis flowers by not smoking or vaporizing the plant materials you are clearly putting less unnecessary chemicals into your body and by taking concentrated doses you're required to smoke less frequently not to mention that the time it takes to do it to have is far quicker than the time it takes to smoke a joint bulb or especially a blunt but if you're an everyday diver like myself a nice email setup likely be the way to go but if you only occasionally dabber prefer to vaporize then a three-in-one vape pen that does wax too might be satisfactory or any or an inexpensive wax pen might be even better or perfect for the beginner just

common types of cod concentrate shatter crumble and butter or wax as it's sometimes called now the names of concentrates usually refer to either the extraction method or the consistency some people refer to all concentrates as wax but we'll try to get into the details because it can be confusing and there's no dictionary definition on some of these yet so you will hear people using one term for multiple things for multiple terms for one thing so when i first started buying legal concentrates in colorado in like 2014 like 95 of the concentrate options were shatter crumble and butter or wax as it's sometimes called and a lot of times all three of these would be called wax or having a sale on wax it would refer to any cured resin that they had so most of what i would get was bho but all this is ethanol extraction and they're still using these terms because we can still come out with these consistencies and it's interesting because this crumble in my opinion is uh more waxy or buttery than the wax and the wax looks a little more crumbly than the crumble it just goes to show you that the terms aren't exact not all crumble is a hundred percent the exact same consistency not all waxes it's just general terms to try to keep them categorized like shatter for example shatter usually refers to as the lighter clear stuff that you can feed through you can't really see through any of the other ones in this one i go to break off a piece it should snap off but there's different types of shatter i mean i've had glass like shatter where it doesn't bend at all it's not malleable in any way it snaps when you try to fold it there's shatter that's called pull and snap where it's a little bit stretchier you can kind of stretch pieces off and they snap off eventually it's still shattered but it's a little bit more malleable and then i've also seen really sappy shatters where it looks like this but just a slightly melted or a slightly warm version shatter is probably the most popular out of the three of these and most people would think that this is the best it can have higher thc percentages but sometimes that means lower terpene percentages now these these two the crumble and the wax are very similar consistency a lot of the crumble that i've been getting in florida is really really dry sometimes crumble ends up looking like that where it's just really dry kind of powdery this video is brought to you by boom head shop the loudest online head shop they carry all kinds of bongs dab rigs vaporizers accessories cleaning products and more check them out and you can save up to 20 off with the cupid's code that's boomheadshop.com when you're making shatter you usually spend a little more time purging out all the fats and lipids when you're making that butter consistency sometimes you'll whip it up while you're purging it so as far as differences goes they're all very similar they'll have similar tastes they'll vaporize basically about the same it's just how they're handled now i don't really like crumble and shatter that much they're my least favorite they're the hardest to handle concentrates in my opinion if you get a really hard shatter it'll break off when you try to go get a piece or crumble sometimes it's really hard to handle really hard to scoop it's super dry sometimes it just smears all over the container and you're trying to get it off and there's just a thin film of it on the inside so i'm hoping this video gives you a little insight on the consistencies the terms aren't too literal they can mean a variety of things there's a bunch of different things you could call shatter a wax or crumble that would fit the criteria or fill that category when i first got into dabbing shatter was my favorite i thought because it had the highest thc percentage that it was going to be the best one oh man biggest numbers in this one but then i learned after several incidents of handling it losing some it was my least favorite to deal with it's usually the least flavorful out of the three there so out of the three i would say butter is my absolute favorite crumble and shadow are [ __ ] i hate those consistencies they're the worst anyway if

I'm a urologist at UCLA and I am happy to be able to speak to you about cannabis and the urologic practice my colleague Neil Baum helped me with with this and I always give him all the credit he richly deserves and so in the this particular program we'll cover how does cannabis work the myths associated with cannabis safety of cannabis and the urologic applications the my journey to learn about cannabis started when I saw a patient a number of years ago who had been esthetic renal carcinoma he was in the intractable pain and anything that we gave to him was of no benefit and so therefore we he came to me and said I'd like to try cannabis and what do you think and quite frankly at that point I had no knowledge about it whatsoever nor did my colleagues I thought about it and and after he came back and had a very particularly terrible experience because the person who was supposed to help him could not help him and it was about seven or eight years ago in Los Angeles before that was when was only medical and so I decided I was going to learn more about this and as I learned about it I wrote about it and have been speaking about it but more importantly I wanted to share my knowledge with my colleagues because this is a patient driven and a patient driven medication and people want to know about it and it's only the best thing for your medical care to know about it I'm in no way advocating it I'm just simply saying knowledge is important so with that I want to proceed the responsibility of a urologist I believe is to just know a little bit about or even more about the use of the cannabis now it just the tip of the iceberg is some of the conditions that may be helped and we'll talk about those conditions in a moment but there is so much to learn about cannabis and one of the problems is that because it's Schedule one that is it's not allowed really to be researched within the universities the Schedule one has prevented and has become an obstacle to knowledge which i think is wrong so all of us end up having anecdotes and stories by patients and that is not the best way of guiding our care for the patient we really need to have evidence base on medicine and that evidence-based medicine will come but first the obstacle of being on schedule one like heroin or LSD has to be overcome 95 percent of us live in a state in that has either medical or fully legal matter of marijuana and only if you live in Nebraska South Dakota or Idaho is a completely prohibited otherwise your patients have the access to medical or for that matter recreational but we're doling and we talking about access to obtaining marijuana for medical purposes interestingly enough it's been illegal for so many years and it's been it's been considered to be dangerous all the way back into the 30s and far before that but in the 30s when there was reefer madness or than the 40s movies that that portrayed it as as a terrible drug well if you go back you find out that the Declaration in penance was written on hemp paper and so people have known about this for a long time the consumption of cannabis is based on speed rate of metabolism and choice there are various methods by which you can you can consume you can smoke or you can vape you can hear this person is using a bong which is water pipe you can consume in in candy or foods of some sort and what happens is that if the person takes cannabis by smoking or vaping you they get a much rep more rapid concerned by the cannabis you it's eaten it's a much slower effect because it has to be metabolized well under those circumstances some people will take one or two pieces of candy or or a brownie or a piece of candy in a candy bar and say oh nothing's happening and then they'll take a second or third piece and by the time the third piece or fourth piece is ever consumed the the effect will become multiplied that's why people need to be very cautious when they take medication through food which is metabolized now it's very interesting to me that the vascular system the lymphatic system and the nervous system have all been well described for hundreds of years and yet the endocannabinoid system was only discovered in 1992 and as you can see from the receptors the receptor of CB 1 which is THC which is more the the portion that people think about when they think about affect psychologically or neurologically or cv2 which is also known as CBD and people think well how can possibly have a medication or a drug that affects all parts of the body I mean literally soup to nuts and we are urologist we know the difference and so we have to wonder what is it about this drug this Mitali the CBD or TC that really affects everything well the fact is that there are different receptors for CB 1 against CB 2 and CB 2 are principally the ones that that will affect things that your urologist want to take care of particularly in reducing inflammation or reducing pain and so when you understand that the receptors throughout the body are different then you understand why CBD and THC and generally marijuana will affect different people in different ways the facts of about cannabis are that it's been used for thousands of years and it's but I showed you the number of states 33 states and history Columbia where it's medicinal should be um this Columbia is also recreational um it's off-limits for scientific investigation it's classified as Schedule one as I mentioned be same as heroin and LSD and in fact there's more research been done on heroin and LSD than on marijuana because of all the laws and truly became a and has become a political plant and there's limited evidence for abuse yes it can be abused but there is limited evidence and that's once again because the research does not allow people to really find out what is in that plant the plant has a hundred and forty-four chemicals within it and we only know of a few so cannabis and evidence-based medicine is critical in my mind because that's what we've been working on as to clinicians all of our professional lives patient values and preferences and best evidence and clinical expertise all Center in evidence-based medicine and since it is truly a patient driven medication people don't will not go to a doctor generally speaking a urologist and say what do you think I should take and the urologist starts off by saying take cannabis that's not going to happen what happens is the patient comes in and says I want to take cannabis how will that affect me because it's um it's been controversial and and promoted by lots of different organizations and groups and of people finally the National Academy of Sciences the medicine looked at it and put out in nineteen ninety nine twenty one years ago of a book that showed that the it is effective conclusively effective for chronic pain nausea and vomiting with chemotherapy that is chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting as well as muscle spasm and MS now those are the three things that that the National Academy is founded it is conclusively helpful for but there are complications and that's why the complications and pediatrics and pregnancy is that you the grade there is greater number of NICU NICU admissions in women who smoke marijuana or consume marijuana while pregnant there's also premature births and underweight well you think about it if those women were to take any other drug even alcohol for example or or other drugs such as cocaine which are much much more addictive of course they too would get greater number of ICU admissions and premature deaths that doesn't excuse it but it just shows you that that drugs are bad for pregnant women there's no conclusive evidence that it causes heart attacks strokes and diabetes it doesn't cause respiratory diseases such as chronic like chronics cigarette smoking there is some thought that if you smoke every day multiple marijuana cigarettes it would have some lung disease or issues but knowing very very very few people do that and actually including in California for decades people were smoking considerable amounts of marijuana and and studies show that they really were not affected like they would be had they been smoking cigarettes it does not improve immune competence and some people have even thought it would be good for treatment of testicular cancer there's no evidence of that whatsoever but for cardiovascular effects it does elevate systolic and diastolic soon aunt after consuming marijuana causes tachycardia increases sympathetic stimulation decreases a time to angina and there is a slight increase in Aminah and MI for one hour post marijuana use so now just like everything else in life you gotta take consideration any comorbidities and so therefore if someone were to have significant cardiovascular disease you would say that it's a bad idea to smoke marijuana for any purpose now another myth is that it's a gateway drug that has been disproven repeatedly and yet it is repeatedly spoken about and so it's all you can do is try and try again the National Academy of Medicine in the Institute of Medicine in 1999 the same book that I reference before has indicated that it is not a gateway drug but what we really need is research not anecdotes so that people will be able to know what - if it indeed is helpful another myth is that it causes cancer does not and when a person comes in to be seen and they ask about cannabis in the medical in a minute and see that only has medical marijuana and frankly just the knowledge of knowing what in a state that has recreational as well or adult use as well the you just have to say let us look at what is eat what is allowed in each state and that is for the medical purposes but and also it's good reference for you to be able to determine whether or not there's medical marijuana that would be helpful in any particular state and you can say well I guess that's at least anecdotally if not evidence-based that it might be helpful so for example in Illinois interstitial cystitis is a qualifying condition for the use of cannabis and so if a person were in California and they said well I've got painful spasms because of interstitial cystitis you could say to yourself well it is allowed in Illinois there may be proof that it is helpful and I I can't god I cannot prescribe it but I certainly can say that it is recommended or at least possibly used in Illinois cachexia due to cancer is another common condition that is that people use cannabis for to stimulate their appetite terminal illness hospice care chemotherapy induced nausea muscle spasms that's why I put in interstitial cystitis here because if it helps them MS muscle spasms maybe an interstitial cystitis as well or for that matter other muscle spasms it's it's been stating to me how well in Parkinson's spinal stenosis spinal cord disorders and we course see patients that have and have those conditions which resulting geologic illness PTSD rheumatoid arthritis sickle cell anemia at least the pain associated with it intractable pain and every state has the the ability or I should say has stated that if doctors find a condition that is diagnosed as debilitating then marijuana in a medical state can be recommended pain is the most common reason for for using the medical marijuana 100 million Americans have chronic pain and so this is the reason why chronic pain is the most common by far and away the most common reason why people use medical marijuana others is multiple sclerosis chemotherapy induced vomiting nausea and cancer as I listed before so you can see that over 50% of the people will want to use medical marijuana for chronic pain why again why 50% greater 50% use marijuana for pain well in 2016 214 million prescriptions of opioids were used more than 60 million Americans consumed acetaminophen on a weekly basis over 30 billion doses of NSAIDs were were given and 80 million aspirins are consumed a day not all of course are for pain but that's 117 aspirin tablets for every man woman and child in the United States the opioid crisis in the United States is is absolutely an epidemic and unfortunately know about epidemics now but is that an epidemic rate as many as one in five whose are opioid addicted received opioids as prescription for non-cancer pain 11 million abusing opioids and a million thousand people are go to the ER every day for opioid misuse the the most chilling thing is 72 thousand people who die every year and that is more deaths there are more deaths since a year 2004 opioid than all the deaths that occurred on the battlefields in every war since 1775 it is a spectacular amount of people who have have died and as it turns out marijuana is a could be a substitute II and some individuals and does not kill and this is the reason why it doesn't kill I think that this is the most important slide there is why do opioids kill and T C does not and the reason is the receptors the the cannabis receptors are in the in this portion of the brain and in the cerebellum the opioids are in the this portion but most importantly they are in the brain stem for breathing and so this is the reason why opioids kill and cannabis does not there has never been a death due to overdose of cannabis but seventy-two thousand people a year die of cannabis overdose in the United States as time has gone on it's become more and more legal in various states but more importantly and in this particular sideshows it that Americans believe it should that medical marijuana for sure should be legalized sixty-two percent versus thirty four percent and just in 1969 when when I went I was when I was in college in medical school 84 percent thought of what should be illegal and only twelve percent legal so attitudes have change and that's why your patients are coming in to talk to you about it so the summary is cannabis is safe it is not a gateway drug and it has several urological applications you can see that annual desk 435,000 from tobacco seventy five thousand from opioids none none from marijuana a hundred from peanuts so you can see that even even peanuts are more dangerous than marijuana the finally one joke by Bill Murray I find it quite ironic that most dangerous the most dangerous thing about about weed is getting caught with it so the dangers are few the the potential benefit is great and in it in this particular talk I hope I was not trying to convince you to use it but I'm trying to come to you about and educate you about why some people do so thank you very much if you wish to contact me there is my email address I wish you a great day thank you", "iRPq0ozF7fw": "what's up it is 3 p.m on a sunday afternoon thanks for tuning into cannabis legalization news where we explain marijuana so you can change them today we're going to be talking about three policy makers who are just showing their whole ass to the whole world uh let's see we're also going to do an update about mexico and malta and somebody in detroit is suing detroit for just some petty stuff so let's just get right into it hey mickey hey tom oh i can wait i'm reporting from 1937. we have a breaking story that's come across the line for cannabis legalization news thank you for joining us everybody since it's 1937 we're gonna say i hope that you've turned up your radio as opposed to likes and subscribes uh governor ricketts who i'm assuming was the appointed governor of nebraska in 1937 says if you legalize marijuana you're gonna kill kids what was the date of that article maybe that was a march 14th 2021 what march 14th 2021 oh that makes me angry i mean i understand when it's something that is just so wrong that you think it's from like 1937 but when it's from 2021 and it's a governor in a position of power saying that weed will kill your children it is just a lie it's the same type of why we've been fighting against on this program and thank you for joining us by the way uh since 2019 starting with the 19. corn [ __ ] are in charge of nebraska dude period the the balls there's only one nut in nebraska yeah there's nothing i mean like i would i would probably be fine going through life as a cat lawyer in nebraska simply because they'd be like well at least he's not on wheat yeah and you're white and i'm white that also helps this haircut probably doesn't let's see that haircut picture that uh governor pete ricketts is rocking so governor pete ricketts uh gave a press conference as you can see he has adopted the lex luthor-esque uh seriously dude like like evil incarnate is right like yeah stereotype right there right and governor pete ricketts and other prohibitionists in nebraska held a conference on wednesday in the capital rotunda just ahead of a unicameral hearing on medical marijuana legalization mmj is in front of nebraska lawmakers for a fifth consecutive year months after losing ballot approval in the 11th hour last fall following a ruling by the nebraska supreme court governor ricketts said if you legalize marijuana you're going to kill your kids that's what the data shows from around the country um you know that is the biggest lie that i've heard all day simply because uh children are not dying from cannabis they aren't if anything in legal cannabis states children's schools are getting funded children have a harder time accessing cannabis especially in states where the illicit market is allowed to participate in the uh regulated market so all those people that were because you know you know who doesn't card right nikki oh dealers drug dealers don't card and so like i see stuff like this and when i see stuff like the the caps in florida when they say that this is about you know preventing our children our children are going to have brain damage and you're like no well you preventing the 10 percent uh flower cap on thc for medical cannabis or for lawfully purchased cannabis just means that the dealer down the street can be like you don't want those nuggets i got the real thc in my nuggets right here and because it's illegal i'm not going to be carding to see whether or not you're over 21 or paying my taxes but it'll still be a cash transaction this is how you get spice outbreaks and other uh outbreaks of bad drugs when uh you know overall you know my 100 percent and legalization but it's also our harm reduction and how we treat just our perception of of what it is like this is complete [ __ ] like complete idiots see like what the how are you shoveling stupid to your people and then still get reelected like how is this like like like like does anybody even ask like hey where are the kids that are dying like like show me the data show me on the doll where marijuana touched you but let me uh just continue to read some of his stuff and i hope that i don't get too upset about it so governor ricketts we already said that ricketts continued marijuana has big impacts on people's cognitive abilities changes their gray matter in the brain damages their ability to be able to develop their cognitive abilities to be able to think to do well in school this is something that's harming our young people and it continues on through the workforce so uh you know i didn't use cannabis when i until i was in college i've been a c student since i was four and so i know i'm pretty sure maybe if i would have smoked weed when i was in high school i would have done better but but no probably not have you ever gone to school it's exceedingly boring the only people that do really really well are the people that are like oh you listened to what the teacher said kissed her ass a little bit and then did it a-plus this kind of stupid does not do your constituents doesn't do america any favors like this is the kind of [ __ ] that so you're saying a guy who lives in a legal state you or me or anybody in legal states deserves to be behind bars because pandemonium has erupted you know this is it's and then not only that you're saying in order to save the children we need to keep it illegal so that the children can continue to access it through drug dealers as opposed to cannabis will no longer necessarily be something that drug dealers are stocking because people that can actually buy sell and grow it uh on a local level uh and where it's licensed and where the purity is regulated and then not only that where they're like i need to see your id oh i don't have my id get out dude safe access isn't is about uh uh you know it's the the the plant itself being a good plant like good product good known product and it's also about a safe place where you can pick it up like i go to the store and pick it up dude yesterday i just went to uh uh uh stop by have a heart and i picked up this uh for my sponsor washington blood code thank you so much so good um so good dude i've been smoking mids for so long i forgot what good we was like and oh my god this is the champagne the weed but anyways uh uh you know i went to the store yesterday they had a long line and everybody was a good citizen there was no cops no raids like the the kind of civility that happens when it's legal and people don't treat it like the [ __ ] up ignorant type [ __ ] that they're preaching in this like your kids no your kids are in trouble with the law because of this the law is the the issue not the plan this is not you know it's ignorance 101. you know ricketts said that the use of marijuana has a huge human toll sharing examples of two fatalities he says were linked to ingested marijuana or thc let's see the death report on those two fatalities meanwhile how many uh people have died of the coronavirus in nebraska or how many people died of heart disease in nebraska how many people have died of alcohol poisoning or like liver failure in nebraska how many people are dying of cheeseburgers in nebraska but for some reason if you legalize weed children are going to be the one who access it that why alcohol is still illegal because then uh children would would ha not be able to access or the children would be able to access alcohol i mean like it just makes no sense what they're saying the same thinking as like you know in legal states they're trying to put limits on what's already out there but we got to think about the children are you [ __ ] kidding me children will go to the store you're not allowed in the store you've got to be 21 and over so you're there and you've robbed the weed dealer and so now the weed dealer isn't necessarily going to be on the streets no more especially if you regulate your plant correctly and you make it really really easy for those growers to get licensed so suddenly they're trying to go legit because they don't want to be looking them behind them and see if everything's going to get shut down they're going to take everything they own they would prefer to be legal themselves and then again i don't know who's selling this weed to kids but i do know that it's not the licensed operators i mean when you know back in traditional days you know i don't ever recall being asked like hey uh can you prove me who you are and what state or what a idea is you know this is uh this is just dumb this is dumb and it's hurting this this this is the type of [ __ ] that hurts our society in the whole like you know i travel the bus you know to work every day when i when i come in i go through the city and i don't know if you know but seattle's a pretty big city you know and uh we have a huge homeless problem and a lot of these people freaked out like during the uh uh what was that when we had the chop and and all the maggot people were freaking out about like antifa and you know we're just uh uh un uh dystopian society well the thing is you know we have a large homeless population of people living in tents [ __ ] that i haven't seen in a long time and it has nothing to do with legalization but people point to this like acceptance of like but part of the problem is how we view mental health and drug addiction like harm reduction is 100 percent what we should be doing not incarcerating and uh putting things on prohibition like uh dr carl hart billion dollars out of the depend defense department's trillion dollar budget to help the [ __ ] homeless people why why do we do maybe it's because we like seeing homeless people so we can judge them as being bad so that we can be like you know not that guy i got some things going on uh but it's just so mean and so stupid how we do this stuff and so like you know again the ama one of the organizations that ricketts mentioned quoted a january article about a mississippi ballot initiative that said while it's possible there may be beneficial medical uses of marijuana numerous evidence-based studies demonstrate that significant deleterious effects abound and the article also notes that such measures put physicians at risk of criminal and civil liability now the ama is full of scientists and they should be better than that because they should know that the reason why numerous deleterious effects abound is because those were the only studies that got funded and they were trying to find any deleterious effect and then one of the big risk factors is the risk of criminal and civil liability that has nothing to do with the cannabis plan and everything to do with the legality and the scheduling of the cannabis plant agree yeah this type of [ __ ] until it's over so you know if if you guys have not yet i mean like you're not you can't disrespect the office but you can invoke people out of office you know you can't you can be polite but firm and then of course then if you're a trumper you can just forget that america is a thing and do whatever you want until like again you get arrested but don't recommend that you know you're not going to convince these people of this because they're already in belief of stuff that ain't real you know it is this is oh my god dude this is why i smoke some good weed like this is why you need good weeds just to put up with this [ __ ] this this idiot odyssey uh that this guy is a representative of a group of people in america and then he has a bunch of other people that agree with him that you know what studies are you guys looking at where are you why why is this such a thing for you to to deny like prohibition doesn't work right we've had how many billions devoted against uh this plan howard buffett and because warren buffett's kid is crazy and he's an anti-prohibition guy and he's got billions of dollars and so that's one of the reasons why uh macon and and uh not detroit the detroit of illinois decatur uh has had such a hard time in illinois getting more licenses and opting in to allowing cannabis businesses is that howard buffett spends all this money on propaganda and of course like the picture of mr ricketts at the podium he's at a sam podium smart approach marijuana the most ironically named anti-marijuana uh organization in the free world but and this is why we don't have nice things because these well it is not us per se but like the [ __ ] and government the people who are running the show the ones who are the authorities right like ones that are stuck right here in 1957 you know where things were easier because you didn't have to really think you could just depress people and believe in crap and then you know what didn't matter you just had to make sure that you had a good haircut and you're white especially a man and then you could just tell people facts yeah yeah make [ __ ] up [ __ ] and that's the problem like so the ama they're like a roller coaster too and i think anything that is a entity in government is a roller coaster of this opinion on cannabis like with the va you know one year it's like don't do it next year it's like okay we're gonna think about letting you guys do it so it's okay it's not a plant that's killed anybody no one's proven anything and now it's like don't do it again people it's not this conversation is so more about wellness and social justice that at the end all game everything that we preach about this is the greatest hypocrisy we got going on right now oh yeah and the hypocrisy continues because ricketts also cites the american psychiatric association a dubious association in my book if you ever see how antipsychotics work which pdf is 2019 position statement on the matter posted online uh and the document concludes with the apa does not endorse cannabis medicine the words danger or dangerous don't appear in the document however it does say in part policy and practice surrounding cannabis-derived substances should not be altered until sufficient clinical evidence supports such changes well that's effing impossible because of the way that the funding is currently set up the only funding is for finding harm there is no funding in for finding benefit because that would defeat the purpose of schedule one tac if you think about too a a psychological company they're not there to help you get better i mean like the if they were they would be promoting what would help which is treatment and and and consultation and you know they there's no magic [ __ ] pill that makes anything better like whether it be uh schizophrenia i mean it helps but things with treatment need to be done like that's this is just pure fear mongering of taking care of yourself you know the endocannabinoid system i'd imagine you know it's entwined with your nervous system your bone structure seriously throw that freaking back into the pipe of the american psychiatric association uh so this endocannabinoid system that we discovered approximately 30 years ago and i've done a lot of research on predominantly in israel where it's more lawful to actually do research that's objective as opposed to trying to find the harm why isn't that enough i mean like we know that it's a biological system in our body we know why it works we know what it does we know that it doesn't kill people now does it i'm not sitting there saying like we should give it to children no right the stuff your home it's it's that as as dr ethan russo told us and if you haven't seen that episode on cannabis legalization news smash the likes hit subscribe and then search uh ethan russo cannabis legalization news on youtube and you'll find it and he does a great job explaining that this is the chief homeostatic regulation regulation system on your body or in your body stuff doesn't usually get out of whack when you're a kid stuff starts your whack more and more as you get older more and more after you've seen enough rotations around the sun where you're going to get injured or where you're going to get old or where you're going to have pain or where you know you might have um audio audio auto immune diseases like crohn's or ibs or or lupus or or uh so many other diseases that your endocannabinoid system's out of whack on and and the only thing we clearly have is we have a governor of nebraska that's suffering from uh cannabinoid deficiency and we all are paying the price for and by we all i mean like i have to read this and get like so mad that suddenly i become cyclops without his freaking visor and then um not only that you know those poor people in nebraska that actually need access safe access to their medicine what are they doing well they've probably already moved yeah now i'm proud that i cursed not as much as i thought i was going to on this uh i mean really i was heated when i saw the topic i was like oh man oh she's gonna be effing all the time keep rolling on to the next one i'll go back to 1937. hang on [ __ ] let's cut uh okay so the next story is just as bad as the first story tennessee republican wants to permanently block recreational marijuana through state constitution in tennessee yeah and this this one even it gets worse right so representative brandon ogles of franklin tennessee received approval in the house criminal justice subcommittee for house joint resolution 140 which would amend the state constitution prohibit future general assemblies from permitting recreational drug use now the hate and stupidity does not stop there it goes on to the potential constitutional amendment would also prevent the state legislature from ever legalizing rape human trafficking or prostitution without making any another change to the founding document like how are you going to put rape and and prostitution in the same like the thinking here is not you're putting rape in par what was it prostitution yeah one of those things is consensual and then the one with the cannabis that you're putting in there there's no psychological dispute or there's no real psychological damage for adult use cannabis but anyway this is one of those things where i'm so angry and it's 420 somewhere that we can test the official position of the department or the ministry of health of japan this should make me violent so violent that maybe i'll even have more burning eyes after this 420 bumper [Applause] [Music] okay it was all a lie tell the minister japan that it'll kick in i'm sure your anger will [ __ ] well now as we continue on with this one anger is going to continue on ahead of wednesday's meeting yeah although amended the resolution he initially filed to also include the ban on legalization of recreational use of substance on the federal drug schedules list the item first only pertain to sex crimes i mean come on man do we i mean what kind of [ __ ] stupid like how are you gonna ever like first off why do you even need a bill for legal like we're gonna stop like we're gonna make sure no one ever legalizes rape like like was that ever an issue where is the legalization of rape uh lobby that's like you know what we need we need to legalize that uh rape but this is that [ __ ] we're like i'm doing a good thing here but at the same time we gotta get the we people like they're all the same people right yeah because there's there's two stops after marijuana uh the first one is human trafficking and the second one is rape you know according to the ministry of japan cannabis use makes you violent uh man like the problem the real problem with the the laws are that they're so wrong that they like we're not trying to get like censored by youtube we're trying to like say like no there's an endocannabinoid system this is why medical marijuana actually works here's how these other things work you really have nothing to fear about this plant it's terribly over regulated you guys are just causing yourself unnecessary harm because you believe in fat fantasy and lies and remember everybody in this country was [ __ ] brought up to believe that santa claus is a real goddamn thing that brings you toys in order to support your parents to be able to manipulate and control you and then we're like shocked that our leaders are still feeding us lies and garbage so they can manipulate and control us but that's the thing though man everybody's between the santa claus lies and the [ __ ] the government's here to help you lies i mean gary's been swayed government's a little kind of like a wizard like the government is basically santa claus to a certain extent especially in america shout out to rob man thanks for tuning in really appreciate it um love that show up clt be in the grommies man hell yeah and so um i had a point most mostly my point is um sometimes when i read the news out of the south or nebraska i feel like it's before we had technicolor before we had science facts or even knew what the endocannabinoid system is it's a very special time that makes me angry but this is why flower states get a bad rep this is why the flower states when everybody thinks that you're you know uh banjo uh i hear songs coming when i walk you know i mean like it's just you're being a stereotype stop being stupid stupid stop it stop stop hurting your people stop hurting america i mean essentially all gays told the committee this will ensure we never have recreational drug use in the state because it's illegal to drink i'm assuming or smoke cigarettes in tennessee this will ensure that we never have recreational drug use in the state i think it's a very much an expression of the value system we have in the south in this state again evidently you're not allowed to drink or smoke cigarettes in tennessee or maybe not even have coffee where do we draw the line on drugs because like with this unlike with coffee i don't have to filter this through water to make an extraction first off it wouldn't work if i was going to make an extra extraction from it i would do it with a more of a polar solvent you know like an alcohol and or a butter however then sure that's more of a drug coffee is more of a drug than cannabis flour cannabis flour is a plant again the perception of drug use and how we interact with drugs and how we treat things because like you're saying it's a variety of things from coffee to heroin right let's just it's everything it's sugar you know and if we can just learn the chemistry won't be a drug let's all realize how much of a drug sugar is you take the sugar cane and then you gotta process the crap out of the sugar cane so much so that you can strip out any plant material what so frickin ever and then you get what's the chemical composition i know it's carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen because it's an organic molecule but what a hey if you're watching out there and you know the chemical symbol for uh sugar uh and that that that would be of course um uh sucrose not uh dextrose or or fructose uh we're gonna go with uh is glucose because glucose and fructose put together is sucrose that's sugar did you say [ __ ] those we are yes this is what happens when cannabis legalization news get enough gets onto a tangent we should have a tangent bumper but the thing is though i mean come on this is the [ __ ] with the the save the children and the recreational drugs we'll never we don't need this in our not my backyard [ __ ] children and so like if i'm gonna be giving uh their kind of bs lines i should at least look like a cat if i'm gonna say like we need to make sure we have cannabis concentration limitations for our regulated cannabis markets for the children i should look like a cat if i if i'm telling my voters my elected representatives in nebraska that the reason why medical cannabis should not come to nebraska is because it kills children i should look like a cat because you are in a freaking world of fantasy it's not real and you should be robbed of your reality if you're saying dude i you know it's just hard to see that there's so much stupid out there but at the same time i know we have a lot of good people and that's the thing like everybody's like oh this legalization is going to happen tomorrow this legalization is going to happen tomorrow and you and me and then if you're joining us on wednesday you should hit them thumbs up subscribe and then tune in on wednesday we're going to talk about tommy chong and all the weedy smokes for the past 60 years um but that's a point of it man like you know chong probably thought it was gonna be 10 years away 40 years ago i thought it was going to be five years away 10 years ago you know and and then some people think it's going to be tomorrow this year and it ain't because some people think that cannabis will kill kids and not only do they think it they have press conferences where they announce it as if it's a fact and again if it the more act or whatever happens if something happens even though uh what's the shunmu turquoise session where he talks about like it's always a priority for democrats like i'm not gonna see i'm not i will be excited we will go live the day of if something goes through a bill where they say hey like we did it to the moor act originally but i'm not holding my breath man like this is not you know we've we've but we are they've gotten everything off their plate though and so like i'm yeah i'm optimistic that the second half because now we're getting into the 420 time and so uh after wednesday we're past st patrick's day and then it's the next holiday is really easter and 4 20. and so i'm thinking that that's probably where they're going now that they've gotten the senate all of washington's gotten the 1.9 trillion dollar corona relief package uh signed sealed and delivered on to the next one and maybe some of that next one is going to be that uh cannabis package coming out of the senate you know we will be going as soon as we have details on that yeah no i just you know uh being that we're further than we were which is nice but again it's never far enough when people like lance gore hasn't seen his mom and his daughter personally in six years like how does he let the prosecutor that's wrong not even just but not just the prosecutor but the visitation visits like like he hasn't had access like so that nut job in the the buffalo guy the when they the insurgency when that guy took over that [ __ ] got a in meeting with with the news people like the following day lance hasn't seen his mom or his daughter his daughter graduated high school uh college and uh uh like brilliant kid um without her dad like prom all this [ __ ] all the life stuff like she's got a dude i mean just life like the government has taken away this man's life and not just his but many others you know women this is [ __ ] they're a plant and what does this plant do makes you better well again it it helps regulate your homeostasis levels yes and so like uh if you have things like think about anxiety or anything else or like you know pain stuff where your your central nervous system is kind of like freaking out a little bit uh that may be why your cb2 receptors are all over those types of areas in your body and then also maybe while your cb1 receptors are very very concentrated in your brain except not in your brain stem and so like you're not going to stop breathing like you can with alcohol or opium or opioids this is not an opinion this is a biological fact based on thousands of dead people tens of thousands of dead people and how many of them were dead from marijuana you know two people did get hit by a bale of it and so they were like moving a couple of bales and and oops but that was a farming accident that really wasn't but you know like you're like you're saying though like it's it's a stabilization of your body like kind of like how you have centrum for women and centered from old men for seniors right like there's skywalker you know there's the sky master sky master excuse me i mean this thing dude i really tell the difference of really good weed these are all top colas and uh i've been buying mids man right at the top oh yeah that's that's good i've been powering through in the gang oh look at hey uh slowly now now let's see if you can get the autofocus going put it up a little bit higher your eyes and it might block off your face okay uh there it is this is what we're fighting for everybody i feel like we're on a uso show but we're looking at pictures of weed right oh i mean just the fact that this people are serving time or this little amount right here not even not even a gram probably uh it would put you in trouble like in tennessee like you like as soon as you're in town you drive through the the state line you're ass puckers and you're going to be like all right if that one cop sees me because i'm too dark and decides to pull me over and happens to smell something i'm [ __ ] yeah but let's get back to this [ __ ] who's in charge of tennessee olgas is his name or olga's uh o-g-l-e-s it's uh i think it's norwegian for stupid but uh amending the state constitution is a years-long process the legislature must approve a resolution with the proposed language in two separate general assemblies hopefully one is not run by you know people who don't believe in science uh meaning it would need to be taken up by the legislatures in 2023 or 2024 session if it passes this section or session hopefully then this means this was just grandstanding on the part of the governor and the reason why you grandstand as a politician is because you're supposed to be solving problems and all the problems were caused by all the politicians before you and now you're going to be the only one that escapes this this uh causing of problems by politicians and fixes everything so uh what pardon you missed the uh the awesome statement here august also added that those long-standing southern values were eroded in virginia as a result of the recent legislation like like what's up these people with their values like there's a guy on the floor the other day that said i know that black lives matter don't like traditional family what the [ __ ] are you talking about we all have moms dads people we love like what the what kind is this [ __ ] values like we are not going to believe in science and we will oppress people is is that one of the values what are these when you say values it could be just a bouquet of freaking flowers man well what type of flowers are they daisies you know are they uh are they marigolds are they uh dandelions or you got something worthwhile for us you know like you know what are you what are you saying these values are because values could be racism you know that's the value is that the value they want is because like the values against the south it sounds like that they're really upset with because you know virginia actually legalized it sounds like the values they want are not believing in science and oppressing people because they can that sounds like a really un-american value i wouldn't be sad if he happened to walk outside and got throw punched but you know whatever no no no you're not allowed to do that he's an elected official you have to respect the office and that's why you vote him out of it because he's clearly not qualified damn right i mean he's preaching goddamn third grade like like who is your audience who what is the educational level for your constituents like i feel sometimes sad like please tell me i not all of uh what messed up state is this not all tennessee things like this i know they don't let's bring it home because uh governor olga said that if you ever want to have a true discussion about medical marijuana you have to truly solidify it we'll never have recreation the conversation will not even be had by a dozen or so conservative lawmakers in this chamber until we know without a doubt there's no recreational coming on its heels and the slippery slope is stopped period and so like um that is just a catastrophe of a statement and these catastrophes of statements are often made but rarely this terrible because first off it says if you ever want to have a true discussion about medical marijuana i don't know if this guy has the ability to have a true discussion about medical marijuana because it appears that he does not understand the endocannabinoid system otherwise he would not have this tact uh and then you have to truly solidify that we'll never have recreational god forbid anybody in tennessee would do anything they enjoy what is tennessee the home of like whiskey and nashville yeah just saying where did it hurt you where did this little flower of a plant like did it jump out and get the bad day one day i mean like what how did this thing come at you one day like you gotta stop a slippery slope because like giving people something that's an alternative to opioids alcohol cigarettes lots of other perhaps pharmaceutical drugs for sleep to anxiety what type of slippery slope are you trying to stop here the slippery slope away from being uh addicted to prescriptions and like you know not being able to get off of these prescriptions is that the slope you're trying to stop do you not want your people to be healthy well isn't also tennessee the place where uh like the oakway pandemic like was a peak once thought with like all the focus of the doctors hustling pills and on all the stuff like i believe big farmers got a big pool there like just like a florida big pole in um indiana because i mean that's where like eli lilly is but then where spies are located moderna pretty sure fives of modern are not in the south like you know but it's still it's like you got poor populations are easily manipulated you know that's that's that's what i'm saying people you are a commodity you know they your constituent is not looking to you as a somebody to want to be for your favor they're thinking you are an asset that i'm going to shovel this pill program for you you know this is ridiculous man there are websites to namaste said mel genitalia [ __ ] candies yes uh just want to give a shout out to jay phoenix for throwing us fiverr on this you know really appreciate that i'm not necessarily saying that people should find out where the governor of tennessee and or uh nebraska lives but uh if you would mail them a sack of gummy bears perhaps um you could do but you know it's not necessarily what you you may want to do however you have to realize it's at least sending a message yeah when you're talking to people that have so checked out from reality they believe that they may have lost the ability to enact sensible regulation to make the right decision when it comes to uh appropriate policy on this because they have made a moral judgment uh and that that really kind of relieves them of having to make a factual judgment well and i think we have to like say what like with mcconnell and uh uh you know their constituents re re reelected him right like the man helped push the hem thing through but again he's also a horrible human being like how do we manipulate the legislatures to benefit the the campus the cannabis policies right so i doesn't normal grade uh because the constituents what not there's a lot of grading that goes on you know by well normal's not necessarily an ngo they kind of are actually but these types of political organizations that are trying to rank uh legislatures because i just say you know look at your local areas and and and see what you can do you know it if you're not going to be the one to run against that person you can at least always support the person running against the one that's going to be in your favor with the you know what you're what you want yeah well let's move on to the next piece of crap story that's coming out of the south uh florida house committee approves thc limits for medical marijuana so the bill aims to prevent medical marijuana from being treated as a recreational drug but opponents argue there's no justification for the measure representative spencer roach likens what he's seen now in the state's medical marijuana industry to the practices that precedes the opioid crisis are you [ __ ] kidding me dude but hey this basically means that we now have a factual discrepancy with mr roach now first off he's one of the most ironically named senators in florida that senator roach is against the medical marijuana however he's starting to conflate the opioid crisis with cannabis now to this is where the slippery slope actually is to go down this means that you are not paying attention to the factual aspects of the substance and its effects on your body and and that is the dangerous slippery slope you see he's going to now stay opioid or opioids heroin those types of things and then disappear and go well that means marijuana that's right that's just factually wrong it's legally correct under uh the federal law legally that is the correct statement which is wrong it's shockingly wrong terribly wrong like hurting us wrong but that's i think part of the education right we have to teach these dumb asses that cannabis is not toxic non-toxic right all these other things are toxic like go through your liver and get flushed out and uh it hurts your body you know inevitably uh cannabis it clings it loves your little fatty cells and hangs out and things and you feel great with it like your body is not recognizing it as if it is alcohol cocaine heroin uh some other drug which is also recognized as a poison by your body uh for some reason your body is recognizing this cannabinoid as something to store in fat cells for regulation for later first like some reason yeah again it's a natural product like and i always it's like being a dead horse but scurvy we learned the hard way that if you don't get vitamin c you get scurvy you know and so if your body doesn't get thc you get [ __ ] up law enforcement [ __ ] up law enforcement you also get a whole cavalcade of uh treatments that the pharmaceutical industry is not all that great at treating for chronic conditions that are probably caused by endocannabinoid disruption not that we're allowed to study this disease or or even system uh and as a result who suffers you me the people everybody who benefits law enforcement pharmaceutical companies exactly there's so much misinformation that people are you know that's the thing about law enforcement right like i am not an acab i i like cops i i have nice things i want my my kids to be protected and stuff like that like they there's better [ __ ] and other [ __ ] to worry about and and legalization the prohibition hurts our society like like we are under trust in law enforcement that's what it does cannabis prohibition undermines trust in law enforcement it's it's you know the other day uh i was thinking uh i had uh smoked a little bit and uh uh i was on my way home and i i was right next to a cop right next to me at the light first i tensed up a little bit but then i realized there's no reason for this guy to even like suspect me or do anything like like that went away real quick opposed to 10 15 years ago or out of state anywhere out of this state my ass bucket is when i have a cop around me yeah but this guy this senator roach i'm sorry representative spencer roach i saw spencer and i thought it was senator representative spencer roach he says 15 years ago when we look at the opioid crisis that's what we're seeing this kind of doctor shopping drug seeking behavior we not only have a responsibility to act now but an opportunity to act before it's too late i would like to direct spencer roach to hash and it's 4 000 plus year history uh but uh other than that he says that this bill is going to restrict the thc levels of medical marijuana products to 10 percent for whole flour and 60 for other products while limiting patients to 1500 milligrams of thc every 35 days based on no freaking science whatsoever you know this dumb ass he doesn't even know why they have to doctor shop because most doctors are not putting out cannabis prescriptions because they put their their license at risk like this is another ridiculous argument about why we should save the children we can save ourselves from ourselves this is ridiculous again like you said hash right and then roach goes on to conflate these are apples oranges and this isn't even apples oranges this is more like apples staplers comparisons well you're not even close you know he's like roach says i mean we're talking about 10 million milligrams over a 70-day period that's 740 now 780 bottles of 24-count aspirin all right first off no second uh you have now said you're gonna have a 24-count bottle of aspirin who buys the bottle of aspirin with 24 aspirins in it what are you doing going out for a weekend you know it's worse aspirin and then so the only reason he said the 24 was so that he could multiply that number and say 780. and so this is which what i how i would look at him if i saw him i would be like you should know better you should no worse medical advice though i mean aspirin will [ __ ] kill you if you take a lot like i have yet i'm trying really hard on cannabis aspirin may cause some stomach bleeding but like it's the tylenol that can actually kill you and so tylenol can cause the liver failure okay at least he didn't give us that because like he could have said that's 780 bottles of 24 count tylenol maybe he didn't get permission from the tylenol people to use that uh [ __ ] but yeah whatever because you know this this this ban on on medical cannabis having 10 or more thc that's going to save the children right there because the children are only buying medical cannabis that's a good one too oh my god but no that's like they aren't can you regular can you tell the drug dealers that they're not allowed to grow more than 10 thc because that's how the bill should be written uh i mean the so the bill was passed through its first committee with a party-line vote but at least two republicans expressed serious concerns with the thc cap saying it sounded too close to lawmakers playing doctor thank god at least somebody spoke some reasonableness is that lawmakers playing doctor when it comes to a woman's body we want lawmakers playing doctor when it comes to our body and what we put into it what is a drug how i can have a drug all those types of things but i'm wondering if it's the sun that does this to these people because you know california is starting to turn into florida because uh feinstein says should marijuana legalization limit thc probably not but it's happening supposedly senator dianne feinstein yeah and senator john corn of texas who jointly chaired the senate caucus on international narcotics control released a report in which they proposed various regulations of legal cannabis protect public health and safety oh i'm glad there's a federal police power now it seems like but among the call for a national institute of health remember that one institute that like says cannabis is heroin that one to intensify its research on short and long-term impacts associated with high potency cannabis and make a recommendation jointly with the food and drug administration as to whether states should cap the potency of products that may be sold again 15 legal federal patients at one time but their stock was capped at 3.5 percent it's just that it still ignores the fact that hash has existed for thousands of years and keefe has existed for thousands of years i put some uh some keef on my my pipe earlier when it was 420 somewhere and um i'm fine again like you can't you can't get any more concentrated than that when you're taking the trichomes not nor should you nor are you trying to like sit there and get at the ever clear like i don't want necessarily cannabis distillate because that cannabis distillates not gonna have the the entourage profile that i'm going for you know it's gonna have too much of the thc and not enough of the terpene profiles or maybe some cbd or some other lesser lesser cannabinoids in there to kind of smoothen out the experience public health and safety i mean i'm tired of being protected for myself i am tired of this [ __ ] like arbitrary public health and safety i get coronavirus that's affecting the public health you know that's stuff can go from one person to another i'm going to have to pass this this chillin to somebody else and i'm not doing that much right now because coronavirus but um where is the public health and safety risk i i can see benefits like i'm i'm getting the benefits now it's one of the nice things about living in illinois no it's the the law is the public safety and health issue right like the the law the fact that uh uh we are incarcerating kids and we are going after people that that's the public self inhibit and then access access the safe access that poor kid and then there's there's more uh data that comes out and who's the people that are getting arrested for cannabis the black and brown kids so think about them think about all the dangerous deleterious impacts that the legality of this plant is putting on them when they get caught with it especially when they're young for the rest of their lives all right and they still do it and not only they still do it they have schmucks that are running states in this country that are saying that we're going to stop it that it kills kids in in the states that have re-uh formed their prohibition their their you know legalized it you know their enforcement therefore the better every single even our nation's capital that you know the the law enforcement and the relationships are always for the better i haven't heard of any like oh now the raids have increased because more people are walking around like zombies through the city or attacking dominoes you know where's the freaking horror stories right you know it's just the horror stories are like children are getting new parks and uh school built in colorado right uh i don't have that that newspaper article on me anymore but our schools in peoria illinois got six hundred thousand dollars from the taxes nice sweet you know we didn't have that before that's going to help those children oh and and there's fewer people selling cannabis on the street because uh you can go buy it uh now which is nice this is like capping the vitamins on tomatoes you know what i mean it's like you can only have so much health right yes think about that like if they said like oh my gosh you have too much uh tea no not thc you have too much vitamin c in this orange send it back pack this orange based on its vitamin c level you're too healthy we can't have that and you know and here's here's the other thing here right so we got florida we got california we got these jackasses in the the committee that are all talking about limiting and then we have uh virginia who's thinking hey we should probably speed this thing up you know what we should do we should actually have because this has been a very somber episode of cannabis legalization news and there's so many people hanging out so thanks so much and you know give us some thumbs ups and share this with people and be like you guys should check these people out because we're trying to legalize the plan but uh yeah some good news out of virginia governor northam considers speeding up legalization of marijuana in virginia you think it was social justice or do you think i could find a filter for slow motion though because if there ever is a a need for a slow motion filter it would be the legalization of virginia which does not go into effect until 2024. yeah lawmakers are working with governor ralph northern's office to consider speeding up the legalization of marijuana by years possibly by making possession legal as soon as july 1st instead of january 1st 2024 holy crap that's fast yeah 2024 they're going to speed it up and then it's going to be in 2021 i think they're trying to uh make the uh possession legal date as july 1st of this year so don't forget if you're in virginia don't don't be in the slow motion go call your elected officials at the state level both chambers because you're not in weirdo nebraska that only has the unicameral chamber chamber uh and tell them that they need to speed it up i mean they probably saw like washington state survived with the pandemic uh the second largest crop you know for the uh revenue uh you guys i think brought in like 10 100 million so far or some [ __ ] like there's a re almost a billion in sales but then like the taxes are different it was a combined uh cannabis sales for medical and also adult use but there was a lot they like they only anticipated their r3 program getting about 20 million dollars and it actually got like 31. and so it was over it was overestimate so like we we sold a lot but you know what and also if you think about it too i'm thinking okay there's obviously the one metric of the actual revenue that's brought in but what about like also the this is something that can never be figured out because no cop ever like clocked this in but the amount of time devoted to arresting people like for cannabis like for how much time has been saved and money and uh uh in all our legal states like how much uh focus now goes on to real crime you know this that's got to be a huge metric yeah but that's the thing like it's not a real crime it's not it's it's it's not a crime i mean that's the thing it's anything cannabis related is not a crime in my world like that's why the activism has always been easy for me like i understand i understand criminalizing it while you're you're operating a motor vehicle i understand that uh and that's a regulation so like if they want to make that a crime fine but uh if they want to make a crime for you to have a joint while you're sitting on the couch watching netflix no that's not a crime well and you know i can't wait to when we talk to tommy chong because one of my favorite uh examples of like large amounts of personal possessions is a story by him where when he had rated for his bong store uh you know the dea were going through all [ __ ] and found pounds of marijuana in his cupboard and they're like you got what why he's all i don't know you have a pound of sugar at your house what what you know what i'm saying like yeah i mean like that's how it used to be when uh when it was medical here like uh i could afford to have a lot all the time right i used to buy by the ounce and it would it was good and it was large because there was a fair market and all blah blah blah but and then that's what this this this budco stuff because they're from the old medical times and it reminds me i'm like oh man i forgot what good we was like like really good weed that was always in my possession uh i mean i i got i i'm still smoking better than what most people are on any other day because good mids out here are great but you guys have been like you have the industry and the stuff and you have enough growers and operators that you can have a wide assortment of products so that the wide assortment of people that are purchasing the products can find what's right for them which is fantastic and then of course you always should have that type of top shelf product that's out there where you can have like the trophy cuts and then the best uh you know the stuff that was you know hand trimmed taken care of completely through the supply chain uh and you have a great chain of custody on it so the products like good weed that's been cured right tastes way better like way better yeah and it hits like the lungs it just it's breathing oxygen to me you know like some plant you can tell like it wasn't purged right and then but the good one some plants you can't purge that well because like if you're trying to grow in water uh or aeroponics it's more difficult to flush your plants now if you're growing a soil based like i'm kind of biased towards soil based growing because i like weed that tastes good and so if you want to make weed that tastes good show me weed that tastes good that wasn't grown in soil yeah and i think you have a great point with the uh we have such a variety of growers and stuff that you can find that one grower with a great price point in the the quality that you like and accept you know that and that's the thing like i've always thought like with legalization just make it legal and now for the market you have to require testing right and you know we all know like pesticides are bad and also other [ __ ] like i would rather have an organic like you know bugs being used for uh insecticides and all whatnot but the thing is if you you just get it tested and put it out there people will buy shitty weed shitty whatever quality product because people smoke cigarettes good things they're gonna look at the price and look at the thc yeah for the most part end of list now like i'm not gonna do that like i'm gonna like preferably i'm not gonna see a list of its thc or or even it's terp profile and i'm gonna i like to buy like that's 31 flavors you know it'd be great if you could taste them as well not necessarily can but i like to buy like you know where you get to see it and maybe smell it and so you can see it in the jar and be like man what is that one right there and then they'll tell you and you'll be like oh i haven't heard of that genetic can i can i give that a smell holy crap what the heck is the terp profile on that and then that's how i will get stuff and i'll find out it was only like 17 thc but it was an amazing experience that was a point break strength it was a good strength purpley and well flavored well grown well cured you know it was that's that's what buying weed should be where you can have this experience of like um smelling it asking like what you're trying to go for like why why are you using this cannabis like what's your activity for this because like that's the thing you know you can have cannabis for the activity you just don't have regular wheat i mean that was like 20 years ago you just have regular wheat but now you have weed for a particular activity for a particular flavor for a particular experience no no totally i mean that's the great thing about canvas but like and also uh like you're saying how it just uh the the profiles um and you know with that meme that i shared where the winky face hemp is not marijuana right so like i don't know if you saw the the the the most recent chronic taste test i did with josh right right i smoked my first hemp uh delta eight one and i felt really light-headed and really good like a good yeah chill buy which you know you would expect from cannabis right because it's not about the tc it's about the cannabinoids and the terpenes and because right after that we smoked some flour and that was the most horrible flour i ever had which i was kind of sad about like i never met a plant that i didn't like and it tasted like smoking a seed and like how is the hemp better than the the marijuana technically but in the end they're all cannabis and and and you know it was a great experience you're gonna have some really well-grown hemp flour there's some good there's some excellent growers and there's some excellent cure in so there's some great stuff and then they're spinning this d8 from like a lot of the uh um stock what do they call that biomass that was extracted by the cb for the cbd and then the leaders of cbd aren't moving so they turn it into a delta eight they spray the the tasty flowers and so those tasty flowers that might have been moving for like four hundred dollars a pound are now moving substantially higher than that and then not only that now you have delta eight flour which means you don't have to worry about these vape cartridges bands people can have an entourage effect with it and delta eight is not delta nine and i mean it's not you try it uh and you'll see it's just a more chill uh kind of an experience and so that you're gonna be blending it with a cbd flower that's uh i should buy some delta eight flour actually actually uh some of my clients should mail me some delta flour yeah i mean you know it doesn't have the same aromas and everything as as as weed but they're cousins and they're exactly the same plant they say they're exactly the same plant it's just that they're just different types of of the same plant and so like you would have like a class one which would be a thc cultivar and then you'd have a class three which would be your cbd cultivar and then there's even class fours now and there's probably more classes depending on the other lesser cannabinoids that they find out but you know hey that's one of the cool things that we're going to see here next year the 2022 farm bill i wonder what they're going to define hemp as in the future i don't know it's exciting times man i think this whole year this whole administration's going to be exciting here for everything yeah yeah and we just have to keep up the fight to uh educate the people that are running uh the the states where it's i mean it just sounds like it really disconnected i mean it sounds just completely cut off from reality when i hear these types of things coming out of nebraska or tennessee or florida like they don't even know what they're talking about disconnected yeah well it's the same people yelling about regular election so so they don't know what we're talking about hey uh if you guys want to give us some viewer mail that would be awesome and at the end of the show we like to go over some viewer mail questions so drop us a comment not necessarily in the live comments because there's like four million of those but then if you drop us a regular comment on a question or you can go to our uh community page and drop us a question there i might actually be able to oh there it is you can go to cannabis industry lawyer on instagram and drop us a question there or follow mickey on facebook actually facebook.com backslash freethc for all of miggy's uh memes the the dank cannabis memes it's it's two forms of dank memes it's dank dank memes on facebook that's sticky icky that's sticky me yeah yeah so male 1 free the plant said what strains are on your mount rushmore of wheat mine are blue dream grape vape green crap basically anything high in piney thank you for the show that one's top like you know that one is tough because uh there's florida purple sometimes branded as miami punch by revolution genetics uh that one is one of my favs um and then i i do really like revolution's geneticist i like point break as well uh and then i'm a sucker for a good og kush love those ones then um that's really it i mean that's those are the things that i really gravitate toward and then whatever else i might be growing you know yeah i hope to get some growth going on i need some seeds anybody um but yeah i like the uh i got familiar with blue dream during the medical times out here in washington like that was the one plant i could smoke and be like all right this blue dream because you know a lot of people have that that bud but i don't trust flavors and whatnot but that's the one that too hit me home as well as a dutch treat i really enjoy a good touch treat yeah i think i've had a dutch treat i mean i haven't had a blue dream in a while like i i just there was so much of it going around like 10 years ago and it's yeah don't get me wrong and i like blueberry i like blueberry muffins i like purple weed uh but that berry taste uh of the blue variety is just so like old school that now they have all these new flavors and i'm not talking like cereal milk or like you know peanut butter or anything like that with the chocolates not but uh the fruitiness of the flavors and and the the flavor effects that they have on it and like the colors and all these other things but man i just got like some really cool ak-47 that was like crossed up with something and that stuff just is is like a blast from the past like a really refreshing one like a fairly skunky um loud kind of old-school varietal yeah well and then this skymaster i'm smoking right now is pretty [ __ ] awesome yup what's oh i don't know uh maybe do some homework on that one um yeah they're gonna go on the back of the thing now that's the thing like there's so many hybrids and crosses that are out there it's kind of nice to know like where they came from but then you just go to the philos galaxy and spend like an hour there well again i'm just more about the farms and the growers like when i reached out to uh washington buck i reached out to three of my favorite growers uh washington but code trailblazing and uh mad mark and uh because i'm trying to put us me in a position where you know when you do a review you don't want to be obligated to anything cannabis related right so i'm trying to just promote the good we the good stuff you know without like making that my have to be part of my deal you know what i mean i don't know that helps watch any youtube channel progression as as they get more subscribers they sell out so well that you don't even notice and eventually every video is brought to you by squarespace sponsors squarespace totally is the best easiest way to make a website hey what you're searching for use uh nordvpn don't let them know where you're at oh my gosh do you think we get a vpn server or do you think that the the cat filter is just going to be off-putting they're like well i thought maybe we should sponsor that one uh podcast about cannabis policy but then i saw that that lawyer was a cat on there um we're a family company family like cats i am not above saying butt up bum bum at the end of this [ __ ] show though i'm just saying going right now i wish was not a sponsor but only because i i i don't need a picture you're

we've been doing this symposium this has always been one of the biggest topics that comes up in the audience Q&A and we've actually never done a formal talk on it before so we thought it was a high time that we go ahead and talk about this topic so thank you dr. Brice I have to say I'm a little relieved that I'm not going to be asked go or no go in terms of cannabis in the use of healthcare so thank you for the invitation to present today and I'd like to give each of you an overview of cannabis and let you come to your own conclusions of whether it's a go or no-go my goal this morning is to present some of the studies some of the risks and a little bit of the legislative aspects of it and let you decide if it's high time or not so marijuana what is it a plant originating in Central Asia a pharmaceutical agent a street drug a political battleground full credit all of the above yes exactly so this is a topic that generates lots of interesting conversation in my office I work in the Department of palliative medicine as dr. Bryce says so my role is really focusing on patients symptoms as they go through cancer care and some of those symptoms come from the disease some of those symptoms come from the treatment and it's a curious observation of mine to see patients are often reluctant to broach this question with their providers at Mayo Clinic and one of the points that I would like to underscore is that if this is part of your toolbox share it with your provider so that they know because like everything else that we're looking at we need to be mindful of the compounds that you're taking in whether it be the chemotherapy the nutrition like dr. North felt was talking about or a product like cannabis so be sure to be upfront with your providers about that so a little bit of the background what is it that we're talking about this morning marijuana is a product that comes from the cannabis plant and typically the plant that we're talking about is this one the cannabis sativa plant that was originally identified in Southeast Asia and it does have known psychomimetic properties but also has identified itself as having medicinal properties and that's really what we're interested in learning about and can those properties be maximized in the terms of your cancer care this is not a new conversation when we look back in the medical archives we see this conversation has been one that has gone back for millennia and has evolved slowly as other products have evolved cannabis is used globally for many people they use it recreationally we know that about 45% of high school seniors have dabbled with it in recreational use we know that about 20% of people use it globally for either recreational or medicinal uses yet it remains illegal in many countries all of us in this room are aware that this has become endorsed or at least legalized in state legislatures but continues to remain illegal from a federal standpoint one of the challenges that we as medical providers have in this conversation is brought about by this which is the Controlled Substances Act this was legislation that was passed on a federal level back in 1970 and at that time medications that were considered potentially harmful were classified in various schedules rated one through five five was considered relatively low risk but scheduled one was considered either the highest risk for addiction and/or showed no value in terms of medicinal benefit cannabis has been classified as a scheduled one substance and the reason that's important is that legally we cannot prescribe that people do get certifications but they don't get a prescription that you fill through a pharmacy more importantly from my standpoint is that as a scheduled one substance I need to either procure a specific license in order to study it or I'm precluded from doing so so I'd like to show you some of the studies that are available this morning but keep in mind these studies are very difficult to do they're very difficult to fund they're difficult to recruit for because of this scheduling designation by the Controlled Substances Act so a little humor along the way can you prescribe marijuana to help me with the boredom of sitting in your waiting room hopefully that doesn't happen at Mayo Clinic so one of the things I wanted clarify too is what are we talking about when we talk about cannabis use and I think for each of us depending on our own backgrounds see this as a different product is it a recreational drug is it something that is has a proclivity for addiction and we need to be cautious of is it a medicinal tool that might come into play in our armamentarium for cancer treatments and it's that latter one that I'd really like to talk about a little bit more detail cannabis is a botanical this is historically been recognized in a number of the products that we use so when we look at common use tools like morphine and aspirin these have all evolved from botanicals that have been identified and purified and used regularly and I think there's been a shift over the last ten years to kind of embrace this philosophy and how we manage multiple diseases and when we look at natural products does anybody recognize this plant so not every plant that we can identify is healthy so this of course is tobacco and we have recognized multiple risks associated with tobacco's so I think it's important that we do have a degree of skepticism when we look at these botanicals can they be beneficial but also like every prescription that I might provide you or any of our colleagues today what's the potential downsides of that also keeping in mind that with each of these products they fall outside of the purview of the Food and Drug Administration so there's no oversight in terms of purity or quality in the products that you might per cure from a dispensary so keep that in mind as a side note and part of one of the conversations that I have with my patients is use a healthy degree of skepticism not just in what I say but in products that are not screened for purity or quality this is a study that was published by our colleagues in Canada at the University of Guelph that looked at products that were identified as botanicals and they used DNA analysis to see does the product that is taken off the shelf contain what is advertised on the label and if so is it pure this was done with 44 products that were purchased both in the US and Canada and it's a little disturbing for me that 34 percent of the products contained none of the advertised ingredient that was on the label and about half of contained contaminants which may not seem like a concern except for those who have significant allergies such as nut or fish or perhaps a gluten intolerance so my point with sharing this with you is just use a degree of skepticism when you're purchasing these products or if you go to a dispensary and are getting information from one of the providers there so let's talk a little bit more about the plant and what it is that will be discussed if you choose to use this tool and visit a dispensary in the marijuana plant there are about 400 compounds a hundred of which are identified as cannabinoids the two products that are mentioned most frequently are the two that you seen here THC and CBD these are the products that are most prevalent in the plant and they're the compounds that are most biologically active in the plant THC has a propensity for more of the psychomimetic the high if you will CBD tends to have more qualities in terms of a pain reliever and also an anti-inflammatory when patients go into a dispensary and are looking at different products oftentimes they're given information about the ratio of THC to CBD or are looking for products that may be exclusively one of those two products I think that's reasonable but keep in mind purifying out the 400 other compounds is a challenge so you're probably getting some component of each well how does the cannabis products affect our body most of the time patients are now using these as oral preparations so there's a variety of edibles that people can purchase they can be taken in as gummy bears as teas as tinctures or oils and like most medications that I perscribed it takes about 45 minutes to an hour for that to be absorbed and have a physiologic effect and that effect may last for three to four hours it's not much of a departure from other things that that we utilize for patients who choose to inhale the product it can be taken in in two ways it can be either smoked where the plant is burnt or it can be vaporized so what does vaporization vaporization is where the plant is heated but not burned heated to the point that the products become aerosolized or become volatile and can be inhaled when you inhale the product the effect is much faster its absorbed directly into the bloodstream the clinical effect is within about 10 minutes oftentimes we caution people who may have a history of lung disease in avoid and definitely smoking because you're getting particulates from that so patients who have emphysema or COPD or a variety of other lung disease as we do caution against using the product that way cannabis is a fat-based compound so that characteristic allows it to be absorbed through the skin that's difficult to measure but for patients who use creams or topicals it will absorb through the skin over a period of hours so the one dog says is that grass yeah but I take it for medicinal purposes only so I'd like to show you just a sampling of studies and the way I have divided this is based on symptoms and as I present these studies you'll find a theme in these and the theme is this that the studies are very small and they're often difficult to kind of think gosh does that apply to me or not because they're done in groups that are close to cancer but not directly done consistently in cancer patients so there's a little bit of seeing if we can get that round peg in the square hole so let's go through these and I wanted to start out with pain this is that question that I get asked most oftenly and when we look at cannabis products this is an old study that was done in 1970 I'm going to make no reference to Terry Taylor but so this was a study that was done looking at volunteers who were using pain medications and trying to equate does cannabis compare to opioids in terms of pain relievers and what this author concluded is that in single doses 10 milligrams of THC is equivalent to about 60 milligrams of codeine or 20 milligrams of THC is about to be equivalent to a hundred and twenty milligrams of codeine now how do you put that into context on average if you were to smoke this if you were to take a joint of marijuana cigarette that contains about 8 to 10 milligrams of THC if we were to convert it to morphine which is kind of our prototype of opioid pain relievers it'd be about 8 milligrams of morphine so what does that mean the starting dose of morphine if I were to prescribe it comes as a 15 milligram tablet so this would be at about half a tablet of the lowest dose of morphine just to kind of give you a frame of reference this is where we may depart a little bit from oncology care and that's because many of these studies come from the University of California and San Francisco dr. Abrams up there is an integrative oncologist and has that specific license that you need to do scheduled one studies and he looked at a population of patients who had nerve pain specifically related to HIV nerve pain is probably the most challenging pain to control it's much harder to control from thence a cancer that might be pressing on another organ or a broken bone when you have damage to nerves it tends to be refractory to medication so it seems like a reasonable population to study so what dr. Abrams did was bring in patients who had previously used cannabis for recreational purposes and put them in a controlled environment and allowed them to use cannabis over a period of five days and quantified their pain in the medical world if we see pain go down by 30% that's a thumbs up that's a go if we can get your pain controlled by 30% then we're making some headway and what he found is patients who use cannabis had a significant improvement in their nerve related pain which then went back to normal when they stopped it this didn't seem to correlate with dose so he used two different doses 19 milligrams and 34 milligrams versus placebo curiously each of those groups showed some pain reduction the to cannabis doses were more effective but neither dose seem to be more potent than the other so it didn't seem to be directly related to dosage I put this up just as an incidence or a frequency that we see side effects and the reason I point this out is because as I look at each of the studies regard list of Wyatts used pain nausea appetite this side-effect profile seems to be repeated which is curious because when you look at the incidence some patients seem to have a higher risk of nausea or a higher risk of anxiety which is often why patients choose to use it and there appears to be a subset of the population that develops these specific side-effects we don't know why but it's a pattern that's pretty consistent across the variety of studies a question that I get asked often is gosh doc you know I'm taking this morphine or I'm taking this fentanyl my pain is still not great I can't do the things that I want the scenario that I find happens a lot I'm not sure why but it's usually my kids or my grandkids say I should try pot what do you think I'm not sure nobody seems to take full ownership of I'm thinking of trying it it's usually somebody my wife so anyway okay tell me what your grandson said but the question then comes up can I use cannabis along with my opioid insert whatever product you're taking so the group in California looked at this question can we combine cannabis with opioids and if so is it helpful is it conflicting what do we see and so what they looked at was the vaporized cannabis and this is one of the vaporization machines called a volcano so this is what the product that they used in this study and what they found was that in patients who were using opioids the addition of cannabis was synergistic meaning that one plus one didn't give us - one plus one gave us three there wasn't a change in the levels of opioids so it wasn't that it drove the morphine levels higher it seemed to be that by going through two different pathways to control pain there was an additive benefit without increased risk of side effects so that's reassuring to me these are very small studies but it doesn't raise any red flags that's good well what about nausea this is probably the indication that most people will tell me my grandson told me I should ask you about using cannabis so from the senior citizens really feeling my joints today me too as she holds me so oftentimes when people will reference cannabis studies and pot studies the one thing that I would caution you about as you google these or look on the Internet most of the studies that were comparing cannabis to see if it helps with cancer or chemo related nausea showed benefit but the caution is this what they compared it to was either placebo in other words nothing and of course cannabis was better or they compared it to the agents that we used a generation ago the agents that we know were not particularly effective for chemotherapy induced nausea so a lot of those studies are comparing apples and oranges so I would caution you against that the products that we use now have been compared in only one study and that's in this bar graph that I show you here which does cannabis help with nausea does zofran which some of you may be familiar with ondansetron control nausea is it better to use them in combination or placebo and what you can can see here from this graph is that the cannabis the zofran and the combination of the two were relatively equivalent across the board they were better than using nothing but none was sort of our out front go in dr. Northville terms none of them seem to be an outstanding choice so if people choose to use that that's not unreasonable it doesn't appear to be helpful if you're using other products that may have been prescribed by your doctor it's about the same so it's it's essentially a wash from when we compare it to the current nausea medications that the oncology team is using unfortunately that's the only clinical study that we have looking at nausea and cannabis the third area that I asked I see patients ask about is with appetite and again juniors coming in telling you he ate a whole bag of Doritos after he was smoking pot last night and you got to try this for your weight loss does that really does that really carry out one of the things that I would really import to you is that when you compare someone with cancer versus somebody who is going to university and they may both be using cannabis the process that's going on inside the body of that cancer patient is much different than a healthy person many of you there in the room already know that the impact of cannabis seems to be blunted in terms of regenerating appetite and regenerating intake of food so when we look at that if we try and study that this is a study that looked at around 250 patients that had a variety of cancers lung GI hematologic malignancies and they were given three options they were given the option of taking THC and CBD taking THC alone or they were given placebo nothing at all and then we measured did their appetite improve and did it improve their quality of life and what we found is that the impact of each of those products almost the same when measured in cancer patients I can tell you in my population when patients come in and have been using cannabis the feedback that I hear this is very anecdotal the feedback that I hear is that it may help with pain it might help with nausea there I can measure on one hand the number of patients who've told me it really helped them with their appetite and increase in food so it's disappointing particularly when patients have lost 30 or 40 pounds their family becomes increasingly concerned because clothes are loose people start to look ill family members or neighbors may start to ask how are you feeling and they're hoping to regenerate some of that appetite and it really has not matured to the point that we see that result so take-home points with regards to that as we don't see we see minimal effect with appetite and minimal effect on weight gain so let me shift just a little bit to some of the pragmatic aspects of using this product so in Arizona this was this law passed several years ago pipe just a hair of a margin 50.1 3% of the population voted to approve the use of cannabis as a medical product we were the 15th state to do so and it was implemented back in 2011 in this state you can qualify to get a medical marijuana card with any of the diagnosis you see listed there cancer glaucoma HIV ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease Hep C Crohn's and the rest that you can see most patients will qualify under the context of having a chronic symptom typically pain when you look at the state registry by far and away the vast majority of people procure a card based on having chronic pain so for patients who choose to pursue this they do have to go through the process which is done almost exclusively online all the forms are filled out online patients are asked to require to sign a consent saying that they will not divert the cannabis to anyone else in their family or friends they are allotted up to two and a half ounces every two weeks unless you live greater than 25 miles from a dispensary if that's the case then patients are allowed to grow their own plant and Arizona will recognize other states cards so for patients who travel from from California or another state that does have medical marijuana certifications Arizona does recognize those this does have to be renewed annually I don't remember the cost it used to be about a hundred and fifty dollars but that may have gone up like any compound that is taken in there are side effects we touched on that a little bit and you see those here in terms of dizziness confusion the curious side effect of nausea and anxiety some memory impairment and difficulty with concentration patients are cautioned against driving just as they would with any other compound that may affect reaction speed and for people who are looking at this literature there is some evidence that shows that there appears to be a higher risk of coronary events heart events so for patients who've had a history of heart disease or have had a recent heart attack that's something to be mindful of there's not a lot of clear cause and effect association but something to be mindful if that's applicable to you many people will think of cannabis and for those who have teenagers as I do that worry about is this a gateway drug is there risk of addiction becomes the forefront of their minds when we look at the risk of dependence it is there when you look at the studies from the federal government the National Institute against drug abuse and compared the incidence of addiction you'll see those listed there so the incidence of addiction to nicotine as around 32% heroin 2023 cocaine 17 alcohol 15 and marijuana is nine so curiously that is the lowest of the compounds that we often associate with other agents particularly with all the information that's in the news regarding opioids so kind of keep that in mind and this is that same data just in a different format so take-home points that I would like to leave with you today you know I will leave the thumbs up or thumbs down to each of you to think is this something that I want to have in my toolbox is it something that can complement what I'm using already just a note of caution that there is there is very limited oversight of that industry and the other caution that I would leave you with is that there is very little data looking at for patients who use cannabis particularly regularly how does it affect the blood levels of other compounds that you may be taking whether that be blood pressure medications diabetes medications or chemo therapies does it raise that level does it lower that level so always go in with a degree of caution because you can ask your physician is it safe and he or she does not have the data to answer that question so it is a let the buyer beware because we can't offer you great guidance on that but when we look at the data there does seem to be a role in terms of pain control in terms of nausea control but very little support that it may help with weight gain or appetite so for those of you who are research nerds like me here's some data that you can look at and I will be happy to be around later if you have any specific questions thanks so much [Applause]", "kH0H0CCH5Wg": "[Music] cannabis is consuming the sooner state as it appears oklahomans can't get enough of the stuff hundreds of thousands hold medical marijuana cards and cannabis dispensaries while they're popping up almost everywhere two works for you investigates and mason morrow outlines the fierce competition among dispensaries cashing in on the green gold rush i had no idea i don't think anybody could have foreseen the you know success of the program a budding billion dollar business once thought impossible in oklahoma the growth in the medical marijuana industry has really surpassed pretty much anyone's expectations approved for medical growing sale in 2018 the state and retailers anticipated 80 000 patient licenses in year one however in 2019 the oklahoma medical marijuana authority issued 190 thousand cards as of today it's issued almost 400 thousand and i don't see any indicators on my end that anything is about to slow down this blossoming industry generated 800 thousand dollars in sales in 2020. chip paul drafted state question 788 the law oklahomans voted for in 2018 to legalize medical cannabis he tells two works for you the marijuana market will surpass the 10-figure threshold this year we will absolutely have the best medical marijuana program in the country according to the omma over 2 000 dispensaries are licensed to sell in oklahoma more than any other state if you drive around town or anywhere in the state you're going to see a lot of dispensaries nationally moore and edmond rank in the top 10 among cities with most dispensaries per capita tulsa is 17th an opportunity two years ago now a cutthroat competition eventually at some point we're not all going to be here may the best group win terrace falanco opened seat cannabis company near 6th and peoria in february 2019 and seed just opened its third location three cannabis storefronts and a c of almost 500 in tulsa county we're not all going to survive so hopefully you know we hope to be one of the survivors like the buds they sell dispensaries come in all shapes and sizes seed here isn't the largest retailer in oklahoma but it has a strong foothold here in green country while here at harvest health in sand springs it's a family run dispensary they grow cultivate and sell their own cannabis all by themselves that's just what we're all about just very family-oriented company tony rodriguez his wife elena and son dalton opened the dispensary two years ago the trio raised the plants from soil to shelf while planters and tenders help the family operation has three flower rooms and that's half as many as the grower used by seed cannabis company the family's smaller scale can't match their larger competition so in order to stand out in the crowded cannabis industry rodriguez remembers why he joined the fray in the first place a close family member suffers seizures but cannabis tames the episodes we put her on that and it was just a huge change in her total demeanor his dispensary harvest health is an organic pharmacy its mission first and foremost to improve patients lives it's not about selling it it's about what the customer actually needs to help them overcome whatever deficiencies they have in life the profits while substantial come second to helping heal his clients chip paul with ok for you approve tells me he wrote legislation to allow for a free marketplace there's no cap on retailers and the cost to start is lower here than any other

"welcome back to the demystifying medicine youtube channel today we will be discussing cannabis and parkinson's disease parkinson's disease also known as pd is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder studies have tried to find a cause for pd either genetic or environmental but none have been confirmed the disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia negra which is an area of the brain responsible for movement this means that the cells in the brain that create dopamine are no longer doing so the death of these neurons causes loss of motor control because dopamine is important for relaying messages to plan muscle movements this leads to the motor symptoms of pd including tremors muscle rigidity and bradykinesia which means slowness of movement there are some non-motor symptoms of the disease as well including anxiety depression and trouble sleeping the risk of developing pd increases with age especially above the age of 60. the prevalence of pd in the us was 680 000 in 2010 and was projected to be 930 000 in 2020 with the prevalence of this disease continually increasing there's a need for new treatment options and cannabis could be a potential treatment for pd cannabis is a drug illicit in some parts of the world that has both psychoactive and therapeutic effects it is an umbrella term that is given to various preparations of the plant cannabis sativa and has other common names such as marijuana weed and pot cannabis contains many compounds known as cannabinoids cannabinoids are chemical substances that bind to cannabinoid receptors in the body this can be visualized as a key which is the cannabinoid fitting into a lock which is the receptor the most common cannabinoids present in cannabis are thc and cbd cannabinoids due to differences in their chemical properties can have varying effects in the body thc is accountable for the psychoactive effects of cannabis and produces the high sensation cbd works to control or reduce some of the psychoactive effects of thc such as anxiety specifically thc and cbd work in the endocannabinoid system in our body which affects different parts of the central nervous system along with cellular communication which is why changes in the system can be linked to parkinson's disease currently the most common medication prescribed for pd is levodopa also known as l-dopa when aldopa reaches the brain it is converted into dopamine and therefore compensates for the decrease in dopamine due to pd however research has shown that some patients fail to respond to treatment with l-dopa furthermore the drug has been associated with adverse side effects and motor complications over time including involuntary movements called dyskinesias in the last decade there has been an increased focus on investigating the therapeutic potential of cbd in treating neurodegenerative disorders such as pd most human clinical trials have been concentrated on the non-motor symptoms of the disease including anxiety depression and trouble sleeping with results indicating that cbd is successful in treating many of these symptoms although less research has focused on the effects of cbd on motor symptoms a 2004 study using a survey aimed to evaluate the experiences of parkinson's patients using cannabis to help treat their disease the results of this study showed that bradykinesia was the symptom most improved by cannabis followed by muscle rigidity and tremors research has focused on various pathways in which cbd could treat the motor symptoms of pd a 2014 study using a mouse model made it an important discovery regarding the gpr6 receptor gpr6 is a receptor that is predominantly expressed in the brain and is molecularly similar to the cannabinoid receptors this study showed that a deficiency of the gpr-6 receptor in a mouse model of parkinson's disease led to an increase in dopamine concentration in the brain furthermore it led to reduced dyskinesia caused by treatment with l-dopa although this has yet to be tested in humans mice are accurate and commonly used animal models for human disease using the results found in the study in 2017 a research team tested the effects of cannabinoids on the gpr6 receptor their results showed that cbd acts as an inverse agonist to the gpr6 receptor this means that cbd binds to gpr6 decreasing the activity of the receptor and therefore leading to an increase in dopamine this research has identified cbd as a potential therapy for treating the motor symptoms of pd without the negative side effects caused by aldoba although these findings are very promising more research needs to be done on the topic with more clinical trials to show the effects of cbd in humans with pd now that we've discussed the effects of cannabis in the body let's review physicians perspectives on treatment of pd with medical marijuana animal investigations support suggestions of improvement in bradykinesia and tremors but this is unsubstantiated in human studies some patients have reported that marijuana diminishes some motor non-motor cognitive and or mood symptoms of pd 18 studies investigated medical practitioners perspectives on this none of these studies presented results that outright rejected the clinical usefulness of medical cannabis in a separate study physicians were asked to indicate the degree to which the use of cannabis is evidence-based for various symptoms of pd 87 of physicians felt that the literature supported the use of cannabis for nausea 60 for anxiety and 86 for pain responses were divided with regard to motor symptoms in fact only 36 percent of physicians believed cannabis could help parkinson's patients with tremors and 35 for symptoms like dyskinesia researchers need to clarify the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy with cannabis products or medical marijuana will remain largely without scientific endorsement research has to document the full benefits risks and clinical applications of marijuana as a treatment for patients with pd medical practitioners attribute a self-perceived lack of knowledge as a significant barrier to approval a study conducted by edelstein at al revealed that 95 of participants had no formal education about medical marijuana 84.6 reported being unprepared to answer clients questions that were cannabis related medical practitioners also raised issues about the potential for recreational misuse diversion into illicit channels the risk of drug drug interactions driving under the influence of cannabis and the potential risks associated with uncontrolled supply finally rey's concern for the health of individual patients was mostly focused around psychiatric adverse effects more than 10 million people worldwide are living with pd and the incidence of parkinson's only increases with age when such a large portion of the population has an incurable disease it is essential that we explore every possible therapy to help improve their quality of life medical cannabis is a promising therapy for pd and requires further research to investigate its potential as a new and exciting treatment for the disease thank you so much for watching also remember

subject today as it comes up often in our team meetings and client sessions as well so i'm going to be talking about marijuana and cbd and discussing kind of the pros and cons benefit of harm for anxiety can i just i think let me see okay there we go did the slide move for you uh i think go ahead i just i'm not sure if it's the view we want but go ahead i think it should be fine okay sounds good so starting off i'll just kind of give a general landscape of anxiety as well as cannabis use in the states right now so anxiety disorder prevalence worldwide an estimated 284 million people have an anxiety disorder and by anxiety disorder and in general that means either generalized anxiety disorder gad panic disorder social anxiety disorder or a specific phobia so an estimated 31 of u.s adults experience one of these disorders in general at some time in their life and an estimated 19 percent of u.s adults have had one of these anxiety disorders in the past year not on that list is ptsd which used to be categorized as an anxiety disorder and certainly entails a lot of anxiety um but i mentioned that because there will be some tie-ins later especially in regards to cbd and some potential research around ptsd as well so we'll kind of have that in mind okay so here's the latest graph i could find in terms of where the u.s is at in terms of legalization and different programs using cannabis as you can see 36 states and four territories have now passed some kind of law legalizing cannabis this could this could include uh thc based cannabis or medical marijuana as that or cbd all of the above these 36 states 15 states and three territories have adopted laws legalizing marijuana or thc based cannabis for recreational use and this has really been increasing exponentially since about 2012. and you can kind of see looking at our country here how widespread is becoming and there's this real contrast at this point between what's still the case at the federal level which is essentially at least on the book scene viewing it as an illicit drug and what's the reality for the bulk of our country at this point in terms of using it medically in some form or even beyond that okay okay so i thought i'd start off just with kind of some uh vocabulary because even i get kind of confused with all the different terms and and what's what and that kind of thing so for viewers who maybe aren't too familiar the base of what we're talking about is the cannabis plant which has several different strains you know uh most often or the ones you'll hear about is cannabis sativa or cannabis indica and within that cannabis plant there's groups of different compounds uh chemical compounds and one of those groups of compounds is the cannabinoids and this is going to entail both the thc compound which is the well-known kind of psychoactive compound that leads to the different effects of intoxication you've heard of kind of etc a different group of compounds is the cannabidiol or cbd uh this is the most abundant uh cannabinoids uh compound group in hemp but it's also in you know the cannabis plant or cannabis uh sativa but it's non-psychoactive uh it doesn't lead towards the high or the different psychoactive properties that you might traditionally think of in marijuana so it's been extracted and it's similarized and used for different growing health purposes as we're going to talk about the term marijuana itself is probably you know maybe the most confusing here because it kind of means different things at different points marijuana can mean the same thing as just the cannabis plant you know the marijuana plant or more often it's probably used as meaning a thc based cannabis product you know marijuana something that has thc that's used and you're going to experience the psychoactive effect or kind of a high from it cbd can't make me high cbd can't make you high correct in general it shouldn't but as we'll kind of talk about it isn't a really important point actually that comes up is um how we don't really have the exact science and practice of ensuring the cbd purity and dosage so if you went to a common dispensary and bought cbd right now not knowing much about it if you don't really know how much thc might be in it uh some cbd products have a fair amount up to three four five percent of thc and then it's just labeled a cbd another one might have some minimal amount that's that's negligent has zero in it so part of the issue we're facing right now is exactly that we don't totally know exactly what contains what's in a very regulated trusting kind of way so cbd something labeled as a cbd product in general shouldn't contain at least too much thc that would have an effect but that's not something you never know so that's that's kind of an ongoing challenging question okay okay so let's take a look at uh cannabis use numbers in the states prevalence has been increasing along with that graph that showed legalization increasing prevalence of use has been increasing pretty steadily there's been a 45 increase from 2007 to 2014. more importantly is the increase in what's called heavy users these are individuals who would use cannabis daily or near daily that's kind of what we're going to talk about as a heavy user or beyond daily multiple times daily that's going from one and nine to over one in three from 1992 to 2014. so that's a big increase that means that the use among users within the use of users the bulk of cannabis consumption is increasingly becoming concentrated around a smaller number of heavy users more and more you know as time kind of progresses here maybe you're going to get to this later but um there's often been a distinction that when they talk about a reliance or addiction is that there's a difference between the daily user and the recreational user uh in terms of impact um and i don't know if you're getting to that later or okay yeah absolutely most of these kind of real serious impacts we're going to talk about are going to be connected to this general term heavy user like you're saying in that frequency of use yeah which ties right into the the next point here which is that quote-unquote self-medication or using cannabis in a way that's beyond infrequent recreational and is used in a way to regulate or modify your mood or your affect habitually and this kind of thing using cannabis or marijuana in that way in states with legalization uh among individuals with anxiety and move disorders is the highest so what that means is in states like mine in california the rates of people who are using marijuana in a way that's self-medicating habitually is higher than states that don't have this legalization status quite yet you can you know i guess about different reasons why that might be there's certainly the proliferation of the legalization happening there's dispensaries popping up all over the point all over the place there's even delivery points that can knock on your door and kind of deliver your your cannabis and that kind of way without even having to go out or drive or go anywhere there's shifting public perceptions around it it's increasingly seen as less stigmatized as having more of a therapeutic value it's an all-natural uh means towards you know health so to speak is kind of what the perceptions are shifting towards and there's reasons they're shifting in that direction but the reasons aren't necessarily based off the research we have available yet so there's something going on there that we can kind of dive into a little bit okay let's see okay here's an example so this is i just did a screen grab off of a common uh cannabis dispensary website and this is the kind of marketing that you'll be likely to find pretty easily related to thc based cannabis at this point this one kind of says conquer your social anxiety and you can see six different products of marijuana on the bottom there that they're kind of advertising as being the helpful therapeutic ones for social anxiety so there's this marketing and social shift towards really viewing this thing as you know kind of you know micromanaging your high and using this for social anxiety and this for insomnia anxiety and this you know this product's gonna be for that and this is kind of the uh social and commercial atmosphere that's happening and has been happening you know for a while now that we're going to see is kind of way over here but in contrast to the actual research which is still kind of way back here so this is just kind of give a sense of what people are actually seeing you know what they're looking at when they're buying their products and the way they're thinking about uh using cannabis before they're coming into your office or kind of on their own this is kind of the this is kind of the focus out there right now okay so as we know cannabis use is increasing and more and more people are using marijuana and cbd to help with their anxiety symptoms so let's look at some numbers around this anxiety ranks among the top five medical symptoms that north americans report using medical marijuana for a big study in 2019 found that more than half of u.s adults receive cannabis as having a medical use xthc and cbd here's here's the important one though results show that approximately 29 to 30 percent of thc marijuana consumption was used to reduce stress and anxiety so something something's big is going on there that the thc this is marijuana being used that frequently for the number one reason stress or anxiety participants reported using cbd to replace medications to reduce pain there is evidence supporting that stress and anxiety and for better sleep and thc again was used most to reduce uh stress and anxiety and isn't anxiety one of the ones on the list for medical marijuana approval kind of well i'm going to go into in a little bit more detail okay go ahead yeah i'm sure i'll get there but at this point no not you know evidence at least thc based uh marijuana not really indicated you know as having a lot of research to back it up okay so this is kind of a surprising result like as you're asking because this marijuana has gained this kind of widespread approval and a lot of people think that as a treatment for mental health conditions and it's been legalized uh for many therapeutic uses you know pain relief you know these kind of things nausea uh different diseases but the research isn't there in terms of anxiety you know and stress but it's being used in this way so what's going on so what does the research actually show like you're asking should i be using marijuana that again this is thc based cannabis products for my anxiety at this point scientific data does indicate the potential therapeutic value of or i'm sorry does one second my screen got locked here that should say um it is up there okay yeah so scientific data does indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid drugs primarily thc for several things pain relief control of nausea and vomiting and that being correlated in different kind of diseases and these kind of things and appetite stimulation you know especially in patients who might be undergoing chemotherapy or these kind of things can be very helpful for these things however a recent comprehensive review did not identify any really good quality literature that reported cannabis as an effective treatment for anxiety symptoms again that's thc-based cannabis beyond that frequency of use is associated with increased anxiety symptoms and future incidents of some problems in particular social anxiety disorder being one of them and we'll look at some more examples of this okay so despite the state of this research the public clearly reports using cannabis to reduce anxiety and it's increasingly viewed as an adaptive way to cope so why might this be one big reason is that low doses of thc do reportedly engender anti-anxiety effects you know this does happen out there this is you do see this and like you're saying a lot of people are going to report this and it's true low doses are going to probably in some most people sometimes uh reduce anxiety and offer kind of a relaxing effect however you as i'm sure everyone kind of knows you got to be careful because higher doses will do the exact opposite and they can often very commonly lead to increased anxiety panic um paranoia kind of feeling why um many people who i might meet with who described their first panic attack you know kind of describe something like this of having too much thc or being dehydrated and using thc and these kind of things so there's kind of this paradox with it where low dosage will probably be relaxing but higher doses are going to really totally do the opposite more importantly than that is that heavy use and chronic use like those heavy users we were talking about who use daily every other daily especially to regulate mood and affect it's going to build up in their system and there's going to be a sort of a dependence that happens where when they stop using or when they're no longer in taking thc there's likely going to be some withdrawal symptoms there's going to be anxiety altered appetite or sleep there's likely going to be irritability or kind of an irritable mood and irritable depression that can kind of develop and these are going to be very uncomfortable things and if the very reason that they were using thc was to kind of modulate some of those aversive feelings here they are coming back tenfold when they stop using what's going to happen further use so they're going to get caught in this cycle of kind of using it but it could become self-perpetuating of these very issues that they were looking to find help with around it so this is kind of partially what explains kind of this discrepancy between what the research shows and why it's so often viewed as a way of helping anxiety because a person might go through a particular night you know or moment and use it in a way that truly brought their anxiety down or they will they were able to cope with the social situation and they got through it by using it that way but there was kind of the devil in disguise there and that they were actually not ultimately helping themselves through something like an anxiety disorder by using it that way it was actually exacerbating the problem a lot of my clients say i i had my social anxiety but this helps me get out the door and helps me be social um and uh and so what's wrong with that right if i can't you know get out with without it what what should i do what am i supposed to do bingo and they're probably right at the outset that it does help them to get out the door right i mean it probably does kind of shift their mood or affect their physiology or thinking and they're able to get out the door that day by using thc using marijuana but is the disorder is the social anxiety decreasing over the long run in the course of their life or is what's actually happening is they're using it temporarily in that way but perpetuating the need for further use of it in that way and missing out on the opportunity to do something different which is of course what we do you know in developing skills like in cognitive behavioral therapy and finding alternative ways of identifying and altering and facing that fear in a way to truly tolerate it you know and overcome it they're kind of staying in the same place by using it to get out the door that way have you ever thought it can be combined in some way to to meet the needs well i think when it comes to thc probably not but as i'm going to get to there's potential too early to say but maybe you know using uh some combination with cbd might be effective more effective as kind of a combination i'll talk about that more in a bit but i wouldn't recommend it in terms of thc based cannabis products okay so we're kind of this is good because we're kind of already talking about this but this is um these are just some screen shots of a twitter feed i was randomly uh scrolling through at some hour of the night this week and uh the thread was around uh anxiety and cannabis and this just kind of shows some of the at times humorous but uh kind of perspectives of how people are thinking about cannabis use for anxiety so this one person says indica makes me so tired that i don't get anything done and that gives me more anxiety or another person wrote i prefer sativas so i can blame my anxiety on the weed instead of myself or another person wrote just like you said sativa is the only thing that gets me out of bed and allows me to talk to people without fear this person says oddly enough i have an anxiety disorder but indicas make me more paranoid so i prefer sativas is that weird question mark so these kind of show a couple points to me on the one hand it kind of shows that in terms of someone who wants to say is you know sativa the good thing for my anxiety is indica the good thing for my anxiety what's the right way to you know take it what's the good one uh there's no real answer you know someone might tell you there is but depending on the person the situation other compounds involved in whatever the product they're taking there's not anything close to a scientifically based answer to the rights weed for you in any particular moment or situation and the other one it kind of shows up people are thinking about it though this kind of is like yeah this is that research we saw that people are perceiving thc perceiving cannabis in this way that they can kind of fine-tune and is going to be helpful for their anxiety but again we're kind of recognizing the problems and challenges with that kind of uh approach to it here okay so we'll go from twitter to this more academic theory based model here this is by um buckner and his colleagues and what this is is just kind of a little bit more detailed and nuanced theory around this general idea of self-medication so this is a model for people with social anxiety disorder you know what the motivation for cannabis use or substance use you know would be so for example one person might want to smoke to get out the door to be able to socialize and there might be multiple layers of that they might be having many thoughts before they walk out the door of how am i going to look am i going to be judged is something bad going to happen am i going to know what to say in this social interaction am i going to get rejected they're flooded with these negative aversive anticipatory thoughts so by smoking or using the thc before walking out the door what happens to those evaluation fears they're just kind of able to be numbed out who cares yeah yes i don't have to think about that anymore and that's what it's doing or maybe the person's starting to feel incredibly nauseous or their stomach's becoming upset because of the anxiety before walking out the door so what does smokey do oh it calms their digestive system so they're managing their physiological arousal in that moment before walking out the door perhaps is to avoid social evaluation or some kind of negative social judgment oh everybody else is you know doing it so i'm going to avoid any negative social evaluation they might facilitate their social confidence in some kind of way or might just increase positive affect so there's multiple layers and if you're working with someone or even you know someone kind of learning this for themselves you want to think about in detail what's the function of this use for me without any pressure or judgment around it starting to think and observe how and why and what function is this serving or multiple functions does the serve in a particular kind of way and do i want to set myself up to create a dependence on this substance to manage this component here or you know if i want to find i'm involved in you know treatment or therapy or find help on your own or self-help it's like how can i know these functions and look to develop alternative skills to manage these evaluation fears manage that fear of judgment manage my physiological arousal what other pathways of targeting these components can you find for yourself and that's god that's kind of how i would um you know approach someone with this challenge here okay so in summary regarding uh thc danger is about over utilization particularly in heavy users for coping motivated cannabis use that's kind of would be my main thing to focus on take away from it the dangers they can create would be leading towards like i was just talking about to psychological dependence it's going to interfere with the possible learning that could happen by not using it and learning how to cope with those feelings and get out the door anyway which ultimately over the long run is going to maintain the symptoms of anxiety i can exacerbate the symptoms over time like we're saying through just maintaining the course of the disorder and even exacerbating physiological kind of withdrawal symptoms uh could potentially lead towards greater reliance on the substance or even an overt substance use disorder and there's especially high risk around chronic use in adolescence there's no reason are you going to say more about that um i i see a lot of that in my practice and and they're they're smoking alone and often to go to sleep uh or at the end of the day rather than in the socially anxious kind of situations of going out there it's kind of isolated uh alone um use yeah yeah especially if there's an adolescent who's in this kind of high you know high use you know daily to every other or or more then there's even some more recent research about how how dangerous kind of the long-term associations are with that things like depression earlier onset of psychotic symptoms these are the things that are being linked to intense adolescent use you know this is the time where the brain is still developing during adolescence and using thc with that frequency around that time is going to alter the wiring it can even impact uh there's some studies that can even impact iq scores you know permanently using it frequently around adolescents so if there's one thing to highlight to be wary of and intervene and trying to find alternative coping methods for it would be you know that kind of use in an adolescent [Music] okay so not necessarily encouraging therapeutic news for cannabis when it comes to thc based products but certainly some understanding of the nuances of it of how it works and the dangers of it to be aware of how about cannabidiol how about cbd what does the research show can i should i can i be using cbd for my anxiety well as terms of right now you know that same comprehensive review found limited evidence that cbd is effective for anxiety symptoms however in terms of this study limited is something uh it's these are kind of stringent uh terms that they use to define it basically it means that it's just it's brand new you know the research is picking up the past couple years but it's still really in its infancy and it's not grown to the point of having firm recommended proven recommendations for it for anxiety at this time that being said let's look into a little bit more detail on what some of these very initial studies and the directions you know they might point us in here and again we're talking about cbd so this is now the non-psychoactive compounds of hemp or of cannabis not the products that are going to be giving any kind of high shouldn't be at least that's kind of what we're talking about now okay so starting off there is this one study that showed cbd was shown to reduce acute anxiety assessed by a public speaking test in patients with social anxiety disorder so what happened was there was a you know group of patients who had social anxiety and they were kind of impromptu giving this performance task of giving a public speaking activity which of course would induce anxiety you know for people who had social anxiety disorder and the group that was given cbd right before acutely uh was shown to report that had an anxiolytic effect an anti-anxiety effect they reported less stress less anxiety giving that public speaking test versus the people with social anxiety who didn't uh receive the cbd who received a placebo so this is kind of the these were kind of some of the initial studies of what they're showing that acute administration at least initially it does lead towards kind of the subjective reduction in anticipatory or performance anxiety regarding at least most of them are around social anxiety it's an example of anxiety but it's kind of showing this overall anti-anxiety acute effect that it will kind of play and there's a couple of studies showing that you know at this point so that's interesting let's let's say these are going to continue and you know the evidence is going to build around it and we're going to kind of find that maybe cbd does offer this calming acute effect and that's something that's interesting but even with that i would say there's a difference we want to be aware of between uh what's helpful with reducing acute anxiety and what's actually helpful with something like social anxiety disorder the course of the disorder so we you know we want to think about everything in context you know in cbt we're always looking at what are you know what really needs to change whether what are the maintaining variables that are contributing to this disorder being maintained over time and one of them is typically avoidance avoidance of feeling anxiety avoidance of feeling anxiety and social interaction situations and again if we're taking something to reduce that anxiety every time habitually then we're still not going to necessarily develop the skills or shift in thinking or coping confidence that's going to actually relieve something like the whole disorder over time so it's interesting but we want to be kind of careful at that just based off the off of these i'd say you know if you're have something every now and again like a speech or a presentation or something like that and uh cbd is used every every now and then to kind of reduce it or perhaps if it was for anxiety around falling asleep if you used it once a month or you know periodically like that and it did have that calming effect for you then that might make sense but on the other hand the same i would argue the same principle applies that falling into using this habitually this is what i'm relying on to feel less anxious and without that those fears of mine are still just as real you're not going to tackle what really needs to be tackled to overcome you know something like a social anxiety disorder or a panic disorder or something like that but if it lets me get to the party doesn't it kind of wear off and i still have to use my skills once it wears off probably you will still have to use your skills once it wears off yes i would imagine you'll feel your anxiety will jump right when you notice it's starting to wear off and uh that might be a challenging scenario so yes it is good that it gets you to the party and that might be an interesting way of potentially using it you know if we were working with someone individually and that's kind of how we conceptualized and planned for it and the commitment was to still be there and use your skills or have an exposure to do something at the party uh perhaps it's better to get to the party with uh in that way without other than kind of not getting there at all you know if you can test it out and it would still be productive by the end of the night uh possibly possibly uh but on the other hand if we always need cbd and there's no growth beyond that if it stays like that then probably not but if it's in the service of building that exposure and confidence and eventually you commit and don't need it to get to the party then yeah maybe that would be a potential you know you could kind of work out with i'd want it to be in a very individualized kind of plan you know doing that with someone but possibly possibly okay good so this was another study a little bit different this study looked at adolescence adolescents 18 to 19 year olds in japan who had social anxiety and this was different from those other studies because this actually was over the course of four weeks and the individuals with social anxiety were just taking uh the milligrams don't get don't have the exact dosage off the top of my head right now just once per day over the course of four weeks compared to individuals with social anxiety who didn't take the cbd and you can kind of see these are two different uh social anxiety scales the two graphs and you can see on the one on the left the blue uh bars uh you can see the individuals who are taking cbd once per day reported a significantly decreased symptomology of social anxiety over the course of those four weeks same with the different social anxiety the level with social anxiety scale on the right individuals taking cbd once per day reported less overall social anxiety over the course of those four weeks so this is a little bit more interesting because it's not necessarily just taking it in that acute moment of performance or anxiety it's taking that's kind of overall a little bit more chronically which is encouraging that it's kind of showing these results but they're still no long-term follow-up on the study beyond those four weeks so we don't really know what happens continuing after that or if the cbd use stopped you know what happened from there so it's still kind of an initial study but interesting and good in the fact that it was more a little bit more of a chronic kind of use you know versus more acute use okay so here's some other interesting studies with cbd there's some initial evidence that cbd can enhance what's called extinction learning which means it might serve like you're asking about and we're kind of hinting at here in the future it might turn out to serve as a potential adjunct to behavioral therapies exposure therapies like what happens in cvt or behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders so what this kind of means is that using adding cbd to a behavioral kind of relearning process for example say someone was afraid of heights and in order to conquer their fear of heights they wanted to try to extinguish or create extinction learning around that fear or that conditioned stimulus so what they're going to do is we're going to expose to frequent and prolonged situations that involved kind of a progressive facing of fear of heights scenarios and what this study kind of demonstrated is that doing something like that but administering cbd even after some of that extinction learning had occurred so after those exposures had kind of shifted some learning that enhanced how strong that extinction learning progressed so what that means is that enhanced uh someone's ability to feel diminished anxiety around purifieds as an analogy but a situation like that this enhanced the learning to say that doesn't have to be as much of a threat for me and that's over the course of time you know that's kind of more uh longer term so this is really where i get interested in the potential of it because it might be able to find a way we don't know exactly the timing or the dosage or how yet but there might be ways of being able to enhance already proven evidence-based strategies to habituate to fearful scenarios or whether it's kind of a phobia or whether it's something like a trauma from the past connecting it back to ptsd there might be something there that helps reorganize the memory or in the learning or enhance it in ways to start to feel less less of a threat response to these built up fearful scenarios that people experience so this another study kind of showed a similar thing cbd may help produce an enduring reduction in learned fear expression when given strategically along with behavioral treatment so it's very initial a very it's very early on but there's could be this helpful contributory effect that cbd might play along with something like traditional behavioral exposure strategies to decrease fear expression to things like fear of social scenarios or feared past traumas or fear phobias or we might be able to find these areas where we can apply this and the benefits of it you need to learn more about exactly how but the benefits of really might help in the future to develop stronger treatments you know in terms of um other proven behavioral treatments for anxiety disorders so these are these are kind of the fascinating studies for me about the potential of this and if we can get this the studies going further and further where this might uh you know more nuance it and get some actual guidelines of direction what this actually might look like um these are these are kind of the exciting parts of it from from what i'm seeing here okay so let's kind of summarize a little bit the picture with cbd most current studies again still examine more acute single cbd dosing and healthy subjects so further studies are required to establish whether chronic dosing of cbd has similar effects well we still need to get more studies around that but overall you know the summary reviews really emphasize the potential value of cbd and treating anxiety disorders but i need to add to that we're nowhere near knowing exactly you know how when and having a protocol for it so there's need for further study of cbd in the treatment of anxiety disorders and what really needs to happen is we need to develop and standardize dosing studies to inform you know what the dosing strategy is going to be exactly which means how much when for which disorder and which situation for which patients etc again we don't still really have a clear way of determining the purity of cbd you know that we know we're getting cbd and the right one and the right dosage it's like we need to have ways of straightening that out but if we can kind of move in that direction um we'll be able to determine you know what cbd's place as an alternative as an alternative or again supplemental therapy of other evidence-based approaches like seaweed like cbt so it'll be interesting and fascinating to keep a watch and see how this uh this research and the subject progresses here okay so again here's my information and if there's any of course follow-up questions uh feel free to get in contact with me and i'll be happy to share what i know and what i learn more in the future uh dr young a number of people talk about using cbd for sleep and even ask about giving their kids a cpd for sleep what do we know about it helping sleep which is commonly going on with anxiety yeah depression well i think what the studies are kind of showing is that it does offer some of that's probably uh the only the only reference would be some of that acute anti-anxiety effect so if anxiety is the thing getting in the way of the sleep or falling asleep then it very well could offer kind of a short-term benefit of decreasing that anxiety which might allow someone to fall asleep you know easier but i'd offer the same cautions with it that using it in that kind of way um it might be better than you know the other prescribed sleep medications out there in the sense that i might have less side effects or potential for you know tolerance or addiction or other kinds of things but it still might not get to the heart of what you need for enduring skills and strategies or get to the heart of the problem for you know what's kind of driving the insomnia so it might help in the short term but i wouldn't recommend using it habitually at this point still or coming to rely on it or use it as a substitute for other great treatments that are still available out there to use that you know between cbt and mindfulness-based approaches and sleep hygiene and i would go to these places first you know certainly to try and develop that um in terms of children i wouldn't recommend that now i think there was like one one anecdotal uh study i found around using cbd for insomnia and a 10 year old but uh the studies are just kind of nowhere near frequent enough to kind of recommend around that for someone you know at that age certainly so i would i would stay away from that and if i find marijuana helpful for me how can i help getting not get dependent on it well when it comes to thc you know marijuana using it in that way do your best as soon as you can to kind of start to do what i was talking about earlier start to really look at and understand the function of use that it might be serving for you and if it's going down that road of leading towards kind of the quote-unquote self-medication or using it to modulate affect or anxiety or these other kinds of things then it's going to quickly go in a direction that's going to exacerbate the problem so i would recommend as soon as you can you know becoming aware of that you know trying your best to only use it in ways that aren't fulfilling that function so you know if you're using it recreationally or to relax or enjoy or whatever it is sporadically then that's another thing but i would recommend trying to alter the function of the use or if that's a real challenge to do and you kind of find yourself lacking the skills or ability to kind of do that on your own that would be the point in time where i'd recommend kind of reaching out for help whatever that's going to look like for you you know social help or friend help or therapeutic help that's the time to really say wait i can there are other skills and proven strategies i can develop to learn how to get out the door or to regulate this feeling or to cope with this situation let me try and explore those sooner rather than later before the self-fulfilled increased problems develop over using thc in that kind of way so that would be you know that'd be what i'd recommend for it and i know everyone's different but if i'm a parent and i know that my uh adolescent or young adult is kind of using daily and and using as i said alone what what sir what does that usually serve in your ex in your clinical experience um when you know when uh when there's daily use but it's really kind of solitary and and not when facing you know anxiety provoking or difficult situations yeah it it might not be related to a function of use for anxiety in that situation it might be probably not a social anxiety or something like that maybe they're just kind of using it on their own to regulate their mood you know or their affect or they're trying to regulate you know perhaps a depression by increasing that positive affect or that numbness or whatever that's coming along with it that would be the questions i would probably see as likelier to look into so you'd want to kind of formulate and kind of dive into you know trying to individually find the answer to that question with each person with each client i stay away from blankets kind of assumptions of why it's happening right try and dive into the details of what the actual thoughts and motivation and what it's actually doing it's a great question that's what we exactly need to find out for every person we're talking to is specifically what it's doing is it's shifting is it numbness is it shifting mood is it avoiding something that's all great helpful information to start to understand and and try and work with to find more helpful avenues to meet that need and one more question of um do you know anything about taking cbd along with other medicines not much research i'm aware of on that too much other than i know other than it can potentially interfere with some things but not that i've seen as being too much yet in terms of major red flags with it but it's i don't think the research is available that i know of or that i've seen to really give a strong answer i'd still be careful you know for sure taking other prescription medications or psychotropic medications i would certainly talk to my psychiatrist around it and not just start taking it that kind of thing potentially but um i'm not too aware of specific you know research on it well thank you dr elin this has been very helpful is there anything else you wanted to add before we finish up in addition to your presentation uh no that's it just to be excited to keep an eye on the research but to remain patient as the gap between the legality and the social scene of it uh is much farther ahead of the research right now so just to be aware of that gap and to be skeptical and patient before we catch up to actual real you know kind of recommendations for this but to be excited about cbd and the potentials at the same time well thank you very much thank you my pleasure", "u9FL4mIM6jU": "dr lim is an internal medicine

providing free comprehensive assessments for medical cannabis dr lem welcome and i will pass it over to you now um i don't think you're oh your video is on now wonderful can uh i hope everyone can hear me thank you for that uh wonderful introduction alana it's my pleasure to be here um it was very comprehensive that's uh the introduction i'm not sure how much else i need to see but um just to reiterate i am an internal medicine specialist and i am very interested in the medical cannabis space um one of the reasons um that i got involved with this with this area was because i had my patients um or i explored the the cannabis uh with my patients and found that there was some profound benefits but there was a big lack of data and so the clinics um that i have worked and founded um with is a multi-disciplinary clinic and we are data-driven so our goals are to look at the data to collect the data and to better understand what cannabis can be used for and that's what i'm hoping to share with you today because parkinso disease is one of those diseases that there isn't just one thing that parkinson's patients suffer from there's a host of things and the current standard of treatment isn't if i could be honest and frank isn't great um and so um a lot of patients are seeking um other alternatives and that's what i'm hoping to be able to share and shed some light into uh today because i think cannabis does have a role okay so um as uh a summary of what we're going to talk about um we'll talk about a general overview of some parkinson's theory uh we'll look at the cannabis uh overview and then we'll go to some frequently asked questions okay so uh parkinson's disease right and so um when you look at the causes of parkinson's disease this is just a summary for what i think many of the attendees here probably already know there is things like um you know there's a genetic component to it um like michael j fox there's environmental causes you know listed here some pesticides and carbon monoxide there's this very interesting um thought that's going out right now about this gut brain connection whereby a lot of the gut microbiome actually causes influence to our mind and how we think and it can lead to some um to some changes that cause parkinsonian like uh symptoms then there are you know risk factors like age and a family history males are more likely to get parkinson's than females environmental exposures and then essentially what happens in parkinson's is that you get this breakdown of the nerve cells um and it's mostly the dopamine releasing nerve cells which is why things like the the standard of treatment is like cinnamon or carbidopa which tries to replace the the dopamine and the idea is that some of the symptoms of parkinson's and you'll see as we go through the theory that not all of them can be explained with just dopamine-releasing cells which is why that cinnamon only addresses some of the symptoms of parkinson's so this was a theory that was proposed that i really really liked and it talks about parkinson in stages um and so most people don't re most people when they think about parkinson's disease they think of you know things like the cardinal symptoms which is the bretokinesia which is a slowing of the movements you know or the pill rolling tremor um or they look a bit flat in terms of how they look right or they start tripping um but that you'll see here actually is kind of a later uh a later stage usually in the stage three right so but parkinson's disease may start as early as stage one and this is why i like this because there are subtle features of parkinson's that may um that may be um present before what people think like ah you must have parkinson's or they they start noticing the pill rolling tremor and that's when people start screening for it so when you look at it you know the in the first steps of parkinson's um or the first stage you lose things that are more non-specific so you get less spell you get things like you get constipated and that's as you go up from the brain stem up to the higher levels of the brain okay so just to give everyone here an idea or a review this this is our brain here and you'll see that um the lower parts of the brain are what's called the the more rudimentary parts this is like for you know your breathing center um and what differentiates us as humans is more the upper brain which is our complex thinking and our critical thinking so this stuff down here in the brain stem you know the the green and the whatever stage one it's sort of a yellow green um that's sort of the the primitive centers in our brain okay and so that's where you get things like constipation and smell and then as you move up you start to affect some of the substantia [ __ ] which is um which is where you usually um cause problems um and that's when you start getting symptoms like okay you get these odd pains that really you know you really can't necessarily pinpoint you get some mood just mood issues um fluctuating mood this is where people start noticing sleep right and so sleep is is um one of the things that's really affected in in patients with parkinson's right and you'll see here that you can imagine that when patients present in stage one or stage two it's rather difficult to say that yeah this person has uh parkinson's because these could be from lots of different things right sinus issues poor sleep could be from stress you know mood can also be from stress so it's not until you get to stage three that people start noticing things like okay you're moving slowly you're getting more rigid you're getting some freezing and then that's when you get the pill rolling tremor and then when you look back you start seeing that oh yeah i had all these other symptoms too but what's interesting also is that parkinson's doesn't stop at stage three right and so as you move up into stage four stage five stage six you start affecting other things that actually become more significant right so as you move up you get more emotional problems that's when you start getting more long-term problems and as you can follow this arrow up the brain as it goes up higher and higher you start getting more and more of the um of the areas in the brain uh that makes us unique as humans okay so the critical thinking the memory um the planning the executive planning and so this is parkinson's and i think it's really nice um overview um so just as a very general review all that i really wanted to show here was these are the cardinal symptoms of parkinson's these are like what people think of as classic but this is not all that parkinson patients deal with right because there's a lot of mood issues in parkinson's patients that may go under appreciated there's psychotic uh things that people can start to hallucinate and then there's cognitive like the dysfunction of thinking fatigue is a big thing you know we don't treat very well sleep disturbance is also probably related to fatigue and all of this is just trying to say that if we look at parkinson's we have to look beyond the pill rolling tremor or just the tremor we have to look beyond that we have to look beyond just the rigidity because there's so much more in terms of what affects our park a patient who deals with parkinson's um their quality of life what affects their quality of life pain is also a big one and so here more features you know you can look at them i'm sure that uh for the guests here or the attendees here who suffer from parkinson's they don't necessarily need to read this list because it's something that they already experience in their lives or in the lives of their loved ones so now let's go to uh cannabis so very briefly let's just talk about what like cannabis overview okay so cannabis is a plant this is a plant um there's two different types there's actually three different types of cannabis there's sativa indica and rudoralis root oralis doesn't really have any medicinal properties so i've left it out for the most part in the can sativa are more historical the way that canada has been growing because most of our products are hybrids and it just you know for the most part with the only thing i want to tell you about sativa and indica because you will experience this or you will come across this if you are looking at cannabis treatment is that the cbd or the thc okay which are your cannabinoids that you find in sativa and indica are exactly the same so that was one thing that i never quite realized when i first got into this into this field which is you know cbd if you get it from sativa sativa or cbd if you get it from indica is exactly the same same with the thc they're chemically the same what differs in the sativa and in the indica plants are mostly the terpenes okay which i'll talk about and the minor cannabinoids okay so um cannabinoids are these unique molecules um they're actually not necessarily only found in cannabis they can be found in other plants but for the most part they're found in cannabis um that that um affect the the the host usually through the endocannabinoid system cbd thc are the most predominant of the cannabinoids okay terpenes um are these other uh molecules that are found within the cannabis plant that essentially gives it the fragrance so you know when you smell the cannabis you can smell that's the terpenes but they also have medicinal properties um and in actual fact um terpenes are usually from other plants okay so like spices have terpenes like parsley has terpene and then they've just bred into the cannabis um out in the wild okay but again the only thing i want to mention here is terpenes by themselves have a have medicinal properties and when you combine terpenes with the cannabinoids there's some thought that they may act more synergistically together all right so how can you these are the these are the ways that you can take cannabis i'm going to talk about how cannabis can be used in parkinson's but just generally how can you take what are the methods of consumption or modes of consumption so you know the most common that most people think of is smoking okay this in our clinic is the least favored why is it the least favorite a it's hard to control what you actually get because you're smoking the entire joint for instance um and you may be trading a benefit for uh a long-term um side effect or not a long-term side effect but a long-term problem okay so like why would you get pain control and then get lung problems like why why do that when there's another way to take it if you are you know there's some good things about it because if you do smoke or vaporize it's it has a faster onset but it also comes off less it also wears off quicker if you're going to smoke though try to use a water a bong because it has a water filter on it vaporize is the other way that i think most people may see out in you know in the public and this one you can use usually is you have a dried flower and you put it into a vaporizer it heats it up and you know under different uh temperatures or or boiling points you can you can vaporize the cannabinoids and you inhale it this one you know there's probably some benefit to it uh because it's again very fast onset so if you're in pain you can you can get a you can you can take a puff of the vaporized uh product and you can get effect within usually about five or ten minutes but it also doesn't last that long it usually lasts for about an hour or two the most common in our clinic is usually in the oral route so either a sublingual buccal or a or a capsule okay and so usually you can use you know you hold it for 45 to 60 seconds underneath your tongue the big things to note here is that when you're taking an oral route whether it's underneath the tongue or an edible like like a capsule it can take up to two hours uh to onset okay edibles include capsules and and um with fixed doses and also edibles can include um uh baked foods or like cookies we usually for medical uh don't use uh edibles like gummies because again you you oftentimes trade one problem for another like these high sugary cookies or high sugary gummy bears um and so it has only a little bit of of cbd or thc in it uh mostly cbd and then you take all that sugar in and then there's topical that's coming out on the market um soon or it's there's some products already out on the market i think this has a lot of this has a lot of potential for localized pain um so how can cannabis help in parkinson's this is not just how can cannabis help in general but this is remember this my talk is specific for parkinson's patients how can it help so there are four really four main areas that we in our clinic have seen it having benefits okay so in sleep in pain in the tremor and in anxiety or mood disorders so what does the data show this is the truth about cannabis so is cannabis a miracle drug that cures everything okay so obviously the answer is is no right um is cannabis a real medication now normally in my powerpoint slide these would come up one at a time but in this in this way it just all pops up at the same time so um i sort of give away my answers right away but yes it's a real drug and here's what it can it can help for and we have we have really good emerging evidence that it's useful in things like pain in poor sleep in tremors anxiety and ptsd seizures um and inflammation okay so here's the stats here's what it looks like this is this is real life data from our from my clinic okay so this is for pain specifically for pain you can see here okay that of these people the predominant people had some improvement right in pain and this is all comers of pain right most of them can you imagine three like maybe a third of the patients had a significant improvement in their pain so you're talking like at least a 75 reduction and when you look at the dose it's an average of 25 to 50 milligrams per day 76 of our patients had an improvement within the first month this is actually improving as we get more data and we can be a bit more aggressive in our dosing um 82 right 82 had some improvement at the three-month mark right and the reason for this is because we can we can titrate the or or help the patients adjust their medications or their their um their yeah their medication um as we see them in follow-up and you look at this the average pain and this is pain again all cameras not just parkinson's patients so all comer pain their average pain that they said that they quantified was 7.4 out of 10 so it's pretty significant pain 7.4 out of 10 is pretty significant and the pain reduced by almost 48 by almost half okay so this goes down to about three point eight okay and again fourteen percent of patients improved by more than eighty percent when you look at these numbers this is this is comparable to the opiates okay except that we know that opiates have other issues like addiction um dr lim we have a question if you are up first something um there's a question here are there any issues with interactions with other parkinson's disease medications great question so and i'm going to touch on that a little later but i will answer it as well now the answer is is that cannabis does or cbd and thc they do interact or they can interact with medications now specifically to parkinson medications the answer is it depends because parkinson's medications like i like i had mentioned earlier isn't just one thing will it interfere with cinematic dance or carbidova the answer is no but will it interfere with some of the other antipsychotics or antidepressants that you may be con on as well the answer is yes will it be uh will it interfere with or interact with benzodiazepines which some parkinson's patients are on for instance for sleep the answer is yes and so it's important and we've realized this to have a team manage your care okay so you know i'll be the first to admit even with all my training i am not a drug expert okay um you know there's just too much to know but pharmacists i mean that's their job they are drug experts so that's why we have clinical pharmacists on our team to review all of our patients to make sure that there are no drug interactions so kind of a long-winded way to answer it but yes the answer the short answer is yes it can interfere with parkinson's drugs or inner interact we do have another one here does the dose include thc so yes so these doses are 25 to 50 milligrams of cbd okay i should have been more clear here sorry 25 to 50 milligrams of cbd and there is a little bit of thc and usually the doses of our thc are in the one to two milligrams and the reason for the thc is mostly mostly because none of the none of the cbd that we get in canada is hemp derived which means that there is always some amount of thc in our cbd now i will say that actually this may be a good thing because thc is really it's often needed for cbd to act better or to be more effective so a little bit of thc with more cbd actually is better but this is a cbd only dose this is just for cbd okay so let's look at the tremor so this one we don't have as much data and you can see that the numbers aren't very much but there are there is some improvement okay and so some improvement in our in our uh in our tremor patients uh just because the reason that our numbers aren't very high is most of the patients who are being referred to our clinic is for pain and anxiety and so um again most people experience some improvement and again a significant improvement in tremors um and the dose again about 25 milligrams per day is on average what these patients were uh had effect on so what about insomnia more data right so this is for people uh who have trouble sleeping average dose 26 milligrams per day again of cbd thc also has a huge benefit but we use it more cautiously especially in our parkinson patients because there is a risk of of uh hallucinations with with uh with or uh hallucinations or cognitive issues with um with thc and so we tend to use it cautiously i will tell the attendees here that cbd actually counters the effects of thc so if you have a predominant cbd like let's say you're on 50 milligrams a day of cbd adding say 5 or 10 milligrams of thc is not the same effect as going on no cbd and just taking 5 or 10 milligrams of thc okay so cbd actually directly counteracts the effects of thc and so you can see here that cannabis in both cbd and thc together can be hugely um [Music] effective at treating insomnia right so again you look i mean you know yes a significant number of people didn't find any benefit that's okay right but a great majority of people had significant improvement okay 83 at three months and then anxiety all right so when you look at anxiety um also a lot of people improve okay so 87 over three months average dose about 27 milligrams this is again predominantly cbd not very much thc at all because we know that long-term consequences of thc actually may worsen depression and anxiety um so this is uh you know the point that i'm showing this is really just to show everyone that you know the clinic is a data driven and b we are having data right um you can see here that not very many people get worse right all of these things very little people get worse and so it's safe and it's potentially very effective okay so um are there risks to taking cannabis and the answer is is yes right so there are side effects to cannabis thc i usually break them down into two thc is what we're mostly you know what we hear in the public um that's the stuff that makes people high it make you know so obviously it's side effect or not necessarily a side effect to some people who want it right it makes them high it makes them drowsy this is why it can be helpful in people with insomnia it can make people have um balance issues so they feel a little bit unsteady on their feet which can again we use this cautiously in parkinson patients because parkinson's patients tend to have stability and mobility issues already so we use this cautiously it can lead to dizziness again the same reason that we use it consciously because we don't want to make any of the the uh mobility issue in parkinson's patients even worse palpitations uh dry mouth um [Music] and so uh again and these things right hallucinations and worsening of anxiety and so we use thc very strategically and very cautiously in our parkinson's patients and usually only when there are on much larger doses of cbd so what's the side effects of cbd you know quite literally not very much there are some patients of ours who who report some loose stools or diarrhea i'm actually more convinced from a clinical standpoint that the loose stool and diarrhea is not so much from the cbd itself but rather the oil so the oil that we're using is an mct oil so um a medium chain triglyceride and some people you know if you take oil it's a bit it gives people kind of makes people a little bit gassy and gives people loose stools and i think that's probably more of what the what the issues are from rather than from the cbd but it's it is something that we notice um some people if they take it for insomnia some people get the the reverse they feel like they're totally energized that's rare but we've seen it um and there are some people who develop some lightheadedness or dizziness but we think in our clinic it's probably more to do with the fact that our cbd here in canada always contains some thc and there are some people who are just very sensitive to thc addictions is there an addictions risk so thc there is an addictions risk but you can see it is extremely small so just to show you uh on the line so this line up here is nicotine we know that nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs out there so this is smoking this is why smokers have a really hard time stopping and then you look here this black is alcohol okay we know that our societies have problems with alcohol consumption but for the most part most people don't get addicted to alcohol but you can see that it's got a significant cocaine is actually right up there not that addictive cocaine just as much as alcohol but you look at thc and look at it and this is a logarithmic scale so this is this is like this is orders of magnitude smaller and so you see that it's not a zero right but it's really small okay is there any addictions raised to cbd the answer is long-term we don't know but it doesn't look like it from a clinical standpoint um there are no there's no uh documented withdrawal symptoms so if you stop people are always worried okay if i stop my medication do i get worse in actual fact we found some really remarkable things with cbd whereby as we escalate the doses of cbd and our patients respond what actually they can do is once they reach a clinical response they stay there for like three months and then some of them for financial reasons usually they stop or they don't take it as often and they realize actually that the benefits are still there and so it's not something that i can necessarily explain except for maybe physiologically your body up regulates the receptors and it gets more efficient at this but i have patients who for instance take cbd for pain and after three months you know they would take it every day or twice a day and then after three months they would take it once every third day or you know once a week or twice a week so it's really very surprising with good control and then there are some um there are some studies out there that suggest okay maybe cbd actually can help with other addictions like you know for cocaine addiction or opiate addiction um i have a couple questions here of course sorry to interject again um is cdb obtained by prescription only yes so right here yeah so it's going to be right here so the answer is no um you don't you don't have to get um cbd through a prescription now i will say this though i'd like to think you know we're two years from the legalization of cannabis in canada and yet despite that believe it or not there is still a lot of grey market stores out there they're decreasing but they're still there and a lot of them have fled to online so i have still believe it or not there are patients of mine who order cbd because a friend told them to order from the site and the site is an unregulated site sorry an unregulated product site they're not they're not health canada approved and so they're selling gray market products and you know the fact of the matter is when i ask my patients it's the same price as the regulator product so i'm not really sure why one would go besides the fact that one may not unders may not realize that that's a great market site and so the best thing to do is if you're looking for it um you know go to a government regulated retail store you can go on the bc website and find out which stores are uh have a license and you can also find out which companies are are licensed through the bcbc government website um so hopefully that answers that question do you want to ask the next question alana first before i go into this sure some really good questions here a couple more can you recommend some strains brands where to buy doctors who we can talk to do you see patients yourself and prescribe cannabis it's a great question and i'm going to answer all of those as we go through i i promise okay um the next one is actually about cbd so maybe you want to answer that one cbd cbd isolate versus full spectrum cbd great question great question so cbd isolates are some companies out there that um that will sell you a cbd isolate um and so the the evidence for the difference between the two isn't great but i can tell you that clinically and from a theoretical and physiologic standpoint full spectrum is probably better and the reason is is that full spectrum allows more synergy so there's this phenomenon called the entourage effect that suggests that in combination the minor cannabinoids or all the cannabinoids act together and the terpenes to provide a more complete response rather than a single pointed response also there is some ancillary evidence to suggest that cbd isolates may not act as well because you'll need higher doses so for instance there's a there's a product on the market for seizures called epidialex epidialex is uh used in the treatment of childhood seizures that's all that it's really approved for certain childhood sweeteners and it's 99 cbd now you know you talk to the company and they'll say that it's a full spectrum but the fact is is that it's 99 cbd so it's actually really close to an iceland um even though it has the other things now if you look at the doses of epidialex for treatment of seizures you're looking at between 800 to 1500 milligrams that's a lot so if anybody has ever purchased cbd you'll know that a usual standard 40 ml bottle of 25 milligrams that's usually a standard is a thousand milligrams and so when you look at the epidiolex to treat childhood seizures you're looking at consuming one entire bottle twice a day right so it's a lot um and so it's a bit anecdotal so i can't don't go don't quote me saying that isolates are are not as effective because we don't know but based on all the information out there and try to gather everything um and putting it all together my sis my my opinion my medical opinion only is that the full spectrum is more efficacious or acts more or acts better or more effectively than the isolates and one more question yes um perhaps you can comment on this uh my doctor and neurologist told me there is no real proof that cbd works well that's so so i can say that unfortunately a lot of my colleagues continue to say things like this when it's not true and i've been trying to single-handedly speak to all of my colleagues across bc and across canada about this first of all um you know if they ever say things like that you can tell them about the phase three trial for the epidialettes that i just mentioned so that's medical cannabis epidialex is the is the cbd uh for childhood seizures that has phase three trials so um to not get too technical phase 3 trials where you get this randomized double-blind control trials is the gold standard for evidence and there is phase 3 trials for epidialex in childhood seizures and so there is lots of emerging evidence to say that cbd is useful a lot of the neurologists and a lot of the gps they just they say that because they don't know and so what i've been trying to say is that instead of saying no why don't we co-manage the patient through for instance through perceive md and then we can all learn together right and so that's what we'll be doing so for instance a lot of the um a lot of the physicians the ep the neurologists who did epilepsy at vancouver general hospital they didn't know anything about medical cannabis but their patients were all on it so what did they do is that we work now directly with them so we see all of their patients who are on medical cannabis uh or who are on cannabis and also happen to have epilepsy so now we share their patients and we manage the cannabis side and they manage the epilepsy side they're the pharmaceutical epilepsy side and we work together as a team so i think that that's a much better approach than saying nope there's no evidence don't go and try it okay so if that's all uh for now i'm gonna answer some of those other questions that were asked um but here so i think this is one of the questions i was asked should i just go get my canvas from a store and just try it out myself right because everything is legal i can just go to the store now i will tell you this going to the store and getting it from a medical uh prescription exactly the same product okay i don't want you to think that the store has sub has um has products that are inferior to the medical realm it's not it's exactly the same so you say okay well why don't i just go to the store to buy it well there's a few reasons one is that it's always better to get a medical practitioner involved if you're really trying to treat a medical problem right that's my fee that's my that's my stance on everything i mean if you have diabetes and you're trying to treat diabetes with your diet you should really try to employ the the help of a dietician so that you can do it properly and so that's one thing the second is that um in the medical route you you can get uh compassion pricing so if your income is below a certain level a lot of like perceive md for instance can help you register with uh with a producer that can get you a discount whereas if you go to a retail shop they're not going to give you any discount you just pay a retail price the third is in regards to pricing as well when you get a medical document for your for your cannabis um you can write it off on your taxes because now you get a medical prescription it becomes a medical um uh it's prescribed by by a physician so it becomes a medical expense so you can write it off on your taxes and some of the third party plans um are covering it okay um so those are the reasons the the and and you know it's it's here as well so the no medical supervision do you really want to just go and buy from a retail store and then try to dose it yourself you know if you're getting side effects who do you ask if there's drug interactions which we already know there are who do you go to right so those are the reasons that i usually give patients say hey like why would you go try to do this on your own when you clearly have um you know a medical condition for it why don't you employ um the services of of a practitioner now i will also say right now that all of our services are free okay so i don't want people to go out there and say well i would employ a medical service but if i could afford it but i don't have any money all of our services are covered under msp so as long as you are you know you you have provincial coverage you will not pay anything to get our services i mean obviously you'll have to pay for the product because we don't control that but our services you know you see a pharmacist you see a nurse you see a doctor all free how much is a cost this is another one of those questions that i always get okay so in general it's about i would say on average about nine or ten cents per milligram so if you're on 50 milligrams a day you're you're about five dollars okay um and a capsule they've come and come down in price about the same so you know if you're on 20 milligrams a day for instance you're spending two dollars a day okay so in a month that's about sixty dollars a thousand milligram bottle is about ninety dollars and depending on how how much your dosing is right um some people can get away with ours we have some patients who use 90 dollars every two months and some patients who use 90 every 20 days okay um and so you can see that again there are there are benefits right if you're spending you know 145 or 135 dollars a month it's you know and you and you'll be eligible for for instance compassion pricing and you get 20 percent off or 15 off and you get a tax deductible i mean it adds up right um this is the question that was asked okay so how do you get to be seen so we uh you can just have your gp refer to us okay um and i can give alana all of the referral information we can we even have a referral sheet that the physician just fills out and signs and then sends to us so we are a referral only clinic but again we are 100 covered by msp um we require referral either from a gp or your neurologist or any other doctor and what's the benefits of seeing us well you see a pharmacist to make sure that there are no drug interactions that we need to be careful about you see a nurse that can help with your intake and answer any questions you see a doctor who can also help and then you see an educator or a coach that can help you that can help you register with a licensed producer help you register for compassion pricing uh help you find help you place your first order and then you know once you get your product and it comes for instance in a bottle and you look at it and you're like i have no idea how to take this the educator can walk you through like okay this is how you take it and now we're doing everything virtually so you could just do it from the comfort of your home we use um a virtual care platform called ollo health that we can you know connect with you on by video or by phone and then we can help you through and this is what we help you with right okay so dosing side effects drug interactions education so that's it so this is the this is the uh the uh website for um perceive md this is our phone number in case you want to call us um yeah or you could just email us okay and again alana i'll give elena the whole package of what we need what you need to get a hold of us um some more questions here um can i ask for a prescription from my family doctor absolutely so yes any doctor can can fill out a prescription if your family physician or your physician is not has never prescribed cannabis before i can tell you that they're probably going to say no and the reason they're going to say no is because to prescribe cannabis is not the same as prescribing any other drug it's really health canada has really bungled it up and it's and it's quite it's it's not necessarily complicated but it's very different than their usual practice and so um yeah but if they've prescribed it by all means yes they can prescribe it and if you want they can send it over to us and then we can we can take that medical document and submit it on your behalf and help you and you know so you can use any part of our service right so if you say okay i only want to use your educator service you can have your family doctor um send us the medical document and we can we can send it to one of the licensed producers on your behalf and we can help you educate and we can help you apply for compassion pricing all that stuff that i suspect their office wouldn't want or wouldn't necessarily offer you and i'm not sure about this question if i'm reading it properly do you take pt from usa and cost i'm not sure what the pt means products maybe do we take products from the usa uh maybe guest 879 can you elaborate patient patient maybe oh do we take patients from the u.s um maybe maybe that's what it's saying so we can we can take private patients um [Music] yes uh and we can uh but it would have to be private paid because they wouldn't be they would no longer fall under the bc uh provincial coverage if you're from out of province we it would have to be private pay again mostly because the provinces don't have an agreement with each other for medical cannabis and for virtual if you're from the us it becomes a challenge because then we have to we have to um recommend the product that you have to go look for in the us which doesn't sound hard but the difference between canada and the us is in terms of regulations so um in canada the the federal government and health canada has mandated that all the licensed producers be uh regulated which means that they control you know things like dosing there has to be certain uh criteria for quality and for consistency of the label so if it says like 25 milligrams per mil that there is about 25 milligrams per mil in there so it's like accurate packaging in the u.s those regulations don't exist which means that the package can be anything and it could be completely different what's inside the package and so it's unfortunate which means that in the u.s you could have a much more variable response all right thank you um another question does cannabis help with dopamine levels the answer is no so cbd can affect things like your serotonin and your dopamine and your norepinephrine receptors but cannabis in and of itself does not increase your dopamine okay so now that's not to say that the it doesn't help with the parkinson tremor okay so you just remember that the parkinson tremor is there because of dopamine uh nerve cells have died or have been injured and they therefore can't act on subsequent uh nerves so it's like one nerve here that's dopamine releasing that acts on this nerve and this stops working so this nerve doesn't work normally okay but this nerve can be regulated directly by cbd okay so for instance if it's a hyperactive nerve it can be attenuated so it's less active just like dopamine would but it's not dopamine whereas cinnamon and the other dopamine agonist actually go in and give the body more dopamine which does the same thing to this to this nerve okay so it's called the different nerve okay and can we get a free consultation an initial consultation yes like i mentioned everything is free except for the products again we i don't control that but the whole assessment um this whole thing about perceive mb is free if we get referred to perceive is the consultation virtual yes yes we have moved to virtual for covid and also to better serve our patients um and also we realize that a lot of our patients they have mobility issues so being seen at home is better um yeah so for those reasons we've decided to go completely virtual um i don't see any more questions in the chat box but i have a question of course um so you know i think many neurologists might be cautious in recommending cannabis use and do you think this has something to do with the concern about the hallucinogenic effects or do you attribute it to something else and is there a high risk for hallucinogenic effects uh for people with pd or or does it just vary from person to person it's a good question so uh off the bat it definitely varies from person to person but the issue really how with neurologists or actually any physician who doesn't consider or won't consider recommending or or trying cannabis is really their own biases and no matter what i think sometimes um people may forget that physicians are human so they're just as human as anybody else we're we're not superheroes which is to say that there is inherent like we live our lives and we still get biased by things around us so you know if people or physicians have uh a son or a daughter who got addicted to cannabis or a friend's friend who got addicted to cannabis or they deal with addictions medicine themselves and they see people addicted to cannabis that they would say no this is not a drug but my argument for uh to that would be the opiates look at the opiate crisis that we're in right now okay it's a terrible crisis people die more people die from opioid overdose than from kovit but i would challenge any person to undergo major surgery without opiates no one would do it it's inhumane okay so the point being that cannabis just because cannabis has been abused it doesn't mean that it has no medicinal benefits because it does and so the problem is is that people tend to bring their own biases into their practice because we're just human and there isn't great there isn't great evidence yet but i can tell you that lots of things that we do in medicine don't have great evidence okay i'm sure that i'll uh some people here i'm certain of it must have been given gabapentin as a prescription drug in the past now i would challenge any of you to ask your physicians to show you what the evidence for gabapentin is and i can tell you that it's quite bad same with the opiates not great evidence for chronic pain use but we do it same with surgeries most surgeries have no good evidence that they work but we do it what i'm trying to say is i'm not saying that surgery is bad or that the opinion is i'm just organ pendant is bad or that opiates are bad i'm just trying to say that there are lots of things in medicine that we do that doesn't have great evidence because we learned over time that it works okay when your appendix bursts and we have to go remove it there's no evidence for that right no one did a trial to say okay if we didn't remove it versus if we did remove it do you die because you wouldn't be able to do that study but surgeons will remove that appendix that's all that's all i really have to say about that sure that's understandable you know i think that oh sorry just one other thing i just wanted to say because there was another point that you made there um that i didn't answer which is the other thing this is that most physicians think of cannabis as thc and so yes and i already mentioned it i am very cautious about giving my cannabis patients thc okay about giving my pd patients thc because a if they already have imbalance issue or dizziness at baseline and i gave them a whole bunch of thc and it just made it worse they're gonna fall and they're gonna break a hip and i'm gonna make them worse so for sure do i want my parkinson's patients high no usually not right but there are some instances actually when the disease is so debilitating that maybe getting a little escape from the reality of the terminal illness is actually a benefit but cbd on the other hand isn't doesn't have these issues right and so that's the problem is that a lot of the people when they when you ask them with medical cannabis they think oh you're going to smoke it and you're going to be thc it's really very far from what we do at the clinic yeah i was just going to say yeah that's understandable on the one hand despite its legalization for sure there is some stigma that is still attached to it and perhaps a misunderstanding between cbd and thc so i think when people think of marijuana they think of being high which is really attributed to thc um and a couple more questions here as well does cannabis help with stiffness so the rigidity i'm pro i think that question is probably referring to the rigidity that parkinson's patients feel where it's almost like things get stuck and the answer is is maybe and i don't know the answer necessarily because we don't we don't have good evidence for it and the reason that i say is maybe is because when you physiologically what causes the stiffness or the rigidity in parkinson's patients it's actually not to do with their muscles it's to do with their nerves okay it's the damage in their nerves that cause the sort of cog wheeling okay and that cog wheeling is if you can fix the nerves um the with cbd you can i guess theoretically or physiologically improve that rigidity now if it's strictly a muscle rigidity because there are some rigidity or stiffness from the muscles itself i don't know right there is some suggestion though that cbd is anti-inflammatory so if it's from inflammation then the answer is maybe it does help um but yeah i don't know the answer for sure okay great another question if my doctor or neurologist refuses to refer what do we do so you know if you try um and you really can't get referred uh we can you know we recommend usually like a walk-in clinic okay um to get a referral and if you really can't we have a no refusal policy all right and perhaps you can comment on this comment my mom was on gabapentin for years and it didn't do anything yes i saw that comment actually it's uh it's like what i said right the elements were kevin pence and it just sort of made me laugh when i saw it because uh i know lots of people like this and um and this is exactly one of those things we give things in medicine all the time based on what someone else may have told us and we've never really looked up the evidence and there's no evidence for it that's why gabapentin doesn't do anything does cbd help with pain yes and so that's why i put the slide up again to show you that it does help with pain your own you're looking at almost a 50 reduction and this is a really good question here how about patients already having hallucinations yes great question so in patients already having hallucinations i would certainly um opt for minimal thc which means that again like another reason not to just go to the to the retail store to get this different companies have varying amounts of thc in them so even though the bottle may say let's say 25 milligrams per ml of cbd the amount of thc in there is varies from accompanying the company some people have like 0.8 or 0.4 milligrams per mill and some people go all the way up to one or two milligrams per mil of thc and so if someone already has hallucinations our team would be very certain um to make sure we choose a product for the patient that has the lowest amount of thc in it um and this and and just mostly cbd uh and the cbd can actually potentially help with some of the hallucinations we have time for a couple more questions do you have patients who take is that patient yes so there are yes so i mean you know we've seen i want to say probably like 2700 patients now so you can imagine that we've seen just about every drug out there in terms of combination uh and so yes we have many patients on quotations it's a pretty common drug um and that's why our pharmacists work directly with the patient and the physician to make sure that okay if we're gonna start and there's a potential interaction these are what to look out for and that's why we see our patients regularly in follow-up so unlike you know some other clinics you know that may say okay here's your prescription for six months go away we make sure that we see we see our patients regularly because i mean it's a journey it's a journey that we go along with the patient okay and one more question here what would be or two more questions what would be the best time of the day to take cbd so there's no real best time to take cbd um it really depends so there are some patients that we have for instance that have predominantly insomnia issues and so we tell them to take it at night you know a few hours before they sleep but there are but but sometimes and it lasts the whole day the next day so it really depends on the person and that's something something that we usually try to help the patients figure out um usually the oral oil or capsule lasts for about eight to twelve hours okay and so you know it depends if you're trying to to help with the tremors in the daytime you may take you know twice a day in the daytime and at night or if you're mostly for tremors and it only bothers you in the daytime maybe you're just taking a daytime and not at night all right and what does oh sorry does thc build up or accumulate in your body so the answer is yes thc and cbd probably do accumulate um they're very lipophilic so they do probably stay in fat um but does that mean that you get addicted or does that mean that you actually get tolerant um and the answer is is we don't know there's some suggestion in the literature when you look at the addiction studies that um that people who use like a lot and i'm talking like a lot like 5 grams 5 to 10 grams a day that they do get withdrawal symptoms but 5 to 10 grams a day is is a i can't i mean for a lot of people they may not realize how much that is but that's an astronomical amount okay i think we have time for one last question here um uh two more questions then and i think that we can wrap it up here um i love that you guys have these really great questions thank you it makes for a better presentation i agree when we have that dialogue um how do we decrease drowsiness in the morning when taken at night for insomnia good question so you can either try to take it earlier in the evening so that its effects are not lasting as long so for instance if you're taking it two hours before bedtime and then you're finding it that it does help you sleep but in the morning when you get up it's you still feel drowsy or a bit groggy for a remaining two hours then you may push the dose back uh to take it two hours earlier at night or you can reduce the dose and the last question if using cbd should i stay away from alcohol i mean in general unless one is consuming a copious amount of alcohol probably not i mean if you're drinking you know one to two glasses of wine for instance a day is fine you know if you're drinking you know half a bottle of wine a day then that's a problem but it's not really a problem so much with the cbd because they tend not to necessarily interact it's more problem with the alcohol consumption and the fact that you're going to get drowsy okay great i think we can wrap things up now uh it's a little past two o'clock dr lam i want to thank you so much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to deliver such an informative presentation for our pd community it really was great and i also want to thank everyone for your great questions um and i'm happy to pass along that information that dr lim um was saying if you send me was that the referral form yeah i'll send you a referral form and some information that they can provide that patients can provide their their family doctors and you can look online as well um both on perceive md and concord medical center you know we're in the transition phase right now but i'll send you both information sure and then i can uh email it to the registrants today so thank you so much and have a great afternoon my pleasure thank you everyone thanks bye-bye bye you", "_6a458D4AhA": "CARE WORKERS FROM ACROSS

report also shows possible marijuana related hospitalizations increased by almost 60 percent randleman says the plant is already slipping into kids hands and cautions and abundance of bud brings along dangerous risk if we don't look at it the right way i think that will kind of explode in a manner that's going to cause more problems within the family but the perception of great health risk from marijuana use is actually trending down in the rocky mountain states and points of contention like driving impaired caused by cannabis are practically unchanged according to the study but even the thought of a driver getting behind the wheel with thc in their system is enough to scare some off the road to recreational right now we don't have a reliable economical way to test the level of thc

chase and this is turkey Tuesday episode 10 today I'm coming back to utopia farms concentrates for another review this time of their Sour Diesel cake batter this stuff is fired and the nose on it is just super sour it has a kind of a piney woody kind of gassy fuel to it but but right out front is just a sour like it almost smells like almost like I don't even know like vinegar almost like just like super sour not really so much of a fruit kind of sour like lime or lemons or anything like that but just like Sour Diesel really has a unique its own funky sour this yes you could say yeah really really stoked on this stuff they came through again with a really fire concentrate the the Chiquita banana was really good and so I had I had really high expectations for this stuff and I was not led down in the least yeah this stuff's got a really nice consistency on it definition of cake batter really really light and fluffy and easy to get a dab off of really really enjoy the consistency of this stuff and extracts like this in general I love cake batters I I really really do I find that in this form extracts tend to have a large amount of turkey retention at the extract is done incorrectly cake batters and butter chips and things like that tend to just be a lot turf here in general can be a little more I guess rugged you you could say than a really clean shatter but I really like us as much Terps as I can get I mean it's chirpy Tuesday as you know I'm all about the Terps all right guys gonna go in on a dab here of these Sour Diesel nug run and cake batter from utopia farms here in California Cheers [Music] [Music] hmm yeah this hour I like what like stupefied by it I characterize a good sour by the the sour note it leaves on the very back of my tongue after a big bath of it or or a bungalow to the flower or whatever mm-hmm I think a really good sour will leave this kind of a lingering sour notes believe lingering and sour notes on the back they're done but on the on the background of it definitely like a mm heavy fuelling this very a a little bit of belief he tastes not not like a trim tastes just like that skunk it's really what it is yeah there's a potent nug run for sure squeezing me in the chest really hard on that dab so yeah this concentrate comes to me from the healing center of San Diego which is actually the buddies kind of buddies walk in I guess if you will buddies was just a delivery service that I ordered most of my stuff from here in the downtown area there all throughout San Diego though and they had no walk-in storefront that you could go to which was kind of a bummer because obviously there's those times where you just wish you know you didn't have to wait for a delivery or lineup you know just just wait around you could just go to a brick-and-mortar and get what you want and now you have that option so yeah Mission Valley you can even find the healing center and yeah just a fantastic presentation on their storefront I I definitely plan on going in there and getting a a review of the dispensary because honestly I here in San Diego when it comes to storefronts I find everything can be the kind of lackluster last night I think at the dispensary they had a utopia farms kind of little event where they were doing a buy one get one free on their edibles utopia farms is definitely known for their award-winning macaroons they're like they're vegan macaroons or I guess gonna go in on a second dab here of the Sour Diesel cake batter from utopia farms this is the nut run they do have a trim run available and had I think $20 cheaper on the gram really really fire as well although now that I've had this and I've run a couple times I can say that the immigrant is definitely worth the extra 20 bucks you know cheers guys [Music] yeah to dab skew is giving me a whole thing a little bit better impression of the buzz on this and yeah this stuff will slap you straight in the face it is a really high quality Sour Diesel extract III find that if I dab too much of this I am kind of useless just I don't know if you this I'm sure there's got to be some of you out there that can relate to this like it when you are extremely high and just zoning the [ __ ] out just staring at something and you just catch yourself almost going cross-eyed like you actually start you're just just brain is melting that's definitely the effect that this stuff has if you if you go a little overboard of a bit or just you know have some fun yeah really fire thus our it is so good you big fan of the nut runs from utopia farms the the Chiquita banana and then this follow up the Sour Diesel is outstanding really looking to try them forward to really looking forward yeah the Sour Diesel has got me stumbling over my words sure really looking forward to trying new flavors from utopia farms guys and as always thank you for tuning in to the CCC 420 [ __ ] you guys next week [Music]", "R84QOqggBLg": "hey i'm nick

environment check them out at growershouse.com i'll link it in the show notes now let's dive into the episode jason welcome to the candy cribs podcast hey happy to be here thanks nick yeah so uh our paths have crossed i know that you're in the consulting space at higher standard cannabis consulting but you have a lengthy career in the cannabis industry before a lot of this recreational you know markets uh came to be what it is today can you tell me about your your background well i'd like to say it's a long one so i'll try to you know be encapsulate as much as possible but um i suppose it's somewhat interesting when i got into it i just got back from backpacking across central america and you know and i had been growing cannabis for a couple years just uh you know just learning at home since i was 19 and then when i was 23 as soon as i got back from that trip i had a very dear friend of mine call me within two or three days and let me know that he had cancer and um you know just just trying to give him something to look past look to past his illness said you know what you're gonna get better i'm gonna move up to washington we're gonna grow some medical cannabis and uh take another trip wow and yeah so and i did and he got better and i moved up uh to washington and we did that very thing and um you know we found that we both had a talent for it and uh so we stuck with it and here almost 20 20 plus years later almost 25 years later uh you know it's been now a career at this point that's incredible so it all started with a medicinal purpose for the plant and providing medicine for for someone dear to you i mean that that's super powerful it it brought meaning to it in a way that you know just uh say just doing it for recreational purposes i mean don't get me wrong the freedom of the freedom of choice issues that are attached to that are important to me as well but um there is something there's just an added dynamic when uh dealing with the medical side there's no doubt about it yeah so uh what part of washington did you move up to well it was a small town uh about no about an hour outside of seattle called the port orchard at the time okay yeah i grew up in arlington which is a small town as well just about an hour outside of seattle oh i know it well yeah they're beautiful yeah yeah they've gone through a lot of changes and and cannabis you know partly being a driver of those changes i i kind of moved and well i moved in 2008 so i moved right before the quote-unquote green rush uh entered into arlington for some you know probably much-needed change in evolution so did you uh take part in you know helping form the initial you know recreational market in washington i would say i had uh more influence in the development of the medicinal although when i yeah although when i entered into the recreation although there's an interesting back story to that as well um you know i started at one of the top growers in the uh in the state and you know shortly quickly pretty quickly took them uh you know with the help of my team of course to the top spot in the country wow um was able to increase their yields by about 30 percent and um you know that was great but the medicinal side uh you know they had it was really raw when uh we entered into it and um you know you had to stack licenses uh and what we would do is uh we you know you could have three licenses with 15 plants apiece so what i what i did is i just sought out people who are quite ill you know with a severe disabilities or illnesses and i uh took their licenses and then they became a dedicated provider for them okay and then so every crop i would give them a pound or two off the top or the money from it which also allowed a lot of you know the people of the sick people that i dealt with to you know some of them to get off social security to start paying uh bills on their own to give them just a little something to feel good about themselves with and of course that that has an effect on the immune system as well so um even though it was a little disjointed uh once we figured out how to get around some of those laws and issues it did it was done we were able to do it in a way that was able to help people in additional ways yeah that's a really good point of financial freedom and less burning financially to lessen the stress which improves the immune system it's all connected um as you just put it that's a really good point to bring up um so uh was that company northwest cannabis solutions that you worked out on on the rec side it is that was my entry into the recreational which um so in washington they when they legalized recreational unlike some of the other states they eliminated medical and that really wow yeah which it was devastating to oh my gosh i did not know that yeah it was terrible frankly and also alluded to it being a money grab a bit um by the state um the probably the worst thing to come out of that in my opinion is you know we weren't able to help you know those people that we helped get off social security we were just talking about okay right back on it um and they lost their uh their free medicine as well um i had a lot of friends who you know did things like cashing their 401ks uh you know mortgage their homes did you know did whatever they could to open dispensaries and then they all had to shut them down because they did what they said was a lottery system to give out licenses i don't know anyone without uh that didn't have a lot of money that was able to get one so which was it wasn't a true lottery well you know there's rumors but uh i think it was interesting that most of the people that did win them not everyone but most of the people did have money and like i said most most of the dispensary owners i knew lost their business which they were unable to get that you know their 401ks back or whatever they did to invest in that uh for growers like myself it was a little different um because i was able to transition i still have all my equipment um from my old grows i usually set up four to five grows at a time uh with three people attached to each one in addition to a grower um that's a lot it was we were we were one of the larger producers medically in the state and uh you know did well you know i did most of my own genetics and uh our strains were the top sellers at almost everywhere they were which uh you know we had a lot of fun with that um and again though i you know the growers were able to transition at least some of us uh one although one thing that i did have an advantage over some of the growers which you know some people would term garage guards is i had to create a business model with a very strict principles that we had to follow to keep things going with my medical uh with my medical co-op i guess we called it okay it wasn't a true co-op but you know that was what we had to label illegally um so i was able to you know because that is a problem that a lot of people find reckon looking for grow masters or directors of cultivation is they know how to grow plants but they don't know how to run crews they don't know how to establish you know budgets and and manage those budgets they don't know how to create repeatable sops or training programs or set up departments or just industry standards yeah for any industry right i mean just business 101 of starting a company hr management proper accounting that's pretty unique that you you bring both to the table you have the cultivation background and pair that with your you know business management background well you know i i was fortunate enough to be in a position to have to create that model and you know a lot of people didn't necessarily go in that direction uh it was hard to predict how that would affect the future of my career unfortunately it affected it in very positive ways so um i i want to shine a light on a special project of yours that you've been working on outside of the cannabis industry but um it it goes to show you know your heart right and and your heart of service all the way back to you know growing for your friend initially um to child trafficking now with this nonprofit that you're part of can you tell me about uh hope railroad the mission and and uh what you're working towards there yeah absolutely um you know something that's dear to my heart um you know it's lost a little steam since we established it but uh i would love you know actually hoping to our discussion on the podcast today may bring some more people uh into it that we get a really ramp up again um kind of came about you know some of us may remember back uh in 2016 when uh you know there was a ban on immigrants coming in and people were stuck in the airports and uh you know there's a big a big deal about you know they just basically cut off immigration and you know what got me is that was uh actually holocaust awareness day that that happened on and that's why uh we call the hope railroad because of of that we the idea was spawned um because of that odd you know coincidence you know um so you know with the immigration issues and especially with uh trafficking it's it's you know started doing some research into it and it turned out that as a lot of these trafficking victims you know they're able to file for a special visa and uh while they're while that's being investigated to to confirm that they were trafficked and to be able to prosecute their traffickers they're protected basically like a witness protection uh and i started coming in and deporting these people while they were waiting for that approval investigation to take place and then once they were so they were basically throwing people back into slavery um including their you know children so there is you know let's have let's throw some fresh new slaves out there it was kind it was just heartbreaking heart-wrenching so the railway we started you know of course a lot of it was bringing awareness to people because very few people were aware of that and also to get people to get uh trafficking victims out so there was two states at the time that set up safe houses one was missouri and one was in new york so we were taking uh helping people in states that ice was coming in and doing that and deporting when they shouldn't have while they were waiting for that visa to be approved and we were getting them safely to missouri and new york so they could so they just had a safe place until that visa was approved and then they were no longer subject to deportation and that that's at the core of it so we did it quite secretly and of course uh spreading awareness on the issue is probably the paramount uh concern because yeah people just aren't aware of that that's that's why i wanted to bring it up today i know it's not directly you know how to grow or your growing background but i know it's very near and dear to your heart and something that i wanted to provide you know the the cantacres platform to to share more about that and um is there anywhere online that people can go to learn more uh before we we dive into the the heavy you know grower questions yeah well you know hoperailroad.com and uh have a website that uh you know that has uh quite a bit of information for people it's a resource and um also a place for trafficking victims to contact us and uh if they need help and um it's uh you know hope railroad.com and i do appreciate you bringing some attention to this today because it is outside of growing but uh maybe more important we're all humans right i mean so it doesn't matter what your career profession is um we're sharing stories and um it's not just cannabis we're we're talking about the the global scale of what cannabis can do for all of us and and the people um helping to to push that change and you're a great example of that and uh you know your heart is in the right place and i commend you for for all your work on that project i'll make sure to link it in the show notes so people can go to that website and learn more fantastic thank you thank you so much yeah yeah you got it so um i i saw it in my research that you recently won a 2019 high times cup for your cbd flower so walk me through that experience what was that like what were the genetics that you submitted can you tell me more about that absolutely i mean that was quite the experience uh surreal and in a way um as most you know most people of our my generation uh you know just read about that is is a far away thing yeah and so um we're lucky enough to have it at the uh at the hemp fest uh here in seattle and uh so it was huge hundreds of thousands of people there whoa oh it was fanta yeah that was amazing you know and you know just it's just a big stage and uh you know there was many different categories and um so and i just come on to a new farm there and oddly enough it was our first crop and uh which also i was kind of exciting uh and the genetics were kana sue okay i know harley sue is that uh yes yes that is that is it's half the genetics of course so uh and in catatonic and so okay it does have a bit of thc so it wouldn't be classified as ham so it still was cannabis but uh but high cbd cannabis with uh you know the thc was about three percent and uh our uh cbd was coming in at uh over 25 percent uh the levels um which were very high of course uh other yeah it's a fantastic strain and um you know if you do if you do things correctly this uh the genetics will take they'll take care of what you yeah were you surprised by the results i was not actually but uh i was and i wasn't at the same time you know sometimes you just have to accept what's in front of you um but like i say it was it was surreal yeah so i suppose i was surprised um but the dedication i put into into growing you know i i was uh you know i expected to do something there but uh at the same time just appreciative of any of the accolades and to win that and it was we actually to win our medal it was it was fantastic and i have to give credit to our team uh my team of growers my team of managers um you know it all it's a group effort and that this doesn't happen with one person's oversight or work and uh i just had a fantastic team with good genetics and uh and my passion and love and uh we were able to bring bring the medal home nice congratulations on that that victory there do you uh have any trends that you've seen in in cbd genetics uh recently that you can share well you know i mean the with hemp being approved by the department of agriculture you know there is innovations with genetics i mean every day more more than we can keep up with frankly and uh tons of strains out there and you know with and of course with the cbd genetics i would say that the biggest changes maybe don't have have to do with things other than the genetics themselves but i would say interstate commerce is the thing to bring the most attention to with cbd uh we can grow cb we can grow medicine cbd uh strains and camp which is cannabis just with lowe's thc in it right and it with a different label legal label on it and uh we can ship it anywhere which makes it accessible to people that didn't don't you know that not every state has medical cannabis approved right but the hemp side of it um now people can they can receive that anywhere they live and that's an amazing thing and you can leverage the uh regional climate that might be a little bit more you know suited better suited to grow hemp and yield a higher you know cbd cultivar than maybe in another part of the country but have the power to leverage that in one state and then ship it across the country somewhere else that's that's powerful and and to me i'm looking forward for one day um in our lifetime where we can do that with uh you know cannabis and a high thc you know uh cultivar that do you think that's where we're heading do you see that happening in the next five ten years that is the exact timeline i usually cite okay when asked that question i think within five to ten years although you know it's dependent on so many variables it's so funny and variables we don't know yeah that's the thing i mean we can't even conceive of all the different things that need to happen even though we you know i mean we can simplify it in a way legalize it federally but of course it's more complicated than that yeah and um it's a lot of it depends on the leadership of our country of course and you know we're just gonna have to wait and see but yeah the good news on that is is there are it's such a big issue now for i mean there are very few issues that are in the public eye more than this over the past few years and uh you know there's a lot going on in so many other areas as some of which we talked about earlier um that i don't want to say it's taking a back seat and but maybe it should to for some of the things like the things we discussed earlier but it's still it's still there in people's minds and i do think within five you know i'd be shocked if it took uh 10 years for it to happen i would expect five five years is probably a good timeline yeah and it goes back to the team you know the the team to take uh a high times cannabis cup for one flower or a team you know at the federal government level to allow this for everyone um it just goes back to the people right um and and states providing good examples and models to follow i'm sorry to hear that that experience um that you saw in in washington um i i was not familiar with that that just you know completely blows my mind i should have known that but i'm glad that i learned it here today from from your experience firsthand so let's dive into uh medicinal versus recreational state markets is there any state that's doing it really well in your opinion that we can model uh potentially the federal government after or new states coming online uh to to look at you know to be honest i would look at oregon and uh in colorado and which were some of the first to do that but they integrated the two and gave owners the option to you know just transitions to straight recreational or you know i mean there's a lot of uh dispensaries that have both you know you're just on one side of the building or you know they have one side of the shop is it recreational the other side is medicinal and that's important because when people are coming in for medicine the atmosphere matters it really really does you know because if you're not careful people will feel diminished they will feel invalidated you know i mean it's a it goes to even like what we were talking about about giving people something to look forward to even my entry into it wasn't necessarily about growing the cannabis it was trying to give somebody something to look to pass their illness and so to to try to make their illness just something they just it's kind of just something they deal with on the side but it's not the everything of their life and atmosphere you know walking into just a you know a fun party atmosphere does not necessarily make somebody that's sick feel safe especially when we're talking about people that haven't used recreationally which is a ton of patients you know a lot of the older generations of people of older generations that come in that realize that it has medicinal value but they they have no interest in getting getting high they just want to help their condition so they don't want to walk into a store that feels like a head shop or something right so i do believe that it's important to have that separation yeah um i've heard a lot of people complain about um the quality of medicinal cannabis compared to recreational cannabis can you uh teach me what's going on there and in your opinion as an owner of uh cooperations and as a consultant um are there different rule books that they're playing by is there you know different psychology in the mind of a business owner for a medical group operation compared to recreational i know it definitely varies state to state but um is there a framework or mindset that you could share with me today absolutely um well in my opinion it mostly has to do with scale i mean generally medical grows are a bit smaller uh and are able to be a little more involved in in the plant care um it can be done on on scale for recreational but you got to have the right grower and at a smaller grow you know there's more growers with the experience necessary to do that but as soon as you get to a certain square footage you know i mean when you get really massive there's a big difference between say growing one room with a perpetual cycle and then once you start having multiple rooms that you need to have on a perpetual cycle suddenly the scheduling becomes so much more complex and so that you know the departments need to be different the setup needs to be different and they're just in areas that most growers don't have any experience in it's not their fault it's nobody's fault except maybe the federal governments i suppose but even even we're talking about bringing in academians uh you know they don't have experience with cannabis so they have the scientific acumen but they don't have the holistic approach to apply it in a lot of cases so for me it has you know simplify and encapsulate or just say it it has to do with scale mostly yeah that's a great response it makes a whole lot of sense um so we're going to take our our first break jason when we get back uh we're going to dive head first into your consulting work that you do today awesome sounds fantastic thanks nick hey hope you're enjoying the episode so far i'm not sure if you've heard the word on the street yet but our friends over at growershouse.com are selling quest factory refurbished units for 15 off regular pricing with a three-year warranty that's a smoking deal by the time you're listening to this you might have already missed out so go on over to growershouse.com and see for yourself and if you haven't been to grower's house they have a lot of different growing essentials such as trellis netting trim trays and more now back to the episode all right we are back and i'd love to dive into your consulting work today so are you mostly working with uh new grow operations is this like their first time running a business can you can you uh teach me a little bit more about your clientele sure um well what the experience that i have and the other growers that i have working for me on the consultant side um really all all in about seed to sale and so we have clients that uh you know we help set up uh from the ground on up uh also a lot of clients who just needs things like diagnostics work um i have a unique ipm program that uh uses principles that aren't really common knowledge in the industry uh you know diagnosis is big in department setup and and you know rarely have i found the department's uh set up in in the grows that they're set up properly or at least in a way that could streamline efficiency the way it needs to be teach me about that what what's typically not set up properly and how do you fix that in in your work well you know maybe i'll use an example of a of a girl i worked at for a year um they when i so when i came on they had just one floating crew of like 20 people or so and uh it just would float around with uh you know with their grow master looking for things to do uh you know they weren't tasking things out the way they should you know they're so you got to control all the variables that you're able to because you know there's so many that you're unable to see so if you control all the variables that you notice it leaves you more prepared to handle the ones that you didn't yeah and so with the departments you know i you need a vegetation department especially a scale if it's a very small grow then that then that still works but once you reach a certain scale you uh you know you need a veg department vegetation department and then a flowering department you need a post-production department you need an ipm department which stands for integrated pest management um you know it goes on and on the packaging department uh you know if you're processing oils you have to have a separate department for procurement uh if you're not producing enough in-house uh to make your oils and fill your flower needs um you know it's there's a lot and in fact uh when i came onto that grow i you know what really the first thing i did was split that one that one crew into five different departments smart and uh can you teach me let's say a couple different phases you know of scaling right so let's say uh a 5 000 square foot you know cooperation to 50 000 to let's say like you know full blown um you know and and maybe you just have a handful of growers in the beginning you know maybe it's a grower slash owner that has a couple helping hands um and then that next level and then that that third level where you know they're at scale so uh what what are the the initial roles that you help implement in that team um through each level so okay so i would say with the square footage and uh you know splitting things up at about 5 000 square feet uh you can still get away with having one floating crew and in fact that's probably will be the way to go you don't want to needlessly pay managers you know the salaries that come with those positions if right if it can be done by one person once you hit about 10 000 square feet is where i would say you should probably consider uh you know splitting it up at least into two departments of vegetation and uh flowering at that at that level you could still get away with having your ipm department and your post-production department uh you know integrated usually post-production will be part of the flowering department of course uh compliance uh would usually be a separate department but that could be done by the vegetation department normally at that scale um and so on and so forth once you get above ten thousand that's when you really gotta have to start considering just you know splitting up into those five or more departments and um you know that because that's when you have to start splitting up rooms to the point where you have you know three four five six on and on you know at northwest cannabis solutions we have 45 separate flowering rooms for example 45 45. to maximize control like you guys wanted them smaller to have a more controlled environment and decrease the spread of you know diseases and pests yeah cross-contamination is always an issue especially at that level which of course you know you need to keep all the rooms contained you make sure your crews are going in tie-backs make sure you're identifying rooms that have problems make sure they're worked on at the end of the day by specific people that uh have their tyveks um i always also i think it's always a good idea at that scale to have uh you know uniforms i suppose you know overalls or types that they wear every day um so but also uh you know it keeps your product fresh if you just have you know you have a 50 000 square foot facility that brings everything down at once you know you're not going to be able to sell it all at once either it take you know even if you're selling it fast so having that perpetual cycle and fresh product coming in all the time helps increase uh you know helps increase quality yeah what about some common misconceptions with uh new business owners in the cannabis space that you've come across well i'm sure that's like a weekly basis it is and it's a loaded question too yeah um with a with it just uh so many different answers that could be put on that you know apply to that question but some of the bigger things i encounter you know profit margins aren't really what a lot of people a lot of owners expect so which that means of course managing budgets it becomes so critical and and of course a lot of growers don't necessarily have experience with that um you know you need a really varied skill set to manage grow and also it's a team effort so you know as we've been discussing i would say trying to just stick a couple people to manage the entire facility is a big mistake as well and that's why i encounter so many times you know the first thing we need to do is split up into departments and that includes having you know an operations manager a general manager that that works together with the director of cultivation and uh you know i would say also infrastructure investing in infrastructure a lot of a lot of owners tend to try to i don't know maybe a good way to put it is their eyes are bigger than their stomach yeah it's been a nice thing yeah yeah they were even trying to get a square pig into a round hole there you go um you know oftentimes i find it uh those infrastructure problems come with uh the hvac systems you know the owners don't want to invest in a state-of-the-art system and then suddenly they don't have the climate controls they need to maximize production and you know there's you have to consider the roi on all these things the return on investment which i you know i haven't encountered many growers that do that and everything that requires money should there should have an roi done on it by either director of cultivation or the gm or operations manager depending upon uh what area they're we're considering or talking about so making sure that the the infrastructure and equipment is what it needs to be to produce the amount of cannabis necessary to you know fill payroll you know to pay all the bills because again profit margins aren't necessarily what a lot of owners think they're going to be especially when if they don't get the right grower and their production isn't maximized or and efficiency needs to be streamlined as well i mean maximize efficiency maximize production uh manage the budget very carefully get the right management team into a place i would also say it's very important you know a lot of these owners look into other businesses if they have them and see if they can apply any any areas that they found success in those businesses see if they can apply them to the cannabis say you know if they have a if a they have a robust marketing team or a marketing department that they could you know they could use in in their cannabis company or distribution of fat panda i went out to film fat panda in washington a couple years ago it was one of our first canon cribs episodes and uh the owners came from a marketing background and to me it's like that that packaging popped those logos the brand experience when they would buy the product when it was you know someone go into dispensary and buy the product it stood out and i think that's a really good point leveraging skill sets from other industries as a business owner that's your competitive advantage you know in addition to your team and your growers that you foster oh indeed i mean there's no question about it i mean you hit the nail on the head there with that uh if that panda is a great example now during my time uh at northwest cannabis solutions especially you know we kind of jostle back and forth that was the one competitive yeah arch rival they were our arch rival it was a friendly competition that uh and and frankly what during my time there we they only i think there was two months that they were able to uh overtake us what was that like the i 502 website i forgot what it was there's a website where it lists like all the rankings yeah it actually even goes into more detail than that list of rankings it has to be reported uh how much revenue was uh you know the companies make every month it actually in quarters they they reported every quarter um and uh how much production so check the scoreboard homies frankly i i feel fortunate that that exists because a lot of that's a problem a lot of growers encounter is that they their uh careers are hard to verify and um you know since uh most of my career has been in washington it's easy to look up at what i've done and you know i've had various articles done on me speaking engagements and and whatnot but that i 502 website is a godsend as far as verification because that's another you know we should even i should say uh you know another thing with ownership do your due diligence you know don't just hire a girl because he talks a big game um because they just you know they're marketing themselves as well so due diligence verify it's hard to do because you know there's not very many places but washington growers do have that advantage i'm sure you have come across your fair share of horror stories that you had to kind of like kitchen nightmare or rescue whatever that show is where you have to like go in and do an overhaul you know i i have growers um you know such as yourself friends in the industry that do consulting work and they reach out to me because they they know me through canada cribs and they're like hey nick like can you create a new show with me where i go around the world and fix girl operations and i'm like that sounds amazing like yes one day we'll get there like my plate is really full right now but yeah for you like i'm sure you've seen a lot of horror stories could you share one maybe sans the the name of the company or owners but should you share a story with me that you came in and fixed and maybe provide some lessons for other growers so they don't have to you know live that experience twice you know i mean the one that pops out to me the most is i came into a grow and they had lost their they had a good grower on staff inexperience as far as running the business but there was enough people in place on the uh on that side of it that they were able to maintain and he did a good job in caring for the plants staying on schedule keeping things clean um when they lost him that they promoted somebody in-house it was just you know didn't he he just was in over his head a bit uh not not that he was bad at what he did he just didn't have the knowledge the basic knowledge quite yet and uh so when i came in you know is a lot of fixing as far as you know just putting in training programs repeatable sop but the but the nightmare was in that infrastructure the hvac system frankly so they had had a company that uh they had a contract with to come do maintenance on their uh on their hvac system and they were coming in and you know apparently doing maintenance on it and the front end went down which is a control system for it and they were apparently just giving these guys at no bid say we'll give you no big contract that won't go over 80 000 and for the front end and they couldn't give them any answers on what what really needed to be fixed so when i came in and the operations manager should have been on top of this frankly but the when i came in you know i went around looked at the looked at the hvac systems and they didn't look like they were being maintained to me so i called in three other hvac companies to give us bids and to take a look and uh there was one in particular and i'm happy to mention their name because i still work with them at uh at times which is tcms they were fantastic could you say that one more time that company name yeah tcms okay and they're one of the larger hvac companies in the western united states and canada um and one of their vice presidents uh came in and worked with me to assess everything needed to be done uh you know our front end system they were able to fix that without you know eighty thousand dollars well they did it for like five oh wow yes and but the biggest thing is they did discover that the maintenance you know quote unquote maintenance that was being done by this other company simply wasn't being done and this goes to they weren't changing the filters they weren't uh you know they should have been pressure washing it three or four times a year at least uh the the filtration systems in the in the condenser units um and so when those got clogged up also they weren't putting in the paper filters so uh one of the and there's two parts to this nightmare the other part is they were failing testing for what was called a gram-negative bio-tolerant bacteria now that's one of the things that they test for on cannabis here in washington they couldn't figure out where it was coming from what was happening and when i noticed and there was a fish fertilizer company that was next to us right so they were bringing in fish no no i see where this is going yeah well well and i i should also mention that most bacteria that you find associated with fish are bile tolerant gram-negative bacteria so with that understanding i i saw it sloshing over the edges of the truck onto the under the dirt that they were driving by our building on and so what happened was called a drift and you know something i dealt with when managing greenhouse grows you have to coordinate with the farmers around you because when they're tilling up their farms or towing up the soil it kicks up uh you know the soil gets kicked up in the air and it contains pesticides that may contaminate uh you know vir you know viruses fungus you know varidisilium uh usarium will it's a big one so you need to make sure you close your vents um but since they weren't putting in the uh filters right in the condenser units that drift the dust was getting in through uh our our hvac systems and then getting into an environment that uh you know the other grower just wasn't keeping clean enough so it was wet everywhere uh just soggy soil and all the rooms all over the everywhere you looked and so once it got in there then it spread so i identified it talked with the port and they uh agreed to pave the road in the back so that helped with the drift also the fish fertilizer place was very very good to work with us and they uh took measures to stop that from happening but the biggest thing is we brought in the cur the right uh hvac company now if the contract went from something like 5 000 to you know upwards of 100 but that also guaranteed any equipment failures and you know it was difficult convincing management or ownership the necessity of that but once i did i put together an roi then it was easy for them to see and frankly oftentimes it is difficult to you know convey important information to ownership with if they don't have an understanding of what's happening and it's important for growers not to get frustrated by that it's our job to find a way to relay the information that's where it sinks in and don't just pound your fist on the table get frustrated and say why aren't you listening to me no take a moment and find a different delivery for the information if that doesn't work find another delivery if that doesn't work do it again and again and again i don't care if it takes a hundred different ways leave your frustration aside and detach that emotional reaction well it's our job it's our job so um it's not about us it's not about our egos it's not about our you know why aren't they listening to me it's about um striving for excellence and finding a way and finding a path towards that that's a very stoic mindset that you have and apply to cannabis cultivation and and i love that i think you're you're exactly right and i'm sure you bring that mindset into the grow operations that you can consult with um talking about new clients and you know your your business so um what are would you say are the top three most common problems that you you get called in for um at your firm excuse me well i'd say the most common one would be uh issues with pests and pesticide resistant pests and because the industries everyone in the industry struggles with that although i've been able to develop a you know a regimen in an ipm program that where insects is impossible for them to build up resistance to but that's scientific acumen and i would actually that would lead to a more simple way to state it there is just a lack of scientific knowledge out in the industry now when you bring people with that you know say with horticultural degrees and well you need that but most of them because of the laws have not had eyes on cannabis so say they know that uh you know they know what all the micro macronutrients are and that they can become deficient but how does it manifest on the planet you need to you know there's subtle differences in colors and shades and you know and the difference between a leaf that's drooping in a leaf that's bending you know for example or a client you know there are there a lot of manifestations that look similar with different causal with different causes so to be able to discern exactly what that is diagnostics you need not only to understand the science which i would say that's the biggest problem in the industry you need to love science you need to but you also have to be able to apply it with your instincts and that's where the real green thumb comes in you have to have the knowledge but you have to be able to apply it correctly that's the disconnect that you've seen with um kind of the the quote-unquote academic world entering into the cannabis space and perhaps not knowing how to apply that or transition that knowledge to the cannabis plant in particular oftentimes and that's not you know that's not a universal statement but um that is generally generally i would say the biggest problem uh finding someone with the the varied skill set the broad skill set with uh everything from you know understanding science applying it knowing the business side knowing how to manage crews understanding how to be a leader to get the most out of your crews to have them respect their jobs enough to do a good job when you're not there to watch them i mean it is and there's just so many things that go into it and uh it's hard to find someone that with that understanding you know on the on the flip side jason i'm sure that you've seen some success stories do you have one that comes to mind kind of a turn around where you entered into a situation that could have been a grow nightmare but by the time you left and and they're you know all the way up to this point today they have been super successful you know i would frankly uh i would say northwest cannabis solutions again you know when i when i got on there they were having some basic troubles uh as an example the first thing that they showed me to ask me what do you think is wrong with this room and i looked at it and it looked to me and you know i mentioned a minute ago about the gym between bending leaves and drooping leaves well he said why are these leaves drooping he said well you notice the stem it's actually bent here with a little bit of a claw on on the fingers of the leaves and so i asked about water temperature and he said no no it couldn't be the water temperature everything's fine with that what else do you think and we went and then i went through other questions because they did a good job of collecting data you know talked about ph we talked about you know what's a nutrient regimen are you uh flushing you know all these different things but then we have eventually rounded out there it went in a circle right back to the water temperature and i just asked well can we go look at the records and sure enough that those plants were getting hit with water uh in the temperatures in the 40s as it was in the winter coming in and that anything under 50 degrees well anything really under 60 degrees 60 degrees has the potential to lock up a plant and in a nutrient lockout that's more difficult to bring out than say a nutrient lockout due to a salt buildup so so you know we uh one of the first things we did is put in a heat exchange system where the water ran through all the rooms through pipes was heated that way and then it was the same temperature as the rooms when it got in and so those plants felt like they're you know getting to a nice warm bath but there's a number of other things that we did and that you know probably don't have time to go into all the different things that had to fix at that part too part two yes but uh you know was able to increase production by 30 percent and again we took the top spot you know i i am proud of that and and i'm proud of my team that helped us achieve that and we took the top spot in the nation for uh the rest of my time there and and i was headhunted away frankly uh about a year later um but but i i would say that would be my favorite victory for lack of a better way to put it yeah definitely have you ever come across a client with uh issues related to licensing or lab testing that maybe uh your company took part in helping to solve absolutely one i alluded to earlier when uh we were talking about the hvac system but that gram negative tolerant bacteria which is you know even just so because i love i just love science right so i already knew that that was associated with fish but that wasn't an angle that anyone in the building would have ever drifted to you know they would have just been kind of spinning their wheels endlessly and they had failed multiple crops in a row before i got there which left the company on the verge of failure and you know with the profit margins the way they are you you just can't have multiple crops fail in a row so um and with licensing of course it's it's always difficult i mean there's different challenges in every state um you know i have a partner down in uh san diego it usually handles the uh you know the the legal side for my clients okay because well because it's just so complicated and in every state you're a subject matter expert you do and with all things you know i mean identify people with the ability to get done with what you need to get done and put them in a position give them some responsibility and put them in a position to succeed and then successful for the company will follow as well just got to make sure that the right to provide the right oversight to make sure that those uh those principles and standards are being followed definitely are there states in your opinion jason that have uh maybe better licensing programs than others or better testing programs than others that again you know new markets that are coming online every day like let's take oklahoma for example they're you know one of the the newer markets um you know are are they you know their licensing and testing uh you know systems are are they good could they be improved upon are there other states that they could uh learn from to strengthen their models you know i would say it's it is good it's robust but i think could use a little more development i know a lot of growers probably are frustrated by the amount of testing for different things everything from botrytis powdered mildews um funguses molds you know bacteria there's so many different things that can make people sick while that may frustrate some growers we need it and if you're doing your job right uh it you don't need to be frustrated by that we're trying we need to keep people safe and this is medicine for people and even for the people using it recreationally do we want to make them sick i mean you know what are we philip morris you know we're going to put cancer-causing chemicals on a product we're going to give the cancer patients i believe that's immoral i agree with you and i'd love to dive into your favorite style of growing so maybe let's just say outdoor greenhouse indoor you know let's start there and and then get into the weeds well that i mean the boy that's a big question actually and my favorite i mean i love indoor you know you can the quality that you can get uh growing indoors you just can't match it that being said the most uh profitable and efficient way to grow is in greenhouses and i would recommend greenhouses over indoor if you had to make a choice if you're able to do both uh a girl that i'm working with right now does both elmar farms they're fantastic okay but i did you know as an example i did find so we'll say see a green you know when we're talking about scale my favorite would be c cia green um some of the problems that i encountered when i got to elmar farms for example they were at these ten foot tall plants that they're sticking in their greenhouses and now on a very small on a small scale if you're just growing in one room even if it's a perpetual cycle you can get more production with those big plants but as soon as you start having multiple rooms that you're trying to schedule out and keep on that perpetual cycle it's about turning over harvest and growing those big plants you know as opposed to see a green you're going to miss out on one or two harvests a year uh in most cases which will end up being more lost you know it's that roi again you'll have more loss with that than you would over you know if you're trying to grow those big plants and get a little production freeze harvest so i would say see a green uh on scale i do like core fiber which is the cocoa core um it's kind of a blank slate uh you know you want to your ph a little lower um you know a little more calcium magnesium but uh frankly that blank slate as long as your program is right uh yields a lot of advantages so being a youtube community uh where we showcase growers such as yourself around the world we have you know tens of thousands of fans subscribers that go into the comments and and they share their personal opinion on how they grow and a lot of times they they critique the growers that we we film which is accepted and welcomed i love it uh but what about some some bad advice that maybe you have heard uh along your your journey as a grower that you can help squash today well you know there there is one that i cite often when this question comes up and um that would be like uh you know sugars and bud hardeners and bud sweeteners these really really expensive products that you're dumping into your medium and for whatever reason the the knowledge common knowledge in the industry is that those sugars help uh sweeten up those buds and get up in the plant and you know it's good for the plants but the problem is as under just even a simple understanding of photosynthesis will tell you that plants are incapable of taking sugars up through their roots so while you do want some sugar in your in your soil or to feed your microbial flora and your microbial mat which does help you know some of those issues with the bud hardening and sweetening and all but you can you know molasses works it's just a simple thing of about feeding microbes as opposed to stuffing sugars in to get into the plant tissue now plants per they create sugars they through photosynthesis they take all nutrients or salts they take the nutrient salts up they combine it with co2 and the light to create sugars that they distribute through the plants which the plants are a lot like us they have two vessels like you know we have veins and arteries they have a xylem and phloem vessel and they take the nutrient salts up through the xylem vessels they create sugars store them in the big leaves which also another little side note don't take all your big leaves off those are your sugar storage repositories that if another part of the plant gets damaged they use the phloem vessels which is the other vessel to distribute those sugars to other areas of the plant to keep it healthy i love it this is why growers are hiring you right you are a wealth of knowledge well you know i suppose uh i suppose i know a thing or two about growing but uh i'll say i'm passionate about it and uh you know i i do believe i have a lot to offer yeah you're constantly learning and evolving your trade i love it one thing i know for sure is i know nothing at all constantly learning there you go uh it's a good mindset to have so i want to do a rapid fire round so i love uh your number one most important thing to know and implement for each of these areas in your grow operation so let's start with water and nutrients what's the number one thing that you should know and implement as a grower water and nutrients i would say you know most growers know they need to ph their water understand why you know try to understand why don't be a system grower to where you just know that you need to use a ph meter know why you're doing it it's to create a solute you know the salts in a certain ph range becomes soluble and so they can be taken up into the plant so understand why you're doing things okay under try to and also don't just uh you know memorize what all the nutrients are the macro and the micronutrients you know the molybdenum the boron of the borons of the world that a lot of growers uh you know i know you know your elements yeah so uh same question what's the most important thing to know and implement for lighting setup well if i would say because a lot of people are going with leds make sure you have a grower that understands fertilizer science to the point you can make the adjustments because the spectrum difference oftentimes a lot of times it'll be as simple as adding calcium and magnesium although of course phosphates are carried into the plant on the back of magnesium so you know they kind of interact together but uh i would say make sure that your fertilizer adjustments are correct if uh according to your lighting especially if it's led nice i like it next up ipm strategy well that's that's a tough one to consolidate into it yes and no the thing is most so industry knowledge will tell you that you know you need to alternate modes of action to help prevent uh the bugs from building up a resistance to your products but that's really that's really a little short side and so combining modes of action now if you combine modes of action the bugs it's impossible for them to build up a resistance to them but it's very tricky you have to match up the half-life of each of your pesticides and also the persistence rate so because if they you don't whatever whatever product you're using has a long the longest persistence rate they will build up resistance to that and even if there are bugs it'll build up resistance to one use two or three of them at the same time but again they have to have different modes of action you have to match up half-life you also have to match up persistence rate and and then also the ratios you can't just dump them all with the same you know ratios you would use if they were standalone products well said trimming most important thing to know and implement with trimming i would say you know ever so most companies want you know want to do hand trimming it seems and it's because it does create a better smoke you know it's more the smoke ability is better it's uh it just tastes a little cleaner often it looks better but you know wet versus dry trimming you know frankly what if you wet trim with the right machine in the right way and the biggest mistake is people just cut down the whole room and then start running it through a machine and once your product gets a little soft and soggy it bruises up the chlorophyll gets trapped up it does affect the smoke ability it looks kind of crappy it looks like it was washed in something you know the cup it just it's discolored often so i would say take down your rooms a section at a time and if you're and have a freezer or fridge on hand because uh if you have product that's starting to get soft put it in that fridge put it in the fridge or freezer to because it will maintain its rigidity and then you won't have those problems with the discoloration and running it through your trimmer excellent last one quality insurance most important thing to know and implement quality assurance the most important is make and this is one i've found a lot of owners have a hard time understanding is flushing um you know it's i actually put up signs it uh well one girl in particular that uh you know sometimes i'll try to do little tricks like this but they just said less is more more branches doesn't always mean more buds more leaves doesn't always mean more you know heavier buds uh more fertilizer does not necessarily mean a better more heavier buds or more or higher quality smoke in fact as we know it makes it worse so don't be afraid to flush and so qa you know make sure that you have a clean product also make sure that nothing your ipm program isn't spraying things if you do it properly and start through veg stop as soon as you see flowers make sure you're not putting uh you know bad pesticides or bad products on flowers i love it thank you so much for that that rapid fire knowledge uh so i'm curious i hear a lot in the youtube comments on canna cribs episodes and deep roots episodes about nutrient deficiencies and solutions for those could you tell me maybe some of the more common ones that you see on on the commercial scale and how you solve them for sure um well i guess i'd start with a ph you know you have to you know it's recommended to use a different uh ph level according to the you know the type of soil you're using so for example peat uh something is p base you'd have your you ph at around 6.3 um most people use core fiber the cocoa core which i do prefer as well and you want it closer to say a 5 8. so without that knowledge you know a lot of people just end up doing 6-3 and core fiber and then it doesn't leave all the nutrients available in the levels that the plant needs so and also the understanding that um you know one that i'd run into is uh you know magnesium deficiencies with purpling stocks it's actually a phosphorus deficiency but because phosphorus enters into the plant on the back of magnesium you know it's still classified as a magnesium deficiency and magnesium and calcium work together in the plants as well just like it does with us so with deficiencies you know look for multiple signs if you only have one deficiency on there it's likely deficient in actual deficient if you see multiple deficiencies on there there's a good chance that it's locked out and then you need to figure out why is it due to a cold water that you use a bad water temperature is it something atmospheric is it a most common would be a salt buildup because all nutrients to salt and most nutrient lines have sodium chloride in it which is basically table salt that's the bad salt that builds up in your in your soil that locks plants out that's difficult to get them out although if it happens due to a salt buildup a sugar solution running through your medium the salts will attach to the sugars so you don't have to put 100 gallons through the pot and usually we'll rebalance it although a mineral matrix of some sort treat it like a brand muffin you got to reboot that system but i would say you know look for multiple signs one sign and then uh discern what's causing it excellent there's a lot of advice there the past 15 minutes so i know a bunch of growers are gonna have to keep going back pause listen to it rewind i hear that a lot so right right right yeah there's a there's a lot of uh knowledge there i appreciate you sharing so let's talk directly to uh the topic of a new business owner so let's take oklahoma for example there's a lot of new owners of grow operations especially when the the barrier to entry to a market is lowered financially or you know legally it's a little bit easier to start a grow operation so what are uh would you say is like uh some of the the top mistakes that a new grower will make and um without having to hire a consultant quite yet like maybe they can remedy something internally i know we talked a little bit about this subject uh prior but maybe just digging a little bit deeper on uh the topic of new business owners in the space and and what they can do well well as far as ownership goes i would say you know don't be afraid to lean on the people you hire to to manage your operation but also do your due diligence of course and to verify that they are what they say they are which is not always easy in this industry and looking for industry standards that are successful in the industry i mean you know for the restaurant industry you can google it but it's in cannabis it's very secretive and so it's very difficult for someone without the actual experience to just know what those standards are so they're left to try to figure it out on the fly and with a startup that oftentimes can be really bad so i would say put your ego aside for ownership and managers and management growers put your ego aside be willing to be wrong and and be willing to do the research or make the phone calls do whatever it takes to figure out what those standard successful standards are and uh just attack it like a dog on a bone and don't get frustrated when you can't find it yeah i love it and and going back to the philosophies you mentioned earlier of essentially stoicism and kaizen you know stoicism of uh you know you can't control everything and it's your perception of uh what's happening um and then detaching your emotion and ego from that and then also uh the philosophy of kaizen of constant self-improvement always learning always being eager to you know try new things and and learn how to solve it a different way well you know that i that's such a big thing in the industry and you know i don't know maybe a good way to put that is you know in this position you have to be confident in your abilities but you better you know be willing to do the research and constantly learn and you know confidence without humility is merely arrogance and it's hard to it's hard to improve or get better or even maintain as an arrogant grower and another you know sometimes i put these signs up like you know less is more um another one that i've used in the past is ego free growing um you know put it aside you know we're cultivators of life and embrace that embrace the science don't be afraid even if you don't have any background in it you know i mean just just start simple um you know i subscribe to a uh a service that allows me access to all the different uh you know university libraries uh you know anyone can access most of them but you know there's a service that allows me access to all the published papers some of them even before they're published and i would say do your research start with peer-reviewed articles on horticulture and then and then cross-reference it against cannabis specific articles to try to confirm or add to that base of scientific knowledge just plant science i love it and just keep researching just be just voracious just read read read i know most people love you know people learn in different ways um i would also say don't be afraid to read you know a lot of these articles and peer-reviewed articles you're not going to find videos on so don't be afraid to read but don't limp yourself in the areas or the method your methods for of research either and just just devour as much as you can yeah i love it um so let's talk about your firm here so um maybe some new projects on the horizon that you can share any trends or developments in the you know cannabis industry today that you're really looking forward to well you know i of course legalization we're all looking forward to that right um you know i am excited about what's happening with hamp uh you know we discussed interstate commerce before because it's uh getting medicine to people that need it that weren't able to have it before but especially in cannabis um you know with my company you know just uh took over a management of a farm here just outside of olympia in washington um that's a hybrid indoor and greenhouse grow um very excited about that project also has 40 acres we're looking to do hemp next year as well okay um but there will be some licensing challenges to that that we're going to sort through over the next season um i have a another project developing in uh michigan right now in detroit um you know my consultants have managers on the ground handling day to day on the east coast uh out in in michigan um another one up in canada that we're discussing with um also in discussions with uh tcms which is the uh i mentioned them earlier yeah so um you know we're developing some pro we're talking about developing some programs to work together on in a jv a joint venture uh so a lot of projects and um of course always welcome more uh depends on what they are of course uh but um you know i have we have a great team and um you know we can take on most projects right on well i'm gonna put another one on your plate for the future whether it's michigan or washington or a future grow operation i'd love to film a can of cribs or deep roots episode with you you are a wealth of knowledge and i'd be uh you know very much looking forward to seeing one of your grow operations in person and and sharing that with the world i would love that nick that would be fantastic uh it'd be a lot of fun too i'd be loving it too you know and uh just to say the word and we'll get that set up uh have a number that uh in mind that i'd love to love to show you in fact that's awesome well thank you for joining me today jason um did we miss anything or anyone that you'd like to cover before we wrap up here um you know uh we i think we talked about a lot of good issues um you know i would say if you're we're talking about maybe some of the farmers are visiting you know i have another one that i'm uh working with uh actually that uh my friend that uh i got in this with that got cancer originally he owns a farm now that they're doing some very unique and interesting things with a sustainable growth there they took a you know dead and rotting trees out of the forest buried them underneath their plants uh to provide a source of food i mean talk about cleaning i haven't heard of that before 111 ranch 111 ranch check them out and uh they have a beautiful grow um but really i would say uh you know for other perspective growers out there looking to get into it or current growers that are struggling or have having issues just don't be afraid to ask don't be afraid to be wrong and don't be afraid to ask questions to people you know or don't know reach out you know make comments on the podcast you know get on instagram and ask questions to growers you never know where you may find an answer and again don't be afraid to research um because i am you know this is a growing industry and it's going to keep growing no pun intended so i'm just excited about uh just the growth and the evolution of it and yeah and maybe most importantly the the medicine yeah and being able to wake up and do what we love and helping people at the same time it's always a good feeling love what you do you never work a day in your life they say and i find that to be true yeah i agree well thank you so much for your time jason um i appreciate you and uh really looking forward to sharing all this knowledge with the world thank you so much nick i had a lot of fun today and uh yeah this was great and uh thank you very much take care hey thanks for joining us today i really appreciate your time and i hope you learned something new i want to show some love to quest for making this episode possible so we can continue documenting history with the pioneers of our global cannabis industry if you need help controlling your environment quest definitely has you covered you can check out all their different units at growershouse.com make sure to like subscribe and share this episode with your network and thank you again for listening if you have any recommendations of who we should interview next leave in the youtube comments", "0wfzdhzl1ts": "hello and welcome to the last episode of the mystifying medicine in this episode we will be exploring breast cancer pain reduction through the use of cannabis cannabis refers to a group of three plants with psychoactive properties known as cannabis sativa cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis these plants are made up of more than 120 components which are known as cannabinoids the main two components being cannabidiol CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol THC CBD is a chemical compound from the cannabis plant it's a naturally occurring substance that is used in products like oils and edibles to impart a feeling of relaxation and calmness unlike its cousin THC it's not a psychoactive THC is the chemical responsible for most of marijuana psychological effects it acts much like the cannabinoid chemicals made naturally by the body according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse THC stimulate cells in the brain to release dopamine creating euphoria according to the institute it also interferes with how information is processed in the hippocampus which is the part of the brain responsible for forming new memories cancer pain is a result of late stage metastatic cancers and primary and metastatic cancers that grow in the bone for a woman with inflammatory breast cancer pain or tenderness often is one of the first symptoms pain caused by cancer itself is more common in people who have metastatic or advanced disease breast cancer starts in the cells of the wrist a malignant tumor is a group of cancer cells that can grow into and destroy nearby tissue cancer cells can spread from the breast to other parts of the body and this spread is called metastasis if breast cancer spreads it usually spreads to regional lymph nodes these are lymph nodes on the same side of the body as the tumor in the following areas under the arm around the collarbone and around the breastbone currently the single lab is investigating the host response to cancer cell release signaling molecules they are currently investigating the mechanisms associated with cancer induced pain and cancer induced depression given the application of breast cancer pain and Canada we decided to ask dr. Gurmeet Singh a professor of pathology in molecular medicine at McMaster University a couple of questions Mead saying I'm a professor of pathology and molecular medicine and a senior scientist with the Hamilton health sciences so most of my research is involved in understanding how cannabis can be used for cancer induce pain and what we found is that currently there are no good treatments for calcium use pain and it appears that cannabis especially CBD might have an effect on cannabis induced pain so we've been looking at preclinical models of breast cancer which is taking marine samples like in in rats and treating them where the with the tumor and once the animals get into pain then we give them different doses of CBD or CBD plus THC or THC alone to see if it has any effects on cancer pain and currently it appears that there is some efficacy and there seems to be some sexual dimorphism that is males seem to be reacting better than females and we're trying to understand the mechanisms by which CBD and THC affect calendar's pain it appears that the immune system might be very important in in the generation of pain and CBD is known to affect the immune system specifically the macrophages and the t-cells and thereby it may have efficacy there are some reports saying that cannabis itself might be effective in limiting tumor growth but we ourselves haven't done any of this work that work has appeared in the literature especially from a group in Israel it appears that breast cancer also involves inflammation and interactions with the immune system and if anything the biological contribution is down regulation of the immune system by cannabis and thereby protecting the individual from cancer news pain most of this pains occurs in individuals who have breast cancer that has metastasized to bone and we in our models we look at what happens to the metastasis and it appears that cannabis limits metastasis and also is able to relieve pain to some degree we haven't really tested it in humans and these are very early preclinical studies we need to do a lot more in trying to understand the mechanisms by isolating the various t-cells and also understanding what happens to the hormonal levels in these individuals my name's Robin guard I'm a PhD student in gamete sings lab I'm in my fifth year and I study cancer pain and neuropathic pain so cannabis is funny because often treatments especially treatments for cancer or sometimes for pain will come from experiments in the lab basic science and they go to preclinical experiments and then they go to clinical trials and then they use them people but cannabis is a bit backwards since it is something that was used by a lot of people and then sort of demanded to be investigated in the lab so there's many reports there's a lot of case reports that cancer works for pain there are some clinical trial reports some small ones and there's a lot of basic science between it now I mean sorry supporting it but it's all very spotty nothing is really put together and cannabis is a complicated thing there's hundreds thousands of chemicals that come out of a cannabis bud and so nobody is quite sure what which of those chemicals are responsible for having an effect if any so the steps that need to be taken are isolating the compounds of interest doing proper preclinical science on them and doing clinical trials that can be reproduced and show an effect for cancer pain so a brief overview of cancer induced pain is I mean imagine imagine a tumor it's it's a clump of dysregulated cells if it's a solid tumor growing somewhere that it ought not to grow so what we often use in the lab is a model is breast cancer is growing in the bone so imagine this this massive", "pAOZ1Z_KFrw": "so we have a regime in Canada where there's actually laws that allow for recreational use as well as for medicinal use and the medicinal side patients have to register and the cannabis use has to be authorized by a physician rise on the recreational side basically anybody can go and buy cannabis at an approved licensed location so you have two regimes which I believe creates some issues when it comes to use on the medical for medical purposes because patients basically have open access to cannabis what we're seeing is that there's this expectation and the patient side that cannabis is going to be this wonderful treatment for their pain and on the science side there isn't the evidence to truly support that and so I feel very strongly that there's a there's a need for well conducted trials to truly evaluate the benefit of cannabis in this setting but it's almost like the horses are out of the barn patients want it and we have to find ways to better educate patients engage them as well as do the research to actually show whether it's going to be helpful or not as health care professionals we are because the scientific evidence isn't there there isn't the knowledge to use cannabis for medical purposes pain management for example in this setting and so we have a large information gap from the perspective of cannabis and its use in the setting which product to use how much THC how much CBD the dose which way and it should be administered so there's a lot of questions that as healthcare professionals we have and yet again I go back to my comment earlier that patients still want to use it so we have to find a way to embedder engage patients so the consultation service at our Center was really the result of clinicians telling us they were having patients ask them about the use of cannabis for medical purposes in the oncology setting and not knowing what to tell them we had developed some expertise within the pharmacy department I basically went to them and said we can do this we refer patients to us we screen patients we try to better understand what the patient expectations are in terms of the use of medical cannabis or cannabis for medical purposes we assess them in terms of their symptoms and then we feel if there's a need for cannabis or that cannabis may be an option once traditional ways of managing that say pain have been exhausted then we lead the patient and the clinician through the process of registering with with the government approved grower choosing the products and then dosing the product helping the patient go through the dosing of the medication to see if it's going to benefit them we also follow the patient to assess whether it's working or whether it's having any side effects so in a nutshell that's the program we're trying to ensure the safe use of cannabis for medical purposes in our patients can stay with the medical the cannabis side I think there are I actually believe there is a role for cannabis in the management about adverse effects of chemotherapy and/or the symptoms that cancer can cause itself there's a tremendous amount of research that needs to be done and that's the exciting part in terms of understanding the underlying mechanisms in terms of side effects and how cannabis can be used to address or to target these underlying mechanisms so we have a research program that we have started looking at very specific adverse effects of chemotherapy that may be immune related and how cannabis can actually modulate the immune system to reduce the side effects for example taxane acute pain syndrome is a is an area that we're very interested in we think that potentially fatigue could be managed by cannabis certainly anxiety seems to be a really important issue with with our patients and we've had some success in managing anxiety with with cannabis in that setting through our consultation service sleep disorders also seem to be at least from our experience and the consultation service seem to be amenable to the use of cannabis as well so I think there's a potential for a broad range of uses once we have the research to prove it", "3pBYi4LEEoE": "hello everyone my name is jen nolan and on behalf of muscadis gleedale australia i would like to warmly welcome you to our coadlow lecture online this evening i'd like to begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land from which we are broadcasting this evening and pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging musculoskeletal australia would like to thank spectrum therapeutics for their sponsorship of this evening's webinar which has enabled us to offer it free of charge it is important to state however that spectrum therapeutics has no editorial influence over the content of tonight's webinar our webinar aims to provide the community with an increased impartial and evidence-based knowledge of medicinal cannabis and its current availability in australia if you haven't previously viewed musculoskeletal australia's website i strongly suggest you do so in line with our focus on empowering consumers through education and support services we have a wide range of information videos webinars tools and services including our national helpline that is available via email and phone on 1-800 263 we also have the information about medicinal cannabis on our website now like to introduce you to mr rob anderson ceo of muscular skill australia to officially welcome you to tonight's lecture thanks jen i would also like to warmly welcome everyone to musculoskeletal australia's 2020 online coadlow lecture this evening the coedler lecture is a free public event that we've run over recent years and it's named in honor of our founder dr leslie coadlow more than 50 years on musculoskeletal australia's mission is to support people for better musculoskeletal health and one way we achieve this is by providing valuable up-to-date high quality information for people living with musculoskeletal conditions another way that musculoskeletal australia supports people is also to find out what people need and to that end we are currently conducting the largest national consumer survey of people living with musculoskeletal conditions or those caring for someone with a condition to determine how their care can be improved with only a couple of weeks left before the survey closes in late october i urge everyone to go to our website and complete the survey to have your say tonight's coadlow lecture is a great platform for msk to provide the community with the information they need and i sincerely wish to thank our presenters for this evening dr richard d natalin and professor ian mcgregor for giving of their time and expertise to provide us with information about an issue which is a significant community interest currently i'd also like to thank spectrum therapeutics for sponsoring this event i'd like to introduce our first speaker for this evening dr richard d natalie richard is a former leader of the australian greens and former senators from victoria richard was elected to the federal parliament in 2010 as the greens first victorian senator and became leader in 2015 prior to entering parliament richard was a gp and a public health specialist he has worked in aboriginal health hiv prevention and in the drug and alcohol sector richard is a strong advocate for drug law reform many thanks richard thanks so much and g'day everybody let me first acknowledge uh the traditional owners of the lands on which we all meet right across the country uh and thanks so much for uh inviting me to really give what uh i wanna give a very personal perspective of an issue that i've been involved with for for a number of years so i'm um somebody who trained as a gp uh somebody who worked um in the um area of public health and then moved into politics and and i did that because i i really wanted to address a number of issues that sort of set outside the um you know the sphere of influence you have you have as a doctor i'm not going to give you a technical presentation about the pharmacology of medicinal cannabis or going to great detail about the evidence base and so on you'll probably get a more technical overview from from me you know so i'll leave that to him but what you'll get from me is a sort of broad overview and and um some of the issues around access and and and the regulatory framework and how how that's been managed at the moment so um why does medicinal cannabis actually work it's interesting because when i trained as a medical student um the only real the message i got about cannabis was that it's harmful product um it's illegal uh stay away from it um we didn't even know there was something called the endocannabinoid system that's emerged only recently sort of through the 90s we came to understand that the body has a system which makes its own cannabis like molecules and they help to modulate a range of functions in the body so they become a way of sending messages to different cells in the body and they perform lots of different functions um so it really was as we started to understand more about this endocannabinoid system that we came to understand how cannabis interacted with that and how it actually produced a range of effects some of them are desirable and therapeutic there's an analogy with other drugs like opiates opiates are drugs that our body also makes we make our endogenous version of those drugs when you hear something with the word endogenous it just means our own body makes them and we have receptors which are basically the the part of the body that that those endogenous opiates bind to and that produces a series of responses and that's why drugs like codeine and pathadine and morphine work uh to reduce pain is because they're working on our own natural system uh that helps to modulate uh things like pain so we had an analogy the endocannabinoid system uh was a system that our body has which produces these molecules that are called cannabinoids and they're basically uh similar in structure to the drugs that we now know as medicinal cannabis now we've known for a long time next we've known for a long time that medicinal cannabis is effective and indeed it's cannabis has been used for thousands of years um and there's a long history of use and some of it uh in the case of it's used as treatments um through some traditional cultures and has been for for a long period of time um what we've learned uh over recent years is that the evidence base is now building for a range of conditions but it's important to say the evidence is still contested in some areas is some debate and it's also important to recognize when we talk about evidence sometimes we're having different conversations because within the medical sphere the gold standard for medical evidence is the randomized double-blind trial and we haven't uh had as many of those when it comes to medicinal cannabis uh as we've had for other well-known drugs but what we do know is that there have been other types of studies done as well as double-blind trials which are certainly increasing in frequency now but case studies can actually help us learn about the effect of particular substances of particular uh therapeutic agents so and and we can't dismiss the fact that a drug that has a long history of use many of the sort of unforeseen side effects that we might see with a new drug really aren't an issue there's also the question about what you're measuring when you're talking about the evidence of where the medicinal cannabis works are you talking about the whole plant or are you talking about the uh different compounds within the plant so the plant medicinal cannabis contains a number of different compounds it contains thc which is the substance that can make can alter your consciousness make you high as as it's described this cbd cannabidiol and there are other cannabinoids and indeed other substances within the medicinal cannabis plant and some people argue that it's the interaction of these different compounds that produces its effect and to complicate things further there are different concentrations in different strains of medicinal cannabis plants when it comes to thc cbd and the other compounds so some are high in thc some are low in thc and it depends on the therapeutic effect that you want so what we do know now is that of course sorry to complicate the matter even further is sometimes um we're talking about a medicinal cannabis that's consumed as an edible product because you can eat it but it can also be vaporized and smoked and so when we talk about the evidence we need to be really clear what are we measuring are we measuring the whole plant or are we talking about individual compounds and what's the method of ingestion what's the dosage all of those things are absolutely critical and because there's so much variation in terms of what has been tested if you like what's been assessed the evidence remains in some areas unclear in other areas contested however we do know that for some therapeutic conditions it's of a tremendous benefits the most commonly used or most common reasons for its use are for things like um to prevent nausea and as an appetite stimulant so for example people living with aids found that it worked as an appetite stimulant um as well as preventing the nausea that comes from many of the drugs that people have been provided we know this evidence around muscle spasms and for conditions like ms there's also now evidence but this is a much more complicated picture about its using pain conditions neuropathic pain cancer pain and other forms of pain now many people i'm sure this will be for many people listening of particular interest and i'm sure many of you also know that pain's very complicated because there are so many factors that contribute to the experience of pain but there is little doubt that many patients who do experience severe joint pain for example do find it a very useful addition to their treatment indeed we're now seeing that in some cases it's being worked as a substitute that's been used as a substitute for opiate treatment which carries its own set of problems look it's also fair to say that many of the advocates for medicinal cannabis talk about its properties across a range of areas including as a drug that fights cancer we do know that in vitro in the laboratory setting there might be some evidence that it has an effect but so far in practice uh we haven't seen that and uh and there's much more work to be done before we can say that it has a beneficial effect in that area we know that um it's also a drug that produces side effects now um someone uh once wisely said that there's no such thing as a side effect all drugs have effects uh there are the effects that um are of interest uh to people and if that's the major effect of a drug and it has few of the things we don't want then we call that um a medicine but ultimately all drugs have effects they have a range of effects and medicinal cannabis is no different um apart from some of the things that i described earth earlier in terms of the beneficial properties that we look for preventing nausea and appetite stimulant muscle spasms neuropathic pain of course epilepsy particularly particular forms of epilepsy in very young children we again we know that there is evidence emerging in that sphere as well but we also know that it can cause psychological a psychological response so the thc for some people is a pleasant side effect and indeed it's why it uh it is why we um are so being used as a recreational substance um but of course for others uh that altered state of consciousness can be problematic particularly for high thc preparations it can produce anxiety paranoia and lethargy in some people so um the you know like all drugs there are desirable effects and for some people undesirable effects the question around psychosis which is when i was training as a as a gp um was one that was again contested and it is complicated it doesn't appear that there's any strong correlation we do know that the issue around psychosis uh is as much around the proportion of thc and cbd and in fact the interesting thing here is that cbd which is within the medicinal cannabis plant is now being used or trialled um and there's uh there are some studies underway as a treatment for psychosis so the picture there again is complicated i think one thing to say is of course if you're a young person or got a very strong family history of psychosis it's something that should be avoided unless you have a a thorough consultation with somebody who's very experienced in in the field um in terms of safety uh again um it's it's important to look at this drug relative to other drugs there's no perfect drug some all drugs as i said have a range of effects one of the things about cannabis is there's no overdose potential so people don't die um they don't overdose from uh medicinal cannabis that's a huge positive when you consider that opiates are a major cause of of overdose and indeed in the u.s uh the numbers are upwards of 60 000 people per year who who um succumb so uh that's by no means trivial and and medicinal cannabis simply does not have any overdose potential i mean you can drugs like paracetamol which we think of as very very safe do um are they very safe drugs and take it when taking the right quantities but when taken in the wrong quantities can actually cause very severe damage to the liver so when we compare the harms of medicinal cannabis to other commonly used drugs and particularly its potential for overdose i think it's reasonable to say it's a relatively safe drug so there i was i suppose learning a bit uh learning more about this drug um as as this evidence sort of developed and ian will go into much more detail around the current state of play there but what was very clear to me was here we had medication that was providing benefit to people it was a drug that in terms of relative harms was uh less harmful than alcohol uh alcohol has a range of harms that simply don't exist for cannabis this was a drug that we knew had therapeutic properties and yeah and we also knew that many thousands and i've only learned i suppose through my time involved in this subject how just how many people are accessing it illicitly and being treated like criminals and while that was happening here in australia what we saw around the world was a number of jurisdictions starting to make medicinal cannabis available and so i became increasingly interested in what we needed to do here in australia to provide people with access to this drug knowing that it was of benefit to them and that's where i learned about dan haslam now lucy haslam may be known to some of you if you've been involved in this area for a while but lucy became involved with medicinal cannabis because her son dan was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer as a 20 year old young man one of the problems with his um treatment was he was getting just awful nausea and he was on having chemotherapy as a 20 year old kid he's getting not just nausea after treatment but he his nausea became so bad that he started to get anticipatory noise he would get nauseous even before treatment started just knowing what was coming up he was on some very heavy-duty anti-nausea drugs his mum who was a nurse um and had no experience with medicinal cannabis his father ironically was a a policeman involved in the drug squad they were both recommended medicinal cannabis from someone they gave it to him he got immediate relief and indeed it improved his quality of life immeasurably he started his nausea was under control his appetite came back and tragically he died in his mid-20s but his quality of life was significantly improved yet he was being treated like a criminal and so were many other families who were using it to treat any number of conditions so there i was i suppose in the senate faced with somebody who was uh it was a doctor and had uh an interest in in this area and had been watching the the field from a distance coming to learn about the stories of people who were getting benefit from the drug drug that had been used for many many years knowing that we've now got an endocannabinoid system that that is designed specifically it would seem for this drug to work on us we had gps who are becoming more interested in the field here in australia and yet people were being treated like criminals so the decision that needed to be made is what do we what do we do next what's what what is the way of trying to drive change in this area we weren't seeing it from within the pharmaceutical industry because there were a number of things working against the development of medicinal cannabis as a conventional pharmaceutical drug firstly there's a lot of stigma and controversy associated with its use but most importantly but this uh pharmaceutical companies rely on getting a patent and protecting their intellectual property to justify investment in new drugs so you have to be able to develop a new drug protect that development and you make money off that intellectual property but how do you get a patent for something that's effectively a natural plant that can be grown in a backyard where people can can grow it easily where there's a thriving black market and indeed in some cases we're going to compete against some of the other drugs that you make drugs like opiates for example which have proven to be very very profitable so there are a number of incentives working against the pharmaceutical pharmaceutical industry developing new products there are a couple of products available in australia but they're very expensive and for very limited indications so what we did was have a look at what other countries were doing and they recognized that with medicinal cannabis it had some unique properties in that a it was a plant easily grown illegal but with major therapeutic benefits and so they decided to set up an independent regulator statutory body responsible for regulating the use of medicinal cannabis products in a medical setting and um in many jurisdictions what they've done is said we're going to set up this special expert independent group and regulate it so we developed a bill a piece of legislation that would effectively do the same thing here in australia by way i mean um myself and then recruited uh labour party co-sponsor a liberal party co-sponsor national party co-sponsor and got independence also to agree common sense i think everybody recognized we needed to ensure that people could get access to this product and we took that bill around the country we had a number of senate hearings we worked as i said with politicians from right across the political spectrum and eventually we managed to get enough support that the government decided it would act however what the government decided to do and in retrospect i think it's been a very significant mistake they decided to use the existing regulator for medicines rather than do what our bill had proposed which was set up a standalone independent regulator specifically for medicinal cannabis and what that's meant is that access to medicinal cannabis is still wanting for many people so what the government has done is they've got the existing regulator called the therapeutic goods administration of the tga and what they do is they treat all drugs to be used in australia have to be registered and for them to get registered what usually happens is a pharmaceutical company puts in an application puts in a an evident a dossier of evidence if you like on the efficacy of the drug whether it works the safety manufacturing quality all of those things are done by a pharmaceutical company and a drug that's registered however we know as i've just said with medicinal cannabis pharmaceutical companies weren't lining up to do that and as a result what happened was we've got the current state of play where the tga has said well we're happy to register a product but we need it to be put through by a pharmaceutical company well that wasn't working so what the tga this body that regulates all medicines in australia has decided has has done is they've approved the use of medicinal cannabis only when a doctor requests special permission so there's something that the tga can use that's called the special access scheme it's for any drug that doesn't have registration in australia and that special access scheme if you're somebody with a terminal illness and somebody who's likely to die within six months a doctor can make an application and will get it however if your patient's not in that category a doctor needs to justify to the tga why this drug should be used and why other medicines in australia are not clinically suitable they have to go through a few hoops now once that's done unfortunately in some states there's another layer of bureaucracy that sits over the top of that and there has been some streamlining of that but um only very recently uh what needed to happen was then you needed to get approval from most state jurisdictions so from the perspective of the doctor if somebody comes in and wants to wants to try medicinal cannabis they may have neuropathic pain muscular spasms they may have joint pain the doctor first has to be a doctor that's interested in exploring this area and it's fair to say that there are many older conservative doctors who just simply are not interested and and don't uh accept that it's a legitimate treatment i think most doctors now accept that it has a role but doctors are still firstly finding it hard to access independent sources of education and advice many doctors are rightly skeptical and want until they are able to access that information we haven't got any gold standard for training in australia yet and then even if you do decide that you want to go down the path of prescribing it what you need to do is you need to then put an application into the tga so from the perspective of a doctor you can write a script which could be filled in a couple of minutes or for another drug or you can decide to go down this route which is going to be much more time consuming and it might not be something that you're convinced about anyway or have much experience in just too hard we won't do it so we've got a major problem at the moment with people being able to access it so the um uh the the next issue of course is that we still don't have products in australia that are available um in a way that's affordable for many people products are not subsidized at the moment and because uh they're not registered for use in australia they haven't been through that tga process there's no way of getting a subsidy like the pbs does for many other drugs and so the the many of the preparations are simply out of reach for many people so in light of all of that we had a senate inquiry the senate inquired which i chaired and we looked at what are the things that needed to change and really it's many of the things that i've already touched on already and i'm just looking at the time so i won't go into into great detail but a lot more needs to be done around educating medical professionals and providing them with independent accessible information should they need it and that's a unfortunately something that hasn't been done well the medical colleges many of them don't have the resources or indeed the commitment to want to take this on and um and it's really up to the initiative of individual doctors um the uh senate inquiry also interesting if you're interested in this by the way just google medicinal cannabis a senate inquiry and what you'll get is a an inquiry that there's really only one inquiry it talks about patient access so the piece around educating doctors was recommended they made it very clear that there needs to be an education campaign with the community they also made it very clear that what we should do is provide a pathway for doctors to get the appropriate training and then not have to use the tga approval process it's basically a script that should be written like any other script is written within the clinical setting and interestingly recommendation 5 says if all of this fails what we should do is have a independent regulator because it's clear that the current mechanism for deciding how and when it's used just isn't working and uh and i think we're so that the the the final slide which is where to from here is one that we need um to be i think working in two very distinct areas i think what we have to do is uh make sure that through the medical colleges um with the support of the federal government that we get a an accredited um a training program for gps who are interested in providing it and we do this already there are examples of this already we do this with methadone for example which was a drug that's used for people who are opiate dependent uh if you to become a methadone prescriber uh you do a short course and that allows you to be able to write a prescription uh in a way that uh in in some ways you write them for other drugs well there's no reason why we can't have that with medicinal cannabis and cut the application to the tga out of the equation it will give gps it will give gps some confidence that they need to know that they're up to date with the most recent literature and it would mean that um patients know uh who would who can provide it uh and who has the the knowledge and expertise in this field and i'm hopeful that ultimately we get the vast majority of gp's comfortable uh in ensuring that it is uh prescribed um if that's if i think we're back here uh in the next year and there is still no um advance uh in terms of gps being able to access information and prescribe it easily then i think it's there's no choice for the government but to recognize that this needs an independent regulatory framework and we return to the principle of a independent regulator but let me just finish with this we have a substance that we know alleviates pain and suffering for many many people we have a substance that has no potential for overdose we have a substance that when it's compared to other products that are uh particularly uh prescription medications is far safer and yet uh we have made it much more difficult to prescribe than much more dangerous drugs we have made it very difficult for patients to afford and we've for some of them treated them like criminals and given them criminal records for accessing what is a medicine and that's wrong and it needs to change and it's why i've been involved in the area for a number of years and why i hope to continue to stay involved until anybody who wants to try medicinal cannabis from the perspective of a health condition for which they might get benefit is able to do it easily and affordably that's really what my goal is is here thanks very much for sharing your incredible experience um and knowledge from particularly your time in parliament and and and you know your involvement with the senate inquiry and so on so um and and the fact that you're willing to stay involved in relation to this issue i think is is a wonderful thing i'd now like to introduce professor ian mcgregor ian is professor of psychopharmacology nhmrc principal research fellow and academic director of the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics in the brain and mind center at the university of sydney australia ian's historical research has focused on the effects of drugs on the brain and behavior and more recently on the discovery and development of new medications for the treatment of disease ian has a strong interest in the area of medicinal cannabis with more than 20 years of experience in cannabinoid research the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics was formed in 2015 with a gift of unprecedented generosity from the lambert family to the university of sydney the lambert initially aims to fast-track research into the therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids in various disease states and the lambda initiative is also engaged at a social and political level to improve community and professional education around medicinal cannabis and to bring about evidence-based regulatory change and improve patient access so ian i'll hand the microphone and the camera over to you thanks very much ian well thank you very much jane and it's wonderful to be here tonight and thanks for the opportunity to deliver the quad love lecture for 2020 alongside richard and a wonderful job richard i thoroughly enjoyed your talk and congratulations on all the wonderful work you've done in the medicinal cannabis space over recent years it's very much appreciated by patients and scientists alike and just a few disclosures there are mostly around companies whose products we've used for various clinical trials in the medicinal cannabis space i'd really like to start by thanking barry joy lambert who in 2015 gave this amazing gift to the university of sydney to establish the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics a kind of purpose-built research center for medicinal cannabis at the university of sydney and their story is a very interesting one and it relates to their granddaughter caitlin who suffers from a very severe form of epilepsy called rabbi syndrome and caitlyn was a very sick little girl aged about three her father michael lambert discovered that giving her what was then an illicit cannabinoid product that was sourced from denmark he was bringing it in illegally had a transformational effect on caitlyn's health and she went from having hundreds of seizures a week to having no seizures and essentially turned an incredible corner in terms of her health and well-being and she continues to have quite an incredible trajectory for a child with travis syndrome often they have severe disability moving forward many of them die before adulthood and caitlyn is doing extremely well and continues to do very well on cannabinoid medications and this story was what inspired the lamberts to set up the lambert initiative at the university of sydney by the way michael lambert did appear in court for his sins of um apparent sins of illegally procuring cannabis substances for his very old daughter and that reflects on richard's story that a lot of people are still criminalized for trying to help their loved ones in this space unfortunately barry has gone on to actually take a business interest in medicinal cannabis uh he didn't know much about cannabis in 2015 but has since formed a company called eco-fiber which sells and markets very successfully a range of mostly cbd rich products into the american market and uh i have no opinionary interest with eco fiber but it's interesting how he turned the story into something of an amazing commercial opportunity we are set up in the brain and mind center at the university of sydney we have terrific labs there where we do a whole range of different research projects and have terrific fun actually with a team of mostly very young scientists doing incredible work and our overall theme is to try and develop novel cannabinoid-based therapeutics to help alleviate human suffering it's a very exciting time to be in cannabis research of course cannabis itself is nothing new as a therapeutic as a 6 000 year history and and the current year of prohibition the past 90 years are basically a historical anomaly compared to the rich history that cannabis has as a therapeutic what recent times have taught us is a kind of advanced complexity around this ancient plant we're kind of in the era of cannabis 2.0 we now understand that there's more than 140 different molecules in the plant that we might call cannabinoids most don't actually get you stoned most they're not intoxicating but a lot of them appear to have therapeutic potential and different types of cannabis plants are enriched in different types of cannabinoids there are other bioactive components in the plant which include terpenoids and flavonoids and this plant seems to have a privileged interface with what we call the endocannabinoid system of the brain and body which richard referred to in his talk the endocannabinoid system is an incredible new frontier in pharmacology and physiology we knew nothing about this system 20 years ago and now we're learning a great deal about it there's basically no process in your brain and body that doesn't involve the endocannabinoid system there's a lot to learn about the system but it modulates very basic processes metabolism inflammation psychological processes like anxiety and fear metabolic processes and also heavily involved in disease states as well and we're trying to understand how the endocannabinoid system might change as a result of people being afflicted with various diseases and conditions uh two of the major endocannabinoid molecules and this this is quite technical but it's worth knowing their names amandamide and 2ag these are incredibly important molecules in your body it doesn't matter where we look in the body you'll find endocannabinoids you'll find the endocannabinoid system you'll find the nandamide in 2ag so if you look in skin it's full of endocannabinoids and various proteins that we interact with if you look in the gut then you have endocannabinoids galore there if you look at joints you know for example your knee joint the synovium there's a very complex endocannabinoid system there and this brings forward the idea that if we can modulate the endocannabinoid system and it appears the cannabis plant has privileged access to that system then you can gain a great therapeutic advantage in terms of trying to alleviate disease and suffering we're also using our knowledge of the endocannabinoid system to better understand what are very widely used traditional medicines so we learned recently for example that one of the actions that panadol has not the toxic action on the liver but its effects on on pain and inflammation seems to involve fairly direct modulation of the endocannabinoid system so when you're taking panadol you're actually really taking a cannabinoid not a lot of people realize that um another really interesting thing is that people vary in terms of their endocannabinoid systems this is a fascinating story from scotland my home country of a woman who had a funny genetic mutation which meant that her endocannabinoid system was overactive she had huge concentrations of endocannabinoids in her blood in her brain and her body and they discovered this because she went in to have fairly serious surgery for osteoarthritis and the doctors soon realized that this woman had really severe joint degeneration normally that they associated with a great deal of pain but she seemed to feel no pain from her condition whatsoever and when they probed her surgical history they found that she'd have various dental and other medical procedures it would normally be very painful but she never required any pain relieving medication when she was cooking in the kitchen she'd often burn herself and she'd only realize she was burning herself because she smelled her own flesh burning that's fairly grotesque by the testament to how she felt very little pain and she could eat the hottest of chili peppers without any discomfort when they asked her about anxiety and depression she never feared anything and on scale psychometric skills she scored very low for anxiety and depression what cases like this tell us is that if you have up regulation of the endocannabinoid system you seem to be able to make pain disappear and also alleviate anxiety and depression and that gives us great hope that some of the cannabinoids present in the plant may actually have this direct line to the endocannabinoid system to cause pain relieving and also major effects on anxiety and depression so at the lambert initiative we're trying to deconvolute the plant we're trying to interrogate the actions of these endocannabinoids and without getting too technical i'll tell you that these days a lot of uncovering of interactions between drugs and their targets is done in computers so we do a lot of high-end computational work modeling how cannabinoids interact with cells in the body and their receptors and we also physically do work where we look at these cannabinoid effects on receptors particularly receptors that we know are related to pain and inflammation and epilepsy and other medical conditions we also run a lot of cellular models of disease so we can take cells from the knee for example from patients that have arthritis that show inflammation and we can apply cannabinoids to these cells in a test tube and find out which cannabinoids are best in terms of reducing inflammation we do the same with cancer we kill cancer cells routinely with various cannabinoids and also we have many brains actually from epilepsy patients which show abnormal electrical activity don't worry the brains are conscious but we can use these brains to look at how cannabinoids interact with epilepsy type electrical activity in these brains and we also run animal models we have mice that have the same sort of epilepsy that caitlin does caused by a genetic mutation and also animal models of arthritis and cancer addiction and that allows us to very quickly uh try and find the best cannabinoids for various disease conditions but we also do a lot of work with humans we do a lot of clinical trials and we partner with various minister cannabis companies and universities around the world to run these clinical trials and as richard mentioned in his talk there's still a lot of uncertainty about the evidence base for medicinal cannabis and the best way to convince doctors to prescribe medicinal cannabis is to provide them good quality evidence from clinical trials and we've recently continued trials for example in youth anxiety and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and effects on driving as well in the netherlands we've got currently running trials and things like tourette's syndrome insomnia exercise and endurance we also have a number of trials launching soon richard mentioned the antipsychotic effects of certain cannabinoids we're involved in a big study down in melbourne that's launching soon around that also there seems to be effects on addiction say alcohol dependence and methamphetamine dependence we're running trials on on these conditions and also pain with spinal cord injury and sleep so there's an awful lot of exciting clinical research to be done and we're very happy and privileged to be involved in that research and if you're interested in getting involved in clinical trials at the landmarks initiative then please go to our website and you can actually put your name down or on the list or yeah as someone that would like to be recruited for these trials another thing that we do is politics and policy that's a picture of me and my colleague jonathan arnold about to appear in front of richard's senate inquiry and that was a very important landmark in patient access so we do a lot of work on that and a lot of our research is around the kind of subterranean world of people in australia who can't access official medicinal cannabis and are using illicit cannabis and i'll talk a little bit more about that later on this evening another thing we do is we hear a lot of patient stories my email inbox is often uh full of stories from patients who've kind of reached the end of the road in terms of what conventional prescription medications can offer them this is an example here my husband's 55 years old he's in constant pain he's crushed vertebrae extensive arthritis bulging discs sleep apnea he cries through the night because he's in so much pain he's on the highest doses of pain relief legally allowed and the only pain specialist has just left our country town the current pain release not working i'm seeking alternatives uh would he be a good candidate for your studies if there are any trials for pain relief coming up could you please consider him so these are the sort of heart-rending stories that we often hear and we're very very keen to try and alleviate this extreme suffering that so many people experience in australia and we're keen to see whether medicinal cannabis offers a root away from that suffering and this is typical of the medications that our chronic pain patient is on you can see a pre-gabbling you can see heavy-duty opioids you can see ibuprofen and aspirin as well so there's not much more that conventional medications can offer to this per patient so what do we do in this case how do you access medicinal cannabis in australia well as richard outlined there's a range of products that can be obtained but it's something of a convoluted process because these are mostly unregistered medicines and you have to use a special access scheme from the tga to get hold of them nonetheless there's still 60 000 approvals that have been granted since this scheme started in late 2016 involving around 25 000 patients and 1500 doctors we were very frustrated through 2016 17 and 18 because the numbers were so low but there's been quite a remarkable increase in numbers particularly over the last year and a half and i think the latest figures in september there was more than six 000 approvals and this what this tells patients is basically it is possible for you to get hold of medicinal cannabis and many other people are the sort of conditions that people are getting approvals for are quite varied but as you'll see from this graph the vast majority are actually for chronic pain and there's also cancer pain neuropathic pain migraine fibromyalgia in the top 10 and anxiety is the second most common condition for which people get an approval for medicinal cannabis products a revolution in some ways has occurred with cannabis clinics opening in a lot of capital cities and this kind of guarantees a patient that as long as you're prepared to outlay 300 or 400 dollars you can see a doctor who's specialized and knowledgeable about the medicinal cannabis area and the problem is of course if you go to your regular gp he or she may or may not be educated around medicinal cannabis and a lot of them are still very uncertain and reluctant to prescribe so going it bypasses that process i have no financial interest in any of the clinics but i think it's important for you to know that that is an option if you're interested in trying medicinal cannabis and you can certainly find out information about these clinics on the web there's a wide range of products available and from your doctor through the special access scheme and most of them contain thc or cbd or a mixture of these two cannabinoids and there's actually quite a bamboozling array of products there's more than 150 medicinal cannabis products that are currently available in the australian market and medicinal cannabis is not necessarily what you think if you're thinking of old style cannabis that you roll into a joint or whatever more than 50 50 of the products are oils so you take these orally uh rather than smoking them there's also a fair number of capsules 16 of the products are capsules there's also oral sprays as well that you spray into your mouth there is cannabis flower material available about 17 of the current products are what we call cannabis flower or cannabis floss but rather than rolling them into a joint in the old traditional style these are vaporized usually so you get a vaporizer that heats up the cannabis you inhale the vapor and that avoids pyrolysis that involves smoke which is really bad for your lungs so the important thing to know is if you go to a cbd only product there'll be no intoxication but if you go to higher doses of thc containing products then you get intoxication with higher doses and that's an issue that can be managed but if you've never been intoxicated with thc before then you may find it quite unusual and it's better to titrate upwards if you're starting a thc product start from a very low goals and build up gradually over time there's a lot of good resources for you to learn more about medicinal cannabis recently the national prescribing service uh opened an excellent website uh nps for orgone eu which explains medicinal cannabis and how to access it very well both for consumers and also for doctors as well so that's an excellent resource there the tga itself also has very good consumer information so there's no real reason for you to be left in the dark about this area if you know where to look i'll also give a paper that came out last week that comes from our group which is a kind of simple how-to guide for prescribing medicinal cannabis and has a lot of the key information in the four or five page simple to understand document and that's a free download from australian prescriber so does medicinal cannabis work and and what are the side effects what what can you expect well let's have a look at thc first as i've mentioned it's the main intoxicating compound in cannabis so if you take a high dose of thc you get quite stoned and we know that's through an action of what's called cd1 cannabinoid receptors part of the endocannabinoid system when thc hits that receptor then that causes intoxication but lower doses of thc are thought to have therapeutic properties at levels that may not actually intoxicate you so it's important to divorce the loados and high dose effects thc has actually been available for decades as a drug called granabinol and it's been prescribed in countries other than australia for for quite a long time and the sort of things it's useful for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting as richard mentioned a lot of cancer patients get very sick when they're given chemotherapy and throw up and feel nauseous and thc has a good effect on that anorexia during palliative care and also with hiv aids there's evidence for that chronic pain and also spasticity and multiple sclerosis and there's a whole lot of interesting emerging indications as well we're starting to get an indication that thc may have some value in dementia and also tourette's syndrome and also in insomnia as well and here's a study that we were involved in with some oncologists at the lifehouse center in sydney and it verified the value of thc cbd containing capsules for people that had chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting that wasn't being helped by standard treatment so refractory cinv and this proves the point i think that cannabinoids can move in when conventional medications fail and produce a useful therapeutic effect there's also some good evidence from other uh trials of ms spasticity in fact this spray called sativex which contains thc and cbd has been used for many years for spasticity in multiple sclerosis the painful muscular spasms that people with ms experience and this is the only cannabinoid product that's currently registered in australia uh sanivex we've got a trial underway in queensland for tourette's syndrome for people that have uncontrollable ticks and we're starting to get an interesting signal from this trial that one of the conditions is placebo control so we don't know which one but one of them seems to be causing quite a remarkable reduction in tanks so we'll know the final answer to that question at the end of the year that that involves thc as well there's also some remarkable data from israel this is a very large um study of almost three thousand i think cancer patients with advanced cancer looking at what happens when they take a cannabis product for six months uh this is cannabis plant material and you if you look at the pain intensity rating at the beginning of the study before treatment there's 253 patients that rate their pain intensity as 10 129 at 9 23 at 8. so these are people really severe pain and after six months on cannabis you can see that very few patients had pain ratings that high and there was also remarkable improvements in quality of life in the study the tga has summarized the evidence themselves around medicinal cannabis and its then treated chronic non-cancer pain and they were quite cautious in a way but they did conclude and i'm sorry for this very busy table but if you focus just on the punchline down the bottom of the slide they concluded that the overall evidence is not very good and there's not that many robust clinical trials we're always looking for very good quality clinical trial evidence and unfortunately with cannabis the quality has not been that good historically it's been quite difficult to do clinical trials with cannabinoids but despite that they still concluded that there was moderate evidence that cannabinoids were effective in providing as much as a 50 percent reduction in pain so that's that's the tga the side effects to look out for well always good as i said earlier to titrate your cb your thc doses upwards gradually to avoid these side effects the higher doses can cause dizziness confusion cognitive impairment and some anxiety and paranoia in vulnerable individuals and if you have a family history of mental health problems particularly schizophrenia you'd probably best avoid at least higher doses of thc whether there are side effects or beneficial effects you may know appetite stimulation of thc and unusually good humor i'm not sure if that's a side effect or not and some people that have used thc for a long long time get a mild withdrawal syndrome when they come off it but it's nothing like the withdrawal that you see with opioids or with benzodiazepines there is an issue with driving a thc can cause a modest short lasting driving impairment and a slightly increased risk of a crash at very high doses t of thc this is sort of equivalent to low doses of alcohol but not higher doses of alcohol and in regular cannabis users we actually see substantially less driving impairment and in some measures of driving thc actually appears to reduce risk drivers appear to compensate for the presence of thc drive more slowly and leave a larger distance between them and the car in front and overall the risk with cannabis appears less than prescription medications where driving is actually legal so benzodiazepines opioids said drugs anti-histamines all impaired driving but there's no roadside broad testing for these substances with cbd there doesn't appear to be any driving impairment and i think we need to tweak the legislation in australia to better reflect actual risk that cannabis poses of course if you're on a thc product then you have no exemption from roadside drug testing so it's good to be aware that if you're taking a thc medication recently and you're probably vulnerable to giving a positive roadside drug test for at least six hours afterwards and we've done quite a lot of work on that and shown that the current roadside drug testing technologies are actually quite unreliable so some unlucky people may still give a positive test 24 hours later even when there's very little thc in their saliva while other people even 10 minutes after they've taken thc will give a negative test so the roadside testing technology is really not very good at all but you do run a risk under current legislation of being criminalized for driving under the influence of thc and we know this is a substantial disincentive for people joining our clinical trials where there's thc medications involved okay let me just tell you a little bit now about cbd it's the non-intoxicating cannabinoid it has a whole bunch of neurochemical actions that are very interesting but it doesn't hit the cb1 cannabinoid receptor like thcs so it doesn't get you intoxicated the way that thc does it seems to increase concentrations of endocannabinoids in the brain and the body and it has strong anti-inflammatory effects in a lot of the cellular models and animal models that we look at and recently the tga approved a cbd product called epidialex for pediatric epilepsy and this is very similar to what caitlin lambert was given illegally back in 2015 by her father she was obviously way ahead of her time and that that medication is now an approved medication five years later has taken all this time for the regulators to catch up and there's a whole load of very interesting and merging indications for cbd and uh as a new york times uh magazine said recently can cbd really do all that there's a huge amount of height that cbd is like a universal panacea and can relieve everything from depression to arthritis to diabetes to cancer to brain injury and we certainly need more signs to work through these um these claims and as with thc and cannabis in general there's generally a lack of high quality research and say with musculoskeletal diseases a recent review said that basically there's not anything other than anecdotal accounts and retrospective reviews so we desperately need to do high quality clinical trials of cbd in the pain arena this is it's already the case that many australian patients are using cbd for pain so if we go back to this slide the s4 category of medications in australia the medicinal cannabis products are cbd products so you can see from this graph but a lot of chronic pain patients and cancer pain and neuropathic pain patients are using cbd dominant products we just don't have any clinical trial evidence that they weren't but i assume that if people are using these products then they must do something useful one thing that we recently gathered evidence for with cbd was anxiety and we showed in a clinical trial in melbourne with the origin group the 12 weeks of treatment with cbd at quite high doses had quite a remarkable effect on young people with anxiety disorders and again these were sort of the the really hard cases these were young people who hadn't benefited from seeing a psychologist or from anti-depressant medication and we treated them in this clinical trial with um escalating doses of cbd and capsules over 12 weeks from 200 milligrams up to 800 milligrams i've really got quite a remarkable effect a highly significant reduction in their anxiety and impairment at week 12 or on two different measures of anxiety and also reduction in depressive symptomatology depression and anxiety often go hand in hand and their overall occupational functioning and social functioning their ability to get out the house and to make their way in in the outside world was greatly improved so there's a lot of a lot of promise there with higher doses of cbd in intractable anxiety and we need more and larger clinical trials to cement this effect in many countries around the world you can just walk into a health food store or a pharmacy and get cbd over the counter this is a shot i think in chicago the two of us cbd topical uh which is claiming to have some anti-pain effects you can even get cbd in your ice cream it's all become a little bit crazy in some ways in the usa the range of cbd products that are available and there's a lot of hype about lodo's cbd and sports we've got bubba watson there the top golfers swearing by the use of cbd it helps with his body and helps with his anxiety and i think most of the rugby players in the uk at the moment are on cbd to help them with recovery from matches and and cbd is widely available over the counter in the uk in fact this is me in my hometown of edinburgh walking into uh honda barrett in princess street to get hold of some five percent cbd i use it for tennis actually it seems to improve my very lousy game the thing about the over the cancer products is that they're very low doses so typically 10 to 100 milligrams of cbd whereas when we get to treating epilepsy or severe anxiety we're dealing with losses of 300 to 1500 milligrams so there's a real question mark around the evidence base for these logos cbd products interestingly in australia the tga has come out with an interim decision which may allow these logos cbd products to become over-the-counter medications in australia during 2021 but they're only allowing a recommended daily dose of up to 60 milligrams so while this is a really welcome development in terms of improving patient access to cbd there's a lot of uncertainty over whether these very low doses do anything in particular and uh some evidence has come recently from new zealand and in a study of uh patients who are prescribed cbd uh there was an encouraging signal with things like pain and discomfort and people who had lung cancer pain but also anxiety and depression so we certainly need better evidence that the evidence is starting to accumulate that needs to be consolidated and one of the key trials that we'll run at the lambert initiative next year is to look at low-dose cbd in adults older adults who have multi-moderate insomnia and we'll give half of them placebo and half of them are a low dose of cbd over 12 weeks escalating from 20 up to 60 milligrams and we'll hope to have a positive effect on their insomnia but also on anxiety pain moods cognitive function and quality of life so this is really a flagship study for us and moving forward another really important study i mentioned earlier people who suffer spinal injuries have to deal with the devastation of what that causes but to add further cruelty and about half of them experience chronic neuropathic pain as a result of their injury and we have a theory about what's going on in the brain with these patients and we have a theory that cbd may be able to turn down the pain signal and we're going to run a clinical trial and combine that with brain imaging and this is luke henderson sasha and sherry and elizabeth cairns from the lambert initiative they're going to run this trial and this could be a real major breakthrough in terms of cbd's use and intractable chronic pain some final thoughts just to close out my lecture and we have maybe 30 000 patients getting official cannabis by the end of this year that's great but the australian government's own figures from the australian institute of health and welfare suggest that 600 000 australians are currently using medicinal cannabis so 570 000 are probably using illegal products and richard referred to this gap between the legal scheme and what's actually happening on the ground and we published a paper recently where we surveyed 40 nearly 1400 australians that were using medicinal cannabis and found that only one in 30 of them were actually accessing their cannabis legally so that's a huge number of people that are continuing with illicit cannabis to treat their medical conditions and who suffer the risk of being criminalized if they fall into the criminal justice system and when we look to the conditions that these people were self-medicating with what's it cannabis for pain was 37.5 of the total of uh main conditions cited for use of cannabis and back pain was particularly prevalent prevalence as well as arthritis nerve pain and fibromyalgia and also a lot of mental health conditions that were being self-medicated as well so we still have a long way to go in terms of bridging that gap between the official scheme and illicit use one reason for encouragement is australia has a lot of clinical trials around medicinal cannabis when we last counted there was more than 60 and we're probably one of the best countries in the world for doing clinical trials for medicinal cannabis we have a great health system and we have access to um i guess reasonably reasonably good quality products for these trials another final point which i think is a very important one is that we've seen worldwide the huge problems with prescription opioids and richard referred to this in his talk and particularly the mortality with you know 60 or 70 000 deaths in the u.s last year mostly from fentanyl and oxycodone and heroin overdoses and an interesting thing that seems to happen when medicinal cannabis becomes legal in various u.s states there's 25 percent reduction in opioids overdose mortality according to the studies so when cannabis becomes available people use less prescription opioids and other studies suggest people use less lyrica and gabapentinoid type drugs and also benzodiazepines so that in itself is probably a good reason to improve access because medicinal cannabis i think is a lot less harmful certainly than the opioids and the benzodiazepines we at the lambert initiative will continue to try and build a better cannabis and in our research where we've got some of these plant components that aren't thc or cbd that look very exciting we have one called cbc that has very strong anti-anxiety effects cbg seems to be showing quite remarkable effects against inflammation cbga is an anti-convulsant and we're also working on a range of new molecules that seem to just give the endocannabinoid system a big boost and by doing that they've reduced pain anxiety and depression so it's a very very exciting time to be involved in this field and thank you so much for the opportunity to give this lecture well well thank thank you ian for uh such a comprehensive presentation that really sort of walked us through so many aspects to do with medicinal cannabis so um so that was really fantastic it certainly increased my understanding quite a lot and i i'm sure it did with many members of the audience um richard maybe a question for you to start with someone has asked whether it's possible to confirm if medicinal cannabis is an item that could be purchased with home care package funds or is that something uh that is probably quite particular right it's it's quite a specific question i guess yeah i i i doubt it i think unfortunately the access pathways as we've described and it's very hard to see how um the government would permit the use of those funds to access um medication like this so i think that's unlikely doesn't mean it's the right decision i think ultimately what we really are aiming for is to have a product that you know all products the many many different products but to have a range of products that are affordable and one of the other recommendations in the uh senate inquiry was that if we can't if we don't achieve that through just um having uh more products come online and cost come down then ultimately uh we need to set up some sort of subsidy scheme and um and that would be you know that's that's something that the committee recommended but i suspect particularly at the moment the government's not particularly keen to to come out thanks richard um and ian a question for you the use of medicinal cannabis as a sort of a complementary medicine to other forms someone mentions about taking medicinal cannabis alongside chemotherapy what are your comments in relation to that in a sort of a complementary sense well i think the evidence is fairly good now that um you can get relief from some of the adverse symptoms of chemotherapy with um particularly thc but cbd may also have a wall as well and we've certainly shown up with nausea and vomiting but a lot of people actually develop neuropathic pain neuropathy as a result of chemotherapy particularly drugs like that and um depending on animal models it seems the prevention of that kind of neuropathy with cannabinoids as well so it's certainly worth considering and and i think that recent study from people grimacing was just published last month may reverberate around the world actually in terms of clinical practice and that is the hope that you know we're doing these clinical trials to try and change the way that doctors behave and to give patients a better chance of a therapeutic response particularly in you know areas like cancer where there can be quite extreme suffering the in sorry richard a question for you um just someone's commenting it's strange that medicinal cannabis is controlled by the poison standard in australia well um the i think ian touched on it the there's a very long history around the use of cannabis uh in any setting and um that has been responsible for really holding back a lot of the um developments that we've we're now starting to see is the drugs officially illegal and uh that made that made it very difficult and that's by not by um dint of uh just australian law that's an international convention on the use of drugs uh effectively prohibited the use of cannabis now um that's changed recently but it's it is one of the reasons why we you know we're only starting now to see you know the the field flourish and the i think potential of the very many different preparations starting to be explored now ian could probably talk about the many obstacles i suspect they've had to confront over their uh years in this field sorry i used to joke that uh be easier to you know land a chimp on the moon than to run a clinical trial with with this whole cannabis and that's that's what it was like uh certainly in the early days that there was no familiarity around clinical trial ethics and governance for these products that's one of the reasons that our flagship driving study we did in the netherlands because we could actually give people cannabis products and allow them to drive on on real roads and so i think it'd be fair to say that as of 2019 2020 there's a lot better understanding around clinical trial governance and in fact talking to overseas companies they sort of hold australia up as a great destination to do their clinical trials so so that that's been a bit of a change and i think one of the key things is actually to differentiate cbd and thc is as soon as governance and ethics and doctors understand that difference and you're running a cbd trial everything becomes much much easier um there's still issues with thc and particularly recruiting patients when we tell them that they're on a thc product and they can't drive for 12 weeks for the duration of the trial that's terribly difficult and we probably lose about 50 of our potential recruits for trials as a result of that single item and and then um a question regarding the efficacy of edible versus vaporized medicinal cannabis it's a very good question i have some colleagues who work in pain meds and who say that vaporized is good for breakthrough pain because it's fairly instantaneous so you know you'll feel the effects within two or three minutes so um whereas oral you have a very different what we call pharmacokinetics so how quickly the drug comes on and how quickly it disappears so with oral products you probably are waiting a couple of hours before you get the peak you may feel them within half an hour or so so you get a kind of longer more sustained therapeutic effect with your products but if you have something that he's dealt with very rapidly for example breakthrough pain then vaporized might be best and richard um a question regarding does does each doctor have to apply to the tga to access medical cannabis for prescription or does the tga issue one permit for all prescribers no so um i should have said this in my talk you can become an authorized prescriber that is also another pathway however that is notoriously difficult and there are very few authorized prescribers in australia and they're for a very narrow set of conditions i think largely for pediatric epilepsy maybe almost exclusively neurologists so you can't become an authorized prescriber easily it's as i said almost impossible and uh to my knowledge there aren't there may be one or two gps but certainly not more than that in the country um the other pathway requires you to apply individually for each patient and what's worse is at least at the time of the senate inquiry is that your approval was valid only for a specific preparation and so if you wanted to try something else or now the cheese you have said they were looking at it at the time but look it was very difficult you had to basically justify you you would get approval for that patient for that preparation uh and um unfortunately anybody else you you had you have to go through the same the same process it's it's fair to say that the process has become more streamlined it was very difficult in the early days but even so if you're a gp and you're sitting there and you might have you know if you're lucky your gp spends a bit of time with you but the difference between seeing a few extra patients each day is either write the script for the drug that you can get very quickly or spend a few minutes um and it can be five minutes ten minutes uh going through this process and and in some ways having your i suppose clinical judgment questioned by the tga um gps just don't like doing that that's a that's a barrier and so i think that i touched on this earlier i think that one pathway through this is similar to what we've done with other drugs is that trying to build uh an authorized prescriber pathway for gps who can demonstrate they've done some basic training they're up to date with the literature they basically are now um have have some knowledge and expertise in the field and they're now authorized prescribers and they can basically prescribe this in the same way prescribe other medicines that's the way to fix it i think thanks for that richard um ian a question um is there any concern in prescribing uh medicinal cannabis for people with cognitive decline could could it um confuse uh increase confusion in any way it's a very interesting question and very valid question as well with um cbd we know that it has quite strong neuroprotective effects so certainly in animal models it seems to reverse some of the neural degeneration that you get there's some very good australian research actually with um animal models of alzheimer's disease where cbd's had quite remarkable effect in restoring cognitive function we're yet to see that in human clinical trials yet but it's an interesting signal um another thing that is interesting with thc is again in animal models i mean we know that thc tends to impair cognition particularly in young people but uh in animal models of dementia it seems to restore cognition which is quite incredible uh there's also a signal coming from western australia a small study that was done for when you give thc to patients with agitation and dementia and we've all seen with the royal commission into nursing homes the the the the chemical restraint and and the the royal commission into disability as well the issue of restraint with antipsychotic drugs and benzodiazepines a major one and what we're starting to see in very small studies is if you give thc and cbd together in agitated patients then there may actually be a a beneficial effect in terms of reducing agitation that's one of the trials that we hope to run a large trial on in the next couple of years because it's such a major issue for for nursing homes and people in the in in elderly care richard um someone's asked about uh how would you find out find a rheumatologist that might consider the prescription of medicinal cannabis should it be appropriate is it is it a matter of uh just raising it with your rheumatologist and um and uh you know finding a rheumatologist i guess there's no particular list around a specialist would there be no it's a good question and unfortunately we you know a lot of this is word of mouth i think ian mentioned this these new cannabis clinics but it's you know it's a few hundred bucks three or four hundred bucks just for a console um and so most people just don't you know why should they have to pay that i mean to access what could be a you know very effective therapy so um beyond that it really is word of mouth and i as far as i'm aware i don't know that there's any publicly accessible information on uh doctors who have expertise in this field uh as is always the case whenever you've got something like this there are always people also um who seek to make a quick buck out of it as well and so you've got to be careful uh that who you're talking to is reputable um i think most you know most gps would absolutely who are keen to prescribe it will will have done their homework but unfortunately unless ian's got any other suggestions uh it's largely word of mouth um and asking your gp if they if they don't can they recommend somebody who does ask this as your rheumatologist if they don't uh ask somebody who does uh and if they're not health um find someone who is i think i think that is probably would that be your opinion ian that it is pretty much word of mouth it is i mean there's you can go to the access clinics and they probably know which specialists are savvy in this area but as richard said you're probably up for 300 or 400 dollars to get that information um i i know a very good rheumatologist but i will mention his name in this forum but we're doing some research with him at the moment and getting some extraordinary effects in models of arthritis that we want to take into uh so they do exist and you may have to shop around and maybe if you have a conversation with your rheumatologist they might be able to refer you onto someone i mean i i think it's changed a lot in the last three or four years with doctors i think they're much more savvy about this area and we still particularly in some specializations have a lot of skepticism you know we did a survey recently of gastroenterologists and only 20 of them wanted to prescribe as as of 2020 so that was a little bit disappointing but in psychiatry and neurology and maybe maybe in pain medicine to a certain extent as well we're getting more positive responses from from pain medicine specialists and addiction medicine as well we're starting to see this tide of change and i think maybe doctors and specialists fear they may be left behind if they don't at least learn about this they don't necessarily have to embrace it wholeheartedly but the more patients ask them about it the more they'll be forced to upskill in this area which is tremendously important for them to do that that's that's very true um in just a very important point and richard just sort of raised this in his last comments uh the difference between medicinal cannabis and the cannabis that the the local dealer might grow in their backyard i think that importance of actually getting good quality product um you know what what should the sort of the average community member who's interested in medicinal cannabis or finding out about it what what they should what should they be wary of in relation to this particular issue i'll go to you first in well one of the most fun studies i've ever been involved in we had the new south wales police bring us i think more than 250 bags of weed that they confiscated from i think mostly the byron bay music festival but a variety of other locations um and we analyzed the street cannabis it actually came from all around new south wales and what we found was that there was only five or six samples that actually had any cbd in them so the problem i think is that street cannabis and i'd love to repeat that study just to prove that nothing's changed but overwhelmingly i think street cannabis tends to be thc dominant so you're unlikely to get cbd and unless you can find a source and these sources do exist with people who have more of a medical um flavor to to their illegal supply and there are people that do that and but yeah the the problem with getting an illicit supply is probably that you're going to get very high thc cannabis with no cbd so you'll miss the benefits that cbd can offer but there's also issues with you know was a pesticide or a fungicide used in the growth of that cannabis um if it's an oil where solvent you know sometimes butane is used lighter fuel is used to extract cannabinoids now i don't want to scare monitor but but you know if you don't know the provenance of your cannabis product then you do run that risk and that's why we need a much better official scheme uh in australia so that people can benefit from quality assurance or around official products um richard did you have a last comment in relation to that issue what would you advise you know patients that you may have seen yes um i think alien's right just on the seat on the thc cbd issue just it's important to sort of spell out that the cbd and the reason that's in like quantities in street cannabis is that modulates against the effects of the thc so the thc makes you high the cbd in some ways prevents some of the action that action and therefore most of the stuff you get on the street is very low in cbd so that people can experience the euphoria and there's nc lose some of those benefits the other thing that's interesting is as ian said there are people who specifically supply medicinal cannabis products illicitly but even where that market's been tested there's huge variation in terms of what people are getting in terms of the quantities of cbd and indeed in some there were some operations that had almost none undetectable levels so if you're getting your medicinal cannabis product illicitly you may be getting a decent product but you may be getting something that as ian said is potentially dangerous but huge variation in terms of what's available so really the only way to be sure is to get something uh through a regulated market and that's where my interest here is to try and put some quality control have a regulated market gives doctors confidence no you know in terms of knowing obviously what they're prescribing and people confidence in knowing uh what they're getting so it comes back to that question of trying to find a gp who can prescribe you a product uh which has gone through a rigorous quality control process otherwise you just don't know what you're getting that's right that's right look that's uh we've reached the sort of the end of our um we've hit our finishing time now and i'm very aware of not keeping our presenters uh much longer and there have been some unanswered questions but we certainly uh i think ian and richard were very generous in trying to get through as many questions as they could listen i would like to thank you both because i think tonight's been fantastic to just give a improve people's understanding around medicinal cannabis some of the issues uh in the research area also at the sort of political and legislative area so it's been really fantastic to just have this discussion and put it out there for the community and hopefully increases increase under people people's understanding and knowledge around the current situation in australia so ian richard i'd like to on behalf of musculoskeletal australia thank you both very much for your generous uh time and skills and expertise that you've shared with us tonight i'd like to thank everyone for joining us as well uh there were some fantastic sites within uh ian's presentation with regards to where you can see further information we have information on our musculoskeletal australia website as well about medicinal cannabis and also you could always ring our helpline on 1-800-263-265 if there are some other questions that you have or your question wasn't answered tonight so look on that note i wish everyone a very good evening thanks so much for joining us and thanks again to ian and richard and good night everyone", "WCZkmm2w3UM": "[Music] we don't know that much right now especially compared to what we know regarding the effects on the brain lungs and heart for example but research on the effects of cannabis on kidney function is largely limited to a few retrospective cohort studies those studies have included smoked recreational cannabis either in healthy people or they've evaluated any lifetime use among people with kidney disease so there are some differences between recreational benefits and medicinal cannabis such as the route of administration uh the dose the frequency of use and all of these can have different effects on long-term outcomes so these studies did not demonstrate any association between cannabis use and the development or progression of kidney disease because of this though in order to answer this question we conducted a study among people at high risk for kidney disease and we did demonstrate an association between chronic cannabis use and a more rapid decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate among people with kidney disease we presented this research at kidney with 2018 and the uh we're planning to submit the manuscript for publication shortly so many people use cannabis to treat a variety of ailments among people living with kidney disease it's estimated that about one quarter to one half of patients experience chronic symptoms such as pain nausea anorexia sleep disturbance anxiety and depression and several of these are approved indications for medical cannabis uh in across the united states in various states additionally anxiety depression and insomnia are the most common psychiatric conditions that people self-treat with cannabis so there's evidence supporting the use of cannabis in the in patient populations without kidney disease for treating several of these symptoms most of the evidence is focused on chronic pain nausea and anorexia or loss of appetite additionally many patients living with kidney disease and those on dialysis experience substantial chronic being it's estimated up to 50 percent of patients can experience chronic pain now over 60 percent of dialysis patients have received at least one opiate prescription annually and approximately 20 of dialysis patients take prescription opiates chronically but we know that the short-term and chronic use of of opiates are associated with increased morbidity and mortality uh among people with kidney disease so cannabis could have a potential therapeutic role in the pain management among these patients and in fact the national academies concluded that there's substantial evidence for the use of cannabis and cannabinoids to treat chronic pain while several meta-analyses and systematic reviews on cannabis use including the prescription cannabinoids have given some mixed results for treating chronic pain well one thing that i could think of is that you know cannabis consumers are no longer the stereotypical lazy stoner the prevalence of cannabis use in the united states and worldwide has increased considerably over the last decade but particularly among people over the age of 50 and even more so over the age of 65 and and this patient population is enriched with chronic illness including chronic kidney disease we know that adults with chronic medical conditions are more likely to consume cannabis than healthy individuals however we don't really know the long-term health effects of cannabis use on some of these conditions so it's that much more important to understand its impact on kidney disease", "F1KK8mmD0d8": "as we get deeper into

dispensary is quite the opposite we've got about a um 30 increase in our traffic lately um and everybody's got questions questions from returning customers asking whether dispensaries would stay open tuesday they got the answer yes but pesota says the majority of curious customers coming through his door are newcomers i've had more questions lately about what's good for anxiety than i ever have before he says customers are nervous about their health jobs and families people are just scared and they're scared of the unknown and a lot of those people are coming into the dispensaries and they're picking up their essential items doctors say the answer to the what should i take question is it depends there are several ways to ingest medical marijuana and each affects people differently the common rule start with small doses and wait until you feel the effects for those feeling more anxious that does not mean you should up your dosage pesota says he doesn't expect questions like these to stop especially with many businesses closing their doors i think this is going to have a very long lasting impact in our community to adjust to the increased demand and fight the spread of

all of a sudden I heard a noise that noise was coming from one of the laboratories what was that I asked myself what was it it's like shooting ducks in the pond came the voice from the electrophysiology lab what I was absolutely amazed by that when I worked in electrophysiology lab I saw that this sound was actually voltage that was converted into audio sound and it was coming from a neuron a single neuron to which an electrode was attached is the way neurons talk it's fascinating and from that point on I was hooked on electrophysiology and hooked the neurophysiology I wanted to know how these neurons talk how they communicate with each other how they create neural networks and that information in neural network gets spread through the brain I wanted to know everything including how neurons work right now while you're listening to my talk right at this millisecond if we were to take a division of the brain or the whole brain and very roughly divided into two types of neurons we would have excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons all of these neurons produce very fast potentials that are called action potentials these are little electrical sparks and these electrical sparks caused the release of a chemical called neurotransmitter so if you have an excitatory neuron when it produces the spike or an action potential this very fast electrical change the excitatory neurons releases excitatory neurotransmitter excites a part of the brain the inhibitory neuron they also produce these fast electrical changes and they release an inhibitory neurotransmitter and that inhibitory neurotransmitter dampens the activity of the brain and so this is constant up and down up and down in different regions of the brain is encoding our perceptions our memories our emotions our motor functions and this complete picture is it's formed by interactions of these excitatory and inhibitory networks that are precisely balanced and acting precisely in time playing out the rhythms playing out the rhythms playing out neuronal beats if we look even further into different subtypes of neurons in the brain of course we're not just limited by excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons the brain is a very complex structure and so another way we can approximate the structure and function of different brain cells is subdividing them further into different subtypes and so if we were to look in the brain we actually have approximately 150 different subtypes of neurons and if we were to stimulate those neurons and place an electrode and listen to how there's near on stalk how they produce their dialect da da da da da da we hear that we have 150 dialects these are different languages that each neuron speaks it's a different dialect and these dialects interact precisely in each one of these 150 neurons subtypes has this precise role in creating this up or down oscillation and we now know in the last few decades that individual neurons play a very precise role in producing this fast electrical change and having these rhythms these oscillations that are controlled that are precisely controlled but of course that's all of our brains are not normal and unfortunately some of our brains have neurological disorders and so neurological disorders is where you have these neuronal beats neuronal rhythms that are upset so perhaps not surprising that after finishing graduates I pursued my studies in epilepsy why epilepsy well epilepsy presents a disorder neurological disorder that is actually a dysfunction of brain rhythms and one would argue that any neurological disorder any neurological disorder is really impaired brain rhythms in the brain and they would be absolutely right in my opinion however with epilepsy the diagnosis of epilepsy comes from actually recording abnormal electrical activity in the brain and ascribing or determining a specific syndrome of epilepsy based on that electrical activity and so how the neurons sound during seizures they scream what do I mean by scream well if you talk dialect normally that's one thing but what happens to you if you scream and you scream non-stop what happens to your vocal cords they burn and you lose your voice the same happens during seizures is that neurons during seizure scream if at normal brain activity neural are firing is not that frequent it's actually a pretty pretty quiet brain that produces some electrical sparks here and there and releases neurotransmitters excitatory inhibitory but during seizures this organization of beats is lost the beats become abnormal the cells get hijacked by this pathology and now they start playing the wrong beats and so the challenge that we took upon ourselves is to understand what contribution these different subtypes of neurons have in producing seizures and since I told you that there's excitatory cells and inhibitory cells you would probably guess the textile Ettore cells and the ones that start the seizures and are responsible for spreading the seizures these large electrical discharges across the brain so according to the words of my mentor it takes crazy people like myself and himself to insert electrodes in multiple cells at the same time and try to understand what these cells do during seizures and that's exactly what we did and what we saw was completely countering to ative we saw the pain Hammett ourselves actually start the seizures which you have here on top is the inhibitory cell in blue when that inhibitory cell this blue thing is actually producing lots of spikes and then after a while it fails to produce a spike and this excitatory cell over here that's in red it produces a whole bunch of uncontrolled activity and that activity spreads across the brain and that's what causes the seizures and so every time the inhibition fails and it doesn't produce a spike the excitation produces a seizure it runs away and it causes damage to the brain and this was absolutely fascinating for us to find that and the studies that we did we did these studies and brain slices taken from rodent brains and you will say well what does that have to do with human brain and human being and what one behold five or so years later the similar pattern of inhibitory neurons starting the seizures and failing during the seizures and excitatory information running away and causing abnormal activity was discovered and confirmed in living human epileptic brains in general I think this is a remarkable and most fascinating thing about the science is that you can have an isolated cell isolated Network in the dish and that activity that you record you can also find in the living human brain that's absolutely fascinating so one way that we can understand these neurons is looking at their spikes and we can convert these spikes into voltage but what we also want to know is how does this activity how do these brain waves these oscillations up and down look like and so in the last two decades neuroscientists have invented and other scientists many different ways of visualizing cell activity right now we can visualize movement of single molecules in one cell activity of one cell or hundreds of cells at the same time or networks and we can visualize this activity a hundred times per one set and we can visualize this activity real-time that's absolutely fascinating and so this is an example of what looks like a brainwave it's abnormal epileptic brain wave that is propagating in the slice where the red color here shows a very massive amount of activity abnormal activity that propagates through this tissue and it's absolutely fascinating we can actually now tell where this abnormal activity begins as a shown here how it travels through brain tissue we can measure the speed of these propagations we can measure the characteristics of this oscillations we can accomplish a lot using imaging and that presents a completely different view and understanding of how neural networks function how they spread this activity across the brain so now that we understand these abnormal oscillations one of the things that we want to do is neuro scientists and neurologists one of the biggest challenges that we have is to actually how to control these abnormal brain rhythms how to stop and control abnormal rhythms how to reset the brain as a rhythmic structure of silat airy structure into the right kind of oscillation and again you can view the drugs and pharmaceuticals that you take actually reset these rhythms they reset the rhythm they reset your mood the depression they do preset seizure they stop seizure they stop Parkinson's tremors you are changing the beats in these neurons with drugs or with electrical stimulation for the past few years smart work has been motivated and has concentrated on a dravet syndrome the dravet syndrome is a catastrophic form of epilepsy it happens in very young children it's catastrophic because children can have up to hundreds of seizures a week those seizures are untreatable uncontrollable in many cases it's catastrophic because children do not develop properly they're having too many seizures for their brain to process other activity and it's catastrophic because up to 20 percent of these kids die after seizure for known reasons and so this is what motivates me to understand how the brain works and to try to invent or understand new ways and potentially alternative ways in which we can treat this abnormal brain activity and what may come as a surprise to you is that these children along with many other children autistic children Asperger's children cancer children are using cannabis are using cannabis extracts to improve their way of life to control them controllable conditions of course that stirs up a lot of emotions children cannabis what are you talking about this is wrong this is right this is wrong here the deal that the devil is in the details okay so let's try to understand some of these details we know that marijuana has been used for centuries with the reported medicinal effects there is multiple publications report medicinal effects there are synthetic drugs that are compounds of cannabis that are used as medications and recently there's been an increase in use of these extracts and even more so the second half of the 20th century we discovered an endocannabinoid system so what is under cannabinoid system and the cannabinoid system consists of endocannabinoids these are chemicals that are produced naturally in your body without taking a puff they're naturally produced in your body and they can bind two types of receptors cb1 receptor cannabinoid receptor one and cb2 receptor cannabinoid receptor 2 and these receptors are very widely distributed throughout the body with cb1 receptors dominant in the brain and it will cause the psychoactive effect from the cannabis plant the cb2 receptors are distributed mostly in the periphery with the most predominant expression of CVT receptor in the spleen and that's the organ that is responsible for amassing your immune response so where does cannabis come in here well would we know of course we all heard about THC bad drug THC it's a part of cannabis and this is all we know about cannabis pretty much we just say cannabis is THC drug and and that's it and so what we have to know is that cannabis plants can't a cannabinoids what are cannabinoids cannabinoids is a whole group of chemicals that have different structures the second most prevalent cannabinoid in cannabis is shown here abbreviated a CBD or cannabidiol there's other cannabinoids that are expressed and it's over 70 of them that are found in the in the cannabis plants and on top of that cannabis plants and these extracts from cannabis plants not only can take an AB noise but they also contain these aromatic substances that are called terpenes so you will find terpenes and other fruits and vegetables limonene and lemon carry filling and cloves and hops lavendar will have line Alou and what we know is that these terpenes on their own have very strong biological activity and sometimes very beneficial biological activity too so they have medicinal properties the terpenes themselves and what has become a predominant thought is that perhaps this isolated compounds like THC or cannabidiol CBD may not be as effective as using the extract from the whole plant you don't just eat one thing from the beet you eat the whole beet to get the benefit of the beet however with that comes the worry that you are actually if you're talking about the children you are trying to give children a drug that is containing THC so let's understand this a little bit better THC has actually been shown to be anticonvulsant except in about 10% of all the cases where it can be broken violent it has other medicinal benefits that have been documented and THC bonds to the cb1 receptor in the brain causing the high affect can add a dial on the other hand the second most prevalent cannabinoid in the plant has been shown to have only anticonvulsant facts and this cannabinoid does not bind cb1 receptor so it's not psychoactive so how can we deal with this thing that we have th see we have CBD we have this plant we have medicinal effects we need to understand more about this plant we need to understand a lot more about these substances do a lot more research get a lot more funding so we can help these children we can help these children have better lives we can understand better the plant and the as it concerns THC so for example here is an analogy so your doctor tells you that you know you can probably have a glass of cognac before you go to bed it comes your heart it's good for you right would you give a 40% alcohol contact to your child you'd never do that but there's something else inherent in that connieyc that makes you feel good it's not just the alcohol so what if you could remove the alcohol what if you could bring down the alcohol level to 0% or half percent the same as cough syrup in the pharmacies and you knew that this cognac now that has no alcohol helps other children from seizures and from other neurological disorders what would your decision be then would you give that cognac to your child then if you eliminate it in the case of cognac alcohol and in the case of cannabinoids or cannabis you eliminated potentially THC and so I think it is time for broader specters of the society sectors of the society and more conservative sectors of the society to understand this diseases to relate to the disease's to understand the pain of the children and the parents the catastrophic pain that they're going through it is time to stop stigmatizing the parents and sending them away as neurologist because they bring up an illicit substance because there are plenty of drugs that are pharmaceuticals that can debilitate children and adults as well and so it is time for us to seek alternative ways to envision neurological disorders and treat neurological disorders and so what I thought is the last few minutes of the talk is I'm actually going to invite a musician a friend of mine arkady got this month to come on stage and instead of playing you the seizures that we've recorded in the lab with the electrodes let's change this a little bit let's have a musician interpret the seizures for you that's key is understanding them let's seek alternative ways to understand it let's seek alternative ways to treat it for the benefit of humanity and let's accept simple facts that thousands of parents are advocating and thousands of parents are giving cannabis yes cannabis and cannabis extracts to their children let's just face the facts and so this is the notes that Arkady is going to play for you and these notes are electrical recordings of seizures in these neurons in brain slices where the first two traces are individual neurons and the bottom two traces are networks this is three minutes of data recorded from the brain networks that is now received data that is now going to get played by Arkady you", "E7MvGH0yMNU": "disclaimer in no way shape or form does the information of this video

giving you anxiety or can you just not fall asleep at night well this just may be the video for you the use of cbd could be an effective and safe way to alleviate anxiety stress and improve your sleep but what exactly is cbd cbd is short for cannabidiol which is one of two compounds found in cannabis the other one being tetrahydrocannabine or thc for short what you may notice is that the chemical formulas of cbd and thc are almost chemically identical but they both elicit different reactions within the body the chemical structure of thc that is found in marijuana is what gives you the feeling of being high while the chemical structure of cbd which is also found in marijuana doesn't give you the feeling of being high but affects the body in different less noticeable ways cbd is known to elicit relaxing and soothing effects without the feeling of intoxication that is usually associated with marijuana marijuana and hemp are two types of cannabis plants marijuana contains a high concentration of thc with some cbd this contrasts kemp as hemp is bred to remove the majority of its thc content leaving the plant as only a good source of cbd this means you cannot get high off hemp derived cbd oils but how do we know that cbd is effective in treating anxiety one study outlined an experiment done on 65 men and women that were classified to be obese majority of the participants were in their 20s to 40s in this double-blind experiment some participants were given hemp-derived cbd oil or an olive oil placebo daily for six weeks alongside their normal diet throughout the six weeks the participants were asked about their feelings of stress as well as other factors including their overall well-being anxiety levels and sleep quality participants were also asked to complete physical activity on a regular basis the study found that overall participants who were given hemp-derived cbd were coping better with stress experiencing improved sleep quality and quantity and showed improved pleasure in life amongst many other benefits so how have people been using cbd cbd oils and creams are currently being used topically to reduce pain and inflammation teas coffee blends and even cbd infused beer help with anxiety relieve stress and help with sleep cbd has also been used to help with withdrawal symptoms panic attacks insomnia depression as well as ptsd although there is little to no side effects of cbd use as well as no proven tendencies for abuse or dependence potential cbd is still relatively new on the market cbd studies are still in the preliminary stages as long-term effects are still unknown so please before trying anything new we recommend you speak to your family doctor and inquire about cbd and find what works best for you if you are interested in

uncommon when people come in for them to describe to us that they've been experiencing atypical behavior acting in ways that aren't like themselves and this is not so uncommon with post-traumatic stress disorder [Music] and people with post-traumatic stress symptoms often attempt to take care of their problem on their own people drink they use substances they misuse substances as a way of coping seven to eight percent of the general population each year are affected by post-traumatic stress disorder or ptsd it manifests itself after an individual goes to a shocking stressful or for lack of a better term a traumatic experience leaving an individual in a very disturbed state the disorder can affect people of all ages and is commonly seen in military veterans victims of sexual assault or abuse and even witnesses of terror attacks and natural disasters symptoms of ptsd can begin to overcome an individual three months after the traumatic event and these include flashbacks where you relive the event over and over while even feeling the physical symptoms such as the racing heart and sweating [Music] individuals with ptsd can have difficulty falling asleep difficulty concentrating and can feel socially isolated develop extreme anxiety while also having depression within the brain the hippocampus amygdala and prefrontal cortex are the primary regions that are affected by ptsd while the neurochemicals cortisol and norepinephrine which are responsible for the stress response also tend to show increased activity in ptsd patients imagine the worst possible day of your life now imagine reliving that moment over and over and over and over again and with each passing moment the fear that it may happen again only grows greater for a lot of ptsd patients they only see one solution one effective way to cope with their problem and this leads us to substance abuse in recent years ptsd has been shown to have a link with substance use disorder in which individuals frequently use these substances to cope with their struggles but today we'll be only focusing our attention to one of these drugs cannabis or more commonly known as marijuana so what is cannabis cannabis is a psychoactive drug that can be smoked ate in an edible form and drank in liquid form the psychoactive substance within cannabis is known as thc also known as tetrohydrocannable this is a molecule that is responsible for eliciting the euphoric effects that it is known for cbd is another major component of cannabis however it is not relevant to the studies we will be examining so when canvas is ingested it causes the brain to release dopamine which is the reward chemical for our body and this is the fundamental mechanism by which cannabis affects our brain body and mental state so now we've talked about ptsd and we've talked about cannabis but how do they relate to one another we'll take a look at two studies that examine the effects of cannabis on ptsd does it help or does it hurt the symptoms in a study conducted in 2014 researchers examined 2 276 military veterans who were diagnosed with ptsd their findings were astonishing following an analysis of their symptoms they found that those military veterans that never used cannabis had the lowest level of ptsd symptoms such as depression anxiety and sleeplessness however it is interesting that those who started smoking cannabis following ptsd diagnosis saw a rise in violent behaviors in contrast those who stopped smoking marijuana also saw a decrease in certain ptsd symptoms [Music] in a more recent study conducted in 2020 404 individuals with ptsd were put on a medical marijuana regiment in which they inhaled cannabis these individuals tracked their symptoms on an app for 31 months and had a total of 11 000 responses they tracked symptoms such as intrusive thoughts flashbacks irritability anxiety along with many others after analyzing the results the researchers concluded that there was a 50 percent decrease in all ptsd symptoms immediately after using marijuana like all studies there are some limitations there needs to be more controlled research so we can truly understand the effects this is a new and advancing field and it's necessary to explore all avenues to see how cannabis can improve or deteriorate our mental health now where does this leave us can we say for certain that cannabis cures ptsd definitely not but we can certainly also not rule it out as a potential treatment what we can say though is that for certain individuals cannabis does prove to lessen the severity of their symptoms while for others it may increase them like any medication before taking any course of action it is best to consult your doctor and understand both the possible benefits and the risks

Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome,\nit's a mouthful okay. We're gonna say CHS and\nactually the technical term is Cannabinoid Hyperemesis\nSyndrome, what is it? It is the pukey pukes that are actually caused by cannabis use. So you're thinking, wait what? Isn't marijuana, which is\nnow legal in many states, either medicinally or recreationally. Right here in Nevada it's legal. Isn't it supposed to decrease nausea? Well if you saw our show\non the proven medical uses of marijuana they include\nnausea due to chemotherapy. Pain, typically chronic\npain due to neuropathy and things like that. And certain types of seizure\ndisorders in children. Those are the sort of very well studied proven medical uses. Now there are other\nthings that are hinted at and people can make arguments for but those are the big proven uses. So why would it be that marijuana\nuse might cause vomiting? Now I wanna preface this by saying we did a show on this before, but it was a live show and\nTom and Logan were in it and we were talking hella smack and it was a little disjointed. And there are a few things that I think we could do better. Number one is make it concise, number two give you CE\nCredit and number three really focus on a particular distinction that I did not clearly\nmake in that episode and has been pointed out to me by the cyclic vomiting syndrome community. So there is another syndrome\ncalled cyclic vomiting syndrome which can look a lot like\ncannabis hyperemesis, but is different. So we're gonna talk about some\ndistinctions between the two so that they aren't confused. Because honestly both syndromes\nare poorly understood, but CVS patients suffer a lot of stigma in emergency departments\nwhen it's presumed that they're just smoking a lot of weed and vomiting everywhere when in fact the etiology and the\ntreatment is very different. All right that being said I'm gonna review a paper with you that I will\nlink to in the show notes that is called cannabinoid\nhyperemesis syndrome and it's in the Journal of Drug Abuse or some crap, which I\nthink is a terrible name for a journal. Because there's use and\nabuse and in this case it's unclear what's going on. But it's a review by\nGalli et al from 2011. I think it really kind of\ncovers most of the big points. So here's the overview\nthen what I want you to be able to get out of\nthis when you watch it. Recognize the fact that\nthere is a syndrome in heavy cannabis users. And we're talking about smoking a few times a day for years. That's the average person who\nsuffers from this syndrome that can lead to episodes\nof severe vomiting that nothing seems to make better except for scalding hot baths and showers. Which is one of the little telltale signs apart from the heavy cannabis use. And that it gets better and is cured by the cessation of using cannabis. And so those are the main things I want you to get out of this. You can recognize this\nas we're increasingly seeing legalization efforts,\nwhich I actually support, around the country for cannabis and studying the medical uses\nand those kind of things. We're gonna have to deal with the side effects and the downsides. And nobody really quite\nunderstands how prevalent this is. The first descriptions\nof it started in 2004, and they were noticing in\nsome studies in Australia which had a pretty permissive sort of heavy cannabis\nculture in southern Australia that people were presenting\nthe emergency departments with the syndrome of cyclic vomiting. So you would have periods\nwhere you're fine, periods only when you're vomiting, periods when you're fine again, periods when you're recovering. And they were taking these hot baths, it was this learned behavior\nthat was making it better. And heavy cannabis users, and they started describing this cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. So let's go through it\nand see what we can learn, because it's important\nbecause it is the cause of a lot of suffering you guys. So these patients are really suffering and it's compounded by the fact that they are often in terrific denial that their cannabis use\nis the cause of this. So what people will notice\nin the emergency department what I've noticed in patients is that when you tell them, well this is maybe cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome my pronunciation is, I must\nbe high it's a legal state. Cannabinoid hyperemesis\nsyndrome they get very upset, they'll say it cannot be my weed. I smoke weed because I'm nauseous. And this is where that distinction with cyclic vomiting\nsyndrome becomes important because it turns out a lot of patients with cyclic vomiting\nsyndrome who are suffering from intermittent bouts\nof nausea and vomiting, are also smoking weed up to 50% to try to relieve their symptoms. And so there can be a lot\nof diagnostic confusion. Because there's so much denial, there's a lot of suffering\nand it's hard to treat because patients don't\naccept the diagnosis. Sometimes it takes multiple visits before you're gonna convince them that a trial of stopping\ncannabis is the answer and it's not gonna make them worse. Okay so let's go through this. So we talked about the fact\nthat cannabis is really, it's one of the most commonly\nused so-called illicit drugs although it's becoming increasingly licit through legalization efforts,\nwhich I honestly think are very, very important. The drug war has failed. Stigmatizing and illegalizing use of natural plant\nmakes very little sense. But not studying it not understanding its downsides is also not good. So we need to think\nabout that particularly as healthcare providers\nbut also as potential users of this recreational and the\ntherapeutic drug like any drug. And so about 4% prevalence\nof marijuana use in the US. And now we're looking at it since 2004 this new syndrome of like\nthis hyper (mumbles) syndrome What does it look like? Well basically first of\nall let's back up a second, how does marijuana even work? How does it affect the brain? Well there are thousands of compounds in the natural marijuana\nplant whether you smoke it or vape it or it's in a blunt or a joint or whether you're eating it as an edible, there are different ways to consume it or whether it's the\npharmaceutical derivative like Dronabinol or Nabilone. It works on the body in some,\nthere's some commonalities, and there are these cannabinoid receptors, two different types, CB1\nCB2 in human and animals. They've identified these and\nthey have different functions. They exist in the brain\nlike the cerebral cortex the hypothalamus, hippocampus,\nmemory, cerebellum balance, basal ganglia, different\nautonomic functions. So sometimes people get a tachycardia that is a kind of generally\nbenign tachycardia from marijuana ingestion. But there are also cannabinoid receptors in the gut, in the GI system. And this becomes important\nto this particular topic. So CB1 receptors are in the intrinsic and extrinsic neurons in\nthe enteric nervous system, the gut nervous system\nand there's some thought that they have particular effects including slowing gastric motility. So what does that mean,\nit means that instead of peristalsis occurring at a certain rate it occurs at a slower rate,\nwhy is this important? Because typically that is associated with nausea and yet\ncannabis in most people has an antiemetic and\nantinausea effect, why? Because of the central CB receptors. So those are felt to mediate a kind of antinausea effect centrally in the brain. So these two effects on\nbalance favor anti-nausea. In normal you know users who\naren't using all the time and maybe don't have a\npredisposition to have this syndrome. Now how are the compounds there are the cannabinoids, CBD, CBG. There are different psychoactive forms of THC,\ntetrahydrocannabinoid. THC all right delta-9 being\nthe most commonly known. But there are multiple sub metabolites, it's processed in the liver\nthrough the p450 system. So there's a lot going\non that we can't entirely nail down what's causing\nwhat in any given situation. And so what we do know is that\nthe psychoactive component that gives you the high\nis typically the THC side. Whereas the CBD side has other effects that aren't necessarily psychoactive. We're not entirely sure what effect is causing the hyperemesis syndrome. So that being said understanding the basic physiology helps us to understand how could this\nactually cause vomiting? Well there is an effect on the gut, the other theory is that\nthere's some central effect on the hypothalamus\nthat may lead to nausea. Now it helps us to know how is THC and the active compounds in marijuana and cannabis how are they\ncleared from the body. Well they're, it turns out\nTHC is actually stored in fat. So the more you smoke the more you end up storing this THC in your fat stores, and over time and with\nexercise with fasting you can actually release THC\nand get a psychoactive effect or another physiologic effect. So one of the theories is\npeople who are chronic smokers every single day multiple\ntimes a day for years can build up in their fat a lot of THC. And that can lead to a\nrelease at times that can lead to high levels which can then potentially trigger this syndrome. But again it's a lot of hand\nwaving because no one knows but at least we kind of\nare starting to chip away at an understanding of what\ncould be going on with these. Now there are endogenous cannabinoids, meaning our body makes\ncompounds that actually bind to these same receptors. So there is some physiologic\nrole innately for this which is why mankind probably figured out that smoking or eating the substance has some effects that may\nbe felt to be beneficial. Alright so that being said\nyou accumulate it in the fat you have these big lipids stores and at times of stress you\ncan actually release them. Now the question is maybe that's related to then these hyperemesis syndromes, how does it syndrome work? Well there are three phases alright. There's a prodrome phase\nand this is important because when you're asking\nyour patients questions you need to ask about this. In the prodrome phase people\nhave maybe mild nausea, they start fearing certain types of food. They maybe smoke more to\ntry to counter the nausea and this is the prodrome period. And this can occur for\nlong periods of time. It's then followed by a shorter period of time called the hyperemesis\nperiod where you're vomiting. And this vomiting is extensive,\nit can lead to dehydration trips to the emergency department. You can have diffuse abdominal pain, electrolyte abnormalities\nfrom dehydration and vomiting. And anything that goes\nwith severe vomiting. And it can be so bad that again patients are debilitated by it,\nbut they're still smoking because they think that the marijuana is actually gonna make things better. And that's one of the great\nparadoxes of cannabis, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. So that being said, there are different case reports\nyou can read about online but basically it's a very similar pattern. So someone comes with this idea\nthat they had this prodrome then they're vomiting and that can, 48 hours sometimes days it\ncan last, and then it improves and people get back almost to a baseline. And that's the cyclically\nnature of the syndrome, that's why it's often confused with cyclical vomiting syndrome, cyclic vomiting syndrome CBS. CBS is often as originally\ndescribed in children but now affects adults as well, it's not as rare as they once thought. The etiology is unclear but\nit's a similar cyclic pattern but again not in long-term\nchronic marijuana users, typically although CBS\npatients may use marijuana for the antiemetic\nbenefit, perceived or real. And the other bit of overlap is this, or non-overlap is this idea that the cannabis hyperemesis syndrome patients seem to have this learned\nbehavior of hot baths. Hot liquid on the body tends\nto make their symptoms better. So sometimes they'll present with burns from scalding hot baths. And the theory behind that, nobody knows why these baths help, but the theory is that\nthe temperature changes between core and skin trigger\na hypothalamic response that suppresses the central nausea. Again that's a little bit of hand waving because people don't really know what's actually causing the\nnausea in the first place. So it's very hard to be able to say, oh this is what it is. So going through this a little bit more, one thing to realize is that you can have a lot of abdominal pain. So when they present to\nthe emergency department what's the differential diagnosis? Well crap it's pretty much anything that can cause severe nausea and vomiting. And whether it's cyclical or\nnot you have to work it up as if it's any of these\nother things first. So you really have to\nrule out other things. Now first you wanna take\na really good history and do a really good physical. If they've got signs of rebound\ntenderness in their gut, specific focal tenderness\nover the right upper quadrant or the epigastrium or McBurney's point. Then you start to think\nabout things, right? Appendicitis, peritonitis,\nthink about pancreatitis. Think about acute\ninfection gastroenteritis. Think about liver disease,\ngallstone disease. Think about, there are other\nendocrine and metabolic things like diabetes with\nketoacidosis, type 1 or type 2 can cause this kind of\nsame syndrome of vomiting. Different hypothyroidism,\nadrenal cortical disease. So cortisol deficiency\nyou can get vomiting, certain medications, drug use. The differential diagnosis\nfor acute vomiting is really, really broad but\nyou have to go through it. Which means thinking\nabout all these things doing a good history in physical, getting the history of drug\nuse, doing a urine tox. Doing a urinalysis to\nmake sure it's not a UTI that's causing the vomiting. Doing a CBC to make\nsure there aren't signs of infection or anemia or bleeding. Doing a CHEM-7 to look at electrolytes, kidney function right, potassium. Make sure that there\nisn't severe dehydration. BUN is high those kind of things Looking at liver function tests, are there problems with liver? Could this be gallbladder, could this be acute hepatitis,\ncould this be alcohol? Looking at obviously like I\nmentioned the urine tox screen to see if there's other\ndrugs that are involved. And also testing for the THC because that will help back up a potential diagnosis\nof cannabis hyperemesis. And of course getting a lipase to rule out or rule in our look at pancreatitis as a possible explanation of the vomiting. So one thing also when you're trying to then rule things out\nis really looking at the differentiation between\ncyclic vomiting syndrome and cannabis hyperemesis. Well first of all it's\nuniversal marijuana use in the cannabis hyperemesis\nwhere it may only be occasional in the CBS patients and often\nthere are triggering factors. Infections, psychological factors in CVS patients that trigger\nthe hyperemesis episodes that are typically absent\nin the cannabis patients. It's more, there isn't really\na trigger, it just happens. Prodromes can exist in\nboth of those patients. And of course you're\ngonna have the vomiting, it turns out it's very common\nto have mild abdominal pain with the cannabis patients but it can be a little more severe in the CVS patients. The compulsive bathing is\nabsent in the CVS patients. If you're actually measuring stuff, it turns out gastric\nemptying is often faster. It's a little bit abnormally fast, its accelerated in\ncyclic vomiting patients but it is slowed in cannabis\nhyperemesis patients if you do those tests, if\nyou do emptying studies. And the other thing is\nmigraines are quite common. 24 to 70 percent of patients\nwho have cyclic vomiting will also suffer from\nmigraines, so generally you can actually differentiate these pretty easily but\nyou have to be aware and I think a lot of clinicians aren't aware of the distinctions. And it leads to a lot of\nstigma and misdiagnosis. The average time to diagnosis for these diseases can often be years, and think of all the suffering that's occurring in the meantime. Not to mention the ED overutilization 'cause people keep coming back. Yeah the treatment for CVS is often psychological, supportive. For cannabis its cessation of cannabis, and that can run against\na roadblock immediately because the patients are in deep denial. Think about it this way and\nthis is something again, this isn't in the article\nbut this is something that I feel strongly about, if you are using cannabis\nmultiple times a day for years there is something that\nyou are self medicating. Functional people in society and you can disagree with\nme on this but you're wrong, functional people in society do not smoke that much marijuana every single day unless there's something\nthey are self treating. So think about it this way\nwhether you have depression, anxiety, some other thing that you're self treating\nwith the cannabis. And then a doctor or a nurse\npractitioner or a PA tells you, you know the reason you're vomiting is because you're smoking\nweed every single day and you need to stop that. Think how your walls of defense are gonna come up immediately. You're gonna rationalize\nthat it's not that. You're gonna doctor shop\nand find another doctor, and this is all common in\nthis community of patients. And you're gonna refuse to believe, it's gonna attack your unconscious belief that this drug is the only thing that allows you to function. You can look at very high\nfunctioning people like Joe Rogan and he can only go a month\nwithout smoking weed. So he's self-medicating something and he says this himself, right? Some part of his\npersonality that he's trying to modulate with this drug. He feels like he's a better\nperson when he smokes it, great. Now try telling him, let's say\nhe gets cannabis hyperemesis, tell him that this drug is\nresponsible for his disease. And he's not gonna respond to that well. So there has to be an approach and it's often gonna involve\na psychiatric approach, a counseling approach, a support approach and a very gentle approach. 'Cause if you attack\ndirect the denial goes up, and we've all seen this in our practice. People like myself who've\ntaken care of these patients in an emergency department\nor hospital setting. So that kind of gets us a little bit into, well one thing I wanna\nback up for a second and I wanna make sure that\nwe that we talk about, and it's mentioned in the paper are some of the other confusing factors that can go into this diagnosis. Now okay guy comes in\nsmoking a lot of weed, and we're talking again, we're\ntalking about a long term. You could say the minimum period is about three months of heavy smoking. And the diagnostic\nchallenge is stop smoking and it usually takes\n48 hours to get better, but in some patients it can take weeks. Why would that be? We talked about it earlier if all this THC is stored in fat, it can be\nreleased over a period of time. Particularly if you're a chronic user and you have a decent amount of adipose, it can take time to wash out. So you're not gonna\nexpect overnight results, so that's one thing to remember when you're doing a\ndiagnostic challenge for this. And when patients are coming to you say, I didn't get better, all right. But the one thing I wanna make sure people don't do is go in someone\nwho's smoking a lot of weed, they have a cyclic vomiting type syndrome and they just go oh it's this, without doing the rest of the workup. So I'm just gonna go\nthrough a little bit more, the other thing is that it could be that you have to make\nsure you think about. And I talked about the test you would do. So we talked about infectious diseases both viral and bacterial. Inflammatory diseases\nlike Crohn's disease. And again our lab tests will\nhelp us T some of this out, but it's very important okay. Intestinal obstruction when I talked about the physical exam if you find\nhigh-pitched bowel sounds that are tinkling, if you\nfind rebound tenderness. Different findings of\ndistension on the exam, then you'd probably guide your studies. You may wanna get a\nKUB, a flat plate x-ray to see is there obstruction. You may wanna consider doing CT imaging, if you're concerned about\nappendicitis, pancreatitis, other things you may\nwanna do an ultrasound to rule out or rule in or\nlook at gallbladder disease. There's pancreatical,\nbiliary and sufficiency. that requires more sophisticated testing and referring to GI that can\ncause some of these symptoms. Gastroparesis which would\nrequire emptying studies and other motility studies,\nendoscopy those kind of things. You would order that CBC\nthat basic metabolic panel, we talked about the other test, oh there's one I didn't talk about can anyone guess in the comments. What I missed that\nwould be a common reason to have cyclic vomiting. Let's say you're a young\nfemale who's sexually active, it's called pregnancy. So definitely do a urine\npregnancy or a serum hCG. Molar pregnancies or ectopic pregnancies can have high levels of hCG\nassociated with vomiting. Hyperemesis gravidarum\nyou don't wanna miss that, and nowadays people are\nsmoking weed during pregnancy which is a show we have\nto do in a separate show. So if you can confound these things, so do not miss what happens more commonly which is pregnancy. We talked about lipase and amylase looking at pancreas disease. And then you wanna consider\nis it cyclic vomiting, is it pregnancy is it gastroparesis, is it intestinal pseudo\nobstruction, motility disorders, there's different things\nthat you can have. At that point you really\nwanna dig into that history. So if there, if you\nfind that they're taking these hot showers and bathing\nand it makes them feel better, you really need to ask that question because they're not necessarily\ngonna volunteer that. Also remember that\nthere's a lot of stigma. So when you're taking the history you have to destigmatize it by going hey you know life I\nsee this a lot of times in people who are heavy cannabis users. Do you find that taking hot baths and things like that makes it better or are you using fairly often? Kind of try to destigmatize\nas much as you can because people are a little bit on guard they may not volunteer this information. Particularly if they're\nvery high-functioning user maybe they're, they\npersonally stigmatize it more. So you can talk about emptying\nstudies things like that, but other things that we didn't talk about that can masquerade, peptic ulcer disease. That's why I think every single patient who comes in to the ER gets a rectal exam. So I shouldn't be discouraging people to be seen if they have a real problem but you're probably gonna\nget a finger in your butt and it's probably going\nto be a medical student. But you wanna guaiac that\nto see if there's blood, peptic ulcer disease. And there's other ways to get\na peptic ulcer disease, right? Including endoscopy et cetera. We talked about biliary tract dysmotility. Volvulus particularly in younger patients but also in very old\npatients, sigmoid volvulus. And the other thing that I didn't mention are central nervous system diseases. So masses in the brain, hydrocephalus, the normal pressure hydrocephalus which can cause consistent\nvomiting in some. Those are things that you would want, we talked about the endocrine issues, but those are things you're\ngonna want to get at by history. Physical if there are neurologic signs you will wanna consider\nneurologic imaging, whether it's CT or MRI. So that's very important\nbecause if you miss that you're definitely doing it\na service to the patient. So basically in a\nnutshell if you've kind of ruled those things out and\nyou've kind of looked at the other things it could be, and you've also considered\ncyclic vomiting syndrome and make sure you don't confuse. The two then you're in a good position to say okay this may be\ncannabis hyperemesis syndrome, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. And if that's the case then you're thinking about the treatment. And really there's two\nparts of the treatment, there's the supportive\ncare which it turns out doesn't work, and then there's\nthe definitive management, which is stop smoking. Or stop imbibing it in\nwhatever means you're doing. Now here's the problem, when I say supportive care\ndoesn't work I mean this. So you know the different antiemetics, whether they're 5-HT2 inhibitors\nor whatever you're using. H1 receptor antagonist,\nD2 receptor antagonists, and I can't use brand names\nbecause this is a CME, but you guys all know the\ncompounds I'm talking about. Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist. When you give these they may help a little but they don't help a lot. Particularly if the person hasn't stopped smoking or using cannabis. So that's another thing you're just not gonna make them a lot better. Hydration obviously is\na mainstay of therapy replacing electrolytes so\naggressive IV fluids as needed. Make sure you get an EKG because if there are\nelectrolyte abnormalities you wanna baseline and make sure there's no derangements at\nthe EKG due to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance\nparticularly potassium, magnesium, calcium et cetera. So check on that for sure don't miss that. And then some people have\nactually attempted narcotics to relieve abdominal pain\nright, in these patients. Because they often come\nwith abdominal pain. Bottom line is that can make things worse because they will further\nslow gastric motility and in and of themselves can cause nausea. On top of that the other problem with that is that you then face this potential issue of creating dependency and\naddiction by introducing someone who might have been\nopioid naive to opioids for this problem when\nit doesn't really help. So really, really caution on\nthe opioids, very important. Also people have noticed\nwhen you do endoscopy and put a camera down\nthere you can sometimes see degrees of esophagitis and gastritis, why? Because you're pulling up\nstomach acid by throwing up and irritating the\nesophagus and the stomach. And so you might see that so some people will give proton-pump inhibitors to help with the acidity\nthat's related to that. And maybe that'll help a little bit. But again these are soft core measures. The hard core measure\nis stop using cannabis. You can help symptoms with hot showers, but this is not a long-term solution. You might get through this one episode but it's gonna come back. And some people injure themselves with temperatures that are too high. So all that being said\nnow the hyperemetic phase where you're really\nvomiting typically will last for about 24 to 48 hours\nbut you are going to relapse if you continue cannabis use. So you gotta sit down with these patients and talk to them carefully about this. Let me see here there's some case reports that have demonstrated you\nget remission and symptoms once you stop cannabis for basically extended periods. So really it's not just stopping it for short period of time\nand going back to it, you kind of have to stop. And that's hard, that's a hard\npill for people to swallow. You have to get at the root cause of why they're using cannabis and we don't have time to do that in the emergency department\nor even in primary care. And that is yet another pitch guys for why we need to start building a better relationship-driven\nhuman health care system where we can spend time\nwith these patients. Where we're no longer\nstigmatizing patients for what they're using but helping them to overcome this problem. Where we're not conflating cyclic vomiting with you know cannabis hyperemesis and where we are actually\ndoing good for our patients while taking care of each other. And that's the pitch for health 3.0 at the end of this episode. Alright I think you now have the tools to take the post-test for this. You can get your CE credits\nit'll be half an hour of credit because this was\nin half an hour lecture. I wanna thank Physician's Weekly, you guys check out their site, they have other CE and other CME. Do not ask me if your specialty is covered because we've talked about this. If you can get ACCME or ANCC credit ask your board if-- (alarm goes off) Wow there's the... Stop that was the timer that\nsays we're at 30 minutes. Did I nail it or what, 30 minutes. ANCC and what's that Logan? - [Logan] Actually we are going at 20. - Yeah I hope you're, Logan says we've only gone\n20 but my timer says 30, so I hope that timer's wrong or else we haven't been recording. Anyways guys so, oh\nwe're good alright yeah. Math Logan, Math is hard. So the bottom line is get your CE credit, we'll have links in the\nthing and I love you guys. Hit share, become a\nsupporter because it's dope. Become a supporter if you\ndon't become a supporter you don't get the CME\nand don't smoke too much just smoke a little\nokay, I love you bye-bye. \u266a Heh, heh, heeh! \u266a \u266a Smoke weed every day. \u266a", "YHWOpgRz-V4": "it's a health condition that affects one in seven people in the UK and this week my next guest has me at headlines after revealing she used cannabis oil to help cure her migraines on TV presenter Jenny Powell joins us now alongside dr. Hillary and Johnny I mean these were debilitating migraines this was taking days out of every single month for you we just couldn't leave the house yeah it's interesting because it's only very much later on in life for me sort of mid forties when I when I discovered that I was actually suffering from the first of I just thought was a really bad headache or a virus and I remember I was actually filming it was freezing cold I was about 46 bit stressed and it was that time of the month and I just had this awful searing headache I felt sick and actually for the first time ever thought can't work and I had to ask if I could just sit down for a while and start working and since then sort of on a sort of regular basis normally I think for doing my hormones and when my periods start I've just had this awful migraine where sometimes three to four days I just can't can't function can't you know can't make tea for everyone can't do the school around can't go to work and it's something that I didn't really I never thought about it you know with people say I've got a migrant that always she's just got a headache you know but why did you have to lie down you know what why is it so dramatic because you look fine but actually and it changes your character I've been really sort of disgruntled and snappy and you know I just I want to talk to anyone I'm actually not held to live with and it was held to go through as well and had you been to the GP there and and gone down there yes tried various kind of mini yeah I'm not great at popping pills I'm all for being preventative and saying but why am I getting them you know what can I do to prevent them rather than right well every month I've got to have this this stack of pills to stop me suffering so much so you know for me that there was sort of like as a safety box it was you know where I'd have these pills there is sumatriptan yeah which kind of worked but I'm not happy with that really I'd rather find out why I'm getting it yeah and what I can do about it or May a more natural way of getting over it and this is then how the the cannabis oil can abide it with your partner actually suggested it yes yes my other half Martin he sort of researches a lot into system well first of all from nutrition but authored to health and sort of holistic ways of looking after yourself and it was a friend of his who actually was epileptic and she's done a lot of due diligence with it and discovered that it helped her I'm just saying this he's all for everybody's different you know I'm not an expert but you know I started to read up on things and discovered that you know for headaches it could help so I tried and it's been like three four months and I haven't had a migraine which for me is life-changing really yes and it could very well be the placebo effect who knows Hillary but where where do you stand on this because if you're saying you've got three or four months there with like this terrible migraine what Jenny describes really well is menstrual migraine and this is very common so many women in the days leading up to their period and during their period they can get migraines on a frequent basis and part of the reason for that is is a falling off of Eastern and levels just before a period and a rise in chemicals called prostaglandins which can cause inflammation and pain and and normally we treat those we can treat those with Eastridge n' just before the period we treat them with with medicines that can stop the inflammation and that would be the traditional way forward now there's huge hype at the moment about CBD products as sold as health supplements legally in this country things everyone's jumping on the bandwagon and you really don't know what you're buying so some will contain a lot more CBD than other products which may have hardly any and there is research done it being done on how therapeutic CBD can be in things like neurological conditions headaches migraines anxiety depression a lot of works being done but we don't yet know how effective CBD is and what concentration you need yes you can buy it provided it satisfies all the safety and sort of regulatory necessities but you don't know what you're buying and some of it can be really expensive now it's worth trying and you've tried it and it seems to work for you and that's fine what it doesn't have in its THC which is the psychoactive chemical that you're not getting a high but you are getting some pain release with an awful lot of people don't quite know what is that you hear they're trying a health supply which is legal cannabis is a Class B drug and it's still illegal to to use and possess and supply so you know you've got to be there is a big distinction this CBD doesn't contain the THC which which has this that gives you the high is the psychoactive and activity but it may be that for some people when they use a decent concentration of CBD does give them relief against pain and some people even think it could be good for conditions like Parkinson's epilepsy anxiety and depression yeah just drops I just take her you know you sort of work up to what sort of works for you but for me just a couple of drops underneath the tongue for about 60 90 seconds and I do it twice a day but like I say you know it works for me I think and I've been very careful I've done the due diligence on what I've got a sort of certified organic non sort of toxic drops that I use from hemp so you know you have to you have to go out there and do the research yeah but it is tricky because it's you know

PENN STATE RESEARCHERS SET OUT TO SEE HOW THAT WOULD IMPACT DRUGS AMERICANS WERE ALREADY TAKING. THEY FOUND 57 PROBLEMS. THE REMARKABLE FINDING WAS THAT WE IDENTIFIED 57. DRUGS THAT HAVE A NARROW THERAPEUTIC INDEX AND THAT MEANS THE RANGE OF AFRICA SEE TO TOXICITY IS VERY NARROW AND THE PRESENCE OF CANNABINOIDS CHEMICALS FOUND IN CANNABIS COULD TIP THE SCALE TO THE DARK SIDE WHICH ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS PATIENTS TAKING BLOOD THINNERS LIKE COMMIT IT TURNS OUT THAT IF SOMEONE WERE ON THAT MEDICATION WERE SUDDENLY THE AD THE HIGH DOSE OF CAN AVENUE AID NO MATTER WHAT THE SOURCE THEY'RE AT RISK FOR INTERFERING WITH THE METABOLISM OF THAT. COUMADIN AND HAVE AN ADVERSE REACTION MORE THAN 8 MILLION AMERICANS ARE CURRENTLY TAKING BLOOD THINNERS. AND MANY ARE OLDER SEEKING MEDICAL MARIJUANA FOR PAIN RELIEF OR CBD OIL WITHOUT KNOWING THE COMBINATION COULD BE DISASTROUS WOMEN STATES LEGALIZE RECREATIONAL WHEN THEY RECORD OR THEY LEGALIZE MEDICAL MARIJUANA. WHAT'S NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IS THE FACT THAT IT MAY INTERFERE WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DRUGS OR CARDIAC SOME AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH AN ANESTHETIC CALLED PROPOFOL ANESTHESIOLOGISTS NOTICE THE INTERACTION IN SURGICAL PATIENTS FOLKS THAT ARE HEAVY USERS OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA FORCES TAKE MORE PRO FOOTBALL TO SEDATE HER SURGERY, THE LIST IS LENGTHY INCLUDING BLOOD PRESSURE DEPRESSION, BIRTH CONTROL FIRE OI AND CANCER MEDICATIONS OFFERING GUIDANCE.

chronic pain this began a cycle that lasted over a decade of fentanyl patch neurontin methadone Norco a myriad of pharmaceuticals that at the height had me over the next decade on 26 different drugs a day what I was left with was overweight depressed unable to work unable to even drive a car but more importantly what I was also left with was chronic pain because we're opioids are an excellent option for people that are in acute suffering they are not the best solution for people having chronic suffering such as mine so I went looking for other solutions about this time I met a woman by the name of K kurta Posse and k was a self-described waken Baker each morning she would wake up and she would pull out her little pink Hello Kitty pipe and she would have a couple of Puffy's so I judged K very harshly I saw her as a drug user but she also told me something very interesting and that was that she was making pot brownies for her boyfriend who had chronic neck pain and that he was able to use or eat one of her brownies before bed at night and not have to use any harmful pharmaceuticals to sleep through the night and that got my interest because up to that point we all had heard the hype around this but all of a sudden I'm like there's got to be some science here so I I started looking for solutions and the first thing I did is I went to a doctor in California who was willing to write me a recommendation to use cannabis and I thought great I'm gonna go and I'm gonna see this doctor and I'm gonna walk out of there with a prescription and know exactly what to do but instead what I got was a sheet of paper with a list of dispensaries and he pointed to one of them and he said this is the Nordstrom of dispensaries so I suggest you go there well I love nor DS so of course that's where I headed so I went over to the dispensary I stood in line I walked up to the counter and I said to the young man behind the counter now that I know is called a budtender and I said okay I have chronic pain what do I use what do I do and out from beneath the counter he pulled a rice krispies treat a bag of caramel corn and a chocolate brownie and I'm looking at this and I'm thinking what how do I use it what do I take and he's like well I have no idea you know I just like this one and it no it kind of makes me and I was like okay great this is not science this is not medicine I need to go and find out more information so I then made my next stop was it heme con well heme con fulfilled every stereotype that I had about cannabis I mean you had your young ladies with the body paint and the strategically placed pot leaves you had the I heart vagina signs along the wall you had the the deafening boom box you know boom boo-boom boo-boom and I'm trying to listen to the vendors and I'm asking them questions and they're giving me answers and and I can't hear anything but what I also heard while I was there was the same girl in the body paint was treating irritable bowel syndrome with cannabis you had the person with the chronic pain seeking answers the social anxiety looking for answers with cannabis so I thought there's got to be something here and I'm since I'm obviously not finding it I'm gonna have to go figure it out myself so I went next and I bought a couple of ounces of something called xxx chem dog and I got it at the granny rate and I went home into my kitchen and I started making this I could not believe that my pain had been so affected by this plant that I had gone from level 8 to a level 2 almost instantaneously when I had taken a puff of it and that no doctor up to this point had ever bothered to mention to me that cannabis was an option how was that even possible so I thought what is it going to take for a doctor to be able to recommend cannabis effectively for treating patients just me so I made this in the kitchen and I can add the oil and I'm looking at it and I'm trying it and I thought okay what is it gonna take so that a doctor feels comfortable actually recommending this for its patient so what are the keys that are gonna be there the first thing is there's gonna have to be lab tests associated with this product if you do not have a lab test associated with the medicine you do not know how many milligrams of each cannabinoid is in there you don't know what you're taking you don't know how to take it and you can't be consistent and frankly a doctor is only going to want to prescribe or recommend something that can be done consistently and accurately the next thing is the doctors going to have to do a very in-depth patient intake process because they're going to have to have all of the same questions that they would ask in treating any disease but then they have to incorporate a set of questions that are specific for cannabis use in itself the next thing is they're going to have to very well understand this plant and the properties of it there are over 500 chemical compounds within the cannabis plant and each one has its own medical potential within it and so how they work and how they work together is very important that a medical professional understands when making this sort of recommendation and the next thing is they're going to have to have a way of giving you specific dosing instructions for each disease that you're treating so that once they do start this feedback loop that they can see what's working and what's not working and refine the data and keep making it better and better I'm a process engineer finding patterns and establishing with data is just the logical way to figure out something and turn it from a plant into a medicine so I went out next and I got a whole bunch of different varieties of cannabis and I was very excited I made all these oils I sent them out for lab results our lab testing and lo and behold I sat down and I'm looking through all these labs and I'm like what am I looking at I have no idea what any of this means I do not understand I don't understand what beta carry a saline is I don't know what Elsa PI I don't know what any of these different components are this so I need to get more education on this because the thing that's fascinating about cannabis is that it is really a pharmacy and a flower because you have all these different compounds within there you know everybody knows about THC and CBD you hear about these in the press there's the misnomer that one gets you high and one is the medicine I would flip that and I would say one isn't of much value and the other one is really good medicine meaning the THC that's a different talk but let's go ahead and stick with this but you also have other cannabinoids in there like CBN and CBN is the one that helps to make you sleepy you have THC v which we believe regulates the insulin uptake in the body so there's all these other you then have all these things called terpenes what terpenes are what you taste and what you smell in a terpene for example in in lavender you have something that's called a little lool that's very calming if you've ever picked up a lemon and held it to your nose and smelled it and had that uplifting feeling that it gives you that's limonene that's also in cannabis so we know that it has all these various components within it and we have to see how they work together I learned about something called the entourage effect now this isn't an actor with a bunch of fans hanging around him this is how all the components of the plant work together in the case of cannabis the whole truly is greater than the sum of its parts because you can buy isolated where they just use one component of it but it is not going to work anywhere as near as well as when you have all of the components together so let's talk about a piece of chocolate cake you could have your flour your butter your sugar your eggs your vanilla your cocoa all of the ingredients that go into a piece of care of chocolate cake but you certainly are not going to have have the experience of eating a piece of chocolate cake and that is a nutshell what the entourage effect is so now we know that we have to have the whole plant so that we have this entourage effect we know that doctors are going to be able to have to dose it correctly but what is in fact a dose because people don't understand that so what a dose is is how much you take and how often you take it if the doctor says I want you to take two in the morning and two at bedtime that's your dose if the doctor says I want you to take one three times a day that's your dose if they say take ten milligrams in the morning and 20 milligrams in the evening that's your dose now what is the therapeutic dose a therapeutic dose is how much is required for you to accomplish what your objective is for example if your objective is to sleep eight hours a night the amount of cannabis that is required to get you asleep keep you asleep and allow you to wake up after eight hours feeling refreshed that is your therapeutic dose if you're suffering chronic pain it's not the amount that knocks you on your butt it's not the amount that gets you high it's the amount that gets your pain under control to a point where you were still a fully functional member of society that is the therapeutic dose it's not just how much you can use so now let's take a look at what is not a dose all right because I hear all the time from people I'll say how much are you taking and they'll say oh I take a one-to-one or I take a one to five or I take a twenty to one well that's great that's a ratio that tells me how much you have one component is in relation to another but it doesn't tell me what they are it doesn't tell me how much concentration of each one is in it just tells me the relationship between two different molecules it's also not the number of drops if I say how much do you take and you say four drops or two drops or five drops if I don't know how many milligrams are in the whole I have no way of knowing how much is in an individual drop and then lastly the most important in the United States in particular where we are not on the metric system however the medical community is a milligram and a milliliter are not interchangeable one is a weight and one is a volume so you need to know how many milligrams of the cannabinoids or whatever the chemical compound is within the volume of whatever the product is whether it's an oil or a cookie or a rice krispies treat alright so let's take a look here at a theoretical therapeutic dose now I want to stay right here before I go any further this is not a particular dose for our therapeutic dose for anything for anybody it's strictly for the purposes of the disc demonstration and I have it up here and I want you to also before I go any further I want to say that no doctor in their right mind would ever recommend somebody start out in a dose this high you always want to start out very very very low and increased slowly until you reach your therapeutic dose but let's take a look at this for a minute we have a recommendation here of a THC dominant medicine that from the doctor they want you to take 25 milligrams a day divided into two separate doses with 1 5 milligrams in the morning when you get up and 20 milligrams about 1 hour before bed they wanted to have several of these different terpenes in it if possible and they want you to take it sublingually which means under the tongue thus the picture of the person sticking their tongue out at you a little bit rolling stones so I'm going to take that and say ok now that you've got this how do we take that information and convert that over to going to a dispensary to buy a product to match it so I'm going to take this as a typical infused oil because it's sibling wool we need to use a tincture or something that can be done under the tongue and let's take a look into a blow-up of the label alright so this on this label I'm going to look along with you it says it's an extra-strength THC product it has 30 milligrams weight of THC within each milliliter the volume so 30 milligrams per milliliter tells you how much is in there we also know that this is going to be about one milligram per drop because we know that a rule of thumb is when you have an infused oil it's approximately 28 to 30 drops per milliliter so in this case because it's 30 milligrams per milliliter it's gonna be about one milligram per drop so in order to achieve the five milligrams in the morning it's going to be five drops and for the twenty milligrams before bedtime you're looking at about three-quarters of a dropper or 0.75 milliliters to achieve that and that will give you precisely what the doctor has recommended for you so I encourage you when you leave here to go to your local dispensaries and look at the myriad of products that are available on the shelves today they come in all forms they come in capsules and waters and all sorts of other things and take a look and go up to the budtender and ask to show you what some of these products are you have the benefit now of a regulated market which means that you now have proper labeling so everything is easier to tell what is in it which really makes eases the way for you to begin your exploration of what cannabis products may work for what ails you and I just one last word of caution remember always start very low and increase slowly thank you you", "V3FF3u0jfRk": "study presented at the November meeting in the American Heart Association grab media headlines before the meeting even started sources like WebMD would have you believing that smoking pot drastically increases your risk of stroke let's see what sources like healthcare triage think about that too the research the study we're talking about today published in the journal stroke reports that marijuana users between 18 and 44 years of age have significantly higher odds of having a stroke than non users using data from a national survey collected by the CDC the authors concluded that recent marijuana users were 82 percent more likely to have a stroke while the risk of more frequent users defined as those smoking 10 or more days per month went up to almost a hundred fifty percent come on a lot of people smoke pot if those between the ages of 18 and 44 were really a grave danger of stroke don't you think we'd be seeing a lot more strokes in this age group feels like I've mentioned relative versus absolute risk you know once or twice but here I go again 80 to 150 percent are the relative risks and since absolute risk is way more applicable in real life that's what we should talk about relatively risky over on Twitter took the time to figure this out for a lot of studies sensationalizing the news including this one and according to his calculations the absolute risk increase of stroke for frequent pot smokers is point five percent zero point five percent we've covered what we know about marijuana use before we did not specifically mention stroke risk in those videos mostly because there's not much evidence to justify it there just aren't a lot of non case control studies focusing on stroke and marijuana use the few that do exist suffer from the same problems mentioned here along with the fact that it can be pretty hard to get honest self reporting of marijuana consumption which is what all these surveys rely on and finally the studies that do exist contradict each other some studies like this one report an association between marijuana use and stroke another study analyzing only male data reported no association between those two factors the current study reported higher use for frequent marijuana users that also reported cigarettes and as the author's point out in their discussion other studies do not report an association between marijuana and stroke once cigarette and alcohol use have been adjusted for so all we can do for now is remind you of what we've said before the level of harm currently associated with marijuana is much less scary than that of other things like cigarettes or alcohol it's likely real meaning greater than zero so take that into account but don't panic we can always use more data especially with changing marijuana laws and more and more people use it and we'd probably need it to be better data especially for it to be

used for recreational and medical purposes there are over 500 chemicals in the marijuana plant but the most commonly known ones being Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol or THC and cannabidiol or CBD the legality of cannabis differs per country many countries have adopted decriminalization laws to make possessions easier while other countries enforce stricter punishments the countries that have legalized are Canada Georgia South Africa arrghh way and eleven of the United States more areas have legalized the medical use even with the rise and acceptance and usage within the recent years there are so many common misconceptions with the two most well-known being that marijuana is a gateway drug and that it kills brain cells in a 2017 study it was found that 123 million Americans use marijuana while 5.3 use heroin assuming that all heroin users were pot smokers this would result in a value of 4.3% showing a weak correlation thus undefined not biological but more sociological furthermore there is no evidence to support the claim that marijuana has neurotoxic effects however it has been shown to cause short-term memory loss similar to that of drinking alcohol the studies in these regards have been inconclusive with some showing detrimental effects while others show protection against damages caused by Alzheimer's and Parkinson's medical marijuana is the use of the cannabis plant or its compounds to treat diseases and conditions it has been shown to be effective in a host of illnesses and in particular chronic pain and fiber the Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that 50 million Americans suffer from some form of chronic pain this condition is characterized that pain that lasts three to six months or more and has effects on everyday life and mental health a 20-17 study in the Journal of Health Affairs found that the majority are sixty two percent of medical marijuana usages are for chronic pain and these conditions have substantial or conclusive evidence of cannabis being an effective treatment Friday myalgia is defined as widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue insomnia memory loss and mood swings in fibromyalgia the brain intensifies the signals resulting in a greater perception of pain although idiopathic in nature it can be onset by genetics infections of trauma or stress with symptoms increasing over time cannabis works through blocking spinal peripheral and gastrointestinal mechanisms that promote pain in blocking these sensors the perception of pain is decreased or halted they use the underlying biological and physiological pathways to disrupt pain relieving symptoms although most studies focus on marijuana and the effects of pain relief as a whole there are a few that looks specifically at fibromyalgia and a 2011 study it was found that 43 percent of patients reported strong pain relief 43 percent mild pain relief and the remaining seven no changes in the 2014 study by the National Pain Foundation it was found that 62 percent reported cannabis is very effective 33 is helpful and five percent sever had absolutely no effects a 2018 study published in The Lancet showed that cannabis was effective in both lowering pain levels and weaning off other medications another 2018 study published in the Journal of Clinical Rheumatology showed that cannabis had significant favorable outcomes in all tested categories I wish I had received this treatment when I was first diagnosed I returned to who I was before and I regained my health are some of the testimonials there are many other treatments that can be used in the case of chronic pain among them non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs opioids epidural steroid injections sympathetic blockers over-the-counter prescriptions and therapy the other most used treatment method is opioids which are a group of medications derived from the opium poppy they're controversial showing a variety of positive and negative effects the positive effects of opioids are attributed to you fork feeling relieving the sensory and emotional aspects of pain however the negative effects of addiction reinforcement and dependency also persist the CDC and 2016 created 12 guidelines to make opioids safer three notable recommendations are non opioid therapy is preferred clinicians should prescribe the lowest dosage and status of the patient should be re-evaluated every three months in a 2018 study done by the Institute University did you not see them illegal it was found that it takes one week for someone to become addicted resulting in

dr. Igor and Olga Kovalchuk put their efforts into looking at how cannabis could be used to fight Cova 19 they join us this morning from Lethbridge Alberta good to chat with both of you this morning morning good morning so Igor your lab was already testing cannabis I understand strains to combat cancer and inflammation where are you at in your research with kovat 19 right so in the past five years we have developed over 1,500 strains of cannabis and have tested today about 400 and we have actually found around a dozen of cultivars that were able to substantially decrease the expression of the h2 receptor took one that is required by virus to enter ourselves and out of those about two three strains can do it by 75% or more and all go so what would be the next steps here and what made you think that you should make that shift and start to think about kovat 19 well I think we all started thinking about Kovach 19 and when it hit and really disrupted our routines so a lot of scientists like ourselves decided to take a look whether or not something that we already have as Igor said we were already testing cannabis for its biological effects may be helpful so and you know luckily we ended up having some of the very promising strains so right now what's most important for us is to actually find partnerships and develop clinical trials because thus far what we shall we show in the lab and it works in the lab but we have to absolutely have to do a clinical trial to show that it really does translate into clinic that it really works in the scale of clinical trial ego you say the strains you're testing your CBD predominate why does that make a difference in getting a clinical trial up and running faster right so there are many strains that can be active but the main reason is that if you have a psychoactive ingredients like THC in Canada then the dose that you can give is limited so it's limited typically by about 25 milligram of THC day and as I mentioned our strains are predominantly CBD so they have twenty to one ratio to THC so that allows us to give up to 500 milligrams of CBD a day and still be within 25 milligram of THC so that the patients are not or do not feel impaired and it's critically important for patient and for a doctorate 12 although what could be any side effects if any well cannabis is on its own has actually very good safety profile it has been studied its components have been studied very very well separately and so the because again the strains that we are talking about are CBD dominant they have really high levels of CBD and very low levels of psychoactive compound we do not predict there's gonna be any major impairment there of course could be some things like like more positive ones let's say anti-anxiety benefits and some betterment of sleep but those would be not really sight of those actually would be quite beneficial effects that people can sleep and there may be a little bit of improvement of appetite as well so some quality of life aspects may also be improved it's absolutely fascinating we'll be watching very closely your work dr.

substance the part that gives you a high it may have some medicinal properties so if it is able to be shown to help people safely I think there is a good argument for considering its legal use within the medical profession we spoke to the home office who again reiterated that cannabis is a drug for which there are no known medicinal benefits it's illegal to supply and possess it in the UK and in a statement the charity Cancer Research UK told us we don't advise patients to use can the soil or any alternative therapies to treat cancer or alongside treatment they're having currently there's not enough scientific evidence to say that cannabis oil is a safe or effective treatment in rare cases it's claimed some people systems can produce the same effects as the oil but it can also exacerbate cancers nevertheless Joyce Smith told me she's proof cannabis oil can make a difference and she started a petition to try to make the government legalize it for medical use Wesley Smith ITV News

looking into a sports reporter talking about marijuana you might be thinking uh-oh who's in trouble now but in this case we're talking about a Lyons legend hoping to get into the legal marijuana business and opening up several shops like ones that are already open throughout the state this is the Megatron Lions fans know and love he was he was like he's like nine feet above everybody grabbing everything down you he was phenomenal received these days fans should get used to Calvin Johnson the mega businessman his spokesman John Tresca tells me the former wide receiver has dabbled in real estate since his playing days and now it's on to the marijuana business Johnson's first application with former Lian Rob Simms was denied but his second application with his wife Britney was approved today by the Medical Marijuana Licensing Board in Lansing the Johnson's company is called Michigan community collective they plan to grow inside a facility in Webberville and sell in multiple locations in Michigan some of which could be in Metro Detroit Truscott says Johnson sees this as a good business opportunity fans were mixed in their reactions to the news well basically I'm against marijuana usage of any kind because it's bad kind of so anyone making money out of this I mean ought to be stopped basically we need if this has been passed by the people right everybody voted on this we've had medical marijuana for almost ten years now and everyone passed in october/november right to be able to legalize it in general why does it matter who does it so there you go differing opinions the cultivation facility in Webberville is almost ready the next step for Calvin would to be work with local municipalities for the store portion he'd have to get buildings inspected and then he'd have to go back in front of that State Board for final approval now there has been talked that his store could be in Bloomfield Hills that's just the attorneys address when they sent documents to

be a discussion and when I when I do this in my in-person classes I asked them about their observations about the acute effects of cannabis and where those hooks come from and what explains differences across people and so when I ask that question and then and you can think about it as I'm talking to you know what are the effects of cannabis well some people will say oh it makes you sleepy some people will say oh it makes you super high or energetic or euphoric and and so as you go across the room people have different different observations in terms of what they see in terms of the effects and then I ask them where these effects come from and why the difference is why does one person say oh canvas makes you you know sleepy or slows you down another person will say oh cannabis makes you for it makes you feel good one person will say it makes you know makes you anxious and paranoid so these are very different effects that people are talking about and what explains the difference in those effects and so we're going to talk about that today in terms of the plant and biology of course another important point here is that the biology of the people is quite different to not just the biology but also you know where they come from who they are their environment so there are lots of different factors here that can influence the effects of cannabis but mostly we'll talk about in this lecture the plant and the plant biology so the plant the plant has been under cultivation by humans for millennia approximately 8,000 years and by extension what this means to of course is that it has been interselection from humans so the humans have basically been cultivating this for certain characteristics over all these many years is the overarching family here is kena baisha and interestingly enough cannabis and humulus or hops are relatives in this same extended family now there's been some quite a bit of debate about subspecies of cannabis and that's based on both taxonomic and morphological differences so therein we'll will cover that in this lecture in terms of some of these morphological differences as well as differences in chemistry and so forth here that the point really is that academics you know scientists still debate the fine details about exactly what's going on here in terms of the genetics and of the plant but broadly speaking most people recognize two subspecies sativa and indica and then also there's some recognition for a third called ruderalis this is more sort of the laypeople version of the different plants so this gives you an idea what we're talking about when we talk about sativa and indica and ruderalis sativa was basically originally seen as useful for fiber and oil and food from a medical perspective it has diverse compounds and also the high biomass and you can see here is the tallest of the three subspecies indica is a shorter and bushier plant with higher THC on the medical side and higher yield in terms of the height of the plant and in ruderalis is this sort of scrawny little guy over here early flowering Hardy and northern climates and obviously a very small I'm a smaller plant and you can read more about this on the there's very similar stuff all over the internet in terms of the different subspecies this comes from a presentation at the International kind of a Research Society and so basically here we have the different in the three different version and you can read about the morphology more details about the physiology and the chemistry and what people saw see is this difference in cycle activity across these three and also some of this you know work linkages and I wouldn't say this is based on research in terms of what people basically report anecdotally as the medical indications about why people might use one version versus another again this is all anecdotal and what we're going to talk a lot more about the science of this and throughout the course but this just gives you had a nice overview what kind of the common views of these difference of species okay so now let's get more into the research on the cannabis plant so how does studies how does scientists study the plant right well there's really a couple of three things they're looking at when they're talking about the plant one is morphology what do we know what this is based on the shape of the leaves and shape of the plant and the other is chemical so when we talk about different chemo VARs so different levels of THC versus CBD versus of the terpenes etc and then a third dimension that is useful here is the underline genetic architecture so this really brings us up to date in terms of modern approaches and here there's all kinds of super cool science we can do looking at the genetic architecture and how it differs from plant to plant and then relate that genetic architecture back to the morphology and back to the chemical side or the medical side of this so why is this important because if you're if you're interested in the medical aspects right then you're interested in in trying to basically figure out which compounds are important for which medical indications right so what role does THC play what role does CBD play how those differ in different plants what role do you know other cannabinoids play cbc CBG so or terpenes and so this is you know trying to figure out the genetics and the chemical makeup I think is very important in terms of pushing forward the research on and how these different cannabinoids may be useful for different medical indications and again just in terms of the morphology you see the morphology differences here in the leaves this is a tea believe the the broadleaf and indica and then the ruderalis here very different and then again kind of a summary of how these plants differ in terms of morphology so the structure of the plant is illustrated here on the right in terms of different parts of the plan and the flowers or the female plants are covered with sticky resinous trichomes trichomes are basically what looks like a sort of stock with a bulb on the end right and inside that bulb that's where the THC and CBD and other cannabinoids reside and so tri comes again contain all the sort of important stuff and they're not easy to see unless you have magnification but they basically exist them in the flower of the plant and then we have the other important pieces you know parts of the plant here too you can look at in terms of you know family was the node systems etc okay so THC and CBD s were primarily focused here in terms of this course and I already mentioned that trichomes contain these cannabinoids and trichomes are you know pretty much all over the plant but most concentrated in the buds and the flowers and again the two most cited the two most researched cannabinoids are THC and CBD and so you saw the illustration of the trichomes but these little guys little hairlike things in here those are the actual tri comes in a picture and maybe they're easier to see over here but you see the stock and the little ball right where that contains the cannabinoids so what about the chemistry how does this work in terms of plant chemistry well there's a common precursor here and then that precursor is the CBG and CBG then as a CBGB over here CBG a via synthesis gets turned into th CA and CB da and so what happens after so so CB g becomes TCA in CBA and then those basically through a process called decarboxylation and basically through heat and or such as oxygen converts the THC the a version to THC and CBD a to CBD so here you see this entire process here from the common precursors through the TCA to THC and CBD aid CBD and an oxidation actually there's a kind of another step in here it's not Illustrated on the right but oxidation also turns THC into cbn or can have it all okay so I want to talk to them about some cutting-edge work done by another professor here at University of Colorado and you'll also see professor Nolan Kane in one of the interviews that I did and it was super I think interesting discussion with him and he's done a lot of work on the genetics of of cannabis plants he's analyzed well over a thousand genomes and he's looked at diverse samples from him to landrace varieties to wild feral varieties and modern varieties you know collected from all over the place including dispensaries or mostly dispensaries actually and basically what he's doing here is he's sequencing these genomes and then lining them up to see how they're how they're different and/or related so he's published some papers and not basically summarizing the you know some of this data from those papers in the next few slides but this is the actual you know one of the important citations here you can go back and look at this paper if you're interested in reading more about this and so basically what he's been doing he's been trying to put together these phylogenetic neighbor networks where he's basically on a genetic basis clustering related strains of cannabis and so this is one of the earlier slides with a with fewer samples but you can see here you know that the hemp varieties are clustering together in terms of their genetics and then you over here you have a number of strains that you can find dispensary super Lemon Haze they're been poisoned um kena tonic harlequin Maui Wowi clustering up here and then you have the cushions down here clustering together and that was an earlier version he's obviously as I mentioned thousands of genomes into this now so with thousands of samples these phylogenetic neighborhood network start to get bigger and bigger and bigger and of course very hard to display on a screen so here in though you can't read the strains what you can see is that this is becoming a very sophisticated approach to looking at how these genetics are related to one to know how different strains are related to each other via genetics and also coming up with these sort of broad categories so these cluster of strains up here are more broad leaf drug types this cluster down here more than hip varietals and then we have also the more narrow leaf sativa type drug types down here and then one of the later iterations our latest iterations again completely filling up the space in terms of sequencing these different samples these different strains it starts to get very complicated I blew up some of this just so you can see what this looks like and again you see some of these related strains over here and blue dream pineapple Express and then over here Skywalker og Girl Scout cookies etc and then it kind of just kind of cool is looking at the hemp type strains down here and also I'm called a narrow leaf drug type strains but I always find this fascinating right it's kind of fun the Farrell Nebraska number one so basically no one picked us up in a some ditch in Nebraska somewhere right which goes to show you just how you pick what is that the plant can be in terms of surviving in places where it probably shouldn't shouldn't be surviving so then also looking at some key differences not just in terms of genetics but also in terms of the levels of different cannabinoids and again you can refer back to his work for some of this but looking at for example how broadleaf broadleaf drug type compares to narrow leaf drug type compares to him right and what you see here is very clear differences and the THC a or the broadleaf is higher the narrow leaf is slightly lower and of course the hemp is way way lower and then the basically the opposite for CBD a where the broadleaf is is low the narrow leaf is somewhere you know not quite in the middle but higher and then the hemp Friday is much higher in terms of CBD he's also looking at the other cannabinoids and again how they differ across these different genetic sort of groupings and what you see here again is that you know they're not just different in terms of morphology and genetics but they also differ in terms of their their chemistry and their cannabinoid makeup same with terpenes and i'm not all terpenes are not different but some of them are clearly different merci and as an example of being clearly different across those different groupings so in terms of just kind of summarize the decoration within cannabis there are at least three major lineages and probably more than that that differ genetically morphologically ecologically and chemically and again I refer you back to the interview with Nolan Cain real talk he'll talk more about these issues and then going back to where we started this lecture right why is it that people report different effects well the again one reason is because people are different but the other reason is because the plant you know different types of flower different genetic versions different strains can differ dramatically in terms of the chemical makeup and and not just remember it's not just differing on one thing it's different many things which also means the interaction among those things can be different across different versions so when we talk about those different versions we also can talk about chemo bars as a way to put it also and so you can you know you can view these different genetic groupings as you know what are broadleaf narrowly if we also you can be the most THC type hybrid CBD type just sort of denote the chemical differences across these different versions and then you know it's worth noting too that for many many years the only way to study the effects of cannabis to get your cannabis from the University of Mississippi farm that was designated to grow canvas for the government and so a lot of what you know the studies have been done looking at the effects of cannabis over the last 40 years we're done with cannabis supplied from that one farm in Mississippi and so just some questions for thought for reflection do you think that cannabis grown by the federal government Mississippi reflects the cannabis in the real world you know why or why not and how might it be different and how might that impact our knowledge about the effects of cannabis we've actually done a little bit of work on this side again this is in collaboration with Nolan cane but just looking at how if we take the test results from cannabis produced by the government from Mississippi how's that compared to cannabis results tested from from legal markets this is a paper that was published you saw the citation earlier but basically this is the the night at cannabis this is the national drug abuse and cannabis Lee comes from Mississippi compared to testing varieties from Denver and Oakland and Sacramento in Seattle and basically what you see is that and this was done a few years ago things have changed since then but CBD clearly lower in the government version THC clearly lower in the government version i'm CBG pretty much on par with the other ones and then they didn't provide test results for other camels like other cannabinoids like tcv so we don't really know so what's different about the government grown cannabis well the obviously lower THC and lower CBD and we don't really know about some of the other other cannabinoids of terpenes and again that was done a few years ago and I have to say having worked closely with people at NIDA they clearly have been catching up playing catch-up but and also doing a pretty good job at catching up and so things are different now in terms of the products coming out of neidell more closely marrying the state legalized markets I mean having said that though of course it's almost impossible to keep up it you know to expect one small production facility and government-run facility Mississippi to keep up with legal market as fast it's developing across the nation that's an impossible task so I feel you know some sympathy for them because it's just a very difficult thing to do but then you know the federal government their hands are completely tied by the federal laws and by the DEA so it makes it very difficult to keep up okay so summarize three at least three major lineages of cannabis including camp broadleaf drug types and narrow leaf drug types and these lineages differ in terms of the chemical profile in terms of cannabinoids and terpenoids nation for my people report very you know report differences in effects even though for example THC may be equal across strange people report different effects because it's not just teach you it drives the effects there are other chemicals in the plan to also drive effects and that is all for this lecture", "h7PINnfABAM": "MARIJUANA MARIJUANA IS MARIJUANA IS BECOMING MARIJUANA IS BECOMING\nBIG MARIJUANA IS

medical conditions medical cannabis products derived from cbd are commonly used for reducing pain inflammation and seizures marijuana can be used in a variety of different ways including smoking in the form of edibles or tea as well as in the form of an oil or extract which contains increased concentrations of thc [Music] whether you've used marijuana yourself or if you've seen movie characters spark up in late night comedies on netflix you probably already know the short-term effects of marijuana but what happens after the high has worn off recent studies have shown that over time adolescent cannabis users may experience a variety of different cognitive declines these include deficiencies in general executive functioning learning memory and motivation general executive functioning takes place in the very front of the brain it helps with planning and accomplishing tasks monitoring emotions and habits and plays an important role in working memory and attention this is also the slowest part of the brain to develop as it continues to mature up until the age of about 25 years old it was found that daily and weekly teenage cannabis users experience impairments in their general executive function compared to adults specifically in attention and working memory which is the ability to retain information over a short period of time teens were found to be more likely to crave marijuana after their high has worn off compared to adults which can lead to binge-like behaviors it has been suggested that the magnitude of impairment is greater in youth than adults for the functions of learning and memory studies have found differences in the way that certain parts of the brain work between teenage cannabis users and non-users these differences were found in parts of the brain that are believed to influence different types of learning and in parts that help form our cognition these differences however between teenage and adult users were most prominently seen among heavy users it has been implied that daily intoxication during young adulthood can impair the successful attainment of education and directly influences the level of income the heavy marijuana users can achieve for adolescents let's start using marijuana later and occasionally the risks are much lower marijuana may also impact motivation which helps us work on our goals and make our dreams into a reality it has been shown that heavy cannabis use during your teens can lower general motivation later in life across studies it seems as though factors that predict worthlin effects include usage and age of onset generally the earlier you start using and more frequently you use the worse the performance in cognitive functions and mental health throughout the video you may have heard phrases such as it is suggested and seems to indicate so why don't we have results that are conclusive and give us more of a clear answer this has a lot to do with current barriers to research and the limitations of studies being conducted in the united states it is illegal to conduct marijuana research under federal law this means that scientists must use chemical formulations that are not derived from cannabis plant as a substitute for marijuana this raises concerns as to how generalizable the study findings are to the real world even in areas where marijuana research is legal the exact amount of thc or cbd is not usually labeled correctly or clearly on marijuana products additionally there are also different strains of cannabis plants each with different potencies and profiles that play a huge role in how marijuana affects the body [Music] because of these limitations we should take the results of these studies with a grain of salt so what is the conclusion what is the effect of marijuana on teens well the answer is complicated only a few countries legalize marijuana research and the legalization of marijuana is still fairly recent so we need a lot more studies to be absolutely sure but based on what we don't know consistently using marijuana as a teen or adolescent may have serious implications when it comes to your cognitive functions so if you're going to use weed make sure that you assess these risks use it sparsely and safely [Music] do [Music] you", "gbDyrcUOqwU": "thc it is the compound in cannabis that gets you high tonight some florida lawmakers are asking do medical marijuana patients get too much of it they want to cap the amount of thc patients can have access to nbc2 chief political correspondent dave elias shows us the argument pitting doctors against patients so right now thc ranges from 15 to 25 percent in medical marijuana but some florida lawmakers want to reduce the amount of thc to just 10 percent i certainly carry my medical card and i appreciate all the benefits that it provides steven shea has seen first hand the results the thc can have because my mom spent roughly five years fighting against stage four lung and brain cancer he opposes any cap on the amount of thc and pot i don't know any medical professional that would come in and say hey we're going to cap the amount that you can get in order to help with what you're going through marijuana has not gone through a rigorous fda process dr bertha madras tells lawmakers she has concerns with the high thc levels that patients have access to the consequences are greater high there's more tolerance that can develop there is more addictive potential not everyone agrees though it all depends on your responsibility with the product too dr heather aldt runs the compassionate cannabis clinic in fort myers that's paid directly to the florida department of health she's against capping thc what if we gave the same dose of an antibiotic to everybody would that be the right thing what if we gave the same antibiotic to everybody would that be okay i don't think so fearing that watering down the potency could have consequences having it at 10 percent would really push a big segment into the black market again number one her message to lawmakers considering the cap i would invite every legislator that wants to come and follow me a day in my office and they'll see the patients that we have and they'll see that they got off their narcotics now it's important to point out that no bill to cap thc has been introduced this year there was one introduced last year

Woman: They just have\nfollowers on Vine. Lavorato: Welcome to \"Bong App\u00e9tit Cook Off\"\nWeed Week. We are here in Los Angeles,\ncelebrating. We have Dee Nasty with us.\n-Whoop, whoop! Lavorato:\nWe have Miguel Trinidad\nin the kitchen. And of course, B Real,\nhost of \"Bong App\u00e9tit Cook Off.\" Hello, guys. You know, we got some of\nthe best minds in the cannabis industry\nhere with us tonight, and we're gonna have a great\nconversation, so welcome. Matt Barnes --\nretired NBA player, cannabis advocate. My name is Mal of the \"Joe Budden Podcast\nwith Rory & Mal,\" and, uh, a weed advocate,\nfor sure. I'm Cheech.\nI'm the Director of Merchandise and the host of \"Sauce Talk\"\non VICELAND, and, um, yeah,\nheavy weed advocate. I'm Guapdad 4000 --\nalso used to work in the NBA. I used to to scalp tickets.\nI was -- [ Laughter ] I'm a scammer-turned-rapper, and that's what\nI'm here for. [ Laughs ] Uh, Jas Waters.\nI'm a writer/director. I'm on Showtime's \"Kidding.\" I'm DJ Nina9 --\nSiriusXM Hip-Hop Nation. I'm Al Harrington, ganjapreneur, owner of, uh, Viola Brands\nand, uh, Harrington Wellness. [ Indistinct conversations ] -There we go.\n-I'll be right here. Tonight, we're gonna\ntake you on a journey. So, we want\nto destigmatize cannabis through the universal\nlanguage of food. The whole meal is gonna be\nabout 20 milligrams, so you'll be able\nto pull back or consume. It's all up to you\nhow you wanna, you know, go on this journey. So, here we go, guys. It's a take on a fried oyster. This is about 3 milligrams. It's gonna be a little bit\non the saltier side, but I wanted to play with\nthe flavors of the Insane OG that we infused this with. It's piney.\nIt's mineral-y. I wanted to bring out the salt. Enjoy the first course. Harrington:\nSo, what are some of -- of everyone's funniest\nedible experiences? -Mm.\n-Who got funny ones? I met a girl, and she --\nand she -- and she came to go\non a first date with me. She didn't know that\nI would be on that edible.\nRight. Thought it was a first date, so I'm like, \"I'm broke, baby.\nWe're going to Denny's. We finna to chop it up. At Denny's\nis when the edible hit. I said,\n\"I ate all this weed cake. I need help.\" And she told me\nto drink milk. Right. I don't know why I didn't\nget it from Denny's. I said, \"Let's --\"\n'Cause they serve milk. \"Let's go to my house...\" [ Laughter ] -I mean, yeah.\n-\"...'cause my pop's got milk.\" [ Laughter ] I don't live with my pops. He was in jail. There was no milk! I'm from New York, right?\nAnd it's not legal in New York. So basically, anybody who's\nfucking around with edibles, they're just doing whatever\nthey think is what it is. -They do --\n-At least here -- yeah. At least here, you know,\nyou can dose it properly, and, you know,\nyou can take it in a way that you can measure\nwhat you're taking. Alcohol is so regulated.\nAlcohol is cool. Like, you can wake up\nand drink at 11:00 a.m., and it's called Sunday brunch. You know what I'm sayin'? We're in Prohibition\nright now. -Right.\n-Yeah, this is a Prohibition. Again, the whole alcohol of it\nwas about taxes. Once they could find\na system to -- to tax it and make money off of it,\nthen it was legal. See, but with edibles, for so long,\nit wasn't regulated, and I've seen a lot of -- yeah, I've seen it take\nsome of the best people out. -Yeah.\n-And I just -- so I'd never -- I never fuck with it, ever. I don't have no stories for you.\nI can't lie to you. I'll sit there and laugh at the\npeople and get high with my -- but I'm not gonna do the --\n'cause it -- You got no stories.\nYou have no control\nover that shit. Nina9: I'm not mad.\nI was high for like a week. It -- It felt good. Like, you go to sleep,\nyou wake up --\nWhoop-dee-do! [ Laughter ]\nI was good. [Laughs] \u266a\u266a When we think of\nan edible experience, we're always thinking of that\ntime when we got too high. -Mm-hmm.\n-And then with legalization, that's what it will help\nto prevent because there will be\nregulations on the edibles. Barnes:\nI think that's one thing, too, where, you know,\nmyself and Al are working with UCLA on this\ncannabis research program, and we really feel like -- I think, our goal is to remove\nthe word \"high...\" -Mm-hmm.\n...from it and explain\nthe educational -- educational side\nand the beneficial side of it 'cause I think people who don't know enough about it\nare afr-- \"I don't want to be high.\nNo, I don't want to be high.\" I think that they steer clear\nof the word \"high.\" So I think if you can really, you know, obviously,\neducate them and let them know\nthe beneficial side, especially being an athlete -- and we can speak\nfrom experience. Um, this is what it does\nfor our bodies. It hits everyone different,\nyou know. You may take to something\ndifferent, but there's a part on that --\non that plant that can help everybody.\n-Yeah. Harrington:\nYou know, if we left it to a vote of the -- the nation,\nyou know what I'm saying, I think that cannabis\nwould be legal, right? So, we all know that right now,\nthe issue is the politics. You know, they're trying\nto figure out how to tax it. They're trying to figure out\nhow to include big pharma. A lot of these states, they're always trying\nto create environments for the smaller people\nto fail. The one thing is, like,\nwe do know, like, the -- the community that's most\nnegatively affected by cannabis was the black community. -Yeah.\n-Absolutely. So, now we have this industry\nwhere, obviously, you know, our brothers and sisters\nare still locked up, but there's now\nan opportunity. And these black caucuses\nare in this mind-set of, like, \"No, we don't\nwant cannabis.\" And I'm telling them --\nI'm like, \"Look, we cannot miss\nthis opportunity 'cause there's billions\nof dollars at stake, not -- for -- for our communities.\" It -- I'm very aware\nof the fact, like, I'm on television\ncooking with cannabis while people are in jail\nfor much less. -Yeah, facts.\n-Right? -Yeah.\n-So... But what I think\nthat the show does and other\ncannabis content does is push the narrative forward so it's not this thing that, like,\nhas this bad stigma. I think about this\nevery single time I go into a dispensary. How many of my cousins\nare sitting in jail for the same weed? And the truth is --\nis that the only difference\nbetween them and me is state and time. But this is all politics, so it's -- it's --\nit's more than just the money\nthat's out there. It's also access\nto the healing that's out there. It's also being able to\nparticipate in something that makes you better rather than\nsitting behind bars because you got to it\nfirst. B Real: Like they said for years\nbefore it was legal, this is the number-one\ncash crop, right? So it's about convincing\nconservative and religious voters. -Money talks.\n-Yeah. -Right.\n-Lobbyists. -Lobbyists...\n-Lobbyists. ...because realistically, a senator in the South or a congressman\nor a governor -- he might not want\nto risk his seat. The game plan is,\nhow do we convince them? The conservatives\nsee the money behind it, so that's a easy --\nthat's a easy win right there. -But once --\n-I think it's, uh,\nedu-- education. Yeah, and it's all\nabout education. It's ab-- It's about having\nthose conversations you're talking about. But I think, you know,\nwe're in a time where people are open-minded, and they're hungry\nfor information. \u266a\u266a Lavorato: You get curious. Like, when it starts\nto be more around, you're like, \"Huh.\nOkay, well, maybe I could -- oh, it works\nfor my back pain? Oh, I have arthritis.\nI can take a bath in it. I don't have to get high.\"\n-Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Everybody thinks of weed,\nand they're thinking about... -High.\n-...are they getting high, but there's CBD that has\nnon-psychoactive properties, and it's -- like, I put my mom\non to, like, the CBD cream, and now she's always like,\n\"Oh, my God. My neck hurts.\" Like, \"Can you bring me\nthat thing?\" And it's like, there are\nso many properties to this plant that is so stigmatized,\nand it's like -- There are so many things\nthat you can do. But if you don't want\nto get high -- not everyone takes\nto being high. Like, some people\njust can't deal with it. -Right.\n-You know what I'm saying? But there are so many\nbenefits to the plant, and you can do it\nwithout having to be altered. For me, weed was always\nthat thing that made me not feel like\njumping out of my skin. -Mm.\n-You know? And now I know that\nthat feeling of feeling like you're\njumping out of your skin is what anxiety is. A part of the high is, like,\nbefore you actually smoke, like, breaking the weed up,\nyou know, rolling up.\nIt's a ritual. So if you have anxiety\nand you're doing that, that helps you --\nyour mind relax... -The process.\n...calm down. -Mm-hmm.\n-And then you smoke. I died off of edibles\none night, though.\nI came back, though. [ Laughter ]\nI didn't realize\nyou came back? Yeah, I came back.\nYou came back. -How? Explain. Elaborate.\n-I-I was up, and then I was down. [ Laughter ] It's that simple. Dee Nasty: My God,\nthat smells really good. What's up with\nthe second course? Trinidad:\nIt's called a salad. It's called a salad? Well, I can smell it\nfrom over here. That's for the third course,\nbaby. We got some garlic\nand some ginger slowly browning. Bring that salad over here. [ Speaks Spanish ] Alright. So, you know,\nwe are in California. There's a lot of fresh produce. And the the strains\nthat we're using -- there's not only the Insane OG, but we also got some stuff\nfrom Viola, from Al's company. And this shit is fire. I mean, it's strong as fuck.\nAlright? Because it has coconut oil, it's gonna absorb into your\nsystem a whole lot faster, so this is gonna hit you,\nlike, in 15 minutes. What's the funniest shit somebody sent to y'all\non social media? I have a -- I had a guy who --\nhe was like, \"I want you\nto humiliate me on 'Live' with, like,\nthree of your girlfriends.\" And I just was like,\n\"I don't know, son.\" Like, \"I don't know\nif I could do that.\" He's like, \"Yeah, like,\nI'll wear your panties.\" -Oh, wow.\n-Oh, word? Yeah, he wanted me to --\nYeah. He wanted\nto wear my panties. He wanted them to be\nspecifically pink. I s-- I turned it down. That was the craziest thing\nthat I had gotten in my DMs, you know, other\nthan the occasional\ndick pic and shit. -Who's gonna follow that?\n-Which are the worst. Yeah, I hate 'em, even though I did see one\nthe other day that I was like, \"Oh. Okay.\"\n-You get surprised. Nina9: You see it, and you be\nlike, \"Okay, now delete.\" No, no,\nbut that's very rare. Guapdad 4000:\nYeah. That shit is cool, but imagine being a dude\nwho gotta deal with that who don't want to\n'cause that's --\nI mean, look -- [ Laughter ] My whole thing is\nif you get a dick pic, send them one back. -No!\n-Whoa. [ Laughs ] If you're a girl --\nIf you're a girl, they'll be thrown\noff guard. B Real:\nI get the occasional -- the occasional, you know,\nbig weed stunt -- somebody smoking through,\nlike, a turkey or a, you know, cantaloupe\nor this or that, you know. They plague my shit\nwith that. But you know, I re-post it.\n-Right. Yeah. I like that. Like you found it. Some of it's good,\nyou know. You were basically\none of the first people who started\npromoting weed. When you came out, like, you\nwere one of the first rappers, and everybody thought\nthat if you were smoking weed, you was, like, on heroin\nand crack, as well, you know? So, you were\none of the first to kind of break through\nand open that up.\nRight. So, tell us about\nyour journey into that. We for sure rolled up\nand smoked weed, but we also, you know,\nwere fucking with \"High Times\" and getting information\nfrom \"High Times.\" We were constantly\neducating ourselves about the -- the --\nthe cannabis movement, going under the tutelage\nof -- of, uh, Jack Herer, rest in peace. -Which is a great strain.\n-Great strain. -Right, yes.\n-Dude, great strain. But he's also a great man because he educated a lot of us\nthrough a book called \"The Emperor\nWears No Clothes.\" -Mm-hmm.\n-And we started seeing, like, from the -- you know,\nin the '20s and '30s, the propaganda starts shifting\nagainst cannabis. Throughout our career, we had obstacles and blocks,\nyou know, because we were\nthe cannabis group. That's why people\nlook at weed the way they do, because they're looking at\nall these other drugs that kids are\nreally dying off of... Right.\n...and they're putting\nall of these drugs in one lane. I think\nit's also stereotyped as a minority thing. -Yeah.\n-Absolutely. You know what I mean?\nTo keep it real, you know. I mean, people -- first,\nthey want to get their -- th-their foot in a- a-and get their position\nwith the taxes and everything, but it's -- it's stigma as, uh, you know,\nyou see rappers doing it... -Mm-hmm.\n-...or people who are lazy or, like you said,\nit gets clumped in with the lean\nand the other shit...\nYeah. ...'cause you always\nsee people smoking when they're drinking --\nyou know what I mean? So it -- it all gets\nclumped into one. So, like --\n-Is it legal now in New York? -No.\n-No, not yet. It's legal in Jersey,\nright? They just postponed\nthe vote that was supposed\nto happen last month. And even though like 60%\nof the residents and the governor is, like,\ninto it, like, the Senate was, like,\nalso, like, \"nah.\" Harrington: Throughout\nthe licensing process, there wasn't no diversity. And that's a huge issue\nin the industry...\nMm-hmm. ...because there's not enough\nblack representation -- black, brown, women\nrepresentation in this space. So that's what it was about. They didn't want\nto monop--\nIn Jersey? They didn't want to monopolize\nthis process. They wanted\nto make sure that -- you know, that social equity\nwould be addressed before\nthey went recreational. \u266a\u266a Mal: I think Miguel\nwants to give intro. What are we eating? Uh, this is, uh,\npescado con coco, also known as... It's local rockfish, so it's very similar\nto red snapper. Uh, the coconut sauce\nthat you see under it is infused with the Insane OG and the Viola strain\nthat you guys gave us. A little bit of spice,\nlittle bit of ginger, some brightness, coconut,\nall smoothed out -- 5 milligrams. -12 milligrams.\n-Yeah, 12 milligrams. -What about the drink?\n-Yeah, what's the drinks? -The drink was 4 to 5.\n-Hey! Enjoy, you guys. -Thank you, Miguel.\n-Thank you. Harrington:\nI just feel like the only way\nwe gonna affect change is, like,\nwe gotta create jobs. You got-- You gotta\ncreate financial freedom. Like, without money,\nyou're gonna be miserable. Lavorato: Would there be\nsome way to do that with, like,\na co-op system? So, like, everybody could\nhave a piece of -- like, say you did\na manufacturing --\nA co-op in the projects? Well, I mean, like, if you did,\nlike, a manufacturing facility where all of the workers\nwere invested in the facility, you know what I mean?\nWaters: You gotta back up\nfor a second, though, because what\nyou're talking about is the poverty\nof low expectation. So, if I'm\non the street corner, and I'm slinging or I'm doing\nwhatever I'm doing, at the end of the day, my -- I have chronic headaches. I don't know what's --\nwhat's wrong, but I know that I don't\nfeel well most days. I'm also desensitized to\nthe idea of losing someone. So if I'm being told my life doesn't\nactually matter, a co-op does nothing. Um, until you stop,\nlike, surviving, you\ncan't really live. -Yeah.\n-You know what I mean? Like -- like --\nand that's basically what you were saying\nin a nutshell -- Yes, it's desperation.\nLike, just everybody\ndesperate... Yes.\n...needy,\nyou know what I mean? It's like, dead serious,\na crab in a barrel, everybody just trying\nto get to the top or just trying to live. -Yeah.\n-You know what I mean? And you can't --\nyou can't see a hum-- you know, a humorous side\nwhen you -- when your ribs\nis touching.\nNo. You know what I mean?\nAnd you hungry or you're cold. You ain't got no --\nyou ain't got no heat. We all know what it's like. We -- We think it's\nabout raising the bar,\nand it's not. It's raising the ceiling.\nRight. And it's something that --\nthat you take for granted. And, also, in a lot of ways --\nI grew up in the suburbs. I take it for granted.\nLavorato: Right. In that you never --\nyou weren't in a situation where you had\nto actually, like, fight to just be considered\na human being. And now you're talking\nabout black men in low-income\nsituations...\nRight. ...who aren't even\nallowed to cry... -Right.\n-...or to even talk about what's happening\nto them.\nYeah. And then you want to tell them,\n\"Put your guns down.\" Well, \"put it down, why?\nWhy do I even matter? -So someone else can shoot me?\n-Right. Exactly. So, I think you have to --\nyou have to start a long way before you do a co-op\nor any sort of job opportunity. It's -- It's giving people\nhumanity. \u266a\u266a Trinidad: In front of you,\nyou have an olive-oil cake, which we do\nwith the Butter Baby. Okay, the panna cotta, we put some of\nthe Insane OG in that and some orange zest. Uh, the berry coulis\non the bottom are fresh berries\nthat we picked up on Melrose market\nthis Sunday and just, you know,\ncooked them down and made a nice sauce with it. This right here is about\n6 1/2 milligrams. But this is where\nwe give you the choice. If you feel it's too much,\ndon't eat all of the cake. Take a small bite.\n-Well, how do you do that? -Have some of the panna cotta.\n-Right. You gotta -- That's the dangerous\npart 'cause it's too\ndelicious to pass up. If we're gonna\nwalk on ice, we might as well dance,\nbaby.\nYou might as well. Let's do it. [Laughs] -Damn!\n-Damn! Harrington: You've gotta eat\nthe whole thing. Oh, my God. I'm ready to wrap this up and put it\nin my pocket, man. -This is so good.\n-So, check this out. She had --\nShe had a good question while we were on --\non the break for a second.

[ Indistinct conversations ] Way higher than I thought\nI was gonna be.", "J42pmHV8ZEk": "Transcriber: Almudena Torrecilla\nReviewer: Rhonda Jacobs When I was 33 years old, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. And like so many who've gone before me, that diagnosis changed my life. It changed the way I look at the world. And it led me to two very common questions that one starts to ask when diagnosed\nwith a life-threathening illness. How did this happen? And what do I do now? Now this isn't a story\nabout self blame. These are just common\nand natural questions that come from many in times like these. I actually found the questions empowering. This is actually a story about how those\ntwo questions led to a realization that I think can help\nto change the conversation around what means to be and stay healthy. So back to my first question: how did this happen? See, (Sigh) I felt like I had done\neverything right. What do I mean by that? Well, if I ask you, what does\nit mean to be healthy, to live a healthy lifestyle? What kind of answers do you get? Regular exercise? Balanced diet? Taking your vitamins? Annual checkups? Limiting toxic exposure to chemicals,\npersonal care products? Well, by all of these\naccounts, I was healthy. I had done the work. So I was angry, and I was frustrated that I'd followed the rules\nand I still found myself sick. Now, I had a friend \nwho a few years earlier had been diagnosed with breast cancer. And when it came to being healthy, she put everyone I know to shame. So I knew she would understand\nhow I was feeling. When we got together, \nshe told me something that would eventually change the way \nI think about health. She told me that her journey \nhad taken her to a place where she believed whole-heartedly  that she had not in fact \nbeen truly healthy. Not at a whole person level because \nshe'd overlooked taking care of herself at the level of her thoughts \nand her emotions. So what she was saying \nhad some subjective merit to me because I can relate to suppressing\nmy own thoughts and emotions maybe in order to please others, or taking on the stress\nof trying to juggle a thousand things. But then the pragmatist in me just wanted to brush that off\nas a little too woo-woo. Then again I had, you know, tackled all of these. And here she was standing\nright in front of me, the picture of health and vitality. So what could it hurt\nto look into this a little further? So down I went through\nrabbit hole number one: mind-body medicine. And for those who of you don't know, mind-body medicine\nstudies how our mind, mood, thoughts and emotion affect our body. So that would be things like \nstress management, stress reduction, like going for a walk in nature, \nunplugging from technology, getting a massage, meditation, (Sigh) mindful breath-work, and thought and belief awareness. So this would be something as simple\nas being more mindful of our thoughts, or something more concrete \nlike cognitive behavioral therapy, where you become actively aware\nof your thoughts and behaviors and then replace them\nwith more positive alternatives that in turn elicit\nmore positive emotions. I also started delving into stories that highlight the mind's ability\nto affect the body. Like the peer-reviewed account\ndocumented by Dr. Klockner in 1959 about a man who he called Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright was diagnosed\nwith terminal cancer and given only days to live. With tumors the size of oranges \nhe had heard or a horse serum that was said to be effective\nagainst cancer and he begged to receive it. His physician, Dr. Philip West,\nreluctantly agreed but was astonished to find\nless than a week later his patient was out of his death bed \nand joking with his nurses. Now, this went on for months until Mr. Wright read a newspaper article stating that the serum was a quack remedy and he suffered an immediate relapse. Now, Dr. West, testing out a hypothesis, said: \"Well, don't believe everything\nyou read in the papers,\" and then he proceeded\nto inject him with what he said was a super-refined, double-strength\nversion of the drug. Really it was water. \nBut again, the tumors melted away. Mr. Wright was the picture of health\nand vitality for another two months until he read what he felt\nwas a definitive report stating that the serum was worthless, \nand he died days later. Now, this is just one of thousands\nand thousands of examples that highlight how the mind\ncan affect the body. And, so I had my anecdotal evidence, which\nincluded the example of my own friend, and I'd like to say that I took\nwhat I learned and put it into practice and lived happily ever after. Of course, that's not what happened. And I don't think I'm alone in that, because many of us hear about how stress\nand emotions can affect our health and how mindfulness meditation\ncan make a difference in our lives and all of that, but many of us also \ndon't do anything about it. I had the stories and the theories, but what I really needed\nwas hard evidence, science to prove that it was true. I mean, we've all grown up\nin a world of, you know, Newtonian, science-based thinking, meaning if we can't see it\nor measure it, then it's not real. So I, like maybe, maybe many of you, didn't start to put these ideas\ninto practice just yet. What I did, and this is now getting into \nthe second of the two questions that I alluded to earlier,\nthe \"What do I do now?\". What I did is I started using\nmedical cannabis at the recommendation\nof my nurse and other patients. And it helped immensely with pain \nand nausea and anxiety and all of the really fun staff\nthat come along with cancer treatment. I also started joining online\nmedical cannabis user communities. And I was in awe at the spectrum of issues\nthat cannabis was helping with. Intractable illnesses that weren't\nresponding to other forms of treatment, like MS, fibromyalgia, PTSD,\nTourette syndrome, IBS, epilepsy, chronic pain, autoimmune\ndiseases ... I could keep going. The list goes on. But I started to wonder, how was it\nthat cannabis was helping with all of these unrelated conditions, because I can't think of another\nmedication out there that would be able to help \nwith so many illnesses. So how did it work? Well, down I went\nthrough rabbit hole number two, and this was a deep hole. In a nutshell, I learned that the reason that cannabis was working \nfor so many different conditions is because it interacts directly with \nour body's own endocannabinoid system. The endocannabinoid system is\na little known but massive bodily system responsible for maintaining homeostasis,\nthat's balance, in the body. It consists of a network of \nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids as well as receptor sites, the most well-known being the CB1 and CB2\nreceptors, and enzymes. Think of it kind of like\nthe traffic lights of a city, keeping the streets moving smoothly. But if a light goes out anywhere,\nit will cause problems. Congestion, confusion. Cars and people will keep moving, \nbut without the guidance and the rules, the flow just won't be as efficient \nand far more susceptible to accidents. It's actually been called the most\nprolific and integrative system in human health and homeostasis, and even dubbed\nour body's own master system because of its role in maintaining balance\namong all the other systems of the body. Now, this is important because all illness\ncan in fact essentially be boiled down to some sort of imbalance in the body, whether genetically induced or otherwise. Now, if you haven't heard of this system\nbefore, you're not alone. And if you are hearing about it \nfor the first time, you may be wondering why on earth you haven't heard of this\nepically important system until now. And it's partly because it's newly\ndiscovered in around the 1980s, but also partly because\nof the stigma around cannabis, for which the system is named. Because scientists discovered the system when they were trying to answer\nthat same question: \"how does cannabis work?\" So they learned that compounds in the\ncannabis plant called phytocannabinoids actually fit near perfectly\nwith the receptor sites of the endocannabinoid system. So used properly, this plant\ncan help to activate, tone and support the endocannabinoid\nsystem when it's out of balance. So it's a pretty amazing plant. To say I became obsessed with\ncannabis and the endocannabinoid system is an understatement. I buried myself in research papers,\nlectures, courses, certifications, learning everything I could about cannabis as well as ways to keep\nthe endocananbinoid system itself healthy and balanced. Because while it's easy to say, \"wow, look at this amazing\nplant that we have; it's able to help\nwith all these chronic conditions and balance the body,\" and obviously I believe that; I've dedicated part of my life\nto spreading the message that cannabis is medicine. But it's equally important\nto look beyond cannabis as a single cure. Because when you look closer, you'll see\nthat cannabis is an important ally, but it's only part of the puzzle. So, let's use that example again\nas the endocannabinoid system and the traffic lights. Except for in this scenario, cannabis\nis like the friendly police officer that comes in to direct traffic\nwhen the lights are out. So the officer's doing their best, and certainly it's helping to keep traffic\nmoving in a more organized manner, but we still have to figure out\nor at least try to figure out how to fix the lights. So how do we go about fixing the lights? How do we support and heal\nthe endocannabinoid system when it's out of balance? Well, it just so happens\nthat one review study in particular looked at 325 other studies that all focused on what helped\nand hindered the endocannabinoid system by focusing on key\nendocannabinoid health factors, and here's what they learned\ndirectly affect the system. Exercise, and notice I wrote\n\"Pleasurable Exercise\" there - it has to be something\nthat you enjoy doing. Okay? Diet and supplements.\nSo a couple examples that I'll give you. Herbs and spices contain\nsmall amounts of phytocannabinoids, the same compound that cannabis contains. And certain healthy fats can actually\nhelp your body to synthesize its own endocannabinoids. Environmental exposures. So some pesticides will actually\ndownregulate the endocannabinoid system, have a direct effect with it. There are a few others\nI'm going to share with you. But before I do, I just want to bring\nyour attention to a sentence that really jumped out at me\nwhen I was reading this study. It said that the endocannabinoid system represents a microcosm\nof psychoneuroimmunology. And I had to look that last word up. In case some of you don't know,\nI'm going to break it down. Psychoneuroimmunology is the study of the interaction\nbetween the psychological processes, \"the mind,\" and the systems\nof the body, \"the body.\" So really it's just a fancy way of saying\nthat metaphorically speaking, the endocannabinoid system represents\na microcosm of mind-body medicine. So now hopefully you can see\nwhere this is all coming full circle and coming together, I hope. Because here's what else was shown\nto affect the endocannabinoid system: Chronic stress. So they looked at stress from pain as well as stress\nfrom thoughts and emotions, so repeated feelings\nlike anger, guilt, depression - something that is chronic\nmeans more long-term. That was shown to significantly impact\nthe endocannabinoid system. And activities that elicit \nthe relaxation response. So that would be, again,\nkind of that walk in nature or doing some yoga, getting a massage. They consider osteopathic\nmanipulation in that study. So why does this matter? Well, I said before that we live\nin a physical world, so for many of us if we can't see it\nand measure it, then it's not real. I told about how I had heard stories\nabout how the mind can affect the body, but I still didn't give it the same weight\nthat I would give to nutrition and movement and medicine. But when I understood\nthat my own endocannabinoid system, my master system for maintaining\nhealth and homeostasis, required me to start taking care\nof my thoughts, my emotions, my stress, my beliefs, it finally clicked for me. So I want to leave you\nwith a scenario to imagine, an idea of how this information can help\nto change the conversation around health, like I said in the beginning. Imagine if the message that we heard from\nour physicians and public health officials sounded like this: \"Listen, what if I told you that there's\nthis really important bodily system, call it a master system, and if you can keep it functioning well, it can do wonders in allowing your body\nto innately keep itself healthy, heal itself and improve the quality of life for those\nwith biological and genetic illnesses.\" If I told you there was\na system like that, would you want to know\nhow to keep it strong and healthy? And I think most would answer yes to that. And then they would go on to say, \"Great, \nso think of this system like a stool. Each of the legs represents\nall that's required to keep the system functioning well. And here's why we compare it to a stool. Each of those legs is an integral part\nof keeping that stool stable and balanced. If we remove a leg, or even shorten a leg,\nthe whole stool starts to wobble and becomes less efficient,\nless stable, less balanced. So let's design a plan for you\nthat incorporates all of these concepts as part of a healthy lifestyle.\" Imagine. Not only is that proactive,\nbut it's empowering. And I invite all of you to consider\nwhere your stool is wobbling. It's been said that mindfulness could be\nthe next great public health revolution. I believe it's only a matter of time\nbefore mindfulness, stress reduction, thought-belief awareness is every bit\nas important as seeing your doctor, taking your vitamins, eating a balanced\ndiet and getting regular exercise. And maybe the endocannabinoid system\ncan help to catalyze that. It's my hope that the more we understand\nthe ramifications of this master system, the more we'd be willing to develop\na truly integrated approach to whole personal health. Who would have thought\nthat cannabis, the gateway drug, could actually form part of the gateway to\nthe next great public health revolution? Thank you.

Siri Satnam Singh and I'm a licensed therapist this week I'm sitting down with a man who is battling depression and deeply-rooted shame today we will witness him confronting his fast this is Damian Abraham [Music] [Music] so your past I know nothing about it yes mother and father what was all about I grew up upper-middle class middle class I guess my mom was a flight attendant my dad was in advertising my mom had a heart attack at 40 and had to stop being a flight attendant and then my they'd been divorced by that point we had a terrible stepfather okay and he did it kind of everything wrong and I think the other thing that ultimately was the shattering thing was he was such a moralist right like this is around the time Bill Clinton Monica Lewinsky and I can remember sitting at the dinner table and he was like they should throw him in jail like Bo claw it was this very like I didn't get along with them politically at that point but then just to kind of have this like it's like sort of ultimate alpha male vision of this is what you should do you should work hard you know I'm a pilot but I also had another job filling vending machines I do this and I do that you know and I'm raising you children to be polite and use manners and respect people you know he had a another life that he was dealing with too so but he it wasn't a great dude yeah and then it's you know it's the things that we're not aware of that really impact our lives so the moralist stepdad I'm sure you had impulses that you wanted to act out that you could not act out because this is not good that's unconscious shaming yeah yeah talk about that some of the impulses you may have had that he said ah dinner so much anxiety is stress around family dinner you know it was really important that we all sat down together and then it was there are a lot of rules you know like how we set the table you know and how we conducted ourselves at that table and it wasn't like we're sitting in a formal dining room dressed up this was just that the dinner table the breakfast table and I think there's a lot of stress around that it was like a shells like it was like a time bomb sitting across the dinner table from this person like what little inconsistency have I forgotten now I have I made that I wasn't supposed to that's gonna set this guy off and it was never like a physical abuse but it was like not talking to you for like two or three days cuz you ran down the stairs it was a very bizarre you see how you internalize that change yeah yes he shamed you yeah and you internalized the shame that because I put the fork this way and it should have been that way that I am not good looking at your videos the word that came out to me is raised it's not just anger on the stage it's rage definitely yes and rage is a ramification of dealing with shame and a number of artists it's not a through-line but this concept that you have been chained unconsciously that you know I'm not good enough and you defend against it divided because a star everything's still bare I am invisible down here on the same level no one should see me because I'm bad so you defend against it and come to a level to where everybody will see me on stage it's it's another form of dealing with shame exhibitionism the where I will dance so fast and seeing so loud and be so flamboyant and be so grand that no one will see that I feel less than no absolutely it's like it's it's a it's an armor yeah you know like you put it on and you could be that other person yeah so you haven't identified from my perspective up to the day consciously that you are shame-based talk about your experience as a teenage boy here it is dad is gone at when did dad leave dad left when I was grade five so I think I would have been about 12 my dad was British he moved back to England moved to Los Angeles for a while then moved back to Toronto so at the age of 16 I went straight edge which is like a way to be sober you know and identify with something in your sobriety which is as a kid it was so important to me you know so I could be straight edge which meant I didn't do drugs I didn't train I didn't do any of that stuff and I I was part of this thing and then I did that you know and I straighted stop me being important to me after a couple years but I still called myself straightedge just as you know shorthand for it well let's not fail you coming to the get room now yes so where do you feel like you feel is a child I don't know I guess it like I guess like I had struggled in school in the very beginning grade one I was diagnosed with a learning disability that I've kind of come to realize was actually my exam anxiety disorder at that age kind of manifesting itself I would have panic attacks learning new concepts so anxiety around I know failure anxiety around what else I'm talking to a fat kid trust me there's a lot to get okay let's work through it being a young teenager preety can do is perceived as housing having breasts you know yeah I was like you know I had to go swimming with these people you know and and it was a physical shaming you know I think it was more like a body shaming thing it was I was the fat kid I want you to have empathy for the child that experienced that I think that's the one that we need to bring into the session the one that maybe on the stage and you punk-rock the one who maybe unconsciously showing up in places I made a name for myself by having a crazy live show early on it would be bloody and it would be chaotic smashing you know and I was big I was huge at that time I look at that now that was a panic attack like I was just like going up there and freaking the on stage and like hurting myself you know I was definitely reckless in my behavior and that's a panic attack and you know it's almost like to get to that to play that fool on stage every night to be that person for people you almost have to get to that panic attack stage what is coming to the space so far is fear mm-hmm anxiety of course that you're trying desperately to stay controlled and I think that's key to the panic attack and the nervous breakdowns to where you're trying to desperately stay in control of these feelings and then you can and then he explode and what are some of the symptoms you have when you have a panic attack like a lack of joy you know just a general like it's it's it's all gone I would just be like tossing and turning at night just worried about anything everything and I think the problem is being in a band it just hyper accentuates those feelings because it's like you're your kind of you live and die based on what someone else thinks about you and I think that's probably why I'm hesitant writing lyrics for the new record you know it's probably why I'm hesitant to to do other things that I want to do creatively is because you don't want to fail on it so what are we gonna do with this critic stepfather was a critic yes the teachers were a critic yes your friends were a critic yes and you still haven't escaped it that you have these musical critics what are you gonna do with that that's a the big question I guess yes I think the critic is inside of you so you're working all day with these shames although you see what I'm saying in different ways it's yeah there's a lot of shame but I also like the other piece of it I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing without this you know without my mental health whatever it is that I've dealt with I wouldn't be fortunate to be able to live this dream you know like I kind of manifested my own destiny in that way yeah well you have something you have obviously some self-love there too but that shame is in there with the self love so it's like toxic cocktail yeah yeah yeah so this reminds me of Anna Freud where she talked about when we are aggressed against that eventually we aggress against ourselves yeah we we no longer need the perpetrator to beat us over the head now we incorporate that aggression against ourselves and that's what you're doing you were beat into it you gotta be perfect you got to be perfect thus I'm not good enough so plus I can't write though I'm travelling all over the world and being recognized yet I can't write on my new album because I'm not good enough so we have to release the inner critic we gotta let him go I'm experiencing you as a man who's very present with his feelings attributions and I think that you have a lot of feelings that that come all the time all the time and really fast you and you are having challenge processing them as quickly as they come I find it like depending on the situation it's hard to let that River flow you know like I think every situation where it's hard to let it flow first day of this tour was like I get I would arrive in the city we pick up the van pick up all the gear drive to the show this case it was Phoenix Arizona which needs five hours in that van in five hours we don't we're not like a band of friends you know there's like bands you hear about them they're like we're all buddies that's not us like why do we fly to LA to pick up a van to then drive to Arizona and then drive all the way back the next day thus spending 12 hours in a tiny little van together that we already hate being in each other with beside each other inside of it and were then we're gonna have to drive all the way up to Vancouver in a van with each other yet for some reason we thought an extra five hours was worth saving a few dollars so phone's idea that to you oh hi yes do you feel I'll be pissed I just think how they feel oh I do this is identification with the aggressor your stepfather a Mian that's not good what are you doing you should never do this so now you have identified with the aggressor and you have become him I don't like the person I become like you know I don't like the way I treat people you know and I find like I don't like the way I treat myself I don't like the way yeah like I it's cool well I should say whenever you speak to your sauna to your van gesture to your wife or whomever that you become aware that they have the potential to reacting to me and not doing what I would like to happen because I'm shaming right I find it I find I can get that place after I've lost my temper and I'm almost like I can't get out of that place after I've lost my temper you know where I'm less like there's almost like too much empathy at that point like I feel so bad for what I did to them yeah so how can we this is just behavioral stuff now so can you be aware of something of that that that's something that you really would like to change that's right yeah I definitely I can see it's like the panic reaction you know I'm like I was quick to fight you know when I was growing up as a younger kid you know it was just like a trigger temper you know and it was just no I'm and it's been trying to get these emotions in check you know it's work what's the word yeah definitely it's work yeah I would love like to be able to get away from that and do away with it I found cannabis is my closest the closest time to that but before I had cannabis oh my god let's go there my early 20s I was seeing a woman her family went through unbelievable violence I had a breakdown came back to Toronto got put on paxil Bute Hren ativan a bunch I can't probably remember the names of I've tried them all and then about six years ago after ten years of these drugs I was in Holland that cycled off my pills again because I didn't like the side-effects felt the panic kind of coming on weed was everywhere turned someone in my band smoking weed so can I try it everyone looked at me like I was lost my mind cuz I'd never done it and immediately it just something happened I could look at myself outside of the anxiety it allowed me to slow down the emotions the flood of emotions and kind of take them as they came and at first I was I was you talk about shame imagine being strain it and identifying is a sober person and the strength than that for 15 years and then trying to drink or in my case smoke weed a lot of strange kids go through this weird thing when they break when they break edge so I felt weird guilt about it at first but then I realized it was working for me and then the weight loss came I was drinking like 6 liters of soda a day you know things like that like now I don't drink soda um but that was cannabis that allowed me to look at that and be like that's gross that's a lot of sugar no one should drink that much sugar and I don't know it I really gained a lot of perspective you know so you have found something that works for you that has been legalized yes it's a I find there opee and it certainly the cannabis have been the best ways to kind of to deal with stuff yeah and it takes time to release this this stuff Shane is the worst feeling that I have come up with in my clients it's just the face because it takes away your love of yourself it goes to the bone it's to the core I think I told a lot more shame about my mental health in my early 20s once I was diagnosed and I was put on those prescriptions but I think later once I kind of gained control of my mental health and gained a little bit of power over it I find working on it it makes me feel stronger this is something that's challenging and it's just let's say it's gonna be challenging for you to overcome this oh it's definitely challenging to overcome this yes and to be easy on yourself but yet if you continue to give it conscious focus it will change it was shift [Music] have you ever done breath of fire I don't think so so you inhale this time he goes out thanks how it goes in exhale close your eyes this is the center of self I want you to open your mouth wide this is the stuff that really transforms you from one session to the next I want you to see yourself there's a little boy at home at school with friends I want you to see when that little boy was unconsciously or consciously shamed don't judge it just experience it and when we experience it in this time in space we are releasing the shame these repressed memories see that lo vuoi how he was shamed for house with his learning disability with his weight at home at the dinner table don't run away from it get into the breath of paranoia let the fear come up don't run away from it the deeper you go the freer you be when you leave here and this safe space feel it [Laughter] inhale exhale let it go let it go let it go let it go what's in the room right now what are you feeling right now having gone through this process I feel for the first time an awareness of how deep shame goes and that the fact that the shame that I experience internally isn't necessarily the result of negative things that were put on me it might have just been innocent critiques of people's you know best intentions I think I also you know like maybe like a little bit of permission for myself to try and enjoy this a little bit more because it's it's it's fleeting and it would be fun to enjoy it while it's happening as opposed to regret it okay okay well end our session with angel cards and I just throw it to the unknown and let the unknown communicate to my client and see if you get some communication from the unknown from spirit I came in to myself we're gonna share it share it okay commitment okay what does that mean to you I think for me it's gonna be commitment to improving you know my mental and spiritual health you know like in emotional health - I guess - as well but bringing commitment to kind of like working on that you know and then it is something you have to be committed to and work out every day it only gets better when they work at it every day so that's what I you know take for that one well good good good good well I think our sessions come to an end and it's been a great session but thank you very much for having me thank you for being here [Music]

We're going to talk about the different\nStates that got legalized and some plans for you as an operator or as someone\ntrying to get into the industry. What should you consider? So wait about maybe one or two minutes\nhere for everything to kind of... be able to jump into the room. If you're watching this wherever you're\nwatching from, go ahead, drop in... in the chat where you're\ncalling in from, you know, are you in one of these new\nStates or are you in, you know, a current operating market? You know, we're going to talk about the\nnew legalized markets here. So maybe about five to eight\nmore seconds here. Nice. Greg Richard here in New\nJersey. I'm glad you joined in. We're going to talk a\nlot about your Jersey. That's probably the one on the most\nexcited about so good deal. Good deal. All right. So over the I'm gonna just get, we'll get started the presentation\nhere. So over the past 24 hours, we've learned that five new States\nhave legalized cannabis for either recreational medical or both uses. Now, those States are Arizona for recreational\nNew Jersey, for recreational, South Dakota, for recreational\nand medical Montana, for recreational cannabis and\nMississippi for medical cannabis. Now those markets could create\n$2.5 billion in medical and recreational cannabis business\nsales by the year 2024. So that's a lot of money\nwe're talking about here, and the industry is just\nexploding naturally. So you also may have saw that\nin Vermont about a month ago, legalized recreational cannabis. So\nthis is a lot of stuff moving over here, especially in the Northeast. So let's go ahead and break\ndown each market as to its size, the current landscape and the\nthoughts about the future here. But before we get started, I need to let you know that\nthe information contained\nin this presentation is meant for guidance purposes only, and not a professional legal\nor tax advice and further, it does not give any personalized legal\ntax investment or any business advice in general. So with all of\nthat, out of the way, let's dive into our first\nmarket here, Arizona. Now this is the second largest\npopulous market of the new ones here. So 7.3 million people. So there's a fair amount of total\naddressable market for recreational clients here. Now they do have a cap licensing\nstructure of 10% of the traditional pharmacies in the state. So thanks CVS\nRite aid, Walgreens, things like that. So they have just shy of\n1500 traditional pharmacies in Arizona. So the dispensary count\nwill be kept about 145 to one, maybe 60 at the most, right? You're\nnot seeing a ton of CVS is being built. So we don't see this, you\nknow, dramatically increasing, but for every 10 pharmacies, traditional pharmacies that go up one\ndispensary can now have another license. Now the proposition\nalso grants localities, certain regulatory powers regarding\ncannabis established businesses, including the prohibition of such\ncannabis businesses within their jurisdiction. You see this\nin places like California, where two thirds of the state does\nnot allow commercial cannabis business activity. Now, should they\nexercise these powers, these localities or these jurisdictions? It could lower the cannabis consumption\nand thus lower the tax revenue obtained from cannabis sales. Now social equity is also earmarked\nin this cannabis legislation. And according to Canada radar, there is 106 licenses actively\nthat are vertically integrated. I think there's at least 130\noperators though. So close, right? So that leaves about, you know, 40 or 50 new licenses\npotentially up for the public and social equity licenses. Because some of these earlier medical\nmarijuana businesses are going to get by first crack at these licenses, these\nrecreational cannabis licenses. So from there, let's go ahead and\ntalk about New Jersey here. Okay? So you've got this, this is the\nlargest newest market, right? It's almost 9 million people,\n8.9 million people here. Now, why do we talk about population? I'm\ntalking about how big these places are, okay. That's called your Tam,\nyour total addressable market. And if you were to\nconquer an entire state, that's how much pie is actually\navailable in that state. Now you're going to be fracturing it\nbecause there's lots of operators there, but at any rate, this is your\ntotal addressable market. Now people are not evenly\ndistributed in all States, right? There are very high densely populated\nurban areas in their suburban areas. There's rural areas. So people are spread\nout different areas of that nature. Now you could go into a very large\nstate like a New Jersey or an Arizona, but be in the middle of nowhere and have\nonly 10,000 people within five miles of your dispensary or say, you're in Arizona. You go to downtown Phoenix and maybe you\nhave 3 million people within a 10 mile radius of you. So really we\ntalk about the market size, but cannabis is a local business. So understand that you really need to\nlook at the actual driving radius of your dispensary or business location\nand how many people you can actually capture in that market. Now, New Jersey is special such that\ngovernor Cuomo from New York said that New York is going to legalize\ncannabis in a legislative action, probably by April, 2021, which is amazing. But that also puts pretty\nbig pressure on, you know, New Jersey to get this right. Cause\nyou know, New York does not want money. Traveling New York money, traveling over\nto New Jersey to buy cannabis. When, Hey, in 12 to 18 months, they legalize it. Why not fast track that process\nas well as capture the revenue, the tax revenue from that, not just the business revenue\nfor the local businesses, but the tax revenue for the cities,\nthe States and the counties. Now state Senate judiciary\ncommittee chairman. Nick Scutari said that\nwithin one month of the vote, the medical cannabis dispensaries\nin New Jersey will be able to sell recreational cannabis. Now New Jersey has licensed only\n12 companies thus far to grow process and sell medical cannabis\nwith 90,000 registered patients. So we're looking at almost a hundred X\nincrease in total addressable market for the medical market here. That does mean\nit's going to be huge supply squeezes. So we'll see how it all plays out. But New Jersey is the one I'm the most\nexcited about specifically because this is the North East is really\ngoing to have to make their move. They're really going to have to think\nabout, okay, you've got... Vermont, you've got, um, New Jersey\nnow, New York comes on, Pennsylvania should be pushing in there.\nYou start doing the see, some push on, you know, all right, let's do a Northeast pact and create this\nkind of epicenter for cannabis in the Northeast part of our country here.\nNow, the next city or in a certain, the next state we'll talk\nabout is South Dakota. I'll get to the questions in just one\nmoment here, but okay. South Dakota. So this is a significantly smaller\nstate, less than a million people, 900,000 people, but you\ncan still make a big, big business in South Dakota. Now what's unique about South Dakota\nis that they legalize medical and recreational cannabis at the same time. Now this will be a local\nlicensing type of thing. So the cities will set\nthe number of licenses, but the law States that\nthey want to, you know, issue enough licenses to substantially\nreduce the elicit production and sale of cannabis throughout the state, but avoid what they call\nundue concentration. So what is undue concentration?\nEssentially, it's saying that, Hey, you can't have too many businesses close\nto each other and artificially giving someone ownership of a local market. Now there can be many debates back and\nforth should undo concentration, even be, you know, on the table, but Hey, we'll see if they want more tax revenue. They may kind of reduce that amount\nlike in LA I think it's 700 feet from another business that\nyou cannot be close to, but we'll see how it all comes together. But that's South Dakota in a small\nsegment there. Now you have Montana. This was a, a good one to look at because they\nhad two ballot initiatives on there. One about the actual age. And if they're\ngoing to create recreational cannabis, laws and regulations, now there are about 1.1 million\npeople in the state of Montana. So a bit larger than mine, or it's\na bit larger than South Dakota here. But again too, about initiatives\nhere, you had a initiative one 90, which was to legalize recreational\ncannabis that passed as well as, um, the constitutional initiative of one 18, which inset set the marijuana\nconsumption age for recreational at 21. Now under the proposal, half of the public revenue generated from\ncannabis sales is going to go towards environmental conservation programs. And then the rest of it's going to go\nto general fund and many other things. But that was one of the big sticking\npoints is that half of this is going to go to environmental conservation\nprograms. Now, according to Kana radar, there's 288 licenses in the state\nof Montana and existing cannabis operators or medical marijuana operators\nwill get first crack at licenses entering into the adult use\nmarket for the first 12 months. Now the initiative also requires that\nbusiness licenses only gold to Montana residents. So it's a pretty\ncaptured market there, but Hey, if you want to move there, pay your\ntaxes. There become a resident there. Maybe you could start your cannabis\nbusiness in Montana. And lastly, rounding it out here with the different\nStates that legalized cannabis through this election here, Mississippi. Now\nwith 3 million people in the state, this will be a market to keep your\neye on because though it is yes, generally conservative in\nnature and most other laws, they did pass medical\ncannabis with a 74% majority overwhelming majority\nhere. Now it also a lot. So now this law, it allows doctors to prescribe\nmedical cannabis for only 22 debilitating conditions. So it's very limited in scope and who\ncan participate as a patient in this market, but Hey, it always starts small,\na little spark and then boom, boom, boom. It grows up and grows up. And now\nwe've got a big cannabis flame here. Now it is a move in the right direction.\nNow the grassroots initiatives, 65 will require a medical\nmarijuana program to be in place by August, 2021. So we've got about what does that 10\nmonths here until they actually get it. So that's great. Now you usually see if something\nbecomes legalized as recreational. It takes about two years for them to, they give themselves at least a two year\nwindow to create those regulations for the cannabis industry. So Mississippi moving forward quite\nquickly here with their program. Now let's hop into questions and then I\nhave another set of things here to talk about, which is getting a cannabis\nbusiness license in the States, things you should consider and how\nto kind of get ahead of the process. But first let's hop into\nquestions. So from Instagram here, Mona organic says, what are your thoughts on how aggressive\nyou can be on cost of goods sold for California farmer? Great question here. Cost of goods sold is pretty much going\nto be dependent on the vertical that you're in. And the ones with the most\nrestrictive access to cogs is going to be dispensary's right. There's\nnot much, um, indirect costs. You can back into cogs, but cultivators,\nyou have a lot more Liberty, almost 80 to 90% of your\ncosts can be added into cogs. You can be more aggressive. It's about\nyour risk tolerance here as well, but I'll just end it with this. Cause this is a very nuanced explain\nor it deserves a more nuanced explanation. But the thing is this, you have to remember that you cannot\njust arbitrarily stuff, items into cogs. You can not just put any old\nindirect costs into cogs. You have to think about a reasonable\nmethodology for your cost of goods sold. So using IRC four 71, to make sure that you are using a\ntax code that allows you to back particular costs into cogs. And it\nmay not be the entire cost as well. You can do it by square foot.\nBy time. It can be by weight. There's lots of different\nways to split costs up, to put some into cogs and some that\nare just SGNA expenses that will not be allowed to be deducted. So hopefully\nthat answers your question there for you. Now let's hop into some other ones here. Um, yeah. So. T Y cultivation says, what about cultivation facilities\nfor say Colorado or California? Not specifically. Sure. Your question. They're dropping a little\nbit more information. I can\njump into that one here. Greg said, just want to point out that the camera's\nregulatory committee isn't staffed for or operational here yet. Very, very true.\nOkay. So look, we signed New Jersey. They're going to turn on their... recreational commercial cannabis activity\nalmost right away within 30 days a month. And as I brought up, there's\ngoing to be supply squeezes. There's going to be regulatory people\nand employees that need to implement this that have not been hired yet that are\nnot trained on their software yet. So yeah, we can be very excited, but\nI want this all to be also to be, you know, a healthy dose of reality.\nYou need to start your, you know, movement right now, but you\ncan not expect like, Hey, we're going to open up our dispensary\nin 45 days. It doesn't work like that. You can't even close a mortgage that\nquick or close a lease that quick. So what I'm trying to give you here\nis a 30,000 foot look about what the, maybe the, the, the territory and the terrain is\ngoing to look like over the next 60 to 90 days, as well as the next 12 to 18\nmonths. This is a long process, right? We legalize it in a day\nor voted on it in a day. But the legalization\nprocess has been this big, big push by a lot of these grassroots\ninitiative people. So if anything, Pat the people in the back that pushed\nand got the signatures and it all the different advocacy groups, that's really\nwhat we're talking about in the moment. But at any rate, there's still time\nto prep for those licenses here. Now, Ray Lopez says Mississippi medical\nchecking in here originally from the Cali scene. Ray, I wish you\nthe... much success. This is Sydney is one of\nthose sleeper markets. I believe because it's going\nto put pressure on Alabama, Georgia and other States. I think\nArkansas may have medical cannabis, but it's going to put pressure on\nthe South. Like, Hey, you know, Oklahoma moved on it,\nthen you've got the, um, how do you say Oklahoma?\nYou've got Florida moving. You've got other States moving. There's going to be kind of a\nmovement here for medical cannabis. If not recreational, we'll see how\nthe presidential election shakes out. We may not know for the, until the end of this week and then any\nother type of actions that happen around the election. But if we do\nsee a democratic president, potentially we see rescheduled\ncannabis and then a more open cannabis market for off the entire country.\nNow, Andrew Curtis here says, I don't understand why I'm in a state\nwhere we are considered criminals, but we have passed a bill for medical\nmarijuana that has gone nowhere. What's up with this. And he's in\nKentucky. Yeah. Look, that's one of the, that's the last prisoner\nproject. You know, there's people that are sitting in jail\nsince 1988 and they're gonna be in jail for a long time and it's\nillegal in their state. I think that person is actually sitting\nin jail in Michigan here at any rate, there is a whole lot of issues around\nthe legalization and the criminality and you know, people being locked up and there are big\ngroups out there trying to expunge all these records. And what you're seeing with a fair amount\nof these new legalization efforts is that expunging records and kind of erasing\nwhat happened with the war on drugs. These people's records to allow them, Hey, if they don't even want to\nbe in the cannabis industry, they can at least go get a normal\neveryday job that has a higher wage, right? When you\nhave a drug conviction, usually you're kind of not\nconsidered for larger jobs, higher paying jobs. So that's\none of the most important things. It's a conundrum that, you know,\nit's an incongruency in the market. Shall I say such that people\nare being criminalized, criminally penalize for something that\nanother person who may be their next door neighbor is making money from, or taking at least a paycheck home as a\nbud tender selling this. It's not fair. I agree with you on that, Andrew...\nJennifer said here, Oregon, real guys, all drugs, and it's a hundred\ndollar fine of caught. Yeah. So if you saw one Oh nine, I\nthink that's just for silicide, but it may be for all the other\nones, but at any rate, methane meth, not methane methamphetamine, heroin, every hard drug has now been\ndecriminalized in, in small amounts. You can't go out here being, coming a\ndrug King pin, but in small amounts. So this is a great first drop of the first\nstate. That's going to be doing that. So we'll see how that all moves out. I bet it's going to be a great case\nstudy to see how arrests go down, how treatment goes up, how people's\nmental health improves from this, how people are going to get help, right? It's going to be either a hundred dollar\nfine, or you can opt in to taking... I think it's like the cogs drug\ndrug, um, recovery programs, rehabilitation programs,\ninstead of paying the fine. So we'll see how it all shakes\nout. This is a great move. I'm very excited for all of these\nthings happening in the industry here. So without any more questions, actually, I'll get to the last\none here on Instagram. What are the biggest write-off problems\nand misconceptions about dispensary's dispensary's I'll tell you\nthe biggest misconception. And this came out in the Richmond\npatient group case this year. So typically what you're\nlooking at here is that dispensary's would say, Hey, we're going\nto be a manufacturer. Let me step back. Tax code IRC four 71 says that if\nyou're a producer or processor or manufacturer, you get to, you know, write off a lot of the labor\nand all these different inputs. So dispensers would say, we\nare a light manufacturer. We buy big pounds of weed and we break\nthem down into either eights or we break them down into pre-rolls right? And\nthey would say, they're a processor. And they get to write off different spots\nin different costs for their business. Well, when the Richmond\npatient group case came out, we made a whole video of\nthat. You can check that out. Just Google Richmond patient\ngroup cannabis will be\nthe first video to pop up. When it said in there is that dispensary's\nare not considered processors or manufacturers, which means they don't get\naccess to tax code IRC four 71. Now I'm not talking about four\n71. See this, you know, wild, new things from the tax cuts and\njobs act where people say, Hey, if you make less than $25 million, you\ncan write off everything in the cogs. And two 80 E doesn't apply\nto you. Do not do that. Please do not do that. But I'm\ntalking about the traditional four 71, where you can say, Hey, I'm a manufacturer and this is the\nsquare footage for all of our inputs. This is our machine costs.\nThis is our labor costs. These are all the raw ingredient costs. And you can write off a lot more\nat any rate Richmond patient group, pretty much boxed the\ndispensary's in saying you can only write off pretty much,\nvery little things here, right? The cost of your cannabis, the cost to not sell the cannabis, not to market the cannabis,\nbut the actual, like, you know, if you do bottle up cannabis, you\ncan write some of that stuff up. But a lot of the larger deductions, and I don't know the specific\ndetails of what those are. Marco and Derek and our tax\nteam would be more app are more in the involved in saying what that is. But at any rate dispensers have their\nhands tied. And that's not a good thing. No one wants that, but Hey,\nif we reschedule cannabis\ntwo 80, E's out the door, and that may happen over\nthe next 12 to 18 months, depending on how this election for the\npresidential race shakes out. Now, Greg, last one here. Do you know any\nstartup lawyers? Yes, we do. If you could reach out to us via\nour website at GreenGrowthCPAs.com, we'll put you in contact with\na big Rolodex of lawyers. I don't even know people know\nwhat that word is, Rolodex, but a good list of lawyers, depending on where you are in the\nprocess and what state you are in, because lawyers are state-by-state. So Greg had reached out to us\nand can help you with that. Now let's hop into, okay, I want\nto get a cannabis business license, but I have, you know, I don't\nknow what to do specifically. Now the big question is, okay, how do you prepare and kind of get ahead\nof this licensing process and increase your chances of successfully\ngetting a cannabis business license. Now I'm gonna to talk about two different\nkind of scenarios if you're plugged into the industry and if you're not\nplugged into the industry or if you're not operational, okay, so we'll\nstart off with most people here, probably if you're not plugged\ninto the cannabis industry, we have four major tips\nhere. Okay? Tip number one. You're going to want to look for\ncities that are favorable for cannabis businesses, right? Not every city is going to be licensing\nfor cannabis businesses, though. They may have the ability\nto do that, right? They may not be restricted in this.\nThey may not open up licensing. So first you want to look for\ncities that are open for licensing. What does that mean? If you're in a\nstate that just went recreational, look where the medical cannabis\nbusinesses are concentrated. That's where probably\nrecreational businesses are\ngoing to be concentrated now in tandem with that consider what\nvertical you want to be in. Okay? Maybe you want to start a cannabis\nnursery with the smaller plants in the clones, but then you may want to expand to other\nverticals such as full cultivation, or you want to be a retailer with a\ndispensary or a delivery business, or being in distribution business. You may want to be in manufacturing or\nmaybe go ancillary and be into testing. Okay. But, or you may want to go\nfully integrated. Who knows. Right. But think about which\nvertical you want to be in. And that is the city that you're looking\nat licensing those types of businesses, right? Not every city is going to license\nfor every vertical. All right now, to pair with understanding what\nvertical do you want to be in? You need to understand what\nare your skillsets for yourself and of your team so that you can\nbring the most value to the market. Don't just open up a cultivation facility\nbecause you think it's fun and sexy. Okay. If you don't know how\nto grow cannabis very well, this is going to be an extremely\npainful and tough process, especially if you're doing\nit just for the money. Okay. There is not, it's very, very easy to\nmake money in the cannabis industry. It's very hard to keep your money\nin the cannabis industry. Okay. What I mean by that taxes, mistakes. They all eat up a lot of your cash. Now,\nif you're only doing it for the money, when you see how much at the\nend of the year you're making, and then you actually look at that as\nthe number of hours you put in and your hourly wage, you probably making minimum wage or\nless as an owner of a cannabis business. When you look at your distributions,\nnow why I say all of this, you want to make sure that you're\npassionate about what you're doing, right? If you're a cultivator, say you work on different farms\nfor other agricultural products, go into cultivation\nbecause you love it, right? If you're a logistics operator\nfor DHL or for Amazon, and you want to get into\nthe distribution business, and this is just another product to move\ninto ship and get into the distribution business. If you love talking to\nthe general public, going to retail, if you've managed to CVS, or if you've managed a McDonald's or\nyou've been a general manager of a QSR or a big, big business that has people in\nand out, maybe retail is right for you, pairing your skillset and your passion\nwith your vertical result in much better success instead of going\nin it for just the money. Now, the second tip here is to\nbegin to budget accordingly, okay? Starting a retail location for the\nfirst and having the first six months of operation can take anywhere from $750,000, all the way to 1.5 million plus depending\non the state and the locality that you're in now, cultivation,\ndepending on the size and scale, it can go from 500 K all\nthe way to $25 million, depending on how you want to\ngo. How big you want to go. I would say start small and scale up. Don't try to go and do 10 greenhouses\nat 5,000 square feet of peace. You will become overwhelmed.\nYou'll run out of money. You'll make mistakes and\nit will cost a lot more. You may not even get operational\nat that point. Now, again, it all depends on your scale now\nnurseries by about 250,000 to 500 K minimum. And look, there's a lot of capital investments in\ncannabis, all the different equipment. It's just, there's a marijuana\nmarkup on everything. Certain equipment's not even there. And you have to custom make\nyour equipment and you, and you're typically paying\nhigher than normal rents. You're going to have to\npotentially have a mortgage. You're going to pay high lawyer fees.\nAre they paying for security fees, security plans, environmental\nplans. There's a lot to go in this. This is a very highly regulated\nindustry, just like alcohol, just like the airline industry, just\nlike the pharmaceutical industry. So be prepared to pay a lot of money.\nIf you want to be in this industry. Now, there are many other factors, but it\nwill take a lot of money to open one. And other verticals such as distribution\nmade you get along with a little bit cheaper, something, you know, sub 500\nK because you're not going to have, you would probably not\npay for your inventory. You're going to take everything\non consignment and manufacturing, at least a million dollars equipment.\nYour first test runs developing your SOP. All this stuff takes time and all those\ninputs to create those SLPs takes time. Now look at here. The third lesson I want to talk about\nhere is going to be talking about building a team. I say this in almost every video, and I want to pound this into your\nface. Cannabis is a team sport. You cannot do this as a one\nperson, person operation. Very rarely will. I say there's only\none person I met there in Oklahoma. They have a small-scale grow of 3000\nfeet. Okay? If you want to stay small, maybe if you're in Oklahoma, you can do a one person show\na one-man or one-woman show. But in most cases, you're\ngoing to build a team. And now you're going to need\nlawyers. You're going to need CPAs. You're going to need help with those\nthings for your M and a activity, right? You're gonna need that\nfor your applications. You're gonna need a CPA for\nyour financial projections. You're going to need operations\npartners who can help you actually run the business. Maybe you're\nthe idea, guy or gal, and you're not really the operator\nof the day-to-day operations. Well, if you want to open up a\ndispensary and you have the money, or you're the idea person, you\nneed to find a day to day operator. Because if you don't like\ndealing with the public, a dispensary is going to make\nyour life miserable. Okay? So building a team around you\nfor those types of things. Now, if you're going into manufacturing, you may want to find a master manufacturer\nwho's worked in CPG or things of that nature, where they've done large scale\nmanufacturing or gone from small scale, and then scaling up to these\nlarger quantities here. And you're going to need a head grower.\nIf you're going into cultivation, someone who likely has experienced\nsomeone who is passionate about it, and who's going to take the time\nto figure out all the issues. One thing I noticed in my trip\ndown to Oklahoma was, Hey. There's a lot of people that\nknow how to grow a lot of great. Cannabis. And this is someone I\nmet from that is from California. That's in Oklahoma. And they said,\nHey, we're growing great in Humboldt. But then we moved over to Oklahoma\nand the humidity really crushed our business. And then we had to do a lot\nof troubleshooting around, you know, how do we manage the environmental\nfactors in the grow operation and a lot of different, you know, details around that. So you want someone who is very well\nversed in dealing with different grow environments. Okay. So team is\nyour third lesson here, or sorry, your third tip here. And now the last one and I think is the\nmost important because this is something that's going to help you build up over\ntime is that you should join your local cannabis community and see\nwhere the needs are. Right? You may say I'm so passionate\nabout dispensary, dispensary,\ndispensary, or grow, grow, grow. But if there's a hundred dispensary's\nthere and they're only all serving 10,000 people, there's probably not enough\nroom for another dispensary, maybe. There's room for another\ncultivator or another. Manufacturer in this case. Okay. But what you really want to\ndo is get involved, right? There's already advocacy groups out\nthere. They just pass these laws. So there's a built-in community\nalready out there. So go out there, maybe even volunteer at current\ncannabis businesses or get a job there, go to meet ups. If you're busy, if your\nstate allows that right, stay safe. When you do that too, don't\nviolate any, you know, lockdown restrictions and don't\nput yourself in harm's way. But if you're not going to physical\nmeetups, look at online meetups, Facebook groups, and different things\nlike that. Join our email list. If you haven't. All right. Also you can reach out to other cannabis\nbusiness owners via social networks and network with them, chat with them.\nTalk with them, ask questions. Hey, what's the best part about\nbeing a retailer in New Jersey? What's the best part about being a\ncannabis cultivator in... you know... we'll say Arizona ask these questions.\nDon't just assume, you know, get part of the community. All right. So once you figured out\nyour estimated location, where your funds are coming from\nand how much you need and your team, the true first step is getting a\nproperty buying or leasing it. All right. And then getting licensed when it opens\nup and you're gonna need to work with a local lawyer. As I brought up earlier, who fully understands the regulations\nand can help with your application as well as everybody else, CPA, security, environmental operations,\nthe whole kit. All right. That will be very, very thoughtful on that because this\nis when the reels race starts to be building a meaningful business. All\nright, now the whole other scenario is, Hey, I'm already plugged\ninto the industry. I've got a couple million sitting\non the sidelines. I'm ready to go, ready to get into the industry. All\nright, well, if that's the case, consider buying one of those\nmedical marijuana businesses, it's already operating now that\nthe laws passed set for medical and recreational, you're probably going to pay a significant\npremium than if you were to purchase maybe 90 days ago, but that is your one way to potentially\nreally dovetail yourself into this recreational market,\nbuy a medical business, or start a fund with\npeople who can, you know, maybe get access in part ownership to\nmultiple medical businesses, right? As someone who's well capitalized, you probably don't want to jump\ninto the day-to-day ops made you do, but likely you don't. So maybe getting some exposure to\nmultiple cannabis businesses in multiple verticals. What do I mean by that? By a 10% stake in a dispensary by\na 40% stake in a cultivator by a 35% stake in a manufacturer\nand by maybe a 49 or 50% stake in a distributor\nin maybe by a larger stake, a majority stake in a testing lab. Right? Think about how you gain\nexposure to this industry, right? That's jumping into the industry, right?\nIt's not just a diving board jump. It's called getting exposure to the\nindustry, your investment exposure, your investment upside exposure,\npotential downside exposure as well, but exposing yourself\nto the industry. Now, all this to be said here, what are we\noffering here at GreenGrowth CPAs, right? We're a financial compliance from anything\ncash and cannabis we can help you out with. So if you need perform\na financial statements, or if you need a gut check on your\nlicense, possibility and potential, then please reach out to us and\nwe can help you out with that. You can visit our website.\nGreenGrowthCPAs.com. Click on the, get started button in the top, right\ncorner of the... how I say of the, of the website there, fill out the form and you can schedule\ntime with our team right there on the website. Now you can\nalso give us a call at (800) 674-9050. And we can\nhelp you there as well. Now let's go ahead. That's a lot\nof stuff I shared with you there. And if you have questions,\ndrop them in on the chat here. I'll answer a few more\nquestions. All right. So let's see. I gotta scroll up\nhere. There's a lot going on. So Andrew says with over half of the\nStates legalized for medical marijuana, why haven't we put in a vote to the house\nin Congress like alcohol prohibition. Now there have been, you know, movements\nto try to reschedule cannabis, to, to be criminalized cannabis, but\nyou know, really bringing it back. They're doing more around the cannabis\nbanking and things of that nature. That those are the things.\nAnd I can tell you, there's probably a myriad of reasons\nof why they haven't descheduled it or rescheduled it. You know, there's different politics at play and\npower politics at play and posturing, these different politicians. Hey, we'll\ngive you this cookie, but not this one. That's a very loaded question.\nAnd it's my very simple answer. We don't know why, but Hey, we'll see how everything shakes out\nwith the rest of the elections here. And if that potentially does\nget rescheduled, all right. Either a, my guy from Brazil, it's good\nto see you here. Good to see you either. All right, Jennifer Rodriguez says here,\nI need mentors because I can do this. I got a team and a plan, but no capital and legally great\narea live in NYC. All right. If you are a mentor that, Hey, reach out to Jennifer she's in\nhere on the YouTube live stream. Just reach out to tender for also, let me just give you a few steps on\nfinding a mentor in this industry. The first question, or sort of the first step to getting\na mentor is finding out who is the specific, what is the specific thing\nyou want to be mentored on mentors? Don't just give capital. They give\nadvice. They can make connections, or we call them smart money. If\nyou are getting capital from them, such that they're not\njust giving you money, they're also going to introduce you to\ntheir entire network. Okay? So first, what do you really need help with? Because\nin that first meeting with your arm, your mentor, they're gonna ask you,\nHey, um, what do you want to learn? And you're gonna say, I don't know.\nWell, don't do that. You want to say, I need to learn about raising capital. I need to learn about\ncreating a business plan. I need to learn about creating proforma\nfinancial statements. All right, cool. I can help introduce you to Michelle\ncan help with the application or the proformas, and I can\nhelp you do this or that, or they can personally help\nyou out. So finding that out. And then the second part of this is\njust asking most people that have made it by whatever financial terms or\nhappiness terms you want to say, they are willing to find willing\nto help other people out. They just never get asked, right?\nI'm a mentor to certain people. And it's only because they've asked\nthat they want me to be their mentor. It's a great thing to feel that.\nSo if you're looking for a mentor, ask people to be your\nmentor, reach out to people, find them on LinkedIn or on leaf wire\nor on Instagram or anywhere else. You can find people and ask them. And\nthis is not a lifelong commitment. They can be maybe a two month engagement\nas being a mentor or a 12 month thing, or until you hit a certain threshold.\nSo that's my thoughts on being, finding a mentor in the canvas. All right. So Cody said, so you can own a dispensary\nin Mississippi now. Yes, there is a possibility to open up a\nmedical marijuana dispensary. But again, it's very, very limited in who\nis going to be able to do that. Now we don't know\nspecifically the regulations. I think I said that Mississippi is\ngoing to open up their market by August, 2021. They'll have\nall the regulations in place. So as these regulations\nstart to materialize, we'll\ngive you more information, excuse me, on the types of licenses that are\navailable and how many of each of those licenses will be available. Now... either says white labeling is\nalready working. All right. So you just talking about the white\nlabeling thing that we were working on... late last year, um, we are still\nworking on partners with that. It's a very friction high friction\nprocess here find the white labeling, but either if you're still looking\nfor help with the white labeling, reach back out to our team, again,\ngo to the GreenGrowthCPAs.com, fill out the get started form. And\nwe can revisit those conversations. I believe your state side,\nyou were in... in Brazil, but I believe your state side. If\nyou're still here, great. If not resil, we can still help you out\nthere. Now let's go ahead. I'll Jennifer says she needs\nhelp with everything. Hey, we all need help with everything. I'll\nI'll I'll preface or I'll add onto this. No one knows everything\nabout the industry, right? There are self-proclaimed experts. Maybe I've been guilty of\nsaying that I'm an expert, but I'm humble enough to say\nthat. I don't know everything. I don't know every law, I\ndon't know every tax code, but I know enough to know that\nthere are certain frameworks, either figure something out or find\nthe right person that can answer that question for me. Right? You have to have humility in this\nindustry because you may know everything on Wednesday at 6:00 PM. And then you wake up on Thursday and\nthere's a new bill that passed or a city, you know, that had their,\ntheir, their meeting meets. And then now things have changed, right? Look at LA you thought you knew everything\nabout the LA licensing and then boom delivery licenses got kicked out\nfor five more years for anybody. That's not social equity. That's a big change that happened\nin just one vote or one night. So again, if you need help, reach out\nto us, if we don't know the answer, we'll put you in contact with\nthe right people that do. All right. So let's. Look, here are the dang says Mississippi's\nrestrictive program will be more viable than Louisiana's on launch. I\nthink so. I think that, you know, we have to see how all the specific\nnuances of the regulations play out. I could say that, Hey, this one\nis better and this one is not. But seeing that Mississippi\npassed it by a 74% vote is very, very assuring that this is going\nto be a great market. Again, it's kind of in the center of the South. So you could see some really good\nbusinesses being built in Mississippi to leverage out to the other\nStates nearby. All right, Andrew says a very\ninformative a preciate. It, I am doing this for you guys here.\nI'm glad you're finding value in this. I'm going to go ahead and\nwrap up our presentation here. We've been going for a good amount\nof time.

I wish you much success have a great\nday and we'll talk to you soon.", "bohJmMsMMII": "scientists are investigating whether cbd a chemical compound from cannabis plants could fight inflammation in

approval process involving clinical trials the agency is still working on cbd specific rules lindsey thiess newsy denver", "5N_QopFYfU8": "I had some firm and I thought informed views about using marijuana as medicine especially for children but what I've just seen has changed my thinking altogether and are not alone politicians doctors and patients are doing the same in parts of America prescription pot is legal and many believe saving lives there's now a green rush to legalize cannabis for medicine nationwide here though it's a crime forcing Australian families to break the law to help their children but they don't have to do that in the rocky mountain state of Colorado where I've just been to investigate how the medical marijuana business works in practice and to meet the little girl who's helped change the laws across America this is Charlotte V a happy seven-year-old but a couple of years ago that wasn't the case I was actually praying for her to just pass because it was so difficult to watch her struggle and what kind of a life was that for her person I thought it would just be better for her to just die peacefully in her sleep some night and I and I you know it's hard to admit that but I thought that would be better than going through what she was going through every 30 minutes you were losing your daughter I was losing her this is what Charlotte and her mum paige figi were dealing with every 30 minutes [Music] it's heartbreaking but important to watch as this one video has almost single-handedly changed America's medical marijuana laws every seizure took something from her if it was words or speech or walking or you know motor skills she would wake up and come out of the seizure and loot have lost something that we had to regain so we were always reteaching skills and she'd lose him and reteaching skills and and then she just started to decline in regress when she was five she really hit her her lowest point Charlotte has dravet syndrome a very rare genetic mutation that causes epilepsy and is mostly untreatable running out of time and options the Figge family turned to cannabis oil and after just a few drops Charlotte's life changed immediately and the results were the results were amazing she was 300 seizures a week 300 falling down grand mal seizures a week to zero after the first week of medicine but one not one seizure [Music] how would that little girl be today without taking cannabis while she's now two and a half years older I'm not sure she would have lived for another two and a half years alan shackelford is Charlotte's doctor and a founding member of the cannabis Business Alliance he says no one predicted the dramatic turnaround this was Charlotte's last resort it was her last resort what changes did you see in once she started taking the cannabis dramatic changes I really didn't know what quite what to expect but to be perfectly frank I was astounded at her complete failure to have seizures complete lack of seizures here in Colorado weed is welcome in fact this is America's Medical Marijuana testing ground more than a hundred thousand patients access medical cannabis in this state and 285 of those are under the age of 18 so while Australia debates the pros and cons of cannabis the reality is all around me [Music] for more than a decade Colorado has been one of now 23 American states where residents can access prescription Pop for everything from cancer to glaucoma but it's what this plant called Charlotte's Web is doing for children with epilepsy that has the whole world watching we grow medical marijuana and a strain of Charlotte's Web to the tune of about 80 85 percent of our current crops and that's grown specifically right now for intractable epilepsy and most of those cases are pediatric cases so it's it's quite controversial weed for kids it's that's what we grow it for this it is quite controversial weed for kids I mean that's an interesting business that you find yourself in it is I I would have never imagined that this would have taken the direction that it had [Music] every one of our strains you can smell with that strain is supposed to be Joel Stanley and his brothers are one of Colorado's biggest cannabis cultivators the five siblings who look more like a boyband than dope dealers are the new face of America's burgeoning marijuana business if you would have told me that I was going to grow medical marijuana for kids I would have rolled around on the ground laughing so hard so no I mean that that whole side of it's just been a shock but once people understand what it is the controversy goes away Stanley Brothers now trait hundreds of patients and have 8000 more on their waiting list to access Charlotte's Web cannabis strain named after their star patient this strain is low in THC the part that makes them on high and is rich in cannabidiol or CBD a non psychoactive ingredient scientists believe the CBD modulates chemical activity which helps quiet the excessive activity in the brain that causes seizures this is a weed for kids can it make them high you know this is a non psychoactive plant so the the the psychoactive compound within cannabis known as THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is very low in this plant so it really qualifies as a hemp strain so instead of calling it marijuana or medical marijuana what cannabis really technically it's hemp it's really him would you consider moving to the United States to receive medical marijuana for Zerlina absolutely we'd do anything for her to try that Australian Sally white is one of the 8,000 waiting to access Charlotte's Web [Music] the Sunshine Coast mum's 16 month old daughter czar Lea has a cardi syndrome suffering as many as 40 seizures a day but because she's in Australia she can't legally access cannabis water it's ridiculous there are other children that are taking medical marijuana in Australia through illegal means we don't want to do that sally has enough brain trauma already that fast to try something that isn't tested it could be quite detrimental to her health we can't risk that either but there are children that are benefitting from it but our only option is to go to America it is ridiculous it's an impossible dilemma isn't it it's a nightmare we don't want to do it but what do you do to you what she sees you till she dies Sally hopes Australia will follow the Colorado [Music] when you step inside a cannabis greenhouse you quickly realize how regulated this business is each plant is bar-coded every detail able to be monitored by state officials every plant has an RFID tracking chip on it so that if one plant moves from from one building to another within a grow that registers in some system so we call it seed to sale tracking there are more of these medical marijuana dispensaries in Colorado than there are Starbucks coffee shops and in America that is saying something but while on the surface this states liberal laws looked like easy solutions to so many illnesses it's hard to ignore that the science and medical research just isn't there yet in fact some studies say marijuana is bad for brain development and can lead to addiction like any drug medical marijuana will have to undergo rigorous clinical trials before anyone can categorically say that it works and long term it's safe what is known is that between 2012 and April this year the Children's Hospital Colorado has treated 29 children for adverse effects to medical marijuana two of those had severe side effects requiring admission to intensive care not all cases involve charlet web but according to the hospital all were high in CBD if there are no trials if there are no human trials then how do you know what the long term effects of medical cannabis are going to be it's a very important question there isn't any evidence from that hundred years of clinical use to treat a variety of different conditions that it had any negative impact whatsoever but the area of concern is that now that you're using medical cannabis for children that you don't know the long-term effects that's an important point and I think we have to always bear in mind what are the potential benefits what are the potential risks when medically you're taking a huge risk oh yeah legally you're taking a huge risk as well yeah yep Brisbane mum lanai Carter is taking a bigger risk than most traveling from Australia to America to access medical marijuana for her desperately ill son Lindsay she fears by speaking to us she may be banned from America but is determined for our government to hear her story we feel this is a battle we have to fight we have to fight it quickly we don't have a lot of time on our hands because we don't know how long he's gone from an immigration point of view yes are you meant to be traveling to America and doing this I don't know all I know is that there were doctors there that believe that this boy needs this treatment to help save his life [Music] the nice son Lyndsey has a brain tumor resulting in daily seizures headaches and nausea chemotherapy won't work and surgery could make things worse they believe their last roll of the dice is a type of cannabis oil it strikes me that you you've become marijuana refugees yes we did I guess you can call off that mm-hmm-hmm we did you know seeking out medical treatment in a country that is so far from home but when such limited options are on the table or the options that are on the table are such high risk we we had no other choice you will do anything to travel to get that treatment yes do anything to save our son [Music] what's your message to parents in Australia who are in that desperate situation of wanting to access this to help their children this is worthwhile to fight for and it might be an uphill battle and your government is saying no no way this is a worthwhile thing to fight for 100% and don't give up ahh-choo he blows and he sneezes in the hall for now America is in the unusual situation where personal anecdotes rather than science are changing laws here in Australia desperate patients are hoping those anecdotes will also be heard by our lawmakers sometimes I feel like saying to these politicians will swap children you take my baby and what try seizure all day long and I'll take your healthy kid and run around the park and pretend that life's great and you decide what you're gonna do are you gonna get it illegally or are you going to do everything you can to get it here somehow being a politician that do something if it was their kid but they obviously don't have sick kids because there's no way that's it they're not do anything hello I'm Liam Bartlet thanks for watching so keep up with the latest from 60

on-demand delivered to your door [Music] delivery is a very natural way actually to receive cannabis so for a lot of people you know prior to a lot of legalization they were getting it on the black market and most of that was almost exclusively through delivery in California many individual dispensaries do offer home delivery what makes E's different is they're able to use algorithms to route drivers to the patients in a very efficient way and have 20-minute deliveries as opposed to if you were to call a dispensary and order home delivery it usually takes about one to two hours a lot of people do call ease the uber of wheat or the uber of cannabis I think back to the first time that I ever ordered an uber the previous experience was we would call a taxi it wouldn't show up you'd call again it wouldn't show up finally a download of this app called uber I press the button on my phone and a black car showed up in about five minutes so that's a really Wow experience for people easy the same way so when you open up their app the first thing you're presented with is a product selection and you just basically add what you want to your cart and that driver will show up in about 20 minutes a lot of people don't have a medical marijuana recommendation from a doctor so part of signing up for ease is I've actually connect you via video chat using our esmd platform to a licensed doctor they're actually issued a medical recommendation right there on the spot digitally a lot of people live about an hour away from the nearest dispensary so home delivery especially for people that have various ailments where they maybe can't leave the house is a very important way for them to get access so drivers start their day at the dispensary and they pick up what we call cases so part of what ease helps with dispensaries is we use data to recommend the strategy that the dispensaries should use to pack those cases so that's specifically which products and how many of each product that that driver would need for their shift once the driver starts their shift typically they never have to go back to the dispensary we would look at that as sort of a failure in the data to predict how much product they would need all of our data comes from sort of the transactions that have happening on the east platform we get a delivery on average about one every thirty seconds so last year we did about half a million deliveries so it's a really broad set of data cannabis really represents you know somewhat of a once in a generation opportunity to build a great company right when I think about a lot of the great companies like AT&T and Microsoft a lot of those companies were created at the beginning of an industry I really look at now as an opportunity to create sort of the next set of great American companies [Music]", "-8kPucbOdT8": "hey guys Nick with precision here and today we're at our partnered manufacturing facility outside of Dayton Ohio looking at our all new line of KPD series of industrial extractors [Music] precision first conceptualized the KPD series of extractors about two years ago when we saw the shift towards a large scale processing both in cannabis and hemp what we did at the time is we searched for the best most well qualified manufacturing partner that we could build an industrial scale modular extraction platform with we found AMG engineering in Dayton Ohio and they've been a pleasure to work with ever since we've combined our expertise in the cannabis and hemp manufacturing arena with their expertise in the AG reprocessing and Industrial Engineering competency and what that's allowed us to do is build a massive but easy to use modular processing center that can be dropped on the farm can be dropped into a building and it's very easy turnkey ready to operate so a lot of people ask why build a modular self-contained industrial extraction skid and the reasons are numerous the first one is that this whole apparatus that you see here takes four people to operate the second thing is it's extremely simple right it's plug-and-play you drop it and you can drop it onto a slab in a farm you can drop it into an industrial processing building or any number of easy turnkey solutions the flip side of this is people typically have unreasonable expectations when it comes to batch processing batch processing is extremely laborious and if you think about having seven or eight or nine extractors to be able to equal the throughput that something like this does you're talking about running those batch extractors 24 hours a day you're talking about having three shifts of people and you may well employ 40 50 60 employees in order to do the same work that four employees could do with a plant such as this so it's really oughta mating the process its streamlining your efficiencies and it's allowing you to operate a business with an extremely low overhead and as we all know that the price of commodities of THC and CBD eventually are declining it's very important to be able to operate your business with very low operational overhead costs to be able to make margin continually as these large players come in and put competitive pressures on the market so we've designed all this in mind when you look at the design of this extraction plant not only does it have the modularity but we'll talk about some of the efficiencies that this plant does as you can see behind me one of the components we have reflux stills so that your reap roofing your ethanol so you're not having ethanol loss we have a number of different high efficiency methods to take the ethanol back out of the biomass and any a number of these small problems that you run into a batch processing all these losses add up and we've designed this with our processing expertise and AMG's industrial manufacturing expertise to be the most efficient most effective way to extract and that's what you see here today [Applause] so now that you understand a bit about the concept of the KPD series of extractors why we built it how we built it how we conceptualized it let's take a look at some of the more technical components on how it operates and why it's so efficient so the first thing that we're gonna look at is our contacts motor control center and basically what this is it's the brain of the entire operation so what's gonna happen is this skid will be placed on a slab somewhere in a warehouse but your motor control center and your plant control center will be separate the reason that that's designed like that is to keep all the components that could come in contact with any solvent that are flammable it keeps the the risk level down basically so that those flammable vapors aren't coming in contact with any of your motor controls so let's take a look inside the control center so inside what you're going to see is you're going to see all your variable frequency drives you're gonna see all of your motor controls and ultimately this is all linked through one interface right so it's all computer-controlled everything on this entire plant you can see all your temperatures all your motor speeds all your input your output your discharge every single function within that plant is controlled from this brain so you can see on your wall all of your shut offs all of your VFDs all of your control panels all of your power input everything is controlled from this room so remembering our HMI interface and our computer brain interface from our con X you also have a display and a touch screen interface on the actual plant so not only can your controllers see what's going on from your control room your operators can see what's going on in the plant from your HMI interface on your actual machine so the process all starts here and basically what this is is you're gonna have your conveyor feeding in your biomass and this is the first step of the process this is a cooling screw conveyor so what will happen is you take your warm biomass and you cool down your biomass in order for when it hits the solvent it's not warming up the solvent obviously you're putting a massive amount of biomass into this extraction plant you're putting a massive amount of solvent so you can understand that the heat energy if the biomass is not properly cooled is going to raise the temperature of the solvent and therefore that affect the extraction efficiency and the extraction quality so what we do is passing it through here this is jacketed and it's controlled to about negative 40 degrees centigrade in order to cool the biomass and take some of that heat energy away to have a nice efficient consistent extraction so the next step in the process once the biomass is cooled you can see that it drops into this first extraction tank and basically what this is is a counter current ethanol extraction so you've got ethanol coming in from one side you've got your biomass coming in from the other if you have a set retention time they mix the solvent strips that cannabinoids from the plant and ultimately you have your micelle a stream coming out so biomass into your first tank solvent into your third tank and through the entire process they mix through the tanks until they're ultimately separated you will have your cannabinoids and solvent go to one area and you'll have your biomass go to another area so let's follow the stream of the cannabinoids through to the next step once your extraction process is started you're gonna have your micellar stream which we call my salad your cannabinoid and solvent mixture in your micelle a holding tank right here this folding tank is constantly going to be processed through your finds filtration which is going to take out most of your fine particulates that might clog your evaporator any residual waxes and we actually do that with not only the Candela filters and the michela but we use a pre-code as well so this precoat tank will have any number of three coats it could be diatomaceous earth it could be any number of absorbance or things like that that will actually pre coat your filtration and allow for a more pure more efficient extraction so let's take a look at how this all works you have your micellar coming here you have your pre coat tank coming here both of these streams are mixed and they're pushed upwards into our filtration mechanisms which are up here so let's have a look at those so once that micelle a stream is coming up here it's being pushed into our filters and these are three candle filters that basically are filtered with precoat coating the filter membrane and then we have our micellar coming right behind that and basically that's creating a filtration mechanism that's taking out all those impurities highly refining your masala stream ultimately your filters will become caked when they become caked after a number of hours could be a day could be three days could be you know 12 hours it really depends on the consistency of your biomass and how you're extracting what you're going to do is do a blowdown on your filters so these filters are extremely easy to clean as you can see the graded bottoms what you're gonna do is we're just gonna take a bucket or some sort of a bag discharge bag you're gonna wrap it around here and you're gonna do a blowdown to blow down the filter and all your discharge cake is gonna come out again same thing you have redundancy so if you're discharging one filter that the other filter is still in use so that you're never losing your continuous process so that takes us through our filtration step what we're gonna do once we have that micellar filtered and we have it clean we're gonna move on to evaporation and evaporation is the process of actually separating that solvent from the original cannabinoids that we have so it's no longer going to be a micelle a stream at this point we're gonna have crude oil and we're going to have solvent so the next step in our process is evaporation and as we stated evaporation is taking that micellar stream of your cannabinoids and your solvent and separating it so we're gonna take our micelle and separate it into two streams ones are going to become crude oil one's going to become our purified ethanol and that's done with this section of the plant right here what you're seeing is you're seeing two giant distillation towers so you can see they started all the way up here and they go all the way down to the second floor beneath my feet about 20 feet tall and what that's actually doing is applying heat to the solvent in order for the solvent to vaporize once the solvents vaporizing it's coming it's separating from the heavier cannabinoid mixture and as the solvent vaporizes it reconned ences on a separate condenser column behind me which creates a liquefied solvent that's been purified and that leaves us with our micelle a stream that's been purified into the purified solvent of course and then our purified cannabinoids which we refer to as crude oil so let's take a look at the next step in the process which is one that's very crucial and often overlooked so once we have our solvent purified from our micellar stream it's very very important that we do a reflux distillation on that solvent and here's the reason why ethanol is what's called a homogeneous azeotrope with water as you know we're extracting a plant there's a lot of water in the plant when it comes out of the field we dry most of that water out through our drying process but you may have anywhere between 2 to 10 percent water and your residual biomass now what's gonna happen because ethanol is a homogenious azeotrope with water those two molecules are just going to want to stay right together the boiling points are so close that they can't be separated with the traditional evaporation why this is relevant is because over time your solvent becomes diluted and becomes less effective at extracting your cannabinoids so you can imagine that you start with 190-proof pure solvent and over time it's going to be diluted with water once you hit around 170 proof or a little bit lower than that your extraction efficiency becomes greatly compromised which is the reason that we have reflux stills so reflux stills are a different type of evaporation they're used with a very tall tower without with a packing material in them and what that does is it allows that very close boiling point to separate from the water and the solvent so we've integrated this into our plant so it's a turnkey system solvent never needs to be replaced in this plant because the efficiency is so high in terms of not only the reclaim rate from your biomass and your evaporation but also the reap roofing of the solvent it's a completely closed system which makes it extremely efficient and extremely easy to before when we were talking about operating your business on really good margins and maintaining efficiency and how you operate your extraction process this is one of the central key components to do that for for your ROI for your business now that we've walked through the evaporation process and the purification of the solvent we need to follow our crude oil through the other output stream so what happens with the crude oil once it comes out of our evaporator as it moves into these holding tanks and basically what these holding tanks are doing is holding the oil and heating it to perform the decarboxylation process D carb is a very very common process that's used in preparation of your crude oil for not only consumption but for final distillation that's what these tanks do right here and ultimately these tanks can be routed and pumped to a distillation machine or any types of popes post-processing that you would like to use so now that we've followed our micellar stream through the entire plant through refinement all the way to D carb and through re proofing of the solvent the other side of the aspect of the processing of this plant is the actual biomass that's coming out so we have a lot of spent biomass that's coming out of this plant and once it comes out of those extraction tanks that we looked at earlier it's ultimately pumped as a slurry up into these separators so we have these rotary strainer separators and basically what they do is they separate that pulpy sludge of biomass it's the first pass that takes the solvent off and what that's doing is it's taking kind of that like I said pulpy sort of really wet biomass and separating the ethanol from it in order for the biomass to then drop into a heated mechanism which is where you're going to regain the remainder of your solvent out of the biomass so let's take a look at that next the last and one of the most crucial processes in our plant is the reclamation of the final solvent from that biomass so as we saw before we separated the majority of the solvent from the biomass using our strainers but it's still think about you know wringing out a sponge you get most of the of the of the moisture out of the sponge by using that pressure but in order to get the remainder of the moisture out of the sponge or in this case our biomass acting like a sponge we need to heat it and that's precisely what this heated screw does here so you can see it's quite lengthy there's a lot of heat energy that goes into that but the flip side is we're taking a typical 94 93 95 percent efficiency and we're taking that efficiency up above 99 percent in terms of reclamation of your solvent now the reason that's important is because obviously we're on industrial scale here we're talking about tens of thousands of pounds of processing per day you can imagine there's quite a bit of solvent that's being used there so when you're losing 5% of that massive amount of solvent you can imagine what the cost is last we checked Evan all's you know 32 dollars a gallon for for azeotropic ethanol around seven dollars a litre depending on your region if you're losing 5% of everything you're processing with which is the case with typical plants typical batch installations batch installations could be even higher than that you can imagine how that's going to affect your effects and how that's going to affect your ROI especially as you have margin compression on your commodity one of the reasons that we designed this in is exactly that so you may have been wondering what are these giant for tanks on the end of this skid and it's very important because these are our CIP tanks CIP stands for clean in place clean in place is a protocol that's used throughout manufacturing throughout GMP throughout any type of protocol that requires food grade or pharma grade compliance now these CIP tanks are meant to hold an acid wash a base wash and then you have a reuse tank so basically what we're doing is we're imagining any sort of contamination that can get into this system based upon what that contamination is you may need an acid rinse in order to dissolve that contamination you may need a base rinse in order to dissolve that contamination you made into ethanol rinse in order to dissolve that contamination which is basically what we have in this entire plant so again through the HMI interface through the control center you have a completely automated CIP process in order to clean this plant the reason that that's extremely relevant is has more regulations and more restrictions come into the cannabis and hemp space you're going to be subject to testing for pesticides for mold for mildews and you can imagine that if any of that stuff's on your biomass and gets into your plant that you're automatically going to potentially contaminate your plant with a contamination source from the field one of the prime examples that we could use is micro butanol in California it's virtually everywhere and in order to remediate micro butanol audit your processing equipment there's a variety of processes that are needed to do that right now in batch equipment everybody does that manual and it's very laborious and time-consuming but as GMP restrictions and regulations come into play you're going to need to have a set standardized process that can be replicated and duplicated in order to be accurate every single time that's exactly what this CI piece kit does and that's exactly what our control center an automation skid does thanks for watching our overview on our KP d series of industrial extraction plants these plants can be engineered to process anywhere from ten thousand pounds a day up to several hundred thousand over a million if that's what you want our engineering partners as well as ourselves with our engineering expertise and our product expertise know every step of the process we know how to make it the most efficient and that's exactly what we've done here and what we've seen today we look forward to working with you and please give us a call if you have any

"WX1cXfmv2TQ": "well a bill that seeks to delay the start of montana's recreational marijuana program for one year is working its way through the legislature the owners of a medical marijuana dispensary here in billings say they stand to lose millions if that delay goes through q2's mitch laggy reports in november last year montana voters passed initiatives to bring recreational marijuana to the state in a program that was supposed to begin in january 2022 a bill introduced to the state legislature last week by republican state representative bill mercer of billings seeks to delay the start of the program by one year citing the need for more time to implement the recreational program that needs 100 employees if montana's recreational marijuana program gets pushed back one year the owners of montana advanced caregivers a medical dispensary in billings say that the state stands to lose millions of dollars in tax revenue it would be foolish for this state to not make that investment now before other people start supplying the people with this market that's been created an economic study done by the university of montana last year found the state could bring in 43 million in tax revenue in 2022 with recreational marijuana and the state is already profiting off of pot through the medical marijuana program montana advanced caregivers have been supplying medical patients with marijuana products since 2008 and its owners hope to expand into the recreational market we've made product and we're ramped up for it we've built more facilities we were creating more products as we speak we're building more locations we have three locations and we're building our fourth right now when voters approved the recreational marijuana initiatives it made the substance legal to possess in small amounts smith said delaying the licensure of recreational marijuana shops will just drive the market underground in the state legislature this session there have thus far been eight bills introduced to amend the state's recreational marijuana laws in some way reporting in billings mit schlagey mtn news thanks so much mitch now house bill 457 is scheduled for a hearing on friday in the state house business and labor", "G4w7exuA7X0": "Marijuana could finally\nbecome legal in New York next year and the chances\nof that happening are higher than ever. Not only is the state\nstrapped for cash, but most states bordering\nNew York have now either legalized the drug or are\nheaded in that direction. Both Vermont and\nMassachusetts already have legal weed and New Jersey\nis set to create its own program in the\ncoming months. That's left New York\nbehind on the issue. And right now all we're doing is\npushing New Yorkers across state borders to Massachussetts\nup where you live. Down to New Jersey, very soon,\nwhere I live. To other surrounding states\nwhere they spend their money in other states to buy the\nproducts that we could be producing and selling right here\nin New York. State Senator Liz Krueger, one\nof several Democrats who led the charge to legalizing\nmarijuana in New York in recent years and she is a\npart of a growing number of lawmakers who think there\ncould be movement on the issue in 2021. But that's easier said than\ndone. The state would have to setup an entire regulatory and\ntax structure and that's left Democrats undecided on how\nto move forward. For one, lawmakers don't\nwant to create a system that drives people to\nbuy the drug illegally. And there's the\nfundamental question of how much are we going to\ntax these products, and I fall into the category of\npeople who say, don't get greedy. We need to make sure we\nhave a successful set of programs, and that means\nwe need to make sure we are not pricing the legal\nsafe products at a higher cost than the existing\nillegal unknown products because then\npeople won't move. For that, New York\nactually finds itself at an advantage on marijuana. More than a dozen states\nhave already legalized the drug for adult use, and\nthat's given New York plenty of time to see\nwhat's worked and what hasn't. State Senator Diane Savino\nis another democrat involved in discussions\non legalization. We don't need to make the\nsame mistakes that other states have made and\nthey have made a lot of mistakes, and we should be\nvery careful as we move forward. But democrats who control\nthe state legislature are still divided on how\nexactly to legalize marijuana. A top issue is what the\nstate should do with the tax revenue from the\nmarijuana industry which is expected to be about\n$300 million each year. Some democrats want part\nof those funds to be reinvested in communities\nof color where the State's drug laws have been\nenforced at higher rates. The people that I have\nbeen working with and are committed to this model\nfeel very strongly that revenue should be used for\nsocial justice purposes to support undoing damage\ndone, again, in poor communities of color. But others want to be more\nflexible with the money. Governor Andrew Cuomo wants it\nto be available for however the state needs it at\nthe time, rather than being earmarked for a specific\npurpose. He says the financial\nincentive for that strategy is\ngreater this year. New York is facing a digit\ndeficit north of $10 billion because of\nthe Coronavirus. I think this year is ripe\nbecause the state is going to be desperate\nfor funding. Even with Biden. Even with a stimulus. But there's a few\nproblems with that. for one, tax revenue from\nlegalizing marijuana is only expected to be about\n$300 million each year. That's a drop in the bucket\ncompared to the state's budget gap. And second, budget\nanalysts say it will be years before the marijuana\nindustry actually generates that\nmuch revenue. In the short term, it's\nnot likely to provide immediate relief, first of\nall, because of timing and second, because\nof magnitude. If you have $8 billion gap\nthis year and at most, that's going to be 200,\n$300 million four years from now for marijuana. So supporters of\nlegalization are hoping to drive the conversation\naway from money and toward what they see as the other\nbenefits of legalizing marijuana. Chris Alexander does\ngovernment relations for a cannabis company on the\nwest coast that's hoping to set up shop\nin New York. He said lawmakers should\nconsider if the State's drug laws are doing more\nharm than good especially for people of color. One thing that was very clear\nover the years, enforcement, your different\nadministrations is that prohibition has conditionally\nbeen selectively enforced. It has been selectively enforced\nin communities of color. It has been selectively\nenforced on our young people. And so I think really it's so\nthat prohibition doesn't work. It hasn't worked which is\nwhy you are seeing so many states make the decision\nto go the other direction. New York already\ndecriminalized small amounts of marijuana\na few years ago. holding less than two\nounces of the drug is no longer a crime, but you\nwill receive a fine. Some don't want to see\nNew York go any further. Saying full out\nlegalization of marijuana could bring huge companies\ninto the state to exploit the market. Dr. Kevin Sabet was a\npolicy advisor under President Barack Obama. This is commercialized\nby an industry not very different than big tobacco\nand big alcohol which are industries that democrats\nare not big Fans of because they have seen how\npublic companies run rough shot over public health\nand marijuana wouldn't be any different. That's actually something\nthat supporters of legalization want to avoid\nas well, hopefully through oversight by the state. Krueger says they want to\ncreate a system that favor competition and innovation\nrather than corporate control. We want to invest in\nentrepreneurs in these communities to be able\nto start up businesses related to cannabis. We want to provide\ntechnical assistance. We want to make sure this\ndoes not become a big pharma with two or three\ncompanies controlling all of this in the\nstate of New York. It's worth noting that\nthe marijuana industry is operating in New York,\njust in a different way. Medical marijuana has been\nlegal here for the last five years, with ten\ncompanies now licensed to sell in New York. But the State's medical\nmarijuana program hasn't really grown in that time\nand leaders from the industry are hoping that\nchanges as the state considers full\nlegalization. Stphen Dahmer is the chief\nmedical officer of Vireo New York,a medical\nmarijuana company based outside the\ncapital region. We're ready to serve more. We're starting to see\nresearch coming together to support the use\nof medical cannibus especially in use of\npatients in chronic pain, for those on opioids and\nwe have quality tested product which has proven\nthe test of time and we are excited for the\nprogram to expand at a minimum to include\nadditional qualifying conditions. Right now, New York's\nmedical marijuana program is considered one of the\nmost restrictive in the country. The list of conditions\nthat qualify someone for medical marijuana is\nshorter than other states and only certain doctors\nare allowed to prescribe the drug. Ngiste Abebe is Director\nof public policy of Columbia Care, a medical\nmarijuan company, and president of the New York\ncannabis association. So the New York Medical Cannabis\nprogram is definitely one of the more restrictive ones in th\ncountry It has a very short\nconditions list which limits patient access\nand takes away doctor discussion because we\nknow that the research is evolving a lot faster than\nregulations can keep up with. Broadly speaking, medical\nmarijuana companies want the state to allow more\npeople to use the drug and make it easier to get, and\nthat's something that is support as well by Senator\nSavino who is a key architect of the State's\nmedical marijuana program five years ago. she's trying to allow it\nwith legislation that would allow more\ndispensaries and doctors to dispense marijuana when\nthey think it's right for the patient regardless\nof condition. If a doctor in his or her\nestimation believes that a patient can be benefitted by the\nuse of any particular drug that is legal in the state of\nNew York to treat whatever that condition is, we shouldn't\nget in their way. We should allow them to\nmake that determination for their patient. That's what we're\nrecommending Lawmakers could pass an expansion\nto the State's medical marijuana program without\nlegalizing the drug for recreational use, but it's\nmore likely that they'll do both at once. Expanding the medical\nprogram while creating a system for adult use. That's where the State's\nmedical marijuana companies come in. Some of them want in on\nthe adult use market as well, and say they're\nready to help jump start the new industry. Here's Abebe again. We also know that the\nfuture size of the New York market is going\nto be significant. We believe that including\nthat medical operators will help start this\nprogram off on the strongest possible foot in\norder to fund that future expansion. For that to happen, New York\nwill have to decide if medical companies will be\nallowed into the recreational industry. That is still\nup in the air. And that leads to other\nquestions, like what is some communities just don't want\nmarijuana companies to set up shop where they live. Kreuger said she would be\nfine if some communities want to ban marijuana\nretailers if that moves the needle on\nlegalization. So it is true. There are some populations\nthat are more concerned about it and they want\nthe right to not have retailers in their\ncommunities and not to have stores. I think that's fine. And there are other\nissues with marijuana legalization that still\nhave to ironed out as well. Like will New York allow\npeople to grow the drug at home and how many\ncompanies will be allowed to operate in the state\nand there's the issue of road safety. There's no easy way to\ntest if someone is driving under the influence\nof marijuana. Opponents of legalization\nsay, that's a problem. We're going to have to invest a\nlot more into driving issues and impairment. We're going to have to invest a\nlot more in labs and toxicology. It's gonna cost money. I don't know if they're\nwilling to do that and that's why I worry about\ndoing it in the first place. Those are all questions\nthat democrats will have to figure out in the next\nfew months if they want to legalize marijuana\nnext year. But with more states\naround the country now moving toward\nlegalization, lawmakers like Savino see this\nas New York's moment. The question is we're\nsurrounded by states that will have legal marijuana\nprogram programs. Does New York want to\nbe in the game or not?", "j6BUDfNNPl4": "it's brisk business a tweeds underneath the glass counters the Toronto pot dispensary offers colorful packages of marijuana laced ghillie bombs and double ducked Oreos Connor perd\u00f3n is a recreational pot smoker and he's also the manager of this store he's never had a bad experience with weed until this past February when he smoked a more potent variety of marijuana I actually took a hit of what we call concentrates and I thought sure if I rub someone in my eye or what happened but like I had a heavy kind of allergic reaction in my face really underneath a swollen eyes were blotches of a red rash what perd\u00f3n now realizes is he'd had an allergic reaction to pot how is your puss dr.

THE LONG LINES .. ON THOSE FIRST FEW DAYS AFTER THE LAW TOOK EFFECT. TONIGHT.. NICOLE KRASEAN GIVES US A CLOSER LOOK.. INTO HOW.. THE FIRST YEAR OF LEGAL CANNABIS.. WENT,, IN ILLINOIS.. AND WHY ...ONE INDIANA LAWMAKER.. WANTS THE SAME THING..

SINCE ILLINOIS LEGALIZED RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA. SINCE THEN ... THE STATE HAS REPORTED MORE THAN $100 MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF RECREATIONAL CANNABIS... AND ACCORDING TO ATTORNEY GENEVA BROWN ... A LOT OF EVERYDAY PEOPLE HAVE BENEFITED FROM THE CHANGE IN LAW. GENEVA BROWN: \"A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SELF- MEDICATING QUIETLY WITH USE OF CANNABIS BECAUSE OF ANXIETY, PTSD, LOTS OF VETERANS WHO CAN NOW GET ACCESS TO THIS.\" ADDITIONALLY ...

MEANING PRIOR CHARGES RELATED TO CANNABIS HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM A BROWN SAYS THIS HELPS GIVE PEOPLE A FRESH START. GENEVA BROWN, CARPLS STAFF ATTORNEY: DENIED TO THEM, THAT'S THE MAIN REASON I REALLY FEEL THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO HAVE THESE OFFENSES REMOVED FROM THEIR RECORD.

SUMMERS: \"WE HAVE AFRICAN AMERICANS THAT ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED AND HAVE THIS ON THEIR RECORD THAN ANYONE ELSE.

Chen director of the UCLA cannabis research initiative can you lethally overdose on cannabis as far as we can tell there have been no recorded cases of lethal amounts of cannabis ingestion resulting in an overdose not a single lethal overdose but how is that possible I mean cannabis is a drug after all with overdoses we tend to think of substances like alcohol benzodiazepines or opioids and the reason that these can result in overdoses is that these receptors also tend to reside in the area of the brain that control breathing since these drugs influence the part of the brain that regulates your basic life support functions they can potentially end those vital functions too and if you can overstimulate these receptors when you take too much opioids for example or drink too much alcohol you can actually shut down the neurons and the part of your brain that control breathing and as soon as you stop breathing that's when you can have a lethal overdose so what exactly sets cannabis apart from the others with cannabis the cannabinoid receptors the cannabis acts upon they are not particularly abundant in the air of the brain that controls breathing and so for this reason ingesting a large amount of cannabis or cannabinoids as far as we can tell isn't going to shut down the respiratory system but there was one instance that caused a lot of controversy in the medical field in 2015 an infant in Colorado passed away in the hospital after they found high amounts of THC in his blood it's still not clear what exactly caused the child's death the coroner at the time listed as having been related to cannabis overdose so that could be one of the first recorded cases of lethal overdose cannabis and again there's some controversy over whether or not it was the THC that led to the infant passing away that certainly is still an active area that people are wondering about will you die from smoking weed we're gonna say 'no you're most likely not gonna overdose for pot but like any other substance marijuana can be abused and lead to dangerous life-threatening situations so act wisely wait Leslie thanks for watching be sure to subscribe and check out more episodes of weed

grow sites to store shelves 41 action news reporter sarah flake went inside of a cultivation facility that just finished its first harvest carrollton missouri is a small town an hour and a half outside of kansas city its population is just under 4 000 people in this unassuming warehouse they are consuming more energy than the entire town these guys are what we're after this is this is the buds this is the medicine this is a medical marijuana cultivation warehouse full of 12 000 marijuana plants carroll county cannabis company c4 gave us the tour something many people have been waiting to see for two years we start out with a little clones they go into a one gallon pot they're in there for eight or ten days to get rooted up and then they go into what we call pre-veg for another 12 days on the day we visited employees were transferring the small plants into larger five gallon pots where they'll finish out the rest of their cycle every plant is tagged and tracked we just harvested bloom room one and then twelve days after that we harvest bloom two twelve days after that three now every 12 days we'll have a new harvest c4 uses led and high pressure sodium lighting they need optimal humidity and temperature levels to take the plants from clones to this when it's in flowering stage that's when the buds start coming out you know these this is everything that we're looking for and this is the creme de la creme all of these buds will be ready for harvest in the next couple weeks they look like they're ready to go but there are several steps left before it hits the shelves the plants will go through a bucking machine that pops the buds right off this helps c4 get the product out to meet demands but they'll focus more on hand trimming as they ramp up we have some sativas we have some indicas we have a lot of hybrids okay so a lot of the stuff now is a hybrid it's a mix so there's a lot of different different uses for different plants from here the product will travel 77 miles to north kansas city to green precision analytics a medical marijuana testing lab that just received its final inspection from the state on thursday and this is the final step here in this lab they'll process hundreds of pounds of medical marijuana and it's all going through a very scientific process and then as we receive it in the lab everything comes in here for grinding and shaking and centrifuging before we dilute it down to put it on the instrument let's break that down scientists will test the marijuana for potency pesticides and any other dangerous bacteria this runs for about two minutes then they'll grind down the flour into a powder they'll add a solvent to the powder and shake it up for 20 minutes spin it around then take the solution off the top and into the testing machine it goes it'll go through a couple more testing machines before it's ready to head to the dispensary or a manufacturing facility we'll definitely have our challenges keeping up once they are in full swing but we've set ourselves up for quite a bit of throughput here being able to do 40 or 50 samples a day in the early beginning for both facilities it's been a mad dash to the finish line we'll be in probably nine or ten dispensaries in the next month or so it'll be gone i mean we'll we'll deliver it and it'll be there a couple days and it'll be gone you can expect to see

meet\na guy named Hidrow. He's an underground\nweed-concentrates maker who treated his own cancer\nwith medical marijuana, and now supplies\nJohn's neediest clients with serious,\nhigh-potency cannabis oil. \u266a\u266a Always have one of these. Andavolu: Okay, good.\n[ Chuckles ] So, Hidrow,\ncan you take me through the cannabis medicines\nthat you make, and, like,\nhow you make them? Yeah, I'll give you\na first run out, and this is trim and leaf and a little bit\nof bud and stuff. Where do you get this trim from?\nWho gives it to you? Everybody's got a friend\nwho grows a little something, and, you know,\nthey throw it away, so I say \"Bring it to me. That, what you're throwing away,\nto me, is a lifesaver, and to other people can be\na lifesaver, you know?\" And when you say \"they,\"\nyou mean, like, people who are basically\nselling weed illegally. Yeah. Some of them are\nreally nice people. Some of them are\nvery horrible people. Some of them are --\nI would like to see them out of the business\ncompletely, because -- What do you mean,\nthey're \"horrible people\"? Well, they're not nice. They're criminals.\n[ Laughs ] You know,\nthey actually are criminals. [ Twisting cap ] After this,\nwe would take this and we literally have the most\ndangerous part of the process, which is where we have\nto actually decarboxinate it. You're putting a flammable\nsubstance next to heat source. Yeah -- never smart. You know, I --\nI mean, like, honestly -- Like, I'm pretty nervous\ndoing this inside. Um, stick your mask on,\nplease. -Because...\n-Um... What -- What can go wrong\nif this goes -- Um, you could burn down\na whole building. You could kill yourself.\nIt's extremely dangerous. All right, I'm actually\nvery nervous about this. [ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a I'll just take off my mask. Yeah, that's done.\nThat's just, uh, oil. Ooh, you can really\nsmell it, though. We don't charge. It's not about charging,\nyou know? How much\ndo you give away? Every week, about 20,000. 20,000 pounds? -Yeah.\n-Wow. But for someone, that could be, like,\n5 to 10 days of relief. And this is why we're -- we're\nactually fighting our government for the right\nfor medical access, because it shouldn't be\npeople like me, sitting in a dank,\nlittle house, risking my life\nand my -- my freedom. to produce\nhigh-potency cannabis oil, I wanted to know who was using\nthis back-alley medicine. So I'm joining John\nas he consults with a new patient,\nPaul Webster Hughes -- a single father of two\nand stroke survivor. Hello.\nGood evening, John. I'm Paul.\nIt's a pleasure to meet you. Hello, Paul.\nVery nice to meet you. Can you step aboard?\nI'm -- I'm good. Thank you. \u266a\u266a I've just given cannabis\nin the privacy of my own home. Thank you very much. And, uh,\nthat's a 1:1 strain, which is 15% CBD\nand 15% THC. There's no\nrecommended dosage, because there isn't\nany medical data on how we're to do this.\nOkay. But, really,\nwhat I'd say of anyone is try a very, very, very\nsmall amount. Just take -- even just, like,\na pinhead to start with until you just\nget used to it. No need to worry about money,\n'cause that's what we do. We give out\nfree cannabis oil.\nWell, thank you very much. Because Paul lacks\nregular, safe access to medical marijuana, he uses a combination of medical oil and street weed to treat the symptoms\nof his stroke at his home in North Yorkshire. [ Birds chirping ] Andavolu: So, Paul, if you could\nsort of take me through -- What happened to you? 2005 --\nI'm living in Thailand, and I went out\nto my wife's village. Went swimming\nin the morning, and later that morning,\nI just fell, and I've got videos --\nbizarre, coincidental. Paul: Now, while you're\nplaying around on there... [ Woman gasps ] -It's okay.\n-There's no blood. [ Child crying ]\nOkay... And I was paralyzed\non the left side of my body. [ Slurring ]\nDo you need any... [ Woman speaking indistinctly,\nchild crying ] Woman: Hey. [ Crying continues ] Paul:\nAnd for the next six months,\nI was carried to the toilet. I had about 10% of my left body,\nat that point. I've had a headache\nfor 11 years.\nWow. Can you imagine having\na headache for 4,100 days? -Straight?\n-Straight -- absolutely. I never get a break. Imagine big, rolling\nboulders or marbles crashing\noff each other. It's like a tightening\nof a skull cap on my head. Did doctors sort of\nprescribe you anything to sort of help?\nOh, sure. Yeah, I-I've been on\npretty much all the medications that they're allowed\nto give me. I was on 14 pills a day\nat one point. So, on these pills, physically,\nit closed me down, and a couple of them depress you\nenough to kill you. This last Christmas,\nI decided no -- no more. And, uh, that's when\nI started, uh, smoking, because it dulled\nthe pain. \u266a\u266a It allows me to do the things\nthat I must do. It gives me potential. The pain's still there,\nbut it's in a bubble. But it's like\nthere's an extra layer between me and my pain. My kids\ndon't see me smoke. I only smoke\nin my room. I don't smoke anywhere else\nin the house. I'm a single dad.\nMy kids come first. Hello, you. -What'd you doin'?\n-Hi. There's word\nfor your brother you'll learn\nwhen you're older -- seven girlfriends,\nI mean... He's a player! Okay, that's one way\nof putting it. Yeah, sure. All right,\nhere's the view -- pizza. Can you bang it on?\nYou can do that, can't you, huh?\nMm-hmm. All right, homework --\nWhat about French?\nI got my history. What was your history like? 64%. 64%. -Yeah.\n-Well done, you. -Pizza's ready!\n-Okay. Thank you, sir. Please.\nYou're very welcome. Oh, thank you very much. Meat Feast or pepperoni? I think it's Meat Feast,\none of your favorites. -Meat Feast.\n-Looks like it's Meat Feast. Do you guys sort of,\nlike, realize that, like, the marijuana\nthat your dad's smoking is still, like,\ntechnically illegal? Yeah, we do. How does that make you feel?\nLike, what... Uh...

They're more important to me\nthan, uh -- than anything. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Ooh.\nHey, you okay? Yes, yes. Is it sort of scary\nto think that he has to do something that's illegal to,\nlike, feel better? If it's helping him,\nI allow it. But if he's doing it\nfor no reason, really, I would feel\nkind of upset. Right. But it doesn't seem like\nhe's doing it for no reason. It seems like\nit helps him a lot, right?\nMm-hmm. Well, she hates smoking --\nI think that's the main thing. And she's got a pretty good\nsense of values. And to her, whatever\nshe sees in the world, says pot's bad. And she thinks\nin black and white. And now we give her\nthis conundrum that daddy needs it. It kind of throws a bit\nof a wobbly at her, you know? Mm-hmm.

What we've got here are\nsome CBD-rich cannabis seeds. They're very low in THCs. I'm gonna pop them\nin the balloon. Okay. [ Helium hissing ] We are gonna tie some notes\nto them from patients -- medicinal-cannabis patients\nacross the UK, and we're gonna send those\nup into the sky and hope they reach\ncommunities across Albion. Amazing. [ Hissing continues ] So, what do you reckon the day's\ngonna be like for you? Uh, I am...\nI mean,\nyou're taking a small boat into big old body of water. It's gonna be a big old\nbody of water out there, be nice and choppy. How is it different from the small canals\nthat you go in? Uh, it's tidal,\nso it's pretty dangerous. Do you think the boat's\ngonna handle it? The boat is gonna handle it,\nmy friend. We do not like pessimism...\nOkay. Right on. ...anywhere near my boat.\n[ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Boat motor humming ] All right, John!\nSee you, man! Goodbye, Krishna.\nGood luck. Namaste. Whoo-whoo!\nWhoo-whoo!

These are real people\ncoming out and demonstrating\nthe reality they believe in. And that's got to make a\ndifference, Krishna, in the end. And what's it like being sort of\nbeing amongst this group of, like,\nother like-minded people? -Brothers. Family.\n-You think so? -Yeah.\n-Amazing. They're just be so open\nand honest about it. I asked them, did they feel\nat all self-conscious? Hell no.\n[ Laughs ] You know, this is what\nthey believe and what they do. Yeah, people are just, like,\nsmoking weed next to the Thames, next to Parliament. The English are\nvery law-abiding. But I think now that we're starting to see\na movement that's gonna\ngive us a change. And this is the mother\nof Parliaments. If it can't start here... -This is where it starts.\n-This is where it starts. \u266a\u266a Andavolu:\nAll right, it looks like he's just about to go\nunder Westminster Bridge, and he's just gonna pop out right in front of the Houses\nof Parliament and Big Ben. I saw him for just this little\nbit right on the other side, and he looked really tiny. Like, the boat was small. And -- Oh, look! You can\njust see him right there. He's coming in. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] He's releasing the balloons. [ Laughs ] Amazing. Man: Go on, John!\nKeep going! Get those seeds!\nYou tell Cameron! [ Cheering continues ] Hey, John!\nHey, John! He gave the wave!\n[ Laughs ] He waved at us. And he looks so small\ncompared to that building. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] \u266a\u266a As an American,\ncoming to the UK and seeing how medical-marijuana\npatients are faring -- In one way, it's a little\ndispiriting to see that they have to improvise and sort of do\nthis underground stuff to get what they think is\nmedicine that's gonna help them. But another way -- I'm seeing\nsomething sort of special. The people I met here\nare kind of filling in the gaps. Guys like John,\nlike Paul, like Hidrow, who are making real sacrifices\nin order to help people -- Robin Hoods of sorts -- they're forming these kind of\nad hoc underground communities, taking weed\nfrom the black market, making it into oil\nand medicine, and then giving it\nto the needy. That's kind of\na beautiful thing. That sort of, like,\nmodel of compassion is something I think\nthat the world can learn from. What I've seen in the U.S. is that legal weed\ncan equal money. But here in the UK, it seems like illegal weed\nequals compassion. And what's cool\nis that compassion is free. \u266a\u266a", "FC0x8fM_ZAE": "THE PRINCETON CHURCH OF GOD.

Reporter: THE RECOMMENDATION COMES FROM A 24 PERSON TASK FORCE OF APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR TO ADDRESS RACIAL DISPARITIES WITHIN OUR COURT SYSTEM. THIS TASK FORCE BELIEVES IN DECRIMINALIZING SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIJUANA WILL HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. RESEARCH SHOWS BLACK PEOPLE AND WHITE PEOPLE USE MARIJUANA AT SIMILAR RATES.

THE IDEA BEHIND DECRIMINALIZATION ISN'T THAT YOU MAKE IT LEGAL. IT IS STILL A VIOLATION OF THE LAW. JUST LIKE SPEEDING IS A VIOLATION OF THE LAW. JUST LIKE SPEEDING YOU GET A TICKET INSTEAD OF HAVING A CRIMINAL RECORD THAT THEN BURDENS YOU TO MAKE IT HARD FOR YOU TO GET A JOB. Reporter: THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS A COCHAIR ON THE TASK FORCE.

Shackleford she said would you please see my five-year-old daughter Charlotte and my first thought was no I don't work with children and then Paige told me that Charlotte had been having seizures since she was six months old and she had been diagnosed with a rare genetic condition called dravet syndrome none of the medicines that had been prescribed for Charlotte had worked not one of 17 different prescription drugs and now they wanted to try a horse tranquilizer from Europe and then Paige said something that really stunned to me she said she had been reading that medical marijuana might be able to stop seizures and she said dr. Shackleford will you please recommend some so that we can try it for Charlotte and I was dumbfounded I how could I possibly rationalize recommending that a child use marijuana for any purpose and I was concerned that if I did it it might endanger my medical license but then Paige told me that Charlotte had had two cardiac arrests too at the age of five and it made me think of my daughter Vanessa who was swimming in the ocean and ice skating and eagerly looking forward to starting school when she was Charlotte's age and Charlotte had never experienced any of those things and she might never experience them because 73 percent of children with dravet syndrome who have uncontrolled seizures died before their 10th birthday and when I finished medical school I pledged to use all of my skills and all of my training to sustain life to care for the patient's I was privileged to take care of to the best of my ability to use all that training to cure when possible but to comfort always and so I knew that I had to see Charlotte and I wouldn't necessarily promise to recommend that she used marijuana but I would see her and a few days later Paige and Charlotte came to my office and in the two hours that Charlotte was there she had five seizures one in the parking lot two in the waiting room and two while I was examining her now imagine your child having seizures like this again 300 a week 3 an hour every hour of every day for five years now I had heard pretty much the same thing that Paige had that there was a compound in the marijuana plant called CBD or cannabidiol that might be able to control seizures there was one study on it published in 1980 and I just happened to have read that so CBD is remarkable unlike THC it doesn't get you high and I did not want for Charlotte to get high I also didn't want for her to smoke marijuana in fact I don't want anybody to smoke marijuana because oral dosing is much more effective and so I filled out the necessary paperwork so that Paige could go down to the dispensary and buy all of the high CBD low THC cannabis in Enver an ounce and a half for $800 and Paige gave it to an herbalist friend of hers in Colorado Springs who extracted it into an oil and then Paige very nervously put several drops of it in Charlotte's mouth and I was on pins and needles after this waiting to hear what had happened had it had it worked or had it been a dismal failure had the whole thing maybe been a huge mistake it was like waiting for the astronauts to land on the moon if you remember that and then finally when Paige did call me she said dr. Shackleford Charlotte has not had one single seizure for an entire week not one it's like a miracle and Paige was right it was a miracle for Charlotte but I had known long before I met Charlotte that medical cannabis could work wonders I knew it actually three years before because a patient of mine named Joan in an occupational medicine practice where I was working at the time had asked me to make it possible for her to use marijuana for pain and and I Joan was a remarkable patient but she had been injured in a work accident and was taking more than a hundred percocet tablets a month and the pain was still so bad that she couldn't do normal household chores even cook for her family and she was severely constipated and was worried about being addicted but she had read that marijuana might be helpful for chronic pain and she begged me to make it possible for her to do so so very reluctantly I filled out that paperwork so Joan Cattrall and Joan went out and got the medical cannabis now I say reluctantly because I know nothing about it I didn't know anything really about how to recommend cannabis and there was no medical research on it I couldn't find any articles on it in any of the medical journals that I was reading you see on that classically-trained very conservative physician I graduated from the University of Heidelberg School of Medicine where I did research as a medical student and then I did seven years of post-grad training at the Harvard Medical School where I was also a research fellow I don't usually recommend treatments that I don't understand and I want to know exactly how the drugs work but I didn't have access to any of that scientific data that I normally relied on when it came to medical marijuana what I did have was a desperate patient whose pain medicines weren't working very well and to my surprise and I have to say to my great relief it worked extremely well for Joan Joan was able to reduce the number of percocet she was taking from a hundred a month to fifty than the 20 and then she could stop taking it altogether it was really pretty remarkable now today just six years after I first met Charlotte there are lots more articles in the scientific literature on the medical uses of cannabis and on the more than a hundred different compounds found in the marijuana plant that are remarkable for their medical applicability let me give you an example researchers in California have found that cannabis is a particularly good treatment for pain and it is in fact the THC that is so powerful researchers in Israel learned that nearly half of the patients with Crohn's disease who use medical cannabis no longer have any symptoms of the disease at all and there are tantalizing early indications from from research on the plant that some of the compounds found in the marijuana plant may someday be used to treat cancer now a lot more research is necessary and marijuana is not a panacea or a cure-all but the medical community is now beginning to recognize that cannabis may play an important role in taking care of patients for whom conventional therapies aren't working very well and that is something that most of the 20,000 patients I've seen over the last nine years can attest to I had really no idea where that phone call would lead me six years ago when Paige called but I can say from a great deal of experience that miracles are pretty commonplace among patients for whom nothing else has worked nothing but medical cannabis this is not about pot this is about patients now you may be wondering about Charlotte and what happened this is Charlotte about a year after she first started using medical cannabis what Charlotte is saying here is ballerina ballerina you can see her dancing [Applause] and she's still doing very very well now next time you or someone you love is suffering from pain that's not responding to conventional treatments or has another medical tradition that might benefit from the use of cannabis think about medical cannabis think about the thousands of patients who have benefited from it and think about Charlotte at ballerina it changed her life and it just might change yours thank

no idea what that is what is janet jackson appreciation day if it wasn't for a nip slip we wouldn't have youtube today a nip slip can you elaborate on this so the reason why the guys that created youtube created youtube is because they tried searching for the infamous nip slip and they couldn't find it because there was no google there was no youtube and youtube was like 2005 and i think the nip slip of janet jackson was a couple years before that maybe 2003 yep yeah i think we have a 10-year anniversary something like that so yeah that's you know the we wouldn't be here if there wasn't a happy mistake so uh yeah lucky accidents i tell you there's some super bowl news there's some super bowl news they aren't allowed to advertise for weed yeah that's an unfortunate one that uh uh we'll we should watch it because it got rejected two years ago the ad for national tv and cbs but there was one uh ad that did get placed it was by um uh uh carrie accardi she runs a group called 420 media and it was played in the virgin islands one place and this one this ad this is the one i got rejected nationally so this is the rejected super bowl ad from cbs for acreage holding let's check this out austin would have dozens to hundreds of seizures every single day none of the prescriptions would work one pill almost killed our son i've had three back surgeries and i was on opioids for 15 years it was a very dark very depressive time in my life after my injury i felt like i couldn't live with the pain but i couldn't live with this treatment long term it was unbearable i don't have to live like that anymore medical cannabis saved austin's life cannabis is giving me my life back there are families in other states having to watch their children die i want to see my brothers and sisters who sacrificed so much for this country have access to the safest treatment possible this really is an injustice it's not just unfair it's cruel such a well done commercial though i mean acreage holdings yeah i mean it was not about profit motive at all you know it was all about the patients and so they uh they rejected that huh the message man do you think i mean we all know because it was canvas related but it was like maybe like we don't want to give them people sad don't want to super pulse that aiming what's why why would we have we could play all the bag or commercial we want all the alcohol commercials you want yeah i'd like commercial about dr galackowitz and uh you know spuds mackenzie but you try to say that cannabis is going to help somebody and no you're not allowed to do that the conversations is constantly being twisted in the sense that like the with the shadow bands and the uh you know the the the twitter flagging for the the ward usage of cannabis and marijuana alone it it's sad but it's also we have good people fighting for us you know and some of those are football players too yeah the nfl has a ban on cannabis and so it would not allow the league to promote the uh the advertisement and so acreage is not the first company that's had an ad rejected from the super bowl last year the vitamin supplement company gnc and i had an ad rejected interesting but yeah and then well the nfl has since changed its rules so they're allowed to consume you know at least pop positive right but it's still not all the way there i mean this whole revamping of the uh the identity you know kaepernick still hasn't got a you know this cannabis is more about medicine it's also social justice and social equity it's a it's a multi-tiered issue that it's nice to see like players stepping up with the cbd issue like this is the the marijuana-like people stepping up and creating their own brands it's okay i mean i'm not some of them like ricky williams have been doing it for a long time and then you have the new people like gronk uh jumping in um i don't know if you follow sports though i don't i do i spawn like yeah and so i'm excited to watch the super bowl today and then it's the super bowl is not just when i pack an exceptionally good bowl but that isn't super bowl and uh and hopefully later on i'll have one of those as well um but yeah man i i'm just not all that surprised that cbs and and the nfl are not allowing a cannabis commercial simply because it is illegal at a federal level and so with those federal regulations that they have you know who else got turned down from a super bowl uh commercial who's that pornhub really yeah pornhub godaddy ashley madison and bud light have had super bowl ads rejected over the years for being too sexual i could see that i thought ashley madison had one though but still bud light still gets their commercials in it don't [ __ ] matter how bud light sponsors the uh pre-election debates right well let's do some more uh football news yeah uh former nfl running back marshawn lynch is launching a premium blunt brand uh yeah and uh um talking to lauren she said it was reported by fox news that there's gonna be a diamond on the tip of it and of course you know fox news doesn't understand that so they just reported that there will be diamonds on the um uh of the blunts yeah and then that's that's not exactly what it is it's not exactly diamonds no no i mean it is nickel gold though man it's uh the green rush these are all things that it can be equated to it but you know whatever uh what else going

consuming your own thing the next day you're gonna be so chill it doesn't make great content sometimes sometimes you're just like yo can we just well i don't mention i still think it's amazing that virginia has passed uh cannabis legalization uh dispensaries opening in 2024. that is just so weird i can't believe that they've passed cannabis legalization three years into the future i agree oh wisconsin yeah let's get to wisconsin news for cannabis legalization governor tony evers as the governor of wisconsin and he proposes legalizing and taxing marijuana this is great until you dig into this story and then you realize that the legislature in wisconsin's uh republican controlled and so i'm glad that the governor's like saying hey we should legalize it right governors don't write laws the the house and the senate writes the laws and so if they're both republican controlled is there even a bill you know i would like to say there is but as we've seen how they like to stick together over [ __ ] how do we come this is why we can't have nice things well you know i'm glad that he's calling for your cannabis legalization but where's the bill yeah you can't just say it you got to actually pass something even that's the process virginia it's coming in 2024. what's that with that wisconsin is that their process like again each state's different right no no every state's pretty much the same i mean the the legislature is the ones that writes the laws the executives the ones that enforces it but like in texas when you have to have the legislator you can't do a like a like a signature movement you know like right yeah like there's not valid initiative in wisconsin or in illinois and so yeah i'd have to be the legislative legislator that's doing it but then you know the the executive can set the agenda and so like it's great that this democratic uh governor of wisconsin tony evers wants to legalize weed and uh he put it even in his budget for the numbers saying legalize marijuana will uh expect it to generate more than 165 million bucks in the wisconsin state i guess the packers state the cheesehead state beginning in 2023. well i know they got hemp i have a friend out there who's based out of wisconsin for a hemp farm yep they do i got hemp everywhere now but the governor also proposed setting aside 80 million of the revenue generated by marijuana to reinvest in communities across the state through a new community reinvestment fund so there you go some some type of social equity that goes into rebuilding and so that would include grants for mental health education economic development and food insecurity you know who doesn't have that no i just learned this yesterday so in washington state five miles away from a marijuana grow that's where you don't have hemp so the marijuana grow takes precedent in the in the uh washington state law i thought that was just quite interesting how about cross-pollination yeah man i'm trying to figure out what uh uh we're talking about on on the end of the tmz thing where's all the weird uh cannabis edibles i once overdosed on marijuana and it took six cupcakes and a bag of pistachio nuts to bring me back from the brink i still get the munchies hashtag survivor [Laughter] that one's not bad all right let's uh back to the democrats in the senate schumer hosts first marijuana meeting to formulate 2021 federal legalization plan marijuana moment is asking me to sign up for their newsletter and also reporting that uh s key u.s senate leaders held a meeting with marijuana stakeholders on friday how come i wasn't invited i'm marijuana um the first formal step towards creating a new bill to federally legalize cannabis states majority leader chuck sumers state finance committee center uh committee chair ron wyden and cory booker heard from a group of advocates and stakeholders as the trio prepares to unveil a draft reform legislation in the early part of the year which is now the early part of the year and were there are they trying to sidestep like everything as far as uh getting involved in the coded relief and there's what they're trying to do like getting involved in the package we'll we'll have to kind of wait and see how that plays out but uh early part of the year that's when some uh some legislation should be coming and i'm not sure what this legislation's gonna look like but hopefully it's like the more act two or something like that it was it was normal it was the drug policy alignment alliance the students for sensible drug policy and other organizations affiliated with marijuana justice coalition business-focused groups such as the national cannabis industry association and the minority cannabis business association were also present there there you go they did have some actual stakeholders all together and hopefully uh we're going to see some legislation here pretty soon and then we can do some content about it on the channel what's it going to take before the uh more act to get seen heard in the next step well i it's it's interesting you know see look what they are saying you know we're trio prepares to unveil draft reform legislation in the early part of this year it sounds like they aren't talking about the morocco sounds like they're talking about something new yeah that's what i'm saying like like you can throw us a bunch of words that are gonna happen but give me dates and let's set goals and guidelines because we already have the more act let's let's continue on right and so what are they going to change what are they going to call it i don't know we'll be reporting on it though oh for sure i mean again as long as there's something messed up going on there's always something to talk about and this regulation is going to take forever to work itself out oh yeah this was historic that yeah amber littlejohn from the mcba's executive director uh leaders and then she goes on to quote leader schumer and senators booker and wyden made clear that equity and justice is the foundation of federal reform we look forward to working with them to that and through every phase of this long journey wow as long as we stop putting people in jail right stop arresting it stop being uh asset forfeiture stop having our personal lives interfered with just because of what we decided to do with our bodies yep uh former guest of the show queen adasi or a day suey i'd have to have her on the show again to help me pronounce that last name of hers from the dpa says uh we're we are excited to have such a dynamic trifecta of leadership in the senate to build on the best of the more act in order to deliver justice to communities most affected by cannabis prohibition so is it going to be the more act two well she was part of the morocc as well so i have faith that whatever they come out with will be at least something reasonable oh it's gonna be interesting to see what this legislation looks like but um yeah and so it's it's not the more act but it's going to be something while it's not clear what the draft senate marijuana reform proposal will entail or when it will be released schumer said lawmakers are in the process of merging various pieces of legislation which could include his own cannabis descheduling bill that he filed in the last two congresses the separate more act could also serve as the basis of reform in the 117th contract congress so there you go man it just it just seems to me and it's all about the paperwork and doing the the meetings and whatnot but it's so frustrating to hear like you're gonna have a thousand pages of legalization where it's to me it'd be like simple okay we're gonna have three things no one in jail no one can get arrested and uh i don't know your stuff won't get taken away you know for the plant period like broccoli right but i understand there's stuff they got a retro act or just it's frustrating man i i want to have faith that's what i'm saying uh the meeting earlier this week schumer pressed biden's attorney general and other justice department nominees to respect the rights of the states that legalize marijuana now that's going to be something interesting that's something that i'm always waiting to see every year in the budget the defunding of the department uh no the drug enforcement agency or administration the dea from having any appropriations any money from congress to do anything that interferes with medical marijuana hopefully that's going to change just to like any state's marijuana law as opposed to states medical marijuana and that would help my friend the one who owns the the lab the testing lab did you see my uh my sharon post so i have a friend here in washington state check this out he owns a cannabis lab in washington state but he can't get certified as a usda hemp facility because government agents can't deliver hemp to a facility that tests a federally listed schedule one drug like wf man this guy's been in business for shoot uh we've had 2012 and so eight years nine years this man has a respectable lab but because he's in the wrong state with the wrong business sorry buddy yeah we create a whole new entity dropping like half a million into it so far craziness man yeah well that's just kind of how it goes i mean it's it's a very weird industry and then it's expensive to get into it's kind of insane like the deadline for illinois uh 10-day notices have passed so i've kind of like just chilled out and relaxed this this weekend yeah oh is it is it 420 somewhere let's do this [Applause] [Music] yeah stuck at work huh hey you know i mean like i smoke outside just not in the building oh that's nice yeah that's where i took my new toy out oh yeah that's right you have that new um uh vape now is that just like um a distillate vape or or what's dude cartridge or is it it's a flower it's a flower flower no it's not in a vape it's just a cylindrical it's been steeled and milled to like aerodynamically i pack flour in there you light the bowl i can't wait to give you guys a hand because as soon as i do the promo video i'm gonna help blow them up possibility we might be able to get a uh a code for our listeners to get a discount on because i mean toys aren't expensive this guy's going for 70 bucks on a uh but when you they're toys right right pipes and different types but this is a really great design i get excited about nerdy [ __ ] man this is definitely one of them but what else we got going on man well you know let's do some more of the summary of other federal bills that are kind of working their way through congress already in 2021 several congressional marijuana bills have been filed one to move cannabis from schedule one to schedule three of the controlled substances act what do you think about that uh man again anything that happens is better than nothing right but then it's still going to be a controlled substance and so like i think the uh irc 280e issue would go away if it's a schedule three but then it's still a controlled substance you know it's still going to be called marijuana under the the legislation uh and then here's another one another bill is uh to prevent the united states department of veteran affairs from denying veteran benefits solely because they use medical marijuana in compliance with state law and one to allow hemp derived cbd to be marketed and sold as a dietary supplement dude as a veteran the um the problem the va has been since the obama years like it goes every other year we're gonna let you have weed no we can't let you have weed hey if you're in the legal state we're gonna let you have weed but when you go there no you can't have any mixed messages they need to have this [ __ ] thing on and just like we can't mess with you yeah i mean it's just so pathetic and then it's it i can't believe that it's a controversial issue that's one of those things it's it's so strange that people just don't look into stuff and be like oh well it's illegal oh then that's terrible but then you actually look into it like oh it's just all lies it was all eyes and we didn't know how the plant actually worked until the early 90s but like you're missing an armed leg you got shot at you got ptsd we don't want you to have a holistic natural approach we want you to take these pills we want you to be stuck in our system the point of all of this is to let you be better on your own right right i can't believe that yeah the pills uh the pills are fine but then you give them like a fresh pure uh good high quality cannabis and suddenly so oh my gosh you know you have to check them make sure they have an id they aren't allowed to touch the plant it has to be in a you know child proof container oh yeah child proof container have you ever seen a child proof container of a vodka bottle come on um yeah no no you don't it's but that's how we are i mean like we don't change and i'm kind of like proud of us for changing as much as we have even though we really don't you know we create all these weird regulations that we put on it well we adapt and that's the thing it's like we're trying to in the end make it so you know this just becomes the natural part of everyday society like it shouldn't even be an issue this shouldn't be a talking point or you know an eyeball raised you can't you can't give this to veterans are you kidding you you're going to maintain this lie uh to their detriment but even in the service itself dude i didn't start drinking until i served like i did maybe have like one or two beers but when i was in the military your only option is to have benders right or or do the hard drugs like cocaine and meth because out of your system in two days this is where our society is [ __ ] up right the justice the imbalance the the non-seeing how things weight should be because hey ray i'm serving the country i'm protecting i'm getting shot at i'm deployed nine ten months out of the way and all you're gonna let me do is drink remember when we used to give people cigarettes in the army here's your cigarettes thanks they let us smoke on the ship so like when i uh my first ship i was on was the uss constitution and a constellation sorry and uh uh constitution the first one the very oldest one but anyways uh uh it was it was in the vietnam war there were signs still in the in the the the barracks about how you can't smoke in the birthing or there were only certain smoky sections in the birthing which was like unheard of now and i'd hear so many stories of these guys pulling into like yeah australia guam coming back with lords of hash and cannabis because that's just what they did back then you know the the zero tolerance [ __ ] didn't happen until reagan and and the reason why that happened was because of a series of accidents that happened on the um uh it's the the one that mccain had an accident on where he crashed his plane on the uh that i have no idea what drug john mccain was nominee crashed no no he wasn't on a drug it was just the the shift that he was he had that accident on uh there was there was a series of accidents going on throughout this time frame and the military tested these people and thought okay cause and effect a lot of these people are testing positive for marijuana why not it must be the reason why this shit's happening it hadn't they weren't even thinking about poor regulations that were going on time or the fact that you're working guys 18 hours on a [ __ ] 200 degree flight deck no no that's not the reason why messed up stuff happens yeah all right this is a good one i like it okay it is a bill the hemp and hemp derived cbd consumer protection and market stabilization act is the third piece of cannabis legalization of legislation to be filed in the new 117th congress and it would provide the hemp industry with critical regulatory clarity as federal agencies develop rules for cbd marketing so this would be the thing that essentially allows cbd to be regulated as if it was an herbal dietary supplement see hemp cannabinoid cannabidiol derived from hemp and any other ingredient derived from hemp shall be lawful for use under the federal food drug and cosmetic act as a dietary ingredient in a dietary supplement boy that would help yeah it would that would help yeah that would help so many people like especially with commerce in between people you know halls they're being pulled over craziness dude yeah yep and so it's gonna be interesting how that goes but let's see who who's involved on this under the proposal from representative kurt schrader democrat from oregon and morgan griffith a republican from virginia filed these bills and actually this is a refiling and so this type of bill was in the last congress and now it's been refiled and i support the hemp and hemp derived cbd consumer protection and market stabilization act do you in that act did you have you gone through it yet at all i'm just kind of reviewing it right now i mean like it's it's the the most important part was that one that we already read that you know it's going to say that hemp cannabidiol derived from hemp and any other ingredient derived from hemp shall be lawful for use under the federal food drug and cosmetic act as a dietary ingredient in a dietary supplement so i guess i i guess the the question would be then how to define hemp right because it's going to be back to that one person's fine it's it's under the 2018 farm bill yeah yeah so i mean it's great for right now until they fix the goddamn regulate definition of him god it's such a little little layer of you know things there right like hey this is great for you but first let's look at how we defined it i mean because it would be great for a lot of people somebody here said that they think hemp should only be for like clothes and paper and i have to disagree do you guys believe here you go well you have to read it man well it says dude i'm sorry do you believe hemp is a product to put in our bodies for me hemp is a product of clothing vehicles or eat on some kind of weird diet well if you're going to eat it karina i mean essentially it is no the the cool article that i was reading earlier had to do with hemp being used instead of lithium for batteries and i'm like oh my gosh this reminds me of what jack baruchian was talking about when he was on our show should check that one out about the hemp futures markets but you could use hemp to create this carbon source that is evidently a better conductor than graphene and so these batteries might be getting grown in your farm isn't that amazing growing batteries and that's the thing marijuana hemp is such an amazing plant with the can the cabbage can cavity all of them though all of the seeds but when you extract them from the the hemp plant then that can be used you know in our like with our friends we have the noun tech talking about the soluble yeah i mean this is the pharmaceutical use so i also ask you about that descheduling one the bill about the scheduling right uh you know the big corporate store uh conspiracy is well if you do schedule hold now you put it in the hands of pharmaceuticals what do you think oh man i know and especially like if this thing is for the hemp and cbd passes if that's going to be considered an herbal supplement and then you have the more act or something similar to that passing uh wow that would be freaking excellent and so i mean like the uh wow i mean so now you're gonna have like cbd essentially just be what it should be it should be like an herbal supplement because it is yeah no i totally agree and once you qualify as a supplement then it can't be taken away into the pharmaceutical arena right that's right so i mean that that's just dope yeah and so right so the pharmaceutical industry i mean they could still but then that's kind of the point and the uh the if you haven't checked out our video with uh dr ethan russo you should go check that one out because that was really really awesome how he talks about the entourage effect and so it's this bundle of cannabinoids and terpenoids that actually have the more medicinal effect it's not just when you isolate it like a particular chemical like a lot of drugs or just a particular chemical you know and this again hemp and marijuana are the same plant just different ratios of terpenes and cannabinoids uh karina just posted she's not a believer of the hemp the one that asked a question about it being a topical versus ingestion but when you oranges you know they can be used uh for the the smell the terpene smell and oils or they can be used orange juice i mean this is what you're doing with hemp marijuana you're just squeezing the [ __ ] out of it and getting all the good stuff yep yep let's see what we got coming out of japan there's uh out of japan i'm gonna try to share that one here and let's uh marijuana law reform in japan contingent on the message this almost comes off like a it's a contributing writer from the japan times but it almost reads like an opinion piece the government wants to revise japan's cannabis control law presently growing or possessing marijuana is against the law but because of a perceived increase in the use of drugs among many many young people the health ministry wants to make smoking and ingesting marijuana crimes too this may sound like splitting hairs how can you smoke weed without having it but the proposal indicates the authority's strong resistance to other countries to decriminalize and even commercialize medicinal and recreational consumption of pot so i guess japan is going backwards don't be like florida japan wait wait florida actually has uh medical marijuana they just have it's just a it's you know hegemony in in florida and so like there's only a handful of companies that operate the entire market yeah you know the the right person with the right kind of money can just be the right kind of influence in that one place yep yep that japan is trying to make it more difficult and criminalize marijuana possession i mean uh no don't do that japan that is stupid i can't believe you would you would go that far to make things worse in your country i don't know what the heart it is for because like when i was in japan 15 years ago it was very taboo you know i could have sell my ripped ass jeans they loved all things american except for this for weed which i don't get like how did how did the weed pass japan did they just like skip over from india to you know you know they just said oh screw this place maybe no way man no no you don't think there's any land races in japan there's gotta be dude japan they have a beautiful landscape man i i was it's beautiful mountains uh beautiful countrysides i think it'd be a good farming weather she's one of these uh doctors is questioning japan's marijuana laws when she realized that people accused of using stimulant drugs sometimes carried out secondary crimes against assault and arson while those accused of using weed usually don't where do these people live do you need a study for this [ __ ] i'm just saying yeah yeah i plan it it's but um i'm not gonna be going to japan to help them open any cannabis companies at piers you know what else do we have in the news we got mississippi mississippi what news do we have out of that they said a july first time table for finalized medical cannabis yes that's coming and this is uh fun stuff that we do on the show we're gonna talk about the long window of cannabis legalization and so after it becomes legal then the rules come out and mississippi has their rules coming in july so in july i'll know how uh the cannabis applications in mississippi are going to be shaping up i can't wait to see those i'm i'm i don't know how bad it's going to be but i'm assuming it's going to be fairly well regulated because it's a medical cannabis as opposed to you know adult use do you think the the fact that you know uh you know since virginia passed uh google had a 20 uh increase in searches right worldwide do you think the the the worldwide increase that happens every time something happens is the reason why jamaica is facing a shortage jamaica is facing a shortage of what oh cannabis how is jamaica facing the shortage of marijuana jamaican faces marijuana shortage as farmers struggle um all right who's reading this one because i can't really make it out all right so apparently heavy rains followed by extended drought an increase in local consumption and increasing look that's awesome and a drop in the number of marijuana farmers that's not so awesome has caused a shortage in the islands famed but largely illegal market so it's still illegal but yet it's famous and you know the guy that have quality bud right like it's got to be what would you say like the like france if you go to france for wine yeah if you went to uh jamaica and you got some shitty weed that would really harsh your mellow like you know you're like i'm in jamaica and the weed sucks what the hell i thought everything that i knew in my life has been a lie if i was in jamaica and i didn't get weed yeah i would be so upset so upset like i i've realized that if i'm going to japan high likelihood not gonna find weed but if i go to jamaica i want weed and i would hope i look like the kind of guy that someone would hit me up yep yep i got hit up in hong kong i have never been to jamaica or smoked wheat in jamaica i should rectify that as soon as covet is gone dude that's bucket list for me my friend bucket list yes my friend uh mark morgan was one of my great friends when i was in law school in uh wisconsin so i can't wait for wisconsin to actually legalize so i can get some more work up there but uh yeah mark morgan was uh he still is uh japan a japanese jamaican guy i should go visit him yeah dude hey now good news for california cannabis workers yeah what did they get the kova test vex california cannabis workers eligible for immediate covet 19 vaccinations that's right they are essential workers doing god's work and so we need to give the coveted vaccines to all cannabis employees 2020 cannot be credited enough for marketing cannabis is essential you cannot forget this yeah hold on over everybody's head ronavirus i'm gonna i this is one of the things that i've been enjoying doing lately i i like to google the coronavirus uh so i could see where the caseload is and and it's just it's just looking so much nicer like look at that crashing uh chart it just like stairs going down um and so that's that's just nice and then oh my gosh it's doing it everywhere thank goodness keep going down that would be fantastic we're slowly opening up again here in seattle yeah it was a year ago that you think you had it remember because you got real sick last year when it was pretty new yeah and i regret calling into bouting virus hey it was a different time seriously though we were under water management back then seemed like 10 years ago yeah the year 2020 was the year that took 12 years yeah yeah yeah feeling better we grew from it we certainly we certainly grew from it all right what other cannabis news do we have going on and virginia model makers cannabis companies turning mainstream there we are rhode island medical marijuana program gets new regulatory sar great [ __ ] babe hey sometimes you need to put in new regulators hey they got a cbd farm in new york somebody says new york very nice botanicals neat marijuana real estate lender afc gamma to raise up to 105 million in an ipo crazy a marijuana real estate lender and so they loan for marijuana real estate again there's businesses everywhere you could be a cannabis accountant yeah but it's also one of those things you know raising money is done in the cannabis industry a lot for example 105 million right there and that's for the real estate aspect and of course west palm beach florida look at that founded in july of 2020 it offers loans and established canada to establish cannabis companies in states where marijuana is legal for medical and recreational use so this bank is out there actively saying that they are going to provide lending to the cannabis companies nice yep so i mean at least now people have an option to because they're in banking as you know there's always that slandered uh the biasedness against them well yeah but you know it's that's going to be something that's going to be interesting is what's the safe banking act going to look like so now that the the senate is coming out with this thing well i hope they aren't just doing this for you know as a show you know i hope they're doing it because they're actually serious and it's got a legitimate shot of getting out because if they're going to put together a piece of legislation put together a piece of legislation they think they can pass you know seriously push it through um uh mark mervyn asked have you tried the delta eight yet oh yeah yeah yeah yeah here's the delta eight pen over here so this is some delta eight it's fine what do you do you feel different from it do you i don't know i know the guys the kids from the cbd hemp library that's their thing and yeah it's uh it's lighter than delta nine and so like it's a little bit more calming a little bit more relaxing uh nowhere near as um buzz inducing in my opinion yeah nice i mean i'm still a spin flower power concentrate yeah i knew it was weed at one time experience yep actually it has helped the uh the price of cbd a little bit and so that product uh has created other products a lot of different edibles and a lot of different um moon rocks and some other stuff for for cbd hemp so delta 8 has really helped that industry become more lucrative do you think delta 8 would um well so it can be a concentrated extract um i just totally blanked that with us and go with man never mind i'm just sitting here looking at the there's so many people talking dude yeah yeah that's right people like to talk man all right let me answer what's going on in the old news by region that's right i'm just trying to find something else that's going on in the here we go funding for marijuana companies surges after democrats win control of white house and congress capital cannabis capital raises and that are going on right now it looks like it is quite a lot of them and so a democratic election trifecta with control of the white house and both chambers of congress is giving the marijuana industry executives hope for federal reform encouraging investors to pump a record amount of money into the cannabis businesses north american cannabis companies have closed or announced more than 1.6 billion in capital raises in january on the wake of democrats taking control the u.s senate further easing a funder funding shortage that began in 2019 according to denver based mj research co really just wish they'd stopped just this whole republican democrat [ __ ] it's it's an american issue that we all are more popular about right and i think i think the reason why it's it's democratic republican kind of issue is just because they're so they don't work together on anything so if one of them votes for it the other one is going to be like well i'm not voting for it we can't even work together you know amy flicks right all right man i know you can't take it off now nor get do that hey this pen really hit really good and it's not a pin again it's the pipe so oh nice did you hit a 420 somewhere bro i'll [ __ ] do it right before all this i was like i'm gonna get ready yeah yeah i tell you sometimes you have to get ready it's i like the uh relaxing sunday show so what do you think the super bowl score is going to be today 42-0 42-0 seriously nothing hey man i'm mr sports like that's sport i got nothing i mean my team the seahawks aren't in it i used to be a chargers fan

reading that article about it where they're trying to make it worse uh it may be kind of difficult kind of like when we were trying to find that uh activist from mississippi we're still looking for that activist from mississippi and and that's that's a horrible thing this is why we do it right because people still con camp can't come out rj i got you all right cool man i like rj but like you

medical marijuana dispensaries will open up later this year in the state of Missouri but right now those hoping to work in this new industry need to know how to do their new jobs in a story you will only see right here on 41 Action News reporter Nick Starling shows us a workshop designed to train future employees for this type of work this is one of the first so-called budtender training courses in Kansas City it teaches people the do's and don'ts of working in this new industry that it is sold by weight more specifically it is commonly sold in grams and ounces this new industry needs people know what they're talking about if they're running a medical marijuana business so today a dispensary from Quincy Illinois taught this group of more than a dozen people all they need to know the organizers say when dispensaries open up later this year they will in turn be the experts so when the patients come in they need to know how to handle all the questions they'll have so this class teaches to them about the cannabis plant the rules and regulations of this industry among other important topics we get into what makes cannabis medicine its therapeutic properties the different chemical compounds in the cannabis plant and really hone in on that so that individuals have a fundamental knowledge of when they're speaking to their patients that come to the dispensary what is their goal with cannabis what are they trying to treat what is their lifestyle after this course the attendees will receive a certification they took this course if you are interested they hope to have some more of these courses in the future reporting in Claycomo Nick Starling 41 Action News", "-X1o3OKL9Ao": "[Music] hello and thank you for joining us i'm wilson stribling welcome to a special at issue mississippi's debate over legalizing medical marijuana 34 states have already approved the use of medical marijuana and millions of americans are enrolled in the programs and in just a few weeks voters in mississippi will decide if this state will become the 35th there are two medical marijuana proposals on the november ballot mississippi voters can choose between a citizen-sponsored initiative measure number 65 and an alternative measure 65-a approved by legislators or voters can select neither joining me tonight are angie calhoun with the campaign for medical marijuana 2020 and state board of health member jim perry tonight we will learn more about initiative 65 and alternative 65-a and we'll hear arguments for and against both proposals thank you both for joining us tonight and we look forward to our discussion this evening during tonight's special we will be answering questions submitted online we're engaging with you on social media and we're also taking phone calls the number to call to ask your question is 1-877-mpb ring that's 1-877-672-7464 in order for alternative 65a to become part of the november ballot lawmakers had to pass it which they did during the legislative session earlier this year republican state representative trey lamar of senatobia presented the alternative on the house floor he called initiative 65 illegitimate and explained why did you know there's no regulation whatsoever in the language about how many licenses they'll be given out there's a similar state in oklahoma that has over ten thousand marijuana licenses how do you think the state department of health is going to properly regulate that amount of licenses for people in the marijuana business i'm going to go ahead and tell you they're not not because they're not capable because they physically can't were you aware that under this program which you get a script for medical marijuana it's good for a year that you know how much marijuana you can get specifically state and real estate in our constitution if it passes two and a half ounces every 14 days let's just say five ounces every 28 days or five ounces a month do you know how much weed that is 300 joints a month 300 joints marijuana joints a month let's say somebody smokes three joints a day okay for an entire month at the end of the month they've got 200 joints left where's that what's going to happen to that weed so when i tell you this language is just one step removed from straight up medical i'm straight up recreational marijuana that's what i mean the intent of this language is to totally flood the market of this state with marijuana it's a major overreach and it's not what the individuals who signed up for this thought they were signing republican representative joel bumgar of madison challenged lamar's intentions in presenting an alternative measure bomgar says he invited his colleague to the table during the drafting phases of initiative 65. bomgar says initiative 65 is the better option because he believes the language in the alternative is too vague and won't help enough people to make a difference both of my parents died from the kind of cancer that takes over your body shuts it down and you die in an extraordinary amount of pain over over years or months or however long that process goes and they had chemotherapy they had opioids they had all of that stuff and they died in extreme pain i remember my dad telling me that every day he woke up and his question for the day was will i be able to stay on top of the pain today after my parents passed away i was talking to some of the cancer doctors that were involved in their treatment and they told me that medical marijuana would have really helped my parents but that they were not even allowed to tell them about it because we live in the state of mississippi and of course my parents i've never used any illegal substance in my entire life neither of my parents that was not something we would even considered and so people in mississippi are dying in way more pain than is necessary because 34 states have done something that we have not decided to do ladies and gentlemen there's no reason again to believe that the program that would be created if hcr 39 became the law would would serve any more than 10 people but it doesn't even matter because hcr 39 was never intended to kill to uh to create a program ladies and gentlemen hcr 39 was intended to kill medical marijuana in mississippi after a heated debate that lasted over an hour the house voted largely along party lines 71-49 to pass alternative 65-a for voters to decide on in the november election we want to remind you the phone lines are open for you to call in and ask your question live dial 1-877-mpb ring that's 1-877-672-746 we'd like to start talking with our guests now uh let me start with you uh angie so we have this initiative on the ballot now in addition to the alternative give us a little bit of background on how we got to this point well um initiative 65 of course was brought on by joel baumgarh our legislator and it was you know to help six patients and you know my son austin i've given my testimony and you know seven years ago he was diagnosed with lyme disease and which has created a ton of issues like chronic nausea and vomiting and severe joint pain and and seizures as well and we tried the 20 we saw 20 doctors we tried 17 prescriptions for over 18 months and they were not working so therefore you know we did research and we found and and knew that medical marijuana helped patients with nausea and vomiting and seizures and pain so austin at the age of 19 decided that it would be best for him to to go to a state with a legal and regulated and functioning program and and so he did and i stayed with him until he was well enough the medical marijuana worked wonders for him it suppressed the seizures he was able to eat once again the the pain subsided so you know even today though if he were to not not to be able to use medical marijuana those those symptoms do return and and so we're just this this program initiative 65 is a great framework for the amendment it's you know based upon pharmacy layouts and and and i just know that you know the opposition talks about you know too much wording and this and that but i have to say 65a for me as a parent is not a working program whatsoever we'll get into more of the details of 65a in a moment but jim we've heard stories like angie's before of of people who have these conditions that are helped when they go other places for medical marijuana given those stories and stories like like angie's are you still against medical marijuana in mississippi sure and thanks for having me wilson and it's great to have this conversation because it's a complex issue this is a actually six or seven page amendment it's going to go in the state constitution the number of pages depends on how long how large the font is but if the issue is about helping angie and her son of course everybody's for that but that's not what's going into the constitution it's not going to say do we want to help people like angie and her son it's going to say do you want to give special protections to a 14 billion year industry that protections that no other product or medicine come close to having and and that's what this is about the out-of-state marijuana industry which is heavily invested in by big tobacco companies that have a history of lying to us with deceptive and fraudulent practices they are rebranding marijuana with stories like this but it ignores the real risks that are inherent in it and if it was about helping just angie's son of course people are for that but why do we have to along the way give immunity to immunities that marijuana companies where nobody associated with them could be liable for any criminal or civil activity why are we not taxing it why are we not given the same opt out to local communities like states like california give why are we giving them this ability to operate with impunity across the state it's because this is about money to them because they're marketing to kids and they want to create this addiction for profit enterprise like we've seen in other states that's what this actual amendment says and it goes way beyond a very very narrow question about whether or not you want to help people if it's medicine we want to treat it like medicine and that's the board of health's position so would it be with a board of health support medical marijuana if it were not in the form of a constitutional amendment well certainly being in the constitution makes it a lot harder because with any law with any new program especially something as complex as marijuana the legislature makes regular changes to protect patients to protect our citizens but if it's in the constitution any substantive change will essence can require another vote of the people we're learning there's a lot we don't know about marijuana there's some we do know the national academy of science says there's risk of increased psychosis and schizophrenia the national institutes of health says that even used just a little bit when you're a teen or a young adult under the age of 25 there's significant increased risk for brain damage we know those things now at the same time we do know there's some some medicinal compo parts some medicinal benefits to components of marijuana that there's four fda approved drugs now in mississippi food and drug administration drugs that have had clinical trials blind testing where you know the dosage you know what's in it you know the risks and doctors actually write a prescription for that we would like to have more of that we would like for the federal laws to be changed so we can do more research on marijuana that's real medicine that's on the way to creating a real medical marijuana program which we would absolutely support but what initiative 65 does is enshrine in the state constitution very special protections to this industry that i'm sure the tobacco industry wishes they'd had back in the 50s and 60s when they were telling us that you smoke more camels because it's good for your throat irritation that's not the right way well last night was the fifth and final public hearing regarding initiative 65 and 65a as required by law the secretary of state's office hosted hearings in each of the old five congressional districts about 100 people attended last night's forum in jackson with more than a dozen speaking for or against the two proposals this isn't a physician versus politicians it's a citizens versus politician simply because the fact that we've been asking for them to do it for 20 bills if they really was going to do it they would have done it we the citizens now have a chance to do the right thing and we need to do that we need to not let bureaucrats continue to make up the rules for us they want to say you know well you know don't you want your elected official to do it no our elected officials aren't doing it that's the problem we went door to door with my three-year-old and my four-year-old in his st andrews school uniform asking people to sign this petition and can i tell you nine out of ten people signed that petition they believe that people should have access to this medication if they are sick we want our physicians to have choices in treating us and we do not want our politicians in our medical care get out of the room it's not their place i'm for all the vets the 200 000 vets in this state to be available to get medical marijuana but i want to tell you something if you take ice cream or cola or vodka and you put medical in front of it it doesn't make it medical and what 65 is is just its pot period it's marijuana under this program it's going 500 feet next to your churches your schools your parks playgrounds things like that 500 feet we have stricter regulations for liquor stores than we're going to put in place for a federally illicit substance i think that the passion from the pro 65 folks and also the interest the general interest if you look at the percentage of people who want to do it there is interest in having a medical marijuana program but there's gonna there's got to be a better way and i think if we do want to do it we need to look at 65a and as the director of the state health department if we pass 65a i promise that i will work to make sure it's a successful program and don't forget the phone lines are open for you to call in and ask your questions live the number to call is 1-877-mpb ring 1-877-672-7464 and we have a caller on the line right now this is robert from natchez robert go ahead with your question please good evening thank you very much good evening um i'm sorry i've been listening to the rest of the program and it makes it really hard to stay concise with what i wish to say when i hear all the things that are being said online before my question so i again will try to be concise it appears to me that 65 and 65 a and no it appears that the republicans have just totally obfuscated the situation adding another question hoping to dilute the the the answer that mississippians want to this bill it should be yes or no which i believe would go yes but again obfuscation please address robert thank you angie do you agree with that that the alternative 65a does what he suggests it does yes i absolutely did it it's a last-minute ditch 65a was put on the ballot by our politicians it's so vague and it is it's just not um it's not appropriate for our state and for the good citizens of our state who are suffering and you know and he's so right it's not fair i've had so many people to come up to me and say look you know we're supporting this but the ballot is so confusing i mean what do we do and so you know therefore i go through the process with them and explain it and and then they're like okay i'm just thankful that i had this ballot and somebody to explain this to me because it is confusing and it's a very long ballot this year and so um you know and it's at the very end as well and obviously you would advocate for people to choose yes to the first question that we should adopt one of these and obviously choose 65 to the second question i absolutely would listen it seems like the caller's problem is highlights the one of the very issues we have here which is his problems with the state's initiative and referendum process and maybe we should change it but you know why we can't change it it's in the constitution it's a constitutional wording that requires that if there are signatures that come in like this the legislature is then presented to the legislature and they put it on the ballot and that wording that's on the ballot that i agree is confusing we know why the wording is like that it's because it's in the constitution the only way we can change that is if we have another vote of the people so this exactly this is a perfect example about why it's such a flaw to go through this process with such a this issue is way more complex than the initiative and referendum process and that initiative and referendum process that's a half a page this is a seven page constitutional amendment on an issue as complex of how we're going to treat multitudes of diseases i think that kind of proves our point we have another caller on the line this is uh harvey from texas harvey go ahead with your question please harvey are you there go ahead with your question please please um another figure on okay what's wrong with what's wrong with marijuana legalizement one of the heaven people a lot of people have cataracts a lot of people can't see and and middle one hit their eyesight and all that thank you harvey uh jim i'll let you take that one what's what's wrong with legalizing marijuana well the one the the purpose of this amendment is to ostensibly for medicinal purposes but the problem is that the conditions that are listed there's a couple that are that are catch-all one is for chronic pain which is very tough to define or question and the other is for basically anything a physician says that they think is worthwhile well unfortunately as we've seen with opioid pill mills in mississippi and across the country unfortunately there's some doctors that for the right amount of money will give a certificate for just about anything and what concerns me as a member of the board of health and as a parent is that if we market marijuana as medicine it gives the the impression that it's okay and that it's safe and kids will think oh it's it's medicine it's okay because my buddy johnny he got the 10 joints a day because his mom signed the certificate if we want to have a debate about legalizing marijuana let's do that as a matter of fact the people who are really financing and supporting this initiative it's their pro-legalization industry i mean i think it's really important to follow the money here because almost two more than two million dollars has come from out-of-state groups or people that are associated with the marijuana industry i get a kick every time i hear uh people say this is about the politicians versus the people well the number one advocate for initiative 65 is a politician he's a businessman he's put well over a million dollars joel baumgarh into this initiative and he's on the board of directors of a venture capital fund that invests in marijuana companies it's not shocking that he has a particular interest in this the marijuana leadership campaign which is an out-of-state group has put in more than 500 thousand dollars the campia consulting group 120 000 who's the person who runs that mr campya is an advocate for legalizing ecstasy why is why is somebody named doug marks from illinois who's in the recreational pot business in illinois interested in what we do with our marijuana laws in mississippi so that's one side the other side is the mississippi hospital association who's against this the american hospital association the mississippi independent pharmacists association the mississippi pediatric group the farm bureau the mississippi board of health the mississippi municipal league the mississippi police chiefs the mississippi sheriff's association governor reeves former governor bryant mississippi federation republican women the american family association the mississippi baptist con convention the pentecostal church so these are mississippi groups and then on the other side it's pushing initiative 65 who i really fear are taking advantage of the hopes and desires of people who are hurting because they are see they see a path to making more money with constitutional protections to keep their costs low and their ability to distribute mary want marijuana wide there's got to be a better way angie before we move on i'll give you a chance to respond to that there was a lot there it was you know i've actually read both amendments and several times and you know obviously you know there's a different take on it but we have a detailed plan and you know it states and it covers so much and you know 34 other states have plans and our plan is based upon a conservative plan that has been used throughout other states and they've worked none have been rejected or are revoked and so you know i just i think that our legislators need to remember that this is about sick people people that are hurting and they need help now right away it's been 20 years that our legislators have tabled it that 20 years is too long we have sick people like my son austin who has to live in another state away from his family i've once had to have our landlord go to his house and take him to the emergency room because i wasn't able to get there in time that's painful and hurtful as a mother you mentioned the details in uh in 65 and one thing we've heard from voters is that they're confused by the language and determining the difference between the initiative and and the alternative so specifically uh the 65 when the plan you refer to actually specifies 22 qualifying conditions what are some of those debilitating uh conditions that qualify and can any others be added later or any deleted well these 22 debilitating conditions were actually doctors worked with initiative 65 and putting them onto our plan and so you know we have als we have the cachexia the chronic wasting disease we have do have chronic pain and you know when you see your child unable to walk down a stairwell because his joints are aching so badly or worrying that he could fall down the stairs having a seizure it's very alarming and epilepsy is one of the you know the debilitating conditions and we know many many children who are young and have been sent home to die where medical marijuana has given those families hope and and and has their children are actually living a quality of life and what about down the road though can how can this be altered if we needed if a condition needed to be added or subtracted from the list yeah well that the department of health is a very smart and educated department there and so they can work with doctors and doctors to you know they can go in and look at some of these and work with their patients doctors are very smart and nobody is in this to you know sell children or get them on you know a medication parents are smart and they'll put it up and take care of them you know i i i just like when you know the opposition says that you know children are going to be you know susceptible to you know obtaining this and taking it to school or different things no reasonable parent would ever allow that to happen jim unfortunately there's a lot of unreasonable parents and what we've we were looking at this because look my first reaction when i first heard about this was before it because you hear a story like angie's you want to help and and that's that's natural um but as a board of health we had to dig deeper and we had to talk to the other states to see okay what what has been your experience what has been your lessons learned here and we we do see in other states the marijuana industry marketing to kids with things like ring pots things that look like the hard candy that little kids get after a soccer game or pot tarts why are we marketing why are we marketing to kids like this when it's ostensibly for medicinal purposes and look at this the stories about people that that believe that marijuana may help them they may have in certain situations and it may haven't but you know there's a lot of diseases and hurt and pain in the world and a lot of people want to get cures wherever but every other medicine we have a process to make sure it's safe that the promise benefits are real and that the risks are recognized and have an ability to manage so why in the world would for example opioids yeah in the last couple years we realized it's a real big problem 15 20 years ago it was seen as a savior for pain in a lot of ways well thank god it's not in the constitution because now it make it a whole lot harder for us to to manage that we need to make sure that this if it's medicine treat it like medicine have a prescription be able to go to the pharmacy to get it have the fda actually approve it so that we know that we can control dosage and that here's a here's a marijuana joint that has thc of 20 here's one that has 80 what does it do what does it do to your lungs american lung association says it does damage not just your lungs but to your heart that's why we don't need to give special protections uh into this entire industry immunity to them it's both civil and criminal meaning what if we find out 10 years from now that they engaged in the same deceptive and fraudulent practices that the tobacco industry did altria who's the company that owns the marlboro man they're a 1.8 billion investor in the marijuana industry we need to be able to protect ourselves long term not just try to say i feel sorry for people hurting maybe this will help so let's put a bunch of protections into our state constitution that's not that's not the right way we've got to be smarter than this make sure we don't get scammed along the way the back to the uh debilitating conditions that qualify none are mentioned specifically in 65 a w why is that see there's several things along this way that the advocates for 65 say is a flaw and and a lot of others say it's a strength what 65 ace does is it directs the state legislature directs them to say you got to come up with a program and here are the guard rails it can't go beyond this or you know too far than here or two way too far out of the way but come up with something and that thing can be adjusted along the way you know when i met with mr bomgar a little over a year ago to talk about this and he was he was walking through the process and i said to him i said to him i said well mr bomgar i i sure wish you knew somebody in the legislature that could change a state law the most the biggest advocate of this is in the state legislature and he said well they'll never pass anything they said the same thing about the state flag how long do we hear for years oh the legislature never changed the state flag well in june they changed it it requires working together and making compromises what mr bomgar and the marijuana industry are doing with this amendment though is saying we want everything everything that we've seen that hurts our ability to make profits in other states we'll take it out of this california gives local governments the ability to opt out and say we don't want to sell it in our communities and more than two-thirds of those communities say no the bomgar amendment says no community can put any restriction on where a dispensary goes that's not compromise and that may be one of the reasons why the legislature hasn't passed a real medical marijuana program along the way we have a question that we've received on social media and a viewer asks hasn't the university of mississippi been studying marijuana for over 40 years that question's from mariposa pyget from facebook ole miss has been growing marijuana for some time i believe are you familiar with that program and how that might play into all of this yes i'm somewhat familiar with the program and you know so we we know that they have been growing since i believe the mid 60s and so that's an extensive amount of research and data that they should have there and i know that they i've heard somebody say there are thousands of pages of research and so you know i believe that by now there there should be enough research and data out there and the people who are sick and suffering who have used it in 34 other states prove that nine times out of ten this product works it helps people to have quality of life once again 34 of the states have not approved initiative 65 we have a different language and structure in our constitutional amendment than the other 34 states and on the marijuana research lab at ole miss as the board of health we had a hearing uh last december the the baumgarh group pro-initiative 65 group came and so did the people that run the research lab at ole miss and they had examined the language in issue 65 and they said it was a bad idea that it wasn't a real medical marijuana program and they're against it so let's listen to the researchers in the situation we thank you for tuning in this is a special at issue i'm wilson stribling and with me are angie calhoun with the campaign for medical marijuana 2020 jim perry who's a member of the state board of health we are examining the issue of whether medical marijuana should be legalized in the state by way of a constitutional amendment you may call us with your questions the phone lines are open now the number to call is 1-877-mpb ring that's 672-7464 and we again appreciate you all being with us this evening angie under initiative 65 what are some of the ways in which a qualifying person can actually consume marijuana well there are multiple ways and patients are different everybody is different and so yes they can smoke it there it can be processed into different forms like an oil or a distillate and that makes it to where you know it could be vaporized for my son he he doesn't smoke it he does have to vaporize it because he has chronic nausea and vomiting and we all know what that means your medicine won't stay down so no he can't eat edibles he has to inhale it which is the very quickest form of getting relief and so therefore you know it makes it it better for him and so there are many different forms you know that it can be processed into and those after it has been processed the the product will have a certificate of analysis that will be very very detailed there will be a scan code on every single product that all the person has to do is hold this phone up scan it and it will tell them exactly what is in the product if it's ten percent thc if it's five percent if it's twenty percent twenty percent is high thirty percent but people who are terminal may definitely need that we have another caller on the line with a question for us this is a rob from tupelo rob go ahead with your question please yes uh someone made the comment a while ago that uh that did the initiative 65 is is conservative so i was trying to figure out what's conservative about um restricting local municipalities the uh the constitutional right to to license zone and even regulate uh these marijuana dispensaries so so in tupelo we have great main street there so basically it sounds like initiative 65 which been has been labeled as conservative would allow a near unlimited number of marijuana dispensaries so i just want to see if that's true or not angie i'll let you go first with that one well again initiative 65 is a well-regulated amendment and a very well thought out we based again our process upon pharmacy pharmacies have to be 500 feet from schools and from churches etc and so that's we have 500 feet away from any of those uh areas and so um you know i think that you know our zoning laws are fair and that you know that's it's a good jim section 8-5 of the amendment says that no city or county can have any sort of prohibition or regulation or zoning restriction to in any way impair the sale of marijuana the reason why they did that wilson is because they saw in other states like i said earlier that local governments were saying no we don't want this in our community california oregon michigan colorado states that have what the public would think would be pretty liberal marijuana laws more than half of the local governments have opted out and the marijuana industry who helped write this and they're the biggest pushers of it they don't like that wilson i mean they they don't want that so they put in the constitutional amendment this provision section eight five and that i never would have thought that california would have a more restrictive uh marijuana law in terms of local government control than the state of mississippi and that's what would happen if initiative 65 passes so 65a what details are left to be set by the legislature does give the legislature more or input at all in the process tax rates possession limits what does the legislature do under 65a and why are such detailed decisions best left up to the legislature instead of the way 65 dictates because there's a lot we don't know and we're going to be no we're going to know more about marijuana 10 or 20 years from now than we know today and do we the caller earlier who was complaining about the ballot initiative referendum process that passed in the early 90s well today we're saying wow that's a really confusing ballot but it was caused by a constitutional amendment the legislature would be able to address issues like zoning would be able to address issues like taxation would be able to address how the how the product is marketed et cetera i met with marilyn mumba in the city council of jackson and they said wait a second you know i'm kind of for legalizing marijuana at least some of them said that but we can control where a fast food restaurant goes and how that operates but we can't control how medical marijuana dispensary operates that's crazy and that's why the mississippi municipal league bipartisan group of mayors look the mayor of oxford who's a democrat she had an op-ed in the tupelo daily journal yesterday that said i'm from medical marijuana but this isn't the right way you know let's let's let's make a better program with 65a and there's a lot of people who are in favor of the concept that want to help people like angie and her son and and hope that the data is real hope that the anecdotes actually can become evidence to give a path to that but they say this isn't this is this is a bridge too far and there's got to be a better way here so angie white is 65 not give that authority to the legislature well once again we go back to the legislators have for 20 years tabled this issue and i as a mother have lost faith in that and i know many stories of people who are tired they are tired of the legislators putting our children our loved ones lives their quality of life on the back burner and i just i feel like initiative 65 is a thorough well-thought-out plan they have covered all of the bases and other 34 other states have similar plans that it protects people it has zoning regulations we have zoning regulations and so this is why you know i just believe and know that initiative 65 is the plan for mississippi we have another question from social media this is from jacqueline temple rudder on facebook she asks can you tell me how i need to vote to vote yes for all chemotherapy patients to have access to medical marijuana would it be 65 or 65 a 65. well i think that uh under 65 um they you would that would be the way for 65 now 65a would give the legislature the ability to create a program like that and i think one thing that's important here is that if you look there's been data that shows research that shows that in other states that have created medical marijuana programs for medicinal purposes less than five percent of the users actually are cancer patients or people with glaucoma or aids the typical medical marijuana card holder in other states is a 32 year old white male with no history of illness other than a drug and alcohol program problem so let's make sure that we don't take a sledgehammer out to deal with the fly here i mean this this amendment goes way way further than trying to help people who are in need help way further because why are we doing this along the way to give all these special protections to an entire industry so that we can you know make some people say yeah this may be something that works so here's a way there's got to be a better way to do this wilson i think that's what 65a would offer for people who want a medical marijuana program for people like chemotherapy patients again on 65a there is no plan for anybody with any debilitating medical condition let's talk a little bit more about the ballot itself we talked about that some people are confused by it it's been published in some newspapers it's online we're going to take a look at it now and and angie kind of walk through with me how uh if if someone uh is ready to vote on this uh how they should go through the process the first question there is you have to vote that you want for approval of either of the initiatives or you are against both so just to initiate the process if you know you want one of these to pass you vote for for approval to start with correct and then after you've done that you have to pick 65 or 65a and obviously you would have people choose uh 65 and jim you would have them pick 65a or jim would you have them say no to the question as a whole so the interesting thing about this ballot which again i go back to the problem with putting something in the constitution because that ballot looks exactly like that is in the state constitution there was no no flexibility to the state legislature or the state election commission to come up with something different and i completely agree it is confusing which is one of the reasons why we shouldn't make policies like this in the state constitution but the for the way that this works is that the first bout the four or against will be counted and if the against happens passes if more votes people say i'm against either one of these programs then the votes for 65 or 65a doesn't matter if the four happens at that point we'll count the votes between 65 and 65a and whichever one gets the most votes will go into the state constitution if that winning ballot gets more than 40 percent of the total votes cast in the overall election which is most likely to be the presidential election confusing isn't it that's where it gets secret so maybe we shouldn't have put this in the state constitution kind of like we shouldn't put a marijuana program in it but so the the issue here is that if you don't want to run the risk of putting anything in like some people feel very strongly you don't vote for anything on the second ballot i view it as a way that i have two chances to beat 65 i'm going to vote against on the first one then i'm going to vote for 65a instead of 65 because 65a puts this issue and gives direction to the state legislature i heard governor reeves on the radio this morning say well i mean the 65a passes it's directed that way we got to do something about it i heard speaker of the house gun say the same thing and that is effectively a direction of the legislature you need to create a real medical marijuana program so i would encourage people to vote against on the first one because my preference is that nothing should be in the state constitution along these lines let the legislature deal with it but 65a is a much better way than 65 so against in 65a and that's where that's an interesting point too because even if you you would think that if you vote no on the first question that you're against both of these uh in in the according to the constitution you still get to choose okay i'm voting no but if one of them has to pass i pick this one so you can still vote no on the first question and pick one of the initiatives down below angie would you like to respond to what jim just said yes as a parent i find it really hard jim to stomach that he would vote no for both because that tells me that you do not support medical marijuana and that we will never ever have a bill brought upon from our legislators it won't happen and that's why i am supporting initiative 65. it is a thorough plan it has facts and it will implement and be up and running by august of next year and so there are no dates i appreciate that but as a parent i also know that the actual science and data from the national institutes of health from the national academy of science the journal of neuroscience research evidence there is no doubt that smoking marijuana even one or two joints before the age of 25 poses real risk to kids and this is something that is being marketed as medicine that has real harm and real risk and real danger so why is it a measure of my compassion to say whether or not i want to help when this is a the real question is is there a better way to help that wouldn't along the way create real risk for a lot of other kids and this isn't just about kids this is about the entire population of the state that is going to add burden on law enforcement because there's no reliable test for drug driving it's going to add burden on the mental health system but you know what we don't get any extra tax revenue to pay for those things that's some of the many flaws that are actually in the actual language of the constitutional amendment and that's why it's just not the right not the right way to go about trying to help people who do need help and do need help managing their pain or other diseases at the tax point because the taxes in 65 don't go to the state legislature to the state coffers they go where they will go to the department of health to administer the program to administer the program correct all right we have another caller on the line uh madeleine from past christian is with us madeleine go ahead with your question please hi um yeah so i wanted to know for people who don't have strong opinions either way like whether to pass it or not to pass it what will be the economic benefit for the state of mississippi like you just mentioned that the taxes will go to the state health department to run the program but will the state see any other benefits thank you madalyn angie did you want to take that first yes that would be fine the the thing is this is medical marijuana we're not talking about recreational so therefore this is for the patients it's for sick people and so therefore we do not feel at all that sick people should pay an extra tax they shouldn't be tax burdened we don't sales tax our pharmaceuticals prescription drugs so therefore why should we tax medical marijuana patients who are already suffering but it does call for a tax to be levied on the product right that whatever the maxing out whatever the state sales tax level is that is you know a fee that can be added on up to seven percent an equivalent of the sales tax which will actually go back to the department of health to help them with the rules and regulations and to keep this program running i think the wilson the problem with this situation is that yes we don't tax prescription drugs in mississippi but this isn't a prescription there is no prescription for marijuana it's illegal under federal law there's no control ability to control dosage there's no ability to control consistency that that's that's what you get with a prescription go to a pharmacy you're not going to go to a pharmacy to get this marijuana you're going to go to a a dispensary for it and the concern that we have is that two of those conditions in that list of 22 are wide enough that you can drive a truck through it when somebody goes to the doctor and says i have pain they show you that pain chart with the smiley face at the top and the frown at the bottom where is it on the list if i say 10 you can't doubt it how do you measure that if i go in and find a doctor like you do with these opioid pill mills sure yeah dispensary here doctor right here here's your certificate you go and and that's the concern that it's going to increase societal costs that we're going to have to pay for it it's going to increase burden on cities but they don't get any revenue out of this it's going to be an increased burden on law enforcement there's no extra revenue for that increased burden on mental health and while we know there's an increased burden on mental health because we've seen in other states that there's an increased use of marijuana in the state and we know from the data and the science and the experts like the institute of medicine national institutes of health national academy of science journal of neuroscience that there's an increased risk for psychosis and schizophrenia but we don't have a way to pay for that so that is a big concern of us and the flaw the actual language and the amendment another caller on the line now troy is with us from greenwood troy go ahead with your question first of all i'd like to thank you all for providing this forum for us to share our ideas and and our concerns i'm definitely going to vote for 65 and that's a new thing for me there's no way in the world that i want to give this to the legislature because what they're going to do is build up a system around it now i know we're talking about the medical aspects of it but the black and brown community have been devastated by these draconian marijuana laws and i hope that this leads to a discussion on how we deal with it from a recreational standpoint not so much that i want it but i'm tired of the legal system having such a precedence in the upbringing of our and the impact that it has on our community now we had no problem with uh making gambling legal alcohol is legal which alcohol is really the gateway drug to all these other things and then we're looking at uh then cigarettes are legal you can go and buy alcohol jello shots at the corner store in our community now do not please ladies and gentlemen allow anybody to take away your freedoms if we send this to the legislature the first time you cross the street with it and you do something wrong outside of what they say is introduction for you into the criminal justice system this is bigger than just the medical aspects of it it's talking about how do we go about uh dealing with a drug that is so pervasive in our community but yet still the black and brown community suffered the most negative impact from it especially when it comes to the criminal justice society thank you so much troy thank you go ahead john some of that because i agree with a lot of the points that troy made there and it's actually one of the real concerns i have with the way that this amendment can be structured is that worry that's going to create two classes of drug laws for people in mississippi insurance doesn't pay for this and it costs a couple hundred dollars an ounce to get marijuana so it's an all-cash business because also under federal law banks can't really service these these industries so if you're rich enough to afford the cash business and you're well connected enough to get a doctor who'll give you the certificate you can get your marijuana you can say i have pain and it's legal for you if you're not rich enough and you're not well connected enough well you're much more likely to get your marijuana off the street where it's actually less expensive because you got to add in the the regulatory cost and the seven percent fee et cetera so you're more likely to get there and you're still at risk of ending up in the criminal justice system let's say you end up you live in public housing you're a poor person you live in public housing it doesn't matter if you have a medical marijuana card wilson because it's against federal law to have any kind of marijuana and be in public housing so you resolution your home even though it's in our state constitution that you can you can have it it is a great concern to me that you're going to end up having a situation where if you're rich enough and well connected enough yours is legal and if you're poor once again we end up there's a lot unfortunately a lot of history in our state and around the country in america of having drug laws that are discriminatory and racist and i'm worried that once again in the interest of trying to do the right thing we're going to end up creating a system that ends up doing the wrong thing and hurts the poorest among us angie let you respond well wilson you know people try to put a lot of fear in this and a lot of issues have been erased are risen about this but you know people should have the right black or white red or yellow to have a choice to choose what works for their body and this is a natural medicine it's been shown over and over through people that have used it and you know we they we need to make sure that this is made available for patients with debilitating health conditions it's a struggle for all of us and i would suggest and i know um you know with my son i've you know gone through this process of how you get medical marijuana because we obviously did for him or he he did so you know my son had a three-way ring binder plus another folder full of doctors reports and so we made an appointment with a medical marijuana doctor we went to see him the doctor established a relationship with my son he talked to him he would not allow me to speak for my son he needed to establish that relationship he made copies of the folder the binder and he saw austin's report for epilepsy which we know is you know one of the 22 debilitating conditions he saw the gastroenterology diagnosis so therefore you know you don't walk in to see a medical marijuana doctor and just say my knee's hurting today can i get a prescription that's just not the way it's done and other states have a lot of restricting restrictions and the doctors can lose their license and so you know we don't want they don't want that to happen so therefore after he established a relationship with austin he went through his files he then sent to the department of health a certification that austin qualified for a medical marijuana card and so once austin got the card in a timely manner he was able then to go to a dispensary dispensaries are not ugly that um you know the opposition makes it out like it's some horrible place to go and so when we walk in the door there are actually two rooms the first one and there's security cameras there they scan your your driver's license and your medical marijuana card that has an id system in it and so it's being tracked so that we know how much you have and then you will wait until a knowledgeable sales person comes to get you and they go in there one-on-one with you the patient is not able to touch any product is behind glass and and in this state the products boxes are there but the products themselves are not even in the glass they're in another room that is safe and secure with the person who will then after the salesperson has asked you multiple questions about you know what your pains or your nausea and vomiting your epilepsy and they will suggest certain products for you and then they have someone go to the back seal the product in a tamper resistant bag put the label on it so you are not in transit with an open container basically so control process when you're when you're following the rules and it's done uh legally and absolutely we have a another question from social media this is from brian mitchell on youtube he says or asks if either passes would it have an impact on a person's past criminal record for possession do you know the answer to that uh no i mean this is this is not about there's a there are a lot of good arguments in mississippi has decriminalized marijuana in many ways and there's lots of debates about criminal justice reform there's lots of debates about other drug laws and changing them and those are worthwhile debates that's not what this is this is about a a different a different issue and i think it's important to keep it focused on that we don't have a lot of time left but i do want to ask you jim we mentioned the 34 other states that have made made it legal have they all gone the wrong direction different states have different programs and i think that you've seen then states that have put it in statute that they make changes oklahoma which has a similar program gave a lot more flex some states put it in the constitution but then the constitutional amendment they give the legislature the ability to change things that's what's happening in oklahoma right now uh it's impossible to say that every state's done it right every state's done it wrong but it what it does say is that you see a lot of states making changes to programs along the way and with our amendment it's so specific and that pro 65 say that's a good thing and i respect that i disagree i don't think it's that good to be that prescriptive in the state constitution and we've seen in other states they've had to make adjustments along the way which would be very very hard for us to do with 65 and i would just say on the other hand 65 a is so vague that there are no guarantees at all that it will ever pass and that there will be any legitimate rules and regulations that will benefit people with debilitating health conditions who are suffering so you worry that if it were tied up with the legislature that it would be tied up there essentially forever potentially yes sir what about um the the the uh the idea though of of the legislature having some control do you do you think that the health department should have full control over over how this is done many states do have their department of health oversee the medical marijuana program now you know if i believe again that our department of health board such as jim and dr dobbs they are extremely bright people and i i have full faith that they would be able to run this program adequately no i would say look if this passes and i'm as you can tell i'm passionate against it i think it's a bad policy bad approach if it passes we're going to do our absolute best to implement it right because the people have spoken and may try to make it work i think it's going to be hard the way it's written but the one there's one aspect of the constitutional amendment that says that the money that we get to run it will be spent by the department of health without any legislative appropriation or authorization and that takes the governor and legislature completely out of it so an unelected appointed board would be completely in charge we thank

candidates for congress and how we select our statewide officials we thank you for joining us and have a good night [Music]", "6JSmZdTrJgA": "cycle so come on in here take a look at the different plants what we have here is something special you know girl oh hi oh is a level one cultivator in the first ever processor in the state of Ohio it's we're able to cultivate and produce medical marijuana here in the state of Ohio that will help patients that are struggling with some of the different qualifying medical conditions in the state we have two non negotiables and that's quality and quality and the artisan grow that we have in our approach back there with that labor pool you're talking about hand watering you're talking about eleven part nutrient mix there's a lot of folks that use an A and B you're talking about a rigorous training program of schwozzam the plant or d fanning the plant of its leaves so that all that energy can be channeled then you look at how we're set up our framework to where we have individual flowering rooms that really allow the focus in on the plant it's much more artisan and focused in the return on that labor is your yields where a lot of folks will sit at the quarter pound of plant you're already north of one pound so you've you know quadrupled that output to where that labor is gonna pay for itself and you're keeping with CM County and surrounding folks employed gainfully with benefits in the way that we do it is in such a way that we have kind of perpetual harvest so that we're not just harvesting once every month or two months we have rolling harvest so that we're getting the freshest plant material to the dispensaries for patients to to select in to purchase the reality is quads one and two you're looking at roughly eight thousand pounds in the first year you're looking at a hundred and forty four plants per room to where you're gonna have a harvest when this is fully operational every two to three days right now we're taking down a room every week to two weeks to where you're already at that over one pound a plant threshold that many in the market try to achieve for years we're already there so the yields are there the quality's there now it's just a matter of converting it either into sellable plant material or into the seeing facility that we're gonna process manufactured goods but I think folks are starting to wake up to see not only the medical efficacy of the drug but to see that there's ways that it can be regulated the first thing when I get in front of folks they'll say there's a right way and a wrong way to do this and I think that we're part of the right way in the right solution and that's in a regulated environment that's in one where the product that goes out is safe it's reliable and it's predictable it's one where it can be tested and it's one where the patients that are taking the product you know they know that hey what went in this is a lot different than the black market maybe I've participated in everybody thinks that every marijuana plant is the same and it couldn't be further from the truth you know when you're looking at cannabinoid profiles you're looking at the Terrapins of an individual strain that's all very important and slowly but surely you know the medical community they're doing more studies around that and so some of that data is becoming available whereas maybe you know CBD the cannabinoid helps treat child's seizures or some of the other qualifying medical conditions whereas if you're suffering from anxiety or something else listed in statute may be THC a higher THC strain is right for you so it's not just the put a seed in a and a pot and let it grow and let's sell medical marijuana it's more let's sell the right medical marijuana that's going to contain the right percentages to treat patients and then it all goes back to that awareness that if they're aware of that then they can identify what strain is right for them and proceed to kind of treat the conditions that they're suffering from rohi was the name of our LLC that is what has got us here to take it to the next level we've chosen the brand butterfly effect the reason was you can see the logo behind me the W and grow high was originally the butterfly which you know stands for tranquility healing ultimately peace of mind and really we took it to a step higher to where you have the butterfly effect where one flap of the butterfly's wings can have you know such magnitude of changes down the road and that's really what we hope to have here is that something you know that might seem as insignificant enough as a cultivation facility here in Muskegon County can really transcend not only the stigma but help patients across the board change their lives which we think doing here", "tcI2fpWgdWc": "good morning everybody and welcome back to your lunch break live my name is ivana if you are new here and if you're not thank you for coming back today is thursday february the 25th and it's been a really newsworthy week but something that we haven't touched on this week and maybe not at all this month is the legislature now we know that the alabama legislature is in session and there's a couple of bills that are getting a lot of talk about this time around but there's two in particular that always seem to be coming up in the legislature and also always seem to be big talking points and those two are one a lottery and number two medical marijuana now both of these are hot topics i've got our own mike cason here who has covered the legislature for quite a while and he is very knowledgeable on these two bills and also what has happened in the past when they have been brought before the house in the senate so mike thanks for coming on giving us a little bit of an explanation about these two bills and uh and how they could be different this year oh thank you thank you for having me i have uh now i've got a couple of things that i've written down here from your story yesterday about the medical marijuana which we're going to link here in our comment thread but i think that the biggest thing to note is the medical marijuana bill passed in the alabama senate now it goes on to the alabama house of representatives and that is where its fate is unclear mike so can you walk us through number one what this bill says and number two if it's past the senate what is likely to happen to it when it gets to the house okay it's a it's a would create a big program it would be they call it a seed to sale uh medical cannabis program which means it would regulate the cultivation the production the transportation the testing and the use of medical marijuana products which would have to be made in alabama grown and made in alabama uh it would not it would not allow any smokeable materials or raw plant materials they would have to be like tablets or capsules and that sort of thing and it would uh create a medical cannabis commission that would oversee all this the doctors would have to would have to take a little training uh see a little training it's like a four hour course and pass the test to be able to to uh recommend uh medical marijuana and then there's a there's a long list of conditions that they could they could recommend it for it's not considered a prescription uh i guess because it's not an fda approved drug so it would be a recommendation and then the patient could go to one of this dispensaries the legislation also creates dispensaries that will be licensed that patients could go there and buy the medical marijuana products it would be taxed uh i think it's a nine percent sales tax to cover the cost of all the regulations so it's a mat it would be a massive program and talking about this program like you said these would not be smokable materials these would not be oils these would be in forms of tablets capsules things of that nature and i think when you said this will be a big program we've got a lot of people that say look this could just be a really money making type program this could be something for for big pharma for pharmacies to get involved with now i do believe that it had mentioned in your story about insurance and the fact that insurance would probably not cover this but what is the the money looking like on that side of this bill uh well the medical cannabis commission would license all the various all the companies that are involved in the various stages of production transportation sales um and so companies would compete for those licenses uh so people would make money off of it so um you know i guess it's just a matter of how how well that's regulated but it would be it would be a for-profit industry with a lot of competition now i know that the person who introduced this bill he is a uh in the state legislature and he is the same man he is a medical doctor and a medical researcher and he is the same person who has introduced this bill before so is this bill the exact same as it's been in years past or is there anything different uh it's essentially the same bill that passed the senate last year it's been tweaked just a little bit i think but uh when senator nelson first introduced it two years ago it passed the senate the house instead of passing it created a study commission they worked for like a year senator nelson was on it a number of doctors lawyers others they came up with our report i think that was in december 2019 and he used that report to sort of update his bill and that's what he had last year and it's essentially the same bill this year what is the or what was the issue in the last two years when this bill got to the got to the house why did it not pass the house uh i don't know of any one specific issue it's just there's just uh there's just a lot of reluctance in the house or has been um the house has just not been as accepting of it i can't give any one specific reason uh maybe they're just there's just a more conservative majority in the in the house perhaps but um uh i know there's a number of former law enforcement people in the house uh speaker mccutcheon is a former police officer i don't know if that's a factor uh senator nelson asked him that yesterday and he said he didn't think that was that was the reason the bill had not passed the house and he is he is optimistic he thinks he has more support in the house this year because he thinks mainly he thinks people are more familiar with with medical marijuana and more families and they know people relatives friends who who could possibly benefit from it and they people just they know more about it it's you know it's been around 36 states have it now so familiarity is is going to help his case he believes now and in this bill it only took about 15 minutes for the alabama senate to pass it and the bill is specifically to regulate the production sales and the use of medical marijuana again in a tablet or capsule form but that that uh language i think has some people a little bit bothered because they say look if you're going to pass it why are we only doing it in these capsules in these uh in these a combined capsule and tablet but then these tablets or capsules etc was there any uh any changes to this bill that only made it in those forms or has the bill always been just for capsules tablets uh it's always been that but it's a little bit broader than that it's capsules tablets uh liquids uh patches uh suppositories so there's like 10 different forms you couldn't have anything smokable or vapeable uh you can't have an oil or liquid you would put it in an inhaler and you could not have any food prod you couldn't have cookies or anything that you eat with cannabis in it but there's a lot of different forms that would be available now we know that this this bill would allow doctors to recommend the medical marijuana products for a range of conditions some that you know in your story were anxiety nausea chronic pain and sleep disorders it would also create a commission to regulate the sale of this and create as you mentioned a minute ago those dispensaries and patients would get a card essentially a card that said that that was their recommendation by their doctor do we know how that would work yet or is it too early in this process to know exactly the the nitty-gritty of that process um well i believe you just have to get authorization from your doctor to get a card and um the the cannabis commission is going to set up a process to you know to to to give out those cards and then you would take your card to a dispensary and buy your products um you'd have to be at least 19 years old or a caregiver or a caregiver an adult could could get access to to the products for a minor uh i believe um yeah but that's uh i guess there's additional details to be worked out on that do you have any idea when this is going to go before the house uh no uh it could be as early as next week or it could be later in the session but uh it will you know first have to go to a house committee it's never even come out of a house committee before so that'll be the first step to uh to clear a house committee before it could get to the floor for a vote which has never happened in the house if this bill did go through the house they did sign off on it it would then go to the governor's desk and we would await a signature uh or a veto from the governor but it would not go to a vote is that correct that's right it wouldn't require a vote of the people like the lottery it's not a constitutional amendment interesting uh interesting fact to make there looking through some of these comments and uh we'll link like i said mike's story here so you can read all about it but yes the the forms of these are tablets capsules other things like patches oils suppositories those types of medication but not in a smokeable or vapeable form um not sure vapeable is a word but i guess it is now i guess it is in this in this bill uh now let's pivot just a minute and talk about another controversial bill that is before the legislature again and that is a lottery now these two bills i know i mentioned earlier always talked about always controversial but mike i i think that some people do say is this a turning of the tide do we see some of these very uh very conservative lawmakers either changing their minds or kind of as some people would say getting with the program or getting with 2021 and allowing a little bit of these uh these more or less conservative ideas we can say come through yes i think that could be happening to some extent uh you know it's a long way to the finish line for the lottery and casino bill which is you know the legislature's not even been able to pass a lottery bill in over 20 years so a bill with lottery and casinos uh is a heavy lift but senator marsh is is just confident he's got the votes to pass to get it through the senate and i've not heard anybody really say he's wrong about that um so he's trying to be real he's being very uh careful about trying to get everybody's input uh one of the comments he made was i'm not asking anybody's permission but i'm getting everybody's input so uh he's really trying to get it in a form that it's gonna pass and then and then we'll go to the house and they'll you know they'll they'll want to change it uh but yeah to answer your question i think it's i think people are more open to the idea of a expansion of gambling in alabama well obviously the governor is she appointed that study commission and the governor said during her state of the state just we can benefit from this if it's done the right way that was a change for her she's never been a proponent of gambling she's not you know cheerleading for it now but she's she's acknowledging that we're not getting any benefit from the way things are now and states around us are i think all of us know somebody maybe even we are that person that drives across state lines to buy those lottery tickets to buy those scratch off tickets and things or to gamble to go to a casino now tell us what this lottery bill exactly entails what kind of gambling would be allowed well the lottery would be a lottery like other states have you'd have the you could play the multi-state lottery games like the powerball and mega millions scratch off tickets uh the lottery the net revenue would go to college scholarships primarily community college scholarships aimed at uh the jobs that are in high demand in industry like the automotive industry in alabama uh there's not nearly enough people to fill those jobs now and that's over you know over the next 10 years or so that's going to be a major task for the state to to have a qualified workforce uh it would also uh students who want to go to four-year colleges and become math or science teachers could also get scholarships now all this is subject to change but that's what the way the bill has it now the money from the casinos would be would go to uh one of the first big recipients would be to expand broadband access across the state which is going to be really expensive and i think uh i think billion dollars funneled to that over time and then the general state general fund would receive a lot of that money and rural health care mental health care uh there'd be some for cities and counties and it's divvied up a lot of ways uh but senator march has tried to be real specific about about that it's all spelled out in the bill but as i said it's subject to change all those specifics are in there now you talk about the lottery about the different multi-state games and things of that nature what about the what kind of role do casinos play into this bill and do they at all and i do want to quickly say i think we've lost your uh your video but we can hear you fine so we're stuck on a little picture of you but i just want everybody to know we do have your audio so um i'll let you talk about the the casinos well the bill is written now would would allow five casinos there would be one in each of the state's greyhound tracks which are in birmingham mobile greene county and in macon county and then there would be a fifth casino in northeast alabama either in jackson or dekalb county and that would be run by the porch band of creek indians so that's five casinos and then uh the plan encourages the governor to enter a compact with the porch band where they can also have full-fledged casinos at the three resorts they have now which are at more winter in montgomery which now you can only play electronic bingo there i think the state if voters approve casino gambling they the state has to essentially has to enter a deal with the porch creeks to allow them to have that also uh so that would so in assets the state would have eight casinos and um including the five new ones senator martial would those include table games yes table games blackjack uh everything you know everything you think of that a casino has roulette slot machines i uh we we we all know somebody who who loves to go to casinos and i know that something that a big i'm not i've never been a real big gambler i just am not that i don't have that adrenaline in me to be okay with that but i know that table games are something that people who do really advocate for casinos do advocate for gambling are very uh they say look if you're going to have the slot machines if you're going to have everything else why not have the table game so very interesting that this bill would allow that right that's a big draw for your i mean that's although uh the the study commission governor ivey appointed on gambling pointed out that most the casinos make most of their money off the slot machines but the tourists and uh the tourism factor and as you said the table games are a big attraction and big money maker too well i know i had a grandmother who loved the slot machines so you know those are those are a big draw for a lot of people um a quick question for you mike a couple of people asking about the insurance part of the medical marijuana bill now we know again that's passed in the senate not gone through the house yet it has not had much luck in the house over the past couple years but in the event it did have luck in the house and it did wind up on the governor's desk what does the insurance part of this look like uh there would be no requirement for insurance to cover uh to cover medical marijuana products so i guess that would be up to individual insurance companies whatever coverage they wanted to provide but there would be nothing to require them to do that and there's a lot of uh protections built in for businesses such as uh you could an employer could refuse to hire somebody because they're a medical marijuana user our employee would not our employer would say if you're going to use medical marijuana you can't work for me it's as i said that's the sponsor of the bill describe that as protections for businesses in other words no business would be in a position where they have to have an employee allow an employee to use medical marijuana or hiring employee that uses medical marijuana um that's that was part of the bill that is that's an interesting um that's an interesting part of that that we'll we'll have to dig a little bit more in maybe later on but i do have one uh one more question for you this is about talking about tourists and coming to alabama for casinos and saying well if it's in one area why would i come so let's just i want to give you a chance to repeat those locations you named a minute ago that were named in that lottery bill that if these if this lottery bill passed if these casinos were built where they would be oh they would be at the state's four greyhound tracks which in birmingham mobile green county and macon county and the fifth would be in northeast alabama either in jackson or dekalb county uh the senator marshall's considered said he was considering changing the bill to allow seven casinos that would be one in each with one in each congressional district so that would open up the possibility of one in southeast alabama uh and another one in north alabama and can you tell us one more time where the money would go we've got a lot of people saying would that money go to education the money from the uh casinos would would not go to education it would go to uh uh rural broad expansion of rural broadband the state general fund uh health care rural health care mental health care and a lot of other there's a lot of other uh places that it's that would go cities and counties would get a small share um the money from the lottery would go to college scholarships so it does go to education good points to make there again we're going to leave mike's coverage on both the medical marijuana bill and on the lottery bill here in the comment thread i do have to say i had somebody asking about your internet saying you needed better internet but let me tell you mike is actually at the state capitol so you know we're gonna we're gonna put the internet on them here i'm not gonna put it on mike so mike thank you so much for all of your information here we're gonna be keeping up with it i know you said that there's not a specific day that medical marijuana that we know of it's going to hit the house do we know anything about the lottery bill the timeline for that uh it's expected to come back up in about two weeks in the senate so middle of next month it sounds like so maybe in march we will have an update for everybody on these bills hopefully and if not uh here in just a couple weeks so mike thank you so much again for for all of your expertise here we really appreciate it everybody thank you for watching thank you for commenting we'll see you tomorrow", "Uto2npyMJ44": "the existing infrastructure that you see in arizona is the is the basis upon which recreational customers will be served thus making the transition easier and faster a little pop in the cartridge and usually the pop goes away and you're all set other than that it's ready to go for you i'll put it in the right so if you look at a store like this there aren't going to be a lot of differences between what you see today and what you see when rec sales start you will have to have as a store the ability to check identification like you would at a bar but other than that there aren't a lot of significant changes the way that it'll work for a recreational customer they'll come in they'll present a government-issued identification they'll be admitted to the store the only difference between what happens at that point between them and a medical customer is the 16 percent excise tax that they pay at the cash register the reason that we didn't allocate money to k-12 is our economist tells us that we're going to raise 300 million dollars per year that doesn't fill the gap that we see at k2 k-12 so we were actually asked to stay away the education folks said it will look like we don't have a problem if we have that revenue coming in and so we we allocated the money to places where we could actually solve problems and so when we looked at community colleges and we looked at what's happened to their budgets over the past few years that was a place where clearly we could actually solve a problem by january 19th the department of health services will accept applications from existing operators in good standing from that time on january 19th they have 60 days to make a determination about that application so we can expect to see sales starting from stores like this end of march early april while we do anticipate that there may be a legal challenge or two when you look at how lopsided the vote was we're really confident that those legal issues are going to turn out the right way", "mgJxilIZjPY": ">>> >>> WHILE >>> WHILE THOUSANDS >>>

"now there's been um a lot of conversation quite recently surrounding the legislation and access to medical cannabis in ireland over the past number of years and on wednesday we spoke to um alicia maher here on lunchtime live who'd moved to alicante in spain in order to try and access cannabis sally has also got in contact with us here on news talk this afternoon sally why did you get in touch with us i kind of agreed with that lady because i felt so sorry for her because i uh how would have similar issues with pain and i find that every now and again i would take i would smoke cannabis now actual smokers because it really does help relieve the pain and inflammation that i feel in my back my back is quite bad and my i'd have i have ms for a few few years and i just find that i'm an adult i'm able to make my own decisions i'm able to go down and buy alcohol if i want if i want to buy 20 cigarettes i can you know so i just think it's it's a time that we had the agile conversation that we say look people should be able to make their own choices like they do in netherlands and denmark and places like that but you could go in and buy cannabis if you're an adult now i know there are downsides to cannabis like for instance the paranoia and um you know there's long-term effects of memory loss but quite honestly i'm in my fifties now so i have enough memory loss going on anyway uh lots of iq etc and sometimes cannabis can cause um schizophrenia in people and i do know people that that has happened to but from my own point of view my own perspective when you're in pain all day um the only thing you can think of is pain the dream and in order for me to be able to function on a normal level and when my kids come in from school and to be quite you know to be not in pain to be able to get up and do stuff we have to go for a walk do the normal things that normal people can do every day i do find that if sometimes you smoke a little bit of cannabis that it does help now i have tried the cannabis oil but the cannabis oil takes so long to get into the system it just doesn't have the same effect and i'm not going around stoned before you know i'd only have i wouldn't even weigh in weighing scales but i smoke um it's only like a little tiny pot in in a little tiny proper pot that you use and it it doesn't um like i'm not going around highs quite around that i would say just if my husband comes in evening i would say he wouldn't even notice that i've had any to be honest so this is this is to this is for you sally to try and deal um with the pain that that you're in can you try and give us an insight into the extent of that and well for instance now for the last i'd say 10 weeks my back i have three bullet juice in my back um and i've been to see a chiropractor i've been to several chiropractors actually i've been to acupuncture i go for a physio every every say four weeks to keep on top of it so i try everything to always to not be taking um painkillers all the time because because if you take too much i'm already on a check video for the ms so if i'm putting sulfate in the top of that it's an extra toxicity that i'm putting into my body so it makes it makes me feel sick any any extra tablets i take i feel sick my stomach feels sick so it's a knock-on effect so therefore my logic is well if i smoke a bit of cannabis i'm not kind of adding to the what's already there and it would cut it must relax my muscles and relax and the fact that it's the fact that it's you know not allowed for for recreational use does it yeah does it bother you that you're oh yes just because i just think that it should be that not for recreation it says like i have young kids so i wouldn't like to see my kids smoking it because it does have long-term effects but i'm in my 50s now i have a long-term illness where i'm trying to cope with pain every day and trying to keep life normal as possible for them you", "-xtuqhtZjJk": "[Music] all right so welcome back to this week's uh installment of green enterprise which is a partnership between my company digital venture partners and black enterprise where every week we speak with a black and brown uh cannabis entrepreneurs and executives who i feel like are building their company and representing our demographic the right way in cannabis this week we have the founder of greenline uh delivery uh terence taylor how you doing today my brother good good happy to be here yeah yeah i appreciate you coming on man just me even me myself i'm relatively new in the cannabis i've only been in it for about two years but you were one of the first few people who i really got to see you know how you maneuvered into space and how you positioned yourself to be successful and i think you have a really um valuable vantage point that you can share with the with the average talent who wants to come into the space so i would love to kind of get an idea on your back story and you know how you positioned yourself to even be successful before you came into cannabis uh uh let's talk about pre-cannabis and how i got into it how i transitioned in yeah like kind of your qualifications what you were doing before you got into this and you know what kind of sharpening yeah now is to be able to succeed so my backstory is i was i played ball i was a athlete college scholarship all that got drafted playing ball when that was over i got into the car business so this was baseball or baseball yeah okay yeah i got drafted by the red sox and then uh after that man i got into the car business and it's about 2006 2007 i was a car dealer i had a little used car dealership which was going pretty good but what ended up happening at that time we had a recession hit so we had a bunch of cars that we want to sell a bunch of customers i want to buy and uh we didn't have the banks to merge and get those loans to make a long story short i had a buddy that i was working with and he introduced us to prop 215 medical cannabis at that time um and that's how we got in uh hooked up with this attorney scott candel he was in like uh marin county in the bay area he put a collective together for me and i was going to start out with a dispensary but the problem was at that time you could put a bunch of money into a dispensary and any day it could get kicked in door kicked in and whatever you put in is just up in smoke so i wanted to go to the delivery model uh yeah man my first i put up an ad on craigslist in 2008. i saw my first couple ounces and i was hooked from that day on uh we later got on with wii maps and we've been rocking ever since man okay so i would love for you to kind of give an introduction in what is the delivery model and what are some of the regulations that you have to follow as a delivery company in california right now oh well it's a lot of tracking tracking inventory um basically everything you buy from wholesale is tracked all your sales for the day have to be tracked um and you got to keep up with your taxes you got to separate your excise from your sales tax with city tax so those are some of the biggest things um and then you got the regular things that any other business has with making sure you're profitable making sure nobody's stealing inventory management all those type of things okay what's your what's your what type of license did you acquire from the state of california because as we know it's like you have retail you have delivery you have cultivation what's like how did what did you have to get in order to be able to structure your business how you have it now so originally it was just a delivery license um but with that i started finding out what the limitations were when you just have a delivery license um so i went back and i applied for a micro business license and the micro business license from what i understand it is three tiers and the three tiers that i chose were retail delivery manufacturing and distribution and uh the reason why i did that is because moving into prop 215 i created a brand of products um the loud brands we got a bunch of pre-rolls and uh i needed to be able to manufacture those products in-house and then i needed to distribute them from my facility to other shops so that's what made the most sense for me to have a micro business and a lot of people um who aren't really familiar with the ins and out of cannabis they feel like once you have acquired a license it's just some magic million dollar ticket or multi-million dollar business venture when really you have to work to sustain that model and make sure that you stay on the right side of the regulation so what some of the things that people don't know that happens once you get your license that could you know possibly have it taken away or you have a strike on your license what are the things as an operator that you have to make sure that you are staying on top of well number one once you get a license that's just allowing you to be in business now you got to run a business right and you you have to run a profitable successful business and that's hard in itself you got to follow certain rules you you can only buy these products from certain from these people that's licensed and if you don't you're gonna get slapped on the wrist and you do it again you're gonna get your license taken and your privileges is out of the game i mean this is a corporate business now and the thing is you if you got to have funding to be able to afford to do all these things you got to have the capital to have a staff and pay for all these people and all those things go into running a successful business what's the process or what general advice would you have for somebody who says you know i want to get funded you know what are some of the things you have to have in order you know like a a financial model a business plan things such as that what do you what would you recommend to position themselves to get funded uh we haven't been funded we did all this ourselves um but uh so i can't really answer that question 100 uh everything that we did is homegrown is you know independent um so i can't answer that question no no i appreciate that i think that's the reality that most of us really have to face and we don't want to we feel like some magic investor or some magic company gonna come along with the five million dollar check and that's just not reality you gotta figure out how to do it uh in my first year i did have somebody come along and they wanted to buy the license out for i think a little over nine hundred thousand dollars but i turned that down just because it was like what i'm gonna do after that what else what am i gonna acquire another license and do it all over again and and i just i believed in what i'm doing that i can make more than 900 thousand dollars you have um a model where you actually empower other minority founders and businesses to kind of operate in partnership with you kind of how did you come up with um that that business model and what are some of the things you look for for a company before you partner with them um and if you can mention some of your partners to for foreign yeah but it really kind of just happened organically um i was in this space and i was operating doing what i was doing and i was running loud brands and then uh lobo reached out to me i guess they had another partnership that kind of fell through and really it was just me giving them a shot and trusting them that they could come in and do what they was going to do i was honest with them i told them what it was i kept my word and it was they've been successful in the space and uh the same thing happened with gas houses kind of just from me just being in the industry being one of the few brown people or black people in the industry i just started meeting felix or seeing felix at different locations um i start from the delivery side i start buying product from the cohong that's where gas house used to be at so i met them there i started seeing them at different events with like metal and stuff like that and i just talked to them and eventually just it worked and they just like yo let's make a deal let's come over let's work together we hoping to get another uh a few more equity brands over here to come work with us because i think what we're building is something special yeah i definitely agree you guys were some of the first um brands who really gave me the opportunity to kind of see how y'all operated see how y'all maneuver day to day and i really don't know many other brands who are operating that efficiently right with the with the um integrity that you guys actually operate with but i would love for you to kind of talk about what the the climate is in oakland in the bay area to even have a successful brand because we look at that as kind of the mecca of cannabis right especially in our culture like what do you have to show as a loud brand as a lobo as a gas house to even survive in the face of so much competition in the bay i mean it's it's hard you got to have number one you got to have a product that people respond to right i mean honestly that's the last thing right because the hard part is actually meeting the right buyers and getting in there in their space and making introductions and being able to just get your product in front of people that's the hard part luckily i mean gas houses gas house they've been in this space forever um and logo um one of the big things that lobo did was a lot of the collabs like collaborating with other brands um and it's in some some cases like bigger brands and letting them do the advertising and marketing and because they have budgets for that we independent people we got to focus our our funds in certain areas so that was a good thing for for lobo like partnering with some of the collabs that it just blew the brand up previously you were talking about how you're expanding to from california and arizona and becoming a multi-state operator what was what was it about the arizona market specifically that made you um interested in it and um if i'm uh correct me if i'm mistaken arizona's medical right now right it's not adult use yet um really because for me i went to school there i went i know a lot of people in arizona i'm from spent a lot of time there and then number two it's about to go uh wreck there i think it's been on the ballot and so we just we figured from just a business standpoint that uh if we're there and we just have a head start on the on the market before it goes right it'll be a lot easier to capture that audience you know when it comes recognize a flood i think they got like maybe 180 000 patients right now but i think the state maybe uh or just that region just scottsdale phoenix scottsdale i think they maybe got like three million people or something like that so just when it goes legal you're gonna have a 5x of consumers there and i would love to get your perspective as an operator in the space you know i think over the past year um there's been a lot of change in just you know who the power players in cannabis are who are the companies with money and influence are uh as a lot of these companies who came in and raised a billion dollars have burned through it and are now insolvent so um what do you think moving forward is the long-term effects of that you know it not being such a green rush anymore per se from from investors and large companies so what was the what was the effect that these large companies like med men and aurora cannabis and acreage starting to struggle and become insolvent what effect did they have on independent companies like yourself um well it should be opening up some shelf space uh for for brands really because it was it was controlling i mean when you can give weed away or you can buy shelf space it's hard for a regular brand coming in trying to show their product and give samples right like you know as a as a buyer what you gonna do i'm gonna take i'm gonna take who gonna give me some money to put it on the shelf right so right um so that's what that should do it should make it a little easier for brands and uh really brands and quality representing the post to just buy in space okay and then also another question that we hear often is do you look at the traditional market as a competitor and like previous conversations we've had some people feel like they have to compete with the um traditional market and some people feel like it's it's something that you that doesn't affect your business as much as people think it would so what's your take on that um it depends on where your location is you know what i mean like i i would assume it's harder for people for dispensaries in oakland to sell uh a higher-end top-shelf product why because you can go to the street and you might get the same fire eighth for 25 that's going to cost you 75 at a shop but if you're in you know the suburbs somewhere if you're in danville or you in blackhawk or you know these suburb areas where it's still not allowed maybe they don't got people that they can just reach out to so quickly and they don't want to go to oakland and deal with oakland you know it's not worth it so they're not looking at no street that's not so it's not a competition on that level what's your outlook on federal legalization do you feel like it's something now because we actually had a conversation with tucky a few weeks ago he kind of felt like that federal legalization is not really going to help black and brown people in the cannabis space right now do you feel like that could be a benefit or is that actually possibly a setback once they federally legalize i think it'll be a setback and just because i mean what we just talked about earlier we talking about big business big business coming into legal cannabis in california space they may even the real big boys you know those are the people that are willing to take a a risk on cannabis i'm talking about the real big players the tobacco johnson and johnson man you ain't gonna stand a chance as an independent nothing when they come in you know what i mean so right and um i might be wrong but that's what i think now i agree i feel like unless they really put some express verbiage into the um legislation that benefits us we we may get left out of that conversation along the terms you know either being bought out or just being starved out i feel like eventually i think starve that would be the thing i think it'll be starved out in that case you know they might be growing bunk weed but [ __ ] if they got bunk weed that cost 10 bucks right it don't go right and i think that's kind of what to your point that's kind of what walmart did once they went global you know they just come into town they drop their prices to where all the mom and pop stores can't compete even if they are losing money but once these other competitors close shop yeah they're gonna lose [ __ ] right and they boost the price back up i mean you lose money for losing money for 20 years straight it don't matter and that matter of fact we lose money for 20 years strong for your employees double and pay so they leaving you right you know they're going to get the master orders they're going to learn how to grow that fire because they're going to pay their way to it right and then also finally um last question before we wrap up it's something that i get asked every day and i'm sure you get asked every day what do you tell the person who walks up there like man terence i want to get into cannabis how do i get into the space how do i get my license how do i get a dispensary what what's that advice that you give to people who come to you and they really want to explore coming into cannabis i would say depending on where you at what city you're in if you're a person from oakland i would say you should i go talk to desley brooks uh you should go talk to his people in oakland if you're from here that want to help you get involved mainly desi brooks and and uh uh i forget the department but there's a special department for helping people get people of color from certain areas in oakland to get licensed and and maybe not all the way get licensed but you get information in the right point in the right direction that that's my advice okay great and then finally um what are your goals i know we spoke about your um transition into arizona but what are some of your goals for the remainder of 2020 throughout this whole covid thing and um also after that if you could tell us where to follow yourself loud brands and some of your other partners yeah uh uh for this year i mean a delivery service he's doing he's doing this thing it's been around for 12 years so it's always doing its thing but the goal is to get loud brands in more exposure and more shops that's my personal goal um and i'm sure for for lobo is the same like maintain and grow and we're expanding out to arizona lobo and wild brands and then gas house gas house man they got the best weed in the state you know okay and then where can we follow you guys on social media including yourself uh it's loud brands usa um my personal is i think it's what it's personal terence terrence l taylor underscore that's my personal um loud brands we got green line green line underscore delivery underscore um and lobo canada and gas house the brand those are all the instagram handles okay perfect man i appreciate your insight and i appreciate you know the perspective that you give young black and brown founders bro and i really uh look forward to working with you again soon bro appreciate it man thanks thanks for taking the time out and giving the brands and the company shout out", "NyFs_7Sy2Zc": "WEBVTT #Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.11.0.400122", "SWubQiWJ_Cg": "for the first time in forever no arrests and no one jailed for simple drug crimes marijuana remains illegal in tennessee but what if it wasn't you need to look no further than nashville it's the only city in the state where as news channel five's nick barris tells us a bold move to decriminalize pot is now making a big difference [Music] davidson county district attorney glenn funk said it was common sense that it was the fair thing to do it was back in july that he said he would no longer prosecute for simple possession of less than half an ounce of marijuana pot does remain illegal in tennessee even so it's widely used every single day by thousands in the state no doubt metro police see it smell it but if it is just a few joints they no longer confiscate it and there's no point in arresting someone if they won't be prosecuted i have not seen many charges or any charges at all for simple possession in nashville kevin teats is a local defense attorney who handles some marijuana cases and business for him in the city has slowed but nashville is something of an island but you go any direction outside of davidson county and you're still seeing uh prosecution that you know could be anywhere from somebody being jailed for marijuana possession to up to a year of probation but that may soon change as others see the impact of general funk's policy to not prosecute for simple possession in the five months since the policy took effect no prosecutions mean the jail is no longer housing any inmates for simple possession none that saves money and frees up resources especially important during the pandemic it also eliminates costly litigation anyone now arrested with marijuana can say police did not have probable costs why because without expensive testing there is no way for them or canines to tell the difference between illegal marijuana and legal hemp in one such case a davidson county judge wrote he has serious concerns about the reliability of canine units in tennessee against this backdrop i'm told that there has been no spike in drug crimes or driving under the influence in nashville and by all indications the policy is saving the city money whether decriminalizing marijuana happens elsewhere in the state well that remains to be seen nick barris newschannel 5.", "Q4SzpaHq-u0": "[Music] so I'm in a massive cannabis field right now and we're not in Colombia or Colorado we're actually in China near the Himalayas local farmers have been tending this field for the past five months and today they're ready to harvest the fruits of their labor they're about to top down 24 tons of cannabis the whole mission their company about how the heart cannot be you'll find your plan the whole woman the ha she knew and by the way it's like some that whining flu a few months ago this clot was all tobacco in court but now young Lou who manages this field says they're growing hemp a strain of the cannabis plant known for the increasingly popular non psychotropic component CBD the CBD market in the US will grow by 700 percent this year and be worth more than twenty three billion dollars by 2023 in China wants a piece of that fields like this in Yunnan Province are now a part of a growing CBD boom in China research analysts say UN and Heilongjiang provinces alone produced just over 11 percent of the global CBD supply last year the extract is taken from these plants then sold in the US demand for CBD from China has ballooned because of its supposed health Frenchie's consumer products increased with CBD like coffee bath bombs and gummy bears claim to help with pain and relaxation whatta man the CBD honey would go Edie ones yeah oh wow kind of sweet and fruity in a way wonder chefs here we're in Quin being here dozens of startups have sprouted up to capitalize on the cannabis and CBD boom in the u.s. the city has become a trailblazer for cannabis much like Denver after marijuana was first legalized in the u.s. Chinese entrepreneurs are convinced they can turn their country into a cannabis superpower China already has the infrastructure and the know-how since it produces half of the world's industrial hemp that's mainly used for textiles and paper but here's the catch in China cannabis is actually a very sensitive topic junsu PCL ba you fool tryna shop that's because it contains not only CBD but THC the psychoactive ingredient that gets you high I feel very safe in my new outfits anyone caught selling products with THC risk spending the rest of his or her life in prison or worse face the death penalty and by extension CBD consumption in the country is also illegal so when we visited one of the world's largest CBD extraction plans it actually felt like we were touring a prison here there are dozens of surveillance cameras barbed wire and every door is locked with a coat oh wow looks like a Star Wars control room in here but what's illegal for the country turns out to be big business and authorities aren't stifling that instead they've put in place very strict regulations on CBD production will mention condom a girl who should say go onto the King Kong Shah Jahan I want to know do you have tests for your employees like drug tests taken I sure go on tea time away gg-get you're not so this apparently is CBD it's kind of muddy looking it kind of looks like a black bean paste or something this factory runs 24 hours a day seven days a week pumping out 1.5 tons of CBD a year so this is what the world wants pure CBD extract and the most pure CBD can be sold for 8,000 to 10,000 dollars per kilogram we went to Shanghai to meet a Chinese entrepreneur who sees this raw material from Yunnan as a golden opportunity to sell CBD Shanghai you have a dollar debt not sure rockefeller count all Summer Sun leads the Chinese branch of CII acts an American financial firm that analyzes companies in the US for Chinese investors when they looked at the CBD boom they decided to open a company in China one may watch other Hayashi be the to me my own son says to really win big it won't be about just selling to the US eventually he hopes one day he'll be able to sell these products inside the country so Chinese entrepreneurs like son are starting to educate Chinese consumers he's selling CBD free products that are legal in China this influencer is testing one of sons products it contains other extracts from cannabis plants but he's marketing products to Chinese consumers as CBD it doesn't have any CBD is that misleading jungle vine hemorrhage at all tension the PR DVD shriveled up see my logo for some beer [Music] as companies anticipate the CBD market in China to open they are starting to invest big in the cannabis of the future - Oh Madonna Mia don't really match the home the country is quickly catching up to the US and Europe and entrepreneurs believe their country will eventually surpass competitors as a CBD powerhouse in production but most importantly consumption yoga since in the trainee at the Tantra pompe oh ho Chun Chiu geranyl woman shampooed on the tree most Wakana shaman a fan for that room to come here time at sea for sure young leo says China can only succeed because he expects the country will do to the CBD industry when it has already done to dominate other industries like smartphones plastics or clothes what can you make voice in the sugar-free trinomial the I woke up you will I depart from your dumb out that wrong with the changing wait wait huh [Music]", "6cJGWX6xPdQ": "i want to do this film because i want people to know my name is patricia crone and i have a terminal lung cancer is not a very good type of cancer to have i've got metastasis in them in my brain and they will grow and they will eventually kill me so i'm interested in anything over and above the normal treatment that can help and this is where marijuana comes in i wanted not to get high but to get well my cancer was diagnosed in november 2011. my first reaction was the kind of icy that's it i was fully uh prepared for you know death quite soon then you start treatment and that of course completely ruins uh all your all your your uh you know your steel resolve now i must accept death etc said once you start treatment you can't go around saying i'm going to die because you are in treatment chemotherapy was terrible undilutedly terrible they cut out a third of my lungs and a lot of lymph nodes after getting over the operation i felt so well that's enough that's enough you know it's impossible to feel that there's anything wrong with you you get used to being alive in a new mode which is a new mode that's called you know the cancer mode [Music] i am a professor of islamic history at the institute for advanced study in princeton all my work has been about the rise and development of islam this book here this is the first book i wrote i wrote this with michael cook we are good friends i wrote this one with martin hines and we lived together martin died of cancer at the age of 47. i may know a lot about ancient islam but i know next to nothing about the modern world of marijuana i was a smoker once but i have never smoked a reefer or eaten a pot lace brownie so i turned to the internet for help somebody suggested that i try a marijuana concentrate known as rick simpson's oil most of the hemp oil i produce comes from indica strain place the starting material preferably good bud in a plastic container dampen the bud material in the container with the solvent you are using then crush the bud material drain the solvent from the starting material and put it through a coffee filter an electric rice cooker boils the solvent off very effectively generally a pound of good a pound will produce about two ounces of high grade oil that's a lot of suggesting this amount of oil over a two to three month period is enough to cure most serious cancers i'm a skeptic by profession and i know there are a lot of fake cures out there but that cannabis fights cancer is not just an old wives tale what do we have here cannabinoid endocannabinoids are possible preventatives of common disease including cancers you have aberdeen school of medicine and dentistry it it's very good to know that there is its potential oh wait a minute look here national cancer institute possible effects of cannabinoids include anti-inflammatory activity blocking cell growth preventing the growth of blood vessels supply tumors laboratory and animal studies have shown that canopy knowledge may be able to kill cancer cells while protecting normal cells that's the potential that we all want to have developed so i went to nyu to see a young doctor who wrote his dissertation on cannabis okay patricia my name is sunil agrawal i'm a physician here at the new york university medical center i'm a house staff officer in the department of rehabilitation medicine maybe you could tell us what are cannabinoids and those are the active ingredients of cannabis that occur inside of the human body and actually all many living systems all the way down to sea squirts but somehow insects and other groups didn't evolve these things but they're also called cannabinoids but they're called endocannabinoids there's this entire massive cannabinoid receptor system in the brain what are cannabinoid receptors they're one of the most abundant proteins in the brain and all major organs have cannabinoid receptors and it turns out they have physiological importance in mood appetite memory inflammation tumor regulation bone growth immunity even reproduction that they're they're involved in cells communicating with each other at a basic level you know so it's basically an ancient um signaling system that we've just discovered in the last 20 years that has been shown in preclinical animal and some early human studies to kill tumors by apoptosis cell death stopping the blood supply to tumors and preventing metastatic spread and sparing other surrounding tissues there's no reason it sounds almost too good to be true but it's all factually documented in national library of medicine now i've got to get myself a pound of cannabis cannabis a.k.a marijuana hemp weed tea pot etc was once a commonly used american medicine which somehow turned into a dangerous illegal drug 19 states and the district of columbia allow marijuana for medical news but federal law still prohibits it and me getting caught with a whole pound of pot i'd be treated as a dealer and that would mean dying in jail or if i'm lucky deportation [Music] i grew up in denmark my parents had five children i finished school there and i went to university there for two years and then i went to england had a job in oxford and then in cambridge and then i went to america the winter went by and for all my determination i still didn't have any cannabis because it's dangerous and at the time i thought it wasn't realistic and i thought you know i'm hopeless i will never find this and forget it my problems getting cannabis really started in april 1937 when congress proposed a heavy tax to make it unobtainable cannabis based medicines were already losing out to regulations and modern standardized drugs but still the tax was fiercely opposed by the american medical association and that's really when the drug war started the treasury department intends to pursue a relentless warfare against the despicable dope battling vulture who preys on the weakness of his fellow man to people who study the marijuana issue harry anslinger is the bad guy dr john gettman teaches criminal justice at shenandoah university in virginia and is a former director of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws harry anslinger was the leader of the bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs bndd for the 30s 40s and 50s he was as much a fixture in federal law enforcement as jane hoover was in the fbi now anslinger was behind the marijuana tax act of 1937 the the federal prohibition that became federal marijuana law for the the mid century yeah he was overzealous with marijuana but there was ignorance at the time as to what the drug was why it produced the reactions that it produced from ignorance comes hysteria marijuana assassin of youth an incredibly influential article that harry angelina wrote about the horrors of marijuana the sprawled body of a young girl they crushed on the sidewalk the other day everyone called it suicide but actually it was murder the killer was a narcotic known to america as marijuana the article inspired the famous exploitation movie there was this idea that people would smoke hash then they were transformed into homicidal maniacs and marijuana was the recipe for insanity he said harry henslinger thought it was a horrible evil thing and whatever they could do to convince people not to use it was fine with him harry angelina's scare tactics worked marijuana the menace won out over marijuana the medicine already by 1942 cannabis was out of the american pharmacopoeia cannabis had lost all connection to medicine and was now only a dangerous drug spring turned to summer 2012 was half gone and i still didn't have any canopies but i felt extremely well then in august i had another scan mri every time i hang on i get more nervous about the result it showed that i had more metastases in the in my brain it was very depressing and they condemned me to whole brain radiation and at that point i suddenly it became death you know became very very real and very very close it was a real i mean they never said it gave me any date but it was very clear from their reaction i could tell i could tell the way they written me off from experience they know i am now a goner whole brain radiation it really scares me if i don't accept the radiation then for sure sooner or later i will become very badly symptomatic in the sense i will get seizures i will get paralysis i'll uh god knows sooner or later the question is how soon how late whole brain radiation i would not be able to work the way i do i wouldn't feel as well as i do so i began to think harder about cannabis i got to have it dangerous they're not cannabis it's not a dangerous drug if people want to smoke and like people drink drink beer what the hell ernest drucker is professor of public health and social medicine at columbia university and city university of new york the drug prohibition treaties that were made go back to 1911 and the united states was the leader in getting those in before it had even outlawed these drugs in its own country because it wanted to establish itself as as in moral leadership yeah yeah yeah and they were there there were a group of ministers who were very uh called moral entrepreneurs who used the drug issue and it was very successful professionally i personally have known about cannabis for many years because it was the drug that everyone was using in the 60s [Music] things that used to be restricted poor minorities or marginal groups like jazz musicians artists and so on which had been the history of drugs suddenly new populations were using drugs what happened politically is that politicians noticed that they could appeal to the white middle class and the middle class fear and could win elections at 1970 congress overhauled our federal drug laws and created the controlled substances act and the idea was that some drugs had a potential for abuse and therefore they needed to be controlled the amount of regulation was going to be based on how dangerous the drug was now in that regulatory frame there are five schedules schedule one is the most restrictive that's for drugs with no medical use and the highest potential for abuse and so heroin for example is a schedule 1 drug so the nixon administration sends congress a letter and they said we understand that marijuana doesn't really fit in schedule one probably doesn't even fit in schedule two because it lacks the high potent potential for abuse but we want you to put it in schedule one now for the time being then congress should reschedule it or the administration should reschedule it but no one ever did it was put there temporarily and then it was just ignored and left there where it remains to the state america's public enemy number one in the united states is drug abuse in order to fight and defeat this enemy it is necessary to wage a new all-out offensive the so-called drug war has started the former deputy chief of the los angeles police stephen downing helped kick off the battle there's no metric that says this war on drugs is successful the cartels when i started they didn't exist in in america this year they control drug trafficking in 1 000 american cities marijuana comprises about 50 percent of the drug market the the impact of the health impact let's say people that die well of course nobody in the history of the world has ever died from an overdose of marijuana several thousand people die a year from heroin overdoses and cocaine i think today pharmaceutical drugs have have passed up heroin and and cocaine and deaths oxycodones i got 150. they can lead to stomach problems to liver damage and even to death much more dangerous than cannabis which is not being used it's not being developed so what do i do i'm going to ask my oncologist dr david sokol about my situation we've spoken about it before that you know this is probably not curable at this point and i really really enjoy working as opposed you know to buying more time but not functioning the way you usually work uh or concentrate there probably would be some drop off in your um efficiency and that's permanent um it can be but most people are quite functional after the radiation they have they can't remember anything well they're not walking around like you know they don't know who their family is or no no no oh no but i'm not talking about that i'm talking about my ability to do the work i'm doing which is the greatest pleasure of my life yeah um there might be some change in that how long does uh whole brain radiation delay the onset of symptomatic tumors i mean at the moment i'm not symptomatic it is calculated that i will probably be in a couple of months maybe three months i'm not sure that i have uh the report obviously if i have the report they're probably three millimeters but right now they're very small spots on the other like six of them or something so in terms of where to go from here let me start by saying the radiation is probably more effective at buying time uh if the smaller uh the amount of tumor that there is to treat but i have this plan for delaying for a month then i want to ask you do you know this study this is white bang relevant to me ah can i have it i see okay i don't know the study and this is sort of in uh you know animal models so a lot of things that seem to work in animal models that don't don't work in the human people so uh you know i'm that's my battle yeah this is a national cancer institute which i assume you accept as as a reputable source you want to try it so if you don't smoke it you make it a highly concentrated oil okay and you eat it okay does it sound sounds very nice probably isn't very nice okay but uh and i'm not sure where you get it i know that's my problem okay uh how much am i risking by making this experiment myself that you cannot tell i can understand that it's really hard but i think it might be worth it i mean from my part of you it might be worse deals i mean i'm a goner but you know i have an awful lot to lose yeah so well yeah um you know i wish i could say you really don't have to worry about that but you know as you know you do i went up to my sister and we started looking for cannabis there was that all whole brain radiation so in august 2012 right after my alarming brain scan i started to contact clinics in some of the states that allow medical marijuana i was desperate to get rigged oil or a pound of cannabis to make it but only oregon accepted out of state applications my sister found a very promising address in oregon for portland alternative clinic which is headed by a real doctor but the clinic doesn't function like an ordinary clinic or a drugstore or pharmacist you can't just go in and buy the stuff you need to have somebody who will grow it for you two three five five yeah hello i got you a number from the alternative clinic in portland i'm looking for a grower in oregon a person to grow cannabis for me that i need for medical purposes and they said would be able to get me in contact with a potential grower we don't provide growers like that that we don't really put people together as much and you can't give me any sort of contact number or anything we just don't have any it's not something we do it's a very good left hand thank you have a great day thank you bye they couldn't help but i'm going to try again hello i got you a number from the important alternative clinic and they told me that you were somebody who might possibly be able to give me a contact or a lead or something or how to find a grower in oregon are you still there you really begin going into that panic state that state of of fear i have this sense you know the grave is just ahead i don't want to go in there there was yet another possibility new jersey had only just passed the law legalizing marijuana for medical use in order to qualify you have to have less than a year to live but the card will be valid for two years so [Laughter] they seem to think it's okay if i survive for another year a moot point anyway since there's no pot available my experiment with the cannabis was going nowhere and so i went ahead with the hospital plan and saw a radiologist and we prepared a mask so that they can pin me down during the radiation i bought a wig i was completely ready but by then something unexpected happened we had got hold of some cannabis [Music] so now i'm making this oil that rick simpson has the recipe for it's quite a business and you have to sieve it then you have to evaporate the stuff in a rice cooker until you get a very tiny amount of oil right i have to remove myself from this i mean the vapors from this you can feel it they sort of pull slightly it's slightly sickening so the vapors are flammable that's why we're doing it outside i mean i haven't really considered the possibility that the police might come of course they could in principle i mean everything is possible and maybe they could smell the vapors but you know and respectable old lady like me why should they burst into my house yeah what if you don't do that for the fun of it that's for sure you do it because you are determined to try anything you can to avoid imminent death of course i instantly suffered a massive overdose and i got to feel extremely bad for a long time i took some you know i had these pieces of bread with a bit of oil on it i i mean i don't know how much it added up to uh it's very weird it's not pleasurable at all at all so i'm making tablets hash tablets of rick's oil i am eating this stuff ah too big one tablet a day it's disgusting it totally like that my hope is no growth of the metastases in my head i'm risking jail in order to save my life it's a pretty weird situation in which one has a sense that it's a government that's trying to kill you it's very hard to make the same size tablet if if you know if this were properly done by medical companies it would be a lot better i've been seriously overdosed it's not nice definitely not nice and then it lasts forever as they say on some website you may feel as if you're going to die but you won't people don't die from the direct effects of marijuana dr aaron lishman is professor of pharmacology and toxicology at virginia commonwealth university in richmond virginia there's a range of side effects there can be panic attacks and in fact that's responsible for a lot of the emergency room visits you know roughly about 10 or so in their lifetime will become dependent to marijuana and there's a certain percentage of individuals a very small percentage that may show psychotic reactions if they smoke marijuana withdrawal effects include disturbed sleep the distortion of time disturbed dreams disorganization of thought but again doesn't cause death pharmacologists at vcu have studied the effects of cannabis for decades often experimenting with mice this mouse has electrodes planted into its spring and then we can study the effects of drugs on its behavior there's been a lot of research looking at cannabis inside of cannabis there's hundreds of compounds and there are about upwards of 70 or more special compounds called cannabinoids and this includes delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol or thc for short which gives people the psychoactive effects the high the plant contains another interesting substance cannabidiol also known as cbd cbd does not produce the thc like high in animals or humans it can have anti-seizure effects it's long been known to have anti-inflammatory effects it decreases nausea and vomiting and thc has a lot of medicinal effects too already in 1975 vcu pharmacologists published a paper on the startling discovery that thc shrinks certain lung cancer tumors but the experiment ended right there when the government cut the funding there was a war on drugs and they had no idea really how it worked when i got into this field in 1989 they hadn't discovered the cannabinoid receptor yet and that's a whole new chapter it began in 1988 with the scientist now at wake forest allen howlett i'm a phd professor of physiology and pharmacology here at wake forest school of medicine i had initially just assumed that everybody knew how marijuana worked but at the cell level it wasn't very known at all so my research was strictly at the level of the cells and we were able to identify this protein that the receptor this particular experiment is to try to understand what cells are making what kinds of proteins whether cb2 receptors or cb1 receptors are present in in the cells that we're working with okay cb2 receptors are found mostly in the immune system and cb1 receptors are found mostly in the brain so these receptors are in many places in the brain and and they've send the messages through a signaling pathway and neurons the knowledge about the endocannabinoid system has been evolving over the last 20 years and now that we've got much more information coming from the basic science they're going to be new avenues for treating diseases so i think this is just right for new pharmaceutical development i'm having a scan a brain scan and mri as they call them to show to reveal the state of my brain the metastasis is in my brain this will show whether it has any effect at all and if it doesn't then i am pretty much doomed it's quite something as i was in the scanner i tried to play the film with a bad ending because i want you know to imagine a bad outcome so get used to the idea the way i mean you habituate you know bad news bad news now get used to it but every time i played the film with with the bad ending and so the film had this way of coming to an end you know they wouldn't play and i said i didn't i never really got to the end whereas when i played the happy end film no there was no problem i'm expecting a call from my doctor it's very very scary [Music] hello hello more of the same and so uh so we're back to where we started i have the choice between whole brain radiation and death okay so that was disappointing the cannabis has not halted the growth but there is a sliver of good news my brain mats had grown very slowly and dr andrew greenberg my radio oncologist had expected the picture to look much worse you can see one here there's a 6.9 millimeter nodule in the medial left occipital lobe here's another one here yeah yeah okay but how many are there now all together eight nine six seven eight nine nine right oh my god it looks bad but what has changed is the scan but not the person in time what i see in the mri is gonna catch up to i know the person who's mri it is with that said at this point in time there's no evidence of that and in fact you know to do to my eye you are none the worst for where you said they had grown very slowly could that be due to the cannabis well that probably speaks more to the genetics of one person's lung cancer versus somebody else's yeah um this could have an effect i mean i i can't sit here and say that it doesn't it's a relatively benign approach if you will i don't want to say treatment i'm not sure it's a treatment no i'm not sure either right yeah you know i don't have a problem if one goes by the philosophy first do no harm if it's not harming you and it might be helping you these tumors grow very slowly but whether they grow more slowly because of the cannabis well that's a big issue i can't tell he can't tell but in the pathology lab at the ohio state university medical center a group of scientists working with professor ramesh ganju are busy gathering more information so in our lab we are trying to find out the anti-tumorogenic activity of cannabinoids against breast and lung cancer we wanted to see if they could be developed to combat cancer we incubate the cannabinoids with these cells and then look at their growth potential how do they grow and how do they proliferate and that way it gives an indication that if they inhibit the growth that means it's killing the cell and the next step is the animal model this is catherine who is doing most of the invivo work and she can explain you over here actually can you take out the mice and show her actually this is these are the memory tumors over here we inject breast cancer cells into memory glands and then we can see over here the tumors are growing we watch the progression we measure them regularly we use external calibers to measure the tumor volume as it progresses we're looking for the edges of the tumor we basically do a cross section you do you find the longest length and you measure that and that is our longest length yes then you do the 90 degree um angle and you measure that and you're able to calculate the volume of these tumors get it thank you and this is the cannabinoid treated mice so they started with the same tumor size so the smaller tumor is sitting right there is a good indication of how the treatment is affecting it and then we do the 90 degree they're either shrinking or they're progressing slower compared to their vehicle there's a big difference we have initially shown that the plant arrived cannabinoid that's delta 9 tsc it has anti-tumorogenic activity against lung cancer hold on metastasis to the lungs all the yellow is metastasis and this one is have been treated with this cannabinoids and now it's brown and healthy and very little yellow this was the result of plant-derived cannabinoids i've also seen what synthetic cannabinoids can do and now dr gandu will show me a study that used endocannabinoids okay we're trying to see effect of endocannabinoids on lung cancer growth we grow these cells in petri dishes and these are the lung cancer cells they form these colonies we incubate these cells with endocannabinoids at two different concentrations this is the lower concentration and you increase the concentration it see all these cells disappear yeah here the lower concentration you do see see some cells still growing however when you increase the concentration most of the cells are gone lung cancer as well as breast cancer i'm still taking it and i'm feeling all right i'm i mean i mean physically i'm feeling as well as as ever i decided to postpone whole brain radiation again i preferred life as i know it for as long as possible i have an errand run i need more cannabis now i'm in portland in oregon to secure a legal supply of it this is organic it's 100 organic and there is a huge difference and you can't spray it you can only use water right at this moment i have two other patients beside myself in a town like this where we're quote unquote weird people are willing to go the alternative route to see if it works and of course it works come on it's the oldest medicine on in recorded history my messy house it's also a small place i can show you what i get out of this tiny space can i oh yeah yeah which one do we recommend for one counter you want something that's going to not you're not going to have to smoke very much should it not be it should be rick's oil do you know rick's oil yes i make it you make it ah i do use it with use everclear and then put that in capsules that's just what i want yes and i have them let me show you i have them all right hold on one second i know exactly where i put them oh crap where did i put them oh i know where i put it never mind hold on yeah well i have them in a box yes they're really good i weigh these things from start to finish they weigh each a half a gram okay as many as you like i made 250 oh wonderful mission accomplished but i'm still a criminal for crossing state lines with marijuana in my suitcase cannabis remains in limbo both legally and medically federal legalization may be too much to hope for but i just want cannabis out of schedule one where the next administration put it we had a report from the institute of medicine about marijuana they basically said schedule one curtails research and development in cannabinoid drugs but even if you come up with a compound not from marijuana itself that produces any kind of marijuana-like effect industry is not interested in it and a lot of that is a carryover of from the um you know the banning of cannabis so it's treated more dangerously than nuclear materials it seems that way i took a trip to washington to visit president nixon's point man on drugs and hoped he would make sense of it i am robert dupont md i'm the president of the institute for behavior and health i was the first director of the national institute on drug abuse and the second white house drug czar in the united states until 1971 that was almost totally law enforcement and in 1971 uh president richard nixon changed american policy to what was called balanced policy that included prevention treatment and research the national institute on drug abuse nida started in 1973 three uh yeah and it is the focus of research on drugs of abuse uh that was its mission the largest part of all the research that had been done in cannabis has been funded by nida we spend more money on prevention more money on treatment than any other country in the world by far my focus was on heroin addiction it wasn't anything to do with cannabis but in the background was a public interest in as you called then marijuana or cannabis but i dismissed that i thought that was not a serious issue for somebody who's interested in drugs and i fancied myself to be a serious person if cannabis is not a serious drug why is it in schedule one schedule one is a drug that has no approved medical use and schedule two is a highly abused drug that hasn't approved medical use and so any drug that is widely abused is either in one or two that's right and and there is no now medical approved use for cannabis the government on the one hand uh funds research into medicinal properties of canopies on the other hand it has put it on schedule one which denies that there's any any medical values that there is a little bit of a disconnect there's no condition whatsoever not the slightest disconnect schedule one drugs are researched all the time being in schedule one is no barrier to research that is a figment of the imagination of paranoid people it's not it's not true it's back to the question of why is it on schedule one and not schedule two this is what interests me but i just explained it to you do you not understand that no i don't really understand it all right i'm going to say it again there's there both schedule 1 and schedule 2 are seriously abused drugs you got that okay number one is for drugs that have no medically approved but wait a minute by the food and drug administration it's a very straightforward decision it's not whether somebody thinks it's medicine it's whether it's approved as a medicine and if it is and it's highly abused it's in schedule two yeah i know i know what i'm sorry how hard is that for you to follow that no i can follow that thank you but the next time you talk to somebody say you don't have any doubt about it you know exactly why it's in schedule one because it was explained to you by me right government has cannabis on schedule one but it also has a patent on on the uh use of cannabis as as a medicine what do you mean a pack there is a patent taken out in 2003. for what i mean i don't know what that was your doctor you could understand it better than i can this says as antioxidants and neuroprotectants i don't know what that is i i i don't understand you talking about cannabis yeah i understand that i don't know in that in that application i don't know that's somebody who knows about patents i got the patent right here here i am in washington by the national institutes of health nih more than 80 nobel prizes have gone to a scientist doing research funded by this institute and one other scientist who worked right here and who got a nobel prize was julius axelrod who specialized in neurotransmitters in how cells talk to each other and later in life he participated in a study of cannabis that the government deemed to be so significant so important that it took out a patent on the findings it says in its abstract that cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults such as stroke and trauma or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer's disease parkinson's disease and hiv dementia and it has more about how it is good for people who have undergone cancer chemotherapy or radiation and other sources of oxidative stress we have here which seems an official recognition by the us government that cannabis has medical uses [Music] in december 2012 after taking cannabis oil for four months another scary test i had a pet scan on my lung ground zero of all my troubles so now i'm waiting for the result of the pet scan i had last week which will show me whether the cancer has spread to somewhere else in my body show there's nothing on your pet scan nothing nothing that's recurrent that we can see within the chest cavity or anywhere else your pet skin is completely negative that's wonderful it's funny it's it's it's slightly relieved but um not as relieved as i thought i was going to be yet but that's pretty good it's great news it saturates and i will get to feel happier about it and it doesn't look at the brain i have nine lesions in the brain now and that i'm still asymptomatic you'll follow up with the radiation oncologist with your brain you know i'm unhappy about your brain mass but i'm pretty happy about your pet scan there's a good chance that the that the cannabis has something to do with it and so i'm not going to risk anything by stopping now i have no doubt there is an anti-tumor potential in cannabis that should be explored but there are still no human trials so i continue to be my own human cannabis trial and often it does feel like a trial my brain doesn't fire and my memory really is very bad and it's very bad in a way which i think is beyond my normal old age badness so is cannabis helping against cancer but hurting my mind [Music] luckily i knew where to find an expert on aging brains and cannabis gary wink is professor of psychology and neuroscience at the ohio state university my research is in rats yes and my research for the past 30 years has been focused on the aging brain what makes it age what i'm trying to do is figure out how do we reverse that or how do we slow it down all right that would be the key that most people would be happy just to slow it down a little bit one of the biggest changes that no it wasn't really appreciated until probably 15 years ago was that as you get older inflammation develops in the brain and the principal properties of marijuana are sort of revealed over time as well and it turns out that marijuana is a very effective anti-inflammatory so we've been looking for drugs that are anti-inflammatories that get across the blood-brain barrier and everything i've tested has worked very well in young brains but nothing was ever effective in an old wrap when we test old rats they have a really bad memory and the way we test that is in the morris water maze based on the decorations we put on the wall he learns how to find the hidden platform in there they get six training sessions every day for four days all right you gonna go swimming again little guy i know a young rat like him should learn pretty quickly where the platform is whereas an older rat would have no ability to do so be great if he found the platform for you oh he's so close so we have a camera on the ceiling that automatically tracks how he's swimming older rats that are really not smart they'll just swim in circles until you take them out you have to basically rescue them but the young guys are very good at finding the platform ah yes good job buddy so a normal young rat can find the platform a normal old rat cannot find the platform but when we give the older rats the synthetic cannabinoid they're able then to find the platform our wonderful surprise was that marijuana actually worked in an old brain first time first compound ever um so that just was so exciting because it gave us some hope that uh something would actually help people slow the aging process when they were already old we know that these rats have recovered something they're more like the young rats than the old rats march 2013 i have an mri every scan feels like a potential death sentence but i'm still around and i think i'm ahead of the curve last year i was invited to a conference and not today i thought i can't really imagine myself being well still unable so here i am a year later and i reached the april that i didn't think i was going to be able to reach so i i don't think there's any doubt that this cannabis has helped but what is missing is clinical trials to show which are the best canopy knowledge to use for this whisper the best strains so in santa monica california i went to greenbridge medical services to ask dr alan frankel about the problem you have no idea what you get when you buy it how to dose it dr frankel treats disease with plant cannabinoids but applies scientific accuracy to dosing and strains the endocannabinoid system the ecs was discovered i believe in 90 or 91 so it's nothing new the endocannabinoid system is the central controlling modulating neuroendocrine system for the body without an endocannabinoid system there's no life that's how integrated this is with everything else right it doesn't mean that you have to have cannabis externally to live however makes no sense to save certainly the safest medicine ever for the people who are getting ready to die i'm waiting for a call from my radiology doctor it's quite nerve-wracking [Music] very good thank you bye bye report shows they have all grown but i got on a small surprise it mentions that there was generalized progression despite partial improvement at the medial right or capital load partial improvement the doctor didn't say anything about that so now i better take another look at all my brain scans before deciding about whole brain radiation in nine months from november 2011 to august 2012 i had eight possibly nine metastases in my brain in august i started taking cannabis in the next eight months i had two plus a partial improvement it's pretty impressive but is it impressive enough postponing radiation probably means faster death acceptance and my life as a scholar is most likely over i have always assumed that the moment i'm symptomatic i accept whole brain radiation i have these symptoms in my right foot which suggests that i'm losing control of that foot and eventually of the whole leg and because of this hash my memory really is very bad i work extremely slowly i can't remember where i put anything you know as if i'd already had a whole brain radiation so i might as well it's actually seven months since i was meant to have whole brain radiation seven months it matters it's a wonderful brother i got an honorary doctorate and still well and you still cannot tell that anything is wrong with me and it's been very nice so far the going has been pretty good i think i have to say i've been lucky [Music] cheers i'm going to the hospital for my whole brain radiation session i finally took the hate step because it became clear that there was deterioration in my right leg well i will lose my hair and i don't believe i'd ever get it back i don't believe about it well enough for long enough i have to say that not having had whole brain radiation in august when i was meant to have it it has given me time to get used to the idea that you know okay now i am you know on that slippery slope down where we can see the end [Music] i completed 14 days of whole brain radiation and the effects are terrible i've lost my balance i'm confused my tongue is burning and i've lost most of my hair but the worst of it is that the radiation had only a small effect on my tumors so i'll continue to take cannabis because it's amazing what cannabinoids can do they affect just about every disease in the body that has to reflect the underlying endocannabinoid system so maybe the endocannabinoid system should be studied and unraveled much in the same way as the genetic code has been done it's a really exciting prospect it's too late for me but i am still thrilled by the idea of what they might come up with he's so nice so beautiful [Music] sometimes it's just a matter of time [Music] you've got left for goodbyes and you don't want to cry but it burns sometimes it just comes down to the heart of the matter i want to feel better could a plan be the answer [Music] here me i need a weed to wrap itself around me when i think about looking down seeing you living without me you are my medicine helping me with everything i need [Music] me [Music] always feel happy going on gardening except when your cats are dying then you feel deeply unhappy but it's sort of the kind of emotions you need to suffer because of love you", "Kvqw3jy1WUQ": "SECOND MAJOR METH BUST THE DEPUTIES HAVE MADE IN JUST THE PAST WEEK. IT'S BEEN ABOUT A MONTH NOW SINCE RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA SALES HAVE STARTED HERE IN ARIZONA, BUT THE CONCERN IS THAT THE INCREASED DEMAND WILL TAKE AWAY FROM PATIENTS WHO NEED IT FOR MEDICAL REASONS. BOX TENS IRENE SNYDER IS LIVE TONIGHT WITH DETAILS. IRENE. GOOD EVENING, CHRISTY AND CHRISTINE OFFICIALS. DISPENSARY COMPANY XKN AREA TELL ME THAT THEY HAD PLANS IN PLACE A WHILE AGO TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA WAS ABLE TO BE SOLD, THEY'D BE ABLE TO HAVE ENOUGH SET ASIDE FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT FOR MEDICAL REASONS THAT SOME OF THOSE MEDICAL PATIENTS SAY BECAUSE THE DEMAND RIGHT NOW THE BEGINNING FOR RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA IS SO HIGH. THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING A HOLD OF IT. NOW THE RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA IS LEGAL. IN ARIZONA. THE FOCUS TURNS TO MAKING SURE THAT THOSE MEDICAL MARIJUANA PATIENTS ARE ABLE TO STILL GET WHAT THEY NEED. BUT THE DEMAND FOR RECREATIONAL TURNED OUT TO BE MUCH HIGHER THAN TO SPEND THREE OFFICIALS HAD EXPECTED. WE BOUGHT WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS GONNA BE THREE MONTHS WORTH. IT ENDED UP BEING PROBABLY ONE MONTH WORTH ANYTHING. 100 MEN UNDER 100 MG, JUST FLEW OUT THE DOOR IN THE FIRST THREE DAYS THAT WERE AVAILABLE IN DISPENSARIES ROUND, MOLINA SAYS THEY SINCE STOCKED UP ON THEIR GOAL IS THE SERVE MEDICAL PATIENTS WITHIN 10 MINUTES, AND RECREATIONAL CUSTOMERS WITHIN 30. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THEIR MEDICINE. YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO SHORTAGE. SOME DISPENSARIES HAVE CREATED SEPARATE LINES FOR MEDICAL VERSUS RECREATIONAL. WE'LL ALSO ALLOWING THEM TO ORDER ONLINE AHEAD OF TIME WE LOOK CAREFULLY AT WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE AND WHAT THOSE ROLLOUTS LOOK LIKE. SO WE LOOK LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE WE PREDICTED ACCURATELY WHAT THE DEMAND WOULD BE FOR PRODUCTS. SOME MEDICAL PATIENTS SAY THEY HAVEN'T RUN INTO ANY TROUBLE GETTING THEIR MEDICINE. YOU HAVE GOTTEN EVERYTHING THAT NEEDED WHENEVER I CAME TO THE DISPENSARY WELL, OTHERS SAY IT'S BEEN QUITE A CHALLENGE LIKE CALORIE. GRIFFIN WHO SAYS SHE HAD TO GO TO THREE DIFFERENT DISPENSARIES TO GET WHAT SHE NEEDED. I'M GLAD THAT IT'S LEGALIZED. THINK THAT THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE CRIMINALIZED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, BUT IT HAS MADE IT WAY HARDER TO GET IT. AND SHE SAYS SHE THINKS MORE SHOULD BE DONE TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE WHO NEED THESE PRODUCTS FOR MEDICAL REASONS, MEDICAL PLACES AND THAT HAVE THEIR SEPARATE RECREATIONAL PLACES. INSTEAD OF DOING BOTH. BECAUSE THAT JUST MAKES IT SO MUCH HARDER FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO ACTUALLY NEED IT. AND IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO QUALIFY FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA, AND YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO ORDER AT LEAST ARE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING IT RIGHT NOW, WITH RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA BEING AVAILABLE, ALL THESE COMPANIES ARE BASICALLY JUST ASK YOU TO BE PATIENT AS THEY CONTINUE TO SMOOTH OUT THE ROLLOUT.

that initiative 190 sets up a legal framework for marijuana sales including a 20 tax constitutional initiative 118 allows the state to limit sales to those 21 and older supporters of legalization argued it would provide montana an economic boost and much needed additional revenue opponents said legalized marijuana would bring health and safety concerns i-190 would legalize having and using small amounts of marijuana as of january 1st the provisions for commercial sales wouldn't take effect until at least next fall new approach says they expect the first legal sales around february 2022

absolutely love it uh whether you agree with me or disagree with me it it it doesn't make a difference i enjoy just getting the feedback and reading what everyone has to say now this particular uh today for this update i do want to talk about a uh a question i received from vincent a on youtube and he wrote hey matt thanks for all the marijuana market updates we'd like to hear what you think about cannabix tech just recently got a u.s patent for a thc breathalyzer couldn't find much recent financials but wondering what your thoughts are i couldn't find any other publicly traded company that makes a thc breathalyzer and with more states legalizing for recreational use i think this might be a good long-term option thanks well first off vincent thank you for your comments and your questions i really appreciate that you're you guys are the reason why we do this is just to provide you uh with a little bit more analysis in terms of of cannabis related stocks it's not easy to find uh but you know and it provides you with actual information what you do with it entirely up to you but i want to try to provide you with very middle of the road straight line and and no bull no just cut to the chase and tell you what it is give the info and then what you do with it entirely up to you now i'll start with a little bit of background on the company and then i'll look at it stock performance cannabix technologies incorporated trades over the counter on the pink sheets under b l o z f b l o z f and it also trades on the canadian national stock exchange is a canadian company so it's not on the nasdaq or on the new york stock exchange it is over the counter it is on the pink sheets um but it's not a company that that cultivates or sells marijuana so it's not your typical marijuana company it's a company that's in the market of creating tools for law enforcement and employers to test the presence of thc on an individual uh and vincent is correct the company did just receive a patent for a cannabis drug detection device uh it's patent uh it's a patent the company's been working on uh since 2014. it recently just got it just uh a week two weeks ago now the actual breathalyzer has already been produced and is in field testing uh a a with an occupational health clinic in southern california it works the same way an alcohol breathalyzer does law enforcement if you are at a traffic stop or maybe in an accident and there's a question about your your impairedness then they break out a little device you breathe into it and then instantaneously it tells you what your alcohol your blood alcohol level or how much alcohol is in your blood and every state has different legal limits if you are over that legal limit then you can be arrested for driving under the influence the thc breathalyzer works the exact same way if you breathe into it and it's meant to register the amount of thc you have in your system uh whenever whenever legal limits are established uh if they haven't been already then you can determine whether you're driving under the influence or operating a vehicle under the influence or showing up to work under the influence or whatever have you now so it it just works the same way as an alcohol breathalyzer and it's supposed to reduce the thc identification process from what is now days sometimes hours into seconds and minutes as of august the company said results missed breathalyzer uh takes less than five minutes to obtain uh and cannabix officials said they're continuing to work on scaling down the current device it is a pretty good size one it's you know it's more that you know the ones the police use for alcohol are very small rectangles and you know with a little tube on the end that you blow into this is actually a bit bigger it's not huge but it's not necessarily compact uh and they're working on trying to decrease the production costs of that device all in all achieving the patent is really pretty big news for the company um as now it's kind of in the driver's seat to develop this kind of technology ongoing now in terms of the company stock it was trading at a range of around 27 cents to 30 cents a share for most of the last 12 months it ticked up to about 66 cents a share in december that's likely response to the current used political situation involving democrats controlling the house the senate and the white house now as i've said before uh you know investors are the belief that with democrats in control of all three of those entities that federal decriminalization of cannabis is closer to reality thus pushing cannabis stocks up we saw it with even our cannabis watch list holdings which i'll talk more about later that they pushed very high after the election and then after january when the georgia election finally gave control of the senate to the democrats now cannabix got its big boost when news of its patent award became public earlier this month as you can see with the chart here the stock price vaulted to more than a dollar 79 a share that's a 616 jump from march 2020's low of 25 cents a share that's a massive jump now the stock price hit a golden cross that's where the 50 day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average back in december of 2020 that golden cross indicates a potential uptrend could be in the offing but in this instance it's more likely the patent drove the stock higher not the pattern so um just be aware of that that the you know news does dictate stock price and this instance that's exactly what happened it wasn't because the technicals showed that it was time for the price for the stock to start moving in an uptrend um and finally vincent is also correct uh financially rather he is correct there is very little and i mean very little financial information available on this company what i could find is that the company doesn't carry any debt but it also hasn't mass-produced its breathalyzer yet so there's very little reason to have any it's basically raising funds to pay for r d it's not taking any debt because it has no need to um and it doesn't have any cash flow either again because it hasn't sold anything so right now its financials are pretty much on level term it's raising funds and then investing those funds uh in into its research and development when it starts mass producing then you might start seeing this company start taking on some debt uh and and even start generating some sales once that becomes fruition that's when the balance sheet will start to expand and you'll start seeing hopefully what the company would hope for would be a balance if not a tip to the cash side to the good now overall the this company is a little tricky for me in terms of investing there's another company out there called hound labs it started uh on-site testing of its own marijuana breathalyzer and the news of this online field test just came days after cannabix uh announced its patent award so i'm sure there was no surprise there uh hound labs is a private company so you can't invest in it the same way you can with cannabix um now for cannabis i would issue some caution realize that there's not they're not the only player in the game here it just happens to be they're the only player that you can actually invest in um it's not an expensive stock even with the run up i mean dollar 79 still is fairly cheap uh it's not bad but if that momentum isn't sustained a pullback could lead to triple digit losses you see the stock go up 600 percent um if their uptrend isn't confirmed or isn't isn't sustained it can drop right back down to that 25 27 30 level that's a massive loss so you have to really put all that in perspective until they start marketing and putting out a product to sell it's going to be very difficult to gauge whether this stock is something to really invest in at this point at least to me and at least in the cannabis industry r d companies are great but there's always caution that you have to kind of throw yeah you have to factor in here whenever you're investing so i would say it's kind of buyer beware here you know understand that it's an r d company there are no sales uh there's no debt that's great but there's no income either so um yeah you know it's just very very tricky um getting in now on the ground level yeah if that's your strategy that might not be a bad idea because if if they start mass producing and start really building up production of this thc breathalyzer and start building up sales especially in the law enforcement community where in states where adult use and medical use is legal well that could be a huge boom for the company and that could be a huge boom for the stock price um is it going to happen you know i'm not a soothsayer i i don't know i mean the run-up is uh is again because of the patent not necessarily because of the it has a massive new product on hand it's got it because it's now taken a step closer to the potential of creating a patented product that they can put on the market and sell commercially now i want to look at our cannabis watch list on money and markets our watch list continues to perform well uh average gain of our six positions just as at 34 but again you have to understand if you've been paying attention you'll see that the broader cannabis market has been hit with some pressure and that has pushed some of our stocks down slightly nothing to be alarmed at but it's just something you need to be aware of so swipes are mounted international it's up about close to 30 percent uh it was up as high as 40 percent it's paired back uh perk and elmer this is actually a company that's actually increased over over time rather than been suffered by the pullback and that's because it's a little more diversified outside of cannabis it's up about 28 since i recommended it so i put it on the watch list in uh september turning point brands this is another traditional tobacco company like schweitzer mounted uh it's up more than 65 percent uh grow generation uh this was you know was our top performer it has paired back a little bit it's still up 61 since i put it on the watch list in november i think it still has room to grow i think this is just a pullback uh i think i think it's temporary uh and i don't think it's going to last too long i i think once we start seeing hearing more cannabis in the news then i think you're going to start seeing more cannabis stock prices jump um planet 13 holdings this is the most recent addition to the watch list it has struggled not not going to kid around it's down about 11 since i added it uh and that's again because of headwinds that canada the cannabis industry is facing they got a nice run uh after the election uh both in november and then again in january now they're starting to pull back a little bit i still think there's a lot of potential long term for planet 13. i don't think it's one that it's it's not time to sell it's not time to get rid of it if you do own it uh just be steady stay the course and i think you'll be just fine and scott's miracle grow again to illustrate how stocks fluctuate when i added this to the watch list in september it dropped about 10 11 it is now up 34 since i since i recommended that price so it's at about a 44 45 swing in price since i added it so uh again it just goes to show you that you know not everything is stays the same and you just have to you know monitor your strategy and stick to your strategy which is what we do here at money markets with cannabis so with marijuana market update so just hold to it you'll be fine i'm going to keep watching things for you if there is an instance where i think that it's time maybe to back out of a position uh that you may have bought based on on the watch list i'll let you know um and i'll be the first to tell you i'll put out a video and let you know uh immediately when that should happen now you can check out my cannabis watch list on moneymarkets.com uh but there is one more thing i do want to address and this is something that uh is is not not personal but it is something i do takes very seriously i'm all about being transparent um i try to give you all the information that i have afforded to me as a research analyst and and sometimes that information uh that i see and that i that i get access to isn't necessarily correct now last week i answered a question about charlotte's web holdings incorporated and the information i told you about the company's debt that i found from research from research that i looked for was actually not accurate however you have to bear in mind that's not the reason why i told you that charlotte's web is not a buy i told you that charlotte's web is not a buy because it has no stock momentum and it's got very high volatility and it's just not one that i'd want to take a risk on right now does that potential of course they all do um but my reasoning was not because of its debt my reasoning was because of its stock performance but again i want to be very open i want to be very honest with you and tell you uh that this was an incorrect this was incorrect uh and and and explained to you why so uh you know that all aside uh it's a lesson learned but um you know again next week i'm gonna talk about another cannabis stock that's been mentioned in our youtube comments or email you can uh comment on our youtube section right below email me at feedback moneymarkets.com and let me know maybe if there's a sector or a stock you'd like me to take

AND I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO HAVE MORE OF A COMMUNITY CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE IN THE STATE OF HAWAII IS COMFORTABLE WITH. THE NEW LAW CREATES A TASK FORCE THAT WILL REVIEW OTHER STATES' LAWS AND PENALTIES -- TO SEE WHAT CHANGES MIGHT BE MADE TO HAWAII'S LAWS, GOING FORWARD. IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR THOSE WHO PREVIOUSLY WERE CONVICTED OF GET THEIR RECORDS WIPED CLEAN -- UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. THE FIRST STEP WOULD BE FOR THEM TO MAKE A REQUEST OF THE COURT.

LAUREN:", "KHfI5-b1Sas": "lawmakers may yet need to figure out what it will look like but a cannabis industry is coming to new jersey and to borrow an oft used murphism it'll happen sooner rather than later but if things were to start up today your local dispensary would likely be very low on stock if they had any at all because new jersey has a pretty robust medical cannabis program with 11 dispensaries serving what will be thousand clients any day now god willing within a year you're able to have a retail experience and potentially sooner only if if jeff and diana are convinced that there's sufficient supply uh such that that we don't eat into what is there for the medical patients there's a potential for some retail activity potential for retail activity through the medical dispensaries the jeff the governor referred to is jeff brown newly named executive director of the cannabis regulatory commission which will create the boundaries for the industry we need to keep expanding the medical industry and then we need to plan for this this new legal cannabis industry and as the governor said a lot of that's going to be sorted out in the legislation and we need to see where that falls before we can start talking about any sort of expectations we reported this week on the bumpy rollout of the initial draft of the state's cannabis enabling legislation and the fears some have about lawmakers well screwing it up folks in in government like to be the best at doing something second and the good news for new jersey is that there have been many a state that has come before that's adam gore's of columbia care a full service cannabis operation which is active in 18 markets in the u.s and the european union he's seen states get it right and states get it wrong columbia care and other providers around the state not to mention the country have been eyeing new jersey's move towards legal weed and preparing we're going to see cultivation facilities all throughout the state so from uh you know a really prominent agricultural region like vineland and cumberland county but also in places like trenton new jersey where as you know there are a lot of uh old industrial places that are well suited for the cultivation of cannabis companies like curaleaf based in belmore but planning expansion in jersey early in 2021 have been ramping up production and waiting for the state's voters to give the green light but operators point out that the medical program is their top priority amal sinha of the aclu in new jersey says many of these operators are already in position to capitalize on new jersey's marketplace he hopes the state decides to issue more even unlimited licenses we want to make sure that this is an equitable and diverse industry and that's the the most important part the industry expects to employ tens of thousands of people in new jersey once the program gets fully rolled out that's plenty of opportunity for economic growth and

doctors i go to a traditional medicine clinic with the highest stamp of approval from the government i'm here at the cannabis clinic at the ministry of health and they're saying that patients can come in here and get free cannabis oil if they qualify so i'm going to go through the process and see if i can take cannabis oil home today i check in with an app and hand over my thai id card for their tracking system they take my blood pressure and ask about my medical history and my symptoms i tell them how i've been having difficulty sleeping with that the doctor says i qualify and can take three drops of oil a day she assures me it's not much in fact you would need to take half the bottle to feel a strong high so i've just received two bottles of cannabis oil each has about 100 drops each it's been prescribed for my insomnia it took me less than 30 minutes to go through the entire process to get the oil just a few years ago using cannabis dispensing cannabis would have been completely illegal thailand's minister of health explains the government's sudden change of heart i think thai people actually were ready for this product long before my party launched this campaign we heard what thai people wanted on the campaign trail some people in your party are saying you could get up to two thousand dollars per kilogram of cannabis is that realistic this is typical economic philosophy demand and supply people will have to compete in the quality of the products so someone that comes with good seats good technologies and some kind of research and development will will have a better opportunity i ask him how far the laws will go recreational use is not the purpose our policy is we want ill people to have options in caring themselves we want another business opportunity for farmers for industrialists thailand's openness towards new laws is tied to the country's deep history with the plant traditionally thai people used cannabis to treat common ailments and spice up noodle soup but the plant has been illegal for more than 70 years and few people know how to grow it anymore i'm on the road with jamsuda nirandan who recently started a legal cannabis farm but finds it difficult to get reliable information on cultivating a high quality crop in thailand so we're on our way to meet an illegal grower called daddy dump it up island far from bangkok daddy dumb whose real name is has been secretly growing cannabis for more than 25 years he remembers a time when cannabis was commonplace on the island i was born on the island which is growing marijuana a lot at that time because fishermen they need some kind of relaxation to go and work in the sea rough sea is very stress yeah and using cannabis smoking bone it's helped them to stay out in the sea without fear he too has embraced cannabis medical properties he gives out the oils he extracts by leaving stashes at the local kanji shop for those who need it but earlier this year he was arrested for growing without a license that doesn't bother she's excited to meet him he shows jamsudani the rooftop terrace where he used to grow his plants before the police took them away from he's now awaiting trial but he says he's not worried about being sent to prison foreign she confesses that she's having difficulty with the strain she's working with is known for perfecting a strain that can perform well in thailand's humid climate and wants to continue that work what i try to to breed out now is the strain which it can grow everywhere in thailand outside not indoor and this should be good enough for medicine so it's not too expensive for regular people to try and grow [Music] were too afraid to get arrested yeah i never feel scared or afraid because i never think that it's bad i'm not kill anyone i not harm any anyone a devout buddhist he gives out his advice and his oils for free it's those seeking profit who worry him they start to do business they start to sell and then they lost their way um this plant is is gift from nature people should should learn how to grow how to use and how to help other people not to make money because if to make money is it would be bad to to our soul our mind making money is exactly what many people are banking on early investors hope that being the first to break into the market will give them a leg up thomsuda and her sister jomquan run rakjang farm in thailand's northeast they're known for their japanese melons and instagram friendly spots [Music] but now it's one of thailand's newest legal cannabis farms through a collaboration with a paipubed hospital which buys their crops their farm is well equipped with greenhouses and a legally mandated security system you have to pass locked doors and dozens of cameras before you can get a glimpse of these seedlings to abide by the rules they must keep track of [Laughter] growing cannabis also needs money and connections most farmers don't have jamsuda foreign foreign they are trying their best to keep costs down by making their own equipment and using solar power it's unclear if they'll ever turn a profit but they are ambitious i haven't [Music] i'm on my way to meet tom cruise a multi-millionaire and big time investor he's a champion of the new laws you google mr we thailand for some ungodly reason my face pops up he says while cannabis products can make big money promises that it will lift farmers out of poverty are unrealistic what do you tell the thai farmers now don't grow don't grow even if the rules and regulations are clear you got to ask yourself who am i selling the products to i feel bad for a lot of people that are being lied to right because everybody wants it's like it's like the gold rush right everybody went in and says gee let's go dig for gold and they end up with a lot of rocks is it just politics legally on a medical part we kept the promise if you really need it you can come and get it for free in regard to the economics of it i think we're still a little weak on that is it all politics what in life isn't [Music] it's been a month since we met apichat and wasana at the temple i check in on them um he tells me he's gained three kilograms he even cracks a smile when i ask if the oil makes him higher they don't know if the cancer is gone but like so many involved with the cannabis industry in thailand they are hopeful", "KzSNbOGNBjU": "[Applause] you know I wanted to start this talk here in beautiful Marin County California by introducing you to the single most sought after demographic in modern cannabis now this one person or persona as we call it in public relations is the one who's being marketed to buy every single brand in California and beyond and as I said I wanted to introduce you to her but it turns out you actually already know her because we the cannabis industry call her the Marin mom and you know what the miranne mom she's up here working hard in Marin County of course she's taking care of her kids she's driving 80 percent of her family's household spending and every day as my colleagues and I strategize on positioning our clients in the marijuana and CBD interest industries in front of the biggest decision-makers and can a curious audiences out there we ask ourselves what's the marin mom reading what informs her buying decisions and why does she do what she does all right a little bit of Honor audience interactivity here really quick so I'm gonna say a word I want you to say that word back to me on a three count so of course the word is marijuana one two three marijuana okay one more time one two three marijuana much better what does that make you think of because to me I used to think of Amsterdam and High Times Magazine but now it's 2019 I'm thinking about Marin County I'm thinking about bone Appetit because legalization is the most significant drug policy shift of our lifetimes and it's bringing on unexpected challenges and opportunities that affect us all even if you don't consume speaking of demographics I'm a lifelong journalist and after 20-plus years working at daily newspapers I decided to get into public relations and now I own my own agency based out of Denver I flew from Denver to San Francisco yesterday and it's funny San Francisco and Denver were both cannabis capitals you know we've witnessed everything from prohibition to legalization and in many ways you can't tell this story without at least acknowledging of course reefer madness which was such a successful propaganda campaign that really changed the game here and across the entire world for 80 years they told us that marijuana would make addicts out of our children and they also told us linking us with warnings that marijuana was going to lead to murder it would lead to rape and it would lead to one of the biggest crime waves you've ever seen according to Nancy Grace but as you know none of that has actually happened in the regulated legal markets that now dominate most of North America so what are the actual unintended consequences of legal cannabis let's talk about a couple of them as they relate to ourselves our kids and future generations starting with ourselves because let's be real and honest some of us in this room consume legal cannabis right give me some raised hands alright I see you and some of us don't and that's okay and we all coexist together at work at home on the roads and highways but you know what's terrifying if I were to give a drug test right now to every single person in this theater which mind you I'm not I wouldn't do that to you but if I were there is no actual way that we could tell how high any of you are right now it sounds like a STONER joke a bad STONER joke but it's not and for a variety of reasons primarily because cannabis is fat-soluble modern medicine and modern science have not yet figured out a way to accurately determine THC intoxication not from blood tests urine tests saliva tests or even breathalyzers and so police looking to detect weed duis are mostly relying on field sobriety tests like sir can you touch your nose but meanwhile everyone Riis that the blood test used to determine quote stoned driving in most legal states has absolutely no scientific merit and this comes from law enforcement this comes from the medical community it's scary because that means you can get a DUI when you're actually not under the influence and even worse you can actually get fired from your job for the same reason regardless of your level of actual intoxication and yet cannabis is kind of legal here right kind of alright so moving on to the next and I have a question for you because what about the kids if you've been paying attention from just say no to this is your brain on drugs you know that cannabis will kill an entire generation of you this right that's what we've been told because the prohibitionists battle cry for decades has been what about the kids and they would ask this as they hypothesized that teen use would skyrocket as cannabis became suddenly more available back in the pre legalization days not that long ago we just didn't know the answer to this question and so lawmakers they wrote strict laws learning from underage purchases at liquor stores and designated cannabis dispensaries as age restricted environments regulators wrote careful rules about advertising all but promising that we would learn the lessons from Joe Camel and more recently Joule and ideally make cannabis a more responsible industry than our tobacco predecessors and everybody these law enforcement and regulators and even the cannabis industry has come together given the research that cannabis use is not great for the developing brain and so we are encouraging these teenagers to not consume until they're 21 or 25 now we are six years almost into the regulated adult use market and the single biggest gift that we have based on this timing is the public health data that we've wanted for so long and the answers to some of these questions and so this public health data which is coming from multiple state health departments in addition to the federal government it all shows that teen marijuana use is not increasing after legalization it's level in many of these states and it's actually decreasing in others which is just fantastic news and this real world data is actually forcing the prohibitionists to change their narratives and that's everything that we've been asking for is to have a fact-based conversation so what about the kids if you ask me about the kids and granted it is still early we need at least 10 15 years to have a better idea but based on five years of state and federal public health data I'll quote my friend Roger Daltrey and say the kids are all right so maybe we should channel some of that thought some of that energy into exploring this plants untapped potential and let's start with these three important facts that I want all of you to know because we have barely scratched the surface in terms of researching the marijuana and the hemp plants there is infinitely more that we don't know than what we do know that said the world's most respected medical journals as well as scientific organizations are in absolute agreement that marijuana and its derivatives are legitimate efficacious medicine especially for those suffering from chronic pain severe nausea epilepsy and other conditions and lastly it is impossible to overdose on cannabis and it is significantly less addictive than opioids and so as I look to these future generations I'll focus on the research happening right now because this research we don't know what it's going to tell us but there are early indications that it's encouraging and this research like it or not is another one of these unintended consequences of legalizing this plant medicine and I promise it will transform lives and the years to come I do want to start with PTSD which affects more than 25 million Americans and has been described as quote watching a scary movie and you're on edge the entire time except that's your life every day every hour you're literally afraid of everything it sounds so awful and what if cannabis can help with that what about spasticity which also affects millions of Americans including so many people suffering from cerebral palsy ALS and multiple sclerosis and one ms patient recently recalled he described spasticity as feeling like quote a steel rod running up my hamstrings what if cannabis can help with that and what about inflammation which affects one out of every five Americans no cannabis will not cure these chronic inflammatory diseases that kill so many but what if it can help what if it can be part of the solution and improve one's quality of life at a time when they really need it it helps that marijuana is already a proven anti-inflammatory and we're learning more every every year so of course there are some negative and even harmful consequences of legal weed including the industry's unsustainable energy consumption and some individuals developing dependence on an addiction to marijuana but when we think about the biggest change for our communities that legalization has made here in the Bay Area back in my home state of Colorado I would very much encourage you to look around what do you see because I think if you give it a hard look you'll agree with me that the single biggest outcome of legalization is that these doomsday scenarios that have been predicted by the prohibitionists never ever materialized and that's huge when you think of it because think about everything we were told regarding cannabis legalization and how it was going to ruin these communities it's interesting because it absolutely reminds me of one of my favorite childhood books and that is the Monster at the End of this book and this is about Grover our friend from Sesame Street and he narrates this book and he's terrified because he knows there's a monster at the end of this book and he doesn't want you to turn the page and so Grover is employing everything in his ability from his tying pages together with a rope he's nailing them together with a hammer and nails he's building a brick wall and of course the reader and Grover get to the end of this book realizing that the monster is of course Grover now 10 20 40 years ago nobody knew what it would be like if we legalized adult use cannabis that said a vocal and powerful minority taught us and trained us to fear this plant they trained us to fear this plant and that said the Monster at the End of this book which is about cannabis legalization and psilocybin decriminalization and progressive drug policy reform the Monster at the End of this book isn't only one segment of the populace it's not just the prohibitionists really it's all of us because we are the monsters that project fear and Prejudice onto the unknown we are the monsters who are easily manipulated by misinformation stemming from authority the prohibitionists were begging us not to turn the page on legal marijuana and yet we did and I would argue that it's one of the smartest things that we the people have done in a generation thank you very much [Applause] [Music] [Applause]", "mlQ9AFjsVK8": "so what it is you got in front of viewing what you're about to do well I am in quite a lot of pain right now my chest really hurts my legs sounds weird to say but they're nothing but painful at the same time generally not feeling that great so I'm just about to medicate myself with some cannabis I mean this is kind of the newest and most effective and efficient way of getting cannabinoids into my system quickly here I have some hash oil that I made so this is basically just the concentrated trichome heads of of cannabis plants so it's without any other plant matter just the cannabinoids just the medicine and this is a rig this way is very efficient because it's very concentrated and it's also much healthier than smoking it because you don't have any of the combustion that you'd normally have of all the plant matter there is no plant matter here it's all just can have annoyed so it's much healthier in that one little bit there's the same amount that it would take me you know a whole joint and then there for half an hour maybe two smoke right of this you get it in one concentrated here I can understand why people might be a bit put off by the way that this looks like it doesn't look like this is medicine this looks like this is drugs but no this is this is the easiest and best way to get the most amount of cannabinoids into my system so that I'm not in pain anymore so that you know I have a better quality of life and you know it works and that's a dad I'm Clark and I'm 27 years old I live in Redding in Berkshire I'm an ancient history and archaeology graduate and I was diagnosed with MS in 2010 I'm literally like I can't escape it and like if I want to be well and I want to feel like a man or you have to use cannabis well I have tried lots of pharmaceuticals and they make me worse than made me feel like [ __ ] but I found that across the board cannabis helps with all of my symptoms it means that my legs are less tight so helps with my spasticity it dramatically reduces my pain it improves my mood and blows my my depression it and brings me out of like like really low times and it can stop me from having tremors and spasms when I have them it generally can like pretty much pick me up when I'm just really feeling awful I can often I can consume some cannabis and then I feel much better to extent where I'm not in as much discomfort completely not in there near as much discomfort gives me something back that ms took away it has just that much of an impact it does improve my quality of life undoubtedly I had a treatment of cannabis oil in America and I've you know experienced the level of of remission that that gave me like it meant I didn't need my walking stick again it meant that I could I was like here I struggle with a craft the Hera's climbing up cliffs see that was the difference so when I was over there I was using it orally so I was taking it in capsules so like the recommended course is a gram a day for 60 days and that that's what I did I came back and I didn't use a walking stick for quite a while as well I was definitely feeling better for some time after it's like in the long term I'm hopefully going to be able to make it so that I can use the oil again and therefore I think it's not unreasonable war I'm realistic for me to say I well I want to be in the 20% and I get there because I know that there's a medicine out there that essentially gets me better so yeah that's what I'm going for I think the law is wrong I think that it's an unjust law it's not based in science is based in stigma and you know used to be accepted that a woman didn't get a vote it used to be accepted that we could have slaves it used to be accepted that we could be abusive and gay people in prison for me I was standing up for my rights to live under standing up for my right to be myself like and if that means that I have to go to prison for to stand up for that right and that's something that I do because ultimately that's more important to me then subjugate myself to someone else as well when I disagree with what they're trying to tell me we're not well when I know that what they're trying to tell me is a lie why should I do that why should anyone do that why should anyone have to do that I'm not saying everyone should take cannabis that's not what I'm saying I'm saying to reduce the harm it needs to be taken out the hands of the criminal black market and through proper harm reduction techniques through legalization and regulation through licensing and probably you know kids can't get hold of drugs if they're sold by a licensed person that will lose their license if they sell them drugs just like alcohol you know it's easier for kids of a certain age to get hold of drugs then it is alcohol simply because they don't have to show ID to a dealer know yeah I think when a law is wrong you have a moral responsibility to stand up to it it's wrong it's unjust and that's what I'm doing you know since I was diagnosed haven't really been able to do as much and I guess what I enjoy doing now is his activism really generally that's kind of what I live for it's what I wake up and I check that's what I do it makes me feel like I can't do that much but what I can do is actually worthwhile or might not be able to spend as much time doing it as of what as someone who was well but through being able to have access to the Internet it has given me you know a sense of purpose in life really I guess I'll do activism because I think it's the right thing to do things have changed things are changing one day they're gonna turn on and go oh I was wrong I can't wait for that day it's gonna happen wait when will that be I don't know you live like that's a difficult question in the UK it's a very difficult question because we don't have the ability to change the laws like certain states in the u.s. are able to change local laws and get cannibus legalized on a local level but for us it's either all or nothing so it's you know it's gonna be difficult and the cannabis campaign movement is really quite young although we have had a history of campaigning in the UK is kind of done it died out and lately is only just I had to be reignited things only just starting to like come together and people were getting organized and trying to make things happen again so to be honest I'd like to be a law-abiding citizen of other than cannabis I don't break them or you know I don't go robbing people we don't go Steven things or or breaking into people's houses or no no I do you know I mean it's just I use a hub to treat my illness but apparently that makes me a criminal so it would be nice to not be a criminal but not be considered criminal by my government because I don't kiss in my crib myself a criminal I'm in it yeah however long it takes no politics because I messed doesn't go just go away like I'm but I live it every day I can't I can't not be in it live it every single day [Music] I instantly got involved with the activism stuff when I found out the truth about kind of if I was just outrageous but how could I have not had this medicine given to me as such when it when so many people around the world already know about it when it is a when it could be available when it used to be available in this country my own illness would never have been as bad as it was if I had been able to access cannabis Crohn's disease is like waking up every morning but the most intense nausea that you can imagine a lot of the time you do throw up a lot of time you have to wake up and you run to the toilet because you're gonna have diarrhea and you will for the next two hours in me I hope having really bad unfortunately I do have access to go and make access to myself with cannabis and that helps me keeping reassuring but it can be really awful [Music] the gaffer just got me on the radio and said Follow the Leader ease get the mobile number how many people expected so we need to know because people wait in the sidelines GPS gets bigger than 50 plus then we'll be coming down on this smell kind of bees that gives us browse to search it okay so what's your name we don't want to lose not only fast we still want people to turn up who doesn't want anyone to get in trouble or anything so we're just gonna carry on we can still have a protest about cannabis without having to have it to smoke here cannabis is what's called a Schedule one Class B drug so Class B means that it's the penalties that you attract for possessing it are up to seven years in prison and up to 14 years in prison for dealing it Schedule one means that it has its considers are having no zero medical value [Music] we've distinct the current law surrounding cannabis and the way people who use cannabis we just think they're it's wrong Dickerman tires were criminalized just for using a plant which is scientifically proven to be safer than alcohol or tobacco they're both legally recreational drugs from it for me life um if I'm having like pains or cramps it's like within seconds they'll just they'll just disappear it makes that much of a difference like without cannabis I might have to go to the toilet 20 times a day there's certainly a growing movement at the moment of people and organizations who want to achieve legal access to cannabis for adults and legal access to cannabis for medicinal purposes for everybody and people want that for a variety of reasons I mean one is that people are using cannabis at the moment sadly illegally with a threat of prosecution you know as a medicine but I am pushing it forward because I decided that the time has come for awareness and I think the law needs to be examined to grow my own organically to medicate myself wait you have to get [ __ ] know people my name is Michele Michele and X I got I couldn't get my head around it it was like it was an illegal drug you know you can't do this it you druggie you know you're wasting your time taking drugs and other people would be like you know if I was in your pain I'd want to get high all the time you know it's like that's what you they think we're floating around in some kind of like hazy hay world you know all as a camera you know but it's not true it doesn't affect us like that it it doesn't affect us in that way at all all it does is bring clarity to what we're already putting up with but just get non-consumers to also say you know yeah I don't consume it myself but I have no problem you know I would accept it if the laws were changed I have no problem with people using cannabis so that's what we really need there's so much stigma around us and there's that sustained a stereotype which sort of alienates us from from normal society so it's the case of normalizing it so that people feel that it's more acceptable for them to say oh well I agree with what you're doing and I think people need to need to see this and need to be aware of it and this is certainly one way of you know individuals coming together locally and showing their support for a national and a global movement which is gaining momentum day by day she the major flaw with prohibiting any substance is that if people like to take that substance for whatever reason somebody will supply to them people like to think of this as the war on drugs I think it's actually a war on people by alienating them by criminalizing by a punishing room for something that either is not doing them or anybody else any harm and that's just unjust my name is Luke was he come down here from the protest to try and reform the laws of the cannabis at the moment I've opened D skinned up a joint front of police and they decided to me I mean I have tried to discuss with them the fact that we're not causing any harm you know I've covered a lot a lot of the topics about the issues around it and that smoking cannabis and growing cannabis and using cannabis certainly for personal use should not be a crime it should not be illegal it should be at the very least decriminalized if not legalized and the police I've you know the police don't want to give us their personal opinions because they are here representing the police force so that's the way it is [Music] this is an issue where the political realm isn't going to take the lead so the grassroots activism is so needed it couldn't be any more needed it's held reform happened in America she's just cogent responses to the problem something has to have gone wrong somewhere where there's a criminalization on people that are already suffering and they're already on the fringes of society the fact that they're having to put themselves out there open their lives up like a book just so that people can take a quick glance and assess oh yeah you're you're worthy of not being a criminal it's quite a horrible position that the law is puttin them in so you know we're nowhere near there where we need to be yeah any situation which is as big as the as Canada's prohibition is it's not gonna change overnight and it's not gonna be solved instantly but we've definitely taken a few decent steps towards the right direction of trying to end it and trying to do something about the fact that we all think cannabis prohibition is wrong so Clark his life is now kind of painting for himself and others should not be a criminal and it's the same as anybody else that's got cancer MSME crimes I just don't want to be a criminal for taking something that completely enhances their life and it is it really boils down to a life or death issue it may not be a in terms of a fatal position but when you have an illness which is a living death anything to get you a little bit of relief on that given day it's something you have to give serious consideration to [Music] but they found a lesions in my brain and they then did a second MRI scan few months later which showed more lesions in my brain which I basically completely proved it's definitely a mess the first feeling when I was when I was speaking to the neurologist and when you go money actually said you know you you do have MS I'm sorry to say you do have MS I was like right cool what do we do you know I was kind of finally relieved that I wasn't making it up you know there was actually something wrong with me and from this point on I could do something about it rather than not knowing my mom and my dad split when I was 1 and then my mum remarried when I was 7 to my stepdad Richard and Richard had multiple sclerosis and my mom also has multiple sclerosis so I've kind of lived with the disease and seeing it in the people that closest to me like all my life [Music] Oh as digested also I'm upset it's not there the time has been loving with this but then I was I'm gonna do it he Matador I got it from but he's got to be great from me so that's it sighs killed I feel my speed I forget they'd have messed up his life unfortunately when I was 11 Richard passed away [Music] is definitely the biggest influence of my life anyone he's medical cannabis around me when I was a child and I saw the difference I made if you know this when you didn't live with someone that has and that's that badly and you see and you see I'm being an agony you see them not being able to move you see the legs tightening and shaking and then you see them go out smoke joint can then come back in and be normal be able to converse be able to like just talk normally he's a massive part my life without like I don't know so I would don't think I'd be the person I am if it wasn't him but before I was diagnosed with illness I did have quite a lot of things and I did do a lot of different stuff I used to be pretty active I used to be live music promoter doing degree and in a band you know we went around the UK playing shows it it wasn't you it was fun you know but since it has made life a lot more difficult and it has meant that I've really had to kind of pick and choose but the things that are most important to me and do them and when I can actually do things so we have been friends going on 12 years now so I think of him like a brother you know if he feels something he'll just he'll just say he's quite sharp and straight to the point and I like to about him you know if he gets bit down or whatever I try to remind him of that like that personality that quality he has of just being able to sit someone down even if it's not a good conversation or anything but he's not scared to do that he will and he's always got a point you know so you kind of like listen to him because usually he's right he's been so positive and so dynamic in a way looking into trying to find the truth as a boy he believes and he puts a lot of energy and thought into a third a couple of his meetings about standing up could be 80 people or so yeah anything he talks so we use our being so clearly and so positively do you know if you're gonna get better or or worse no I don't know that's part of the problem they have of everyone with MS faces is the fact that nobody knows like it is it is more likely that it will get worse then it will get better and it's also could just stay the same so I think there's about a 60% chance it will get worse a 20% chance they will get about our and a 20% chance of same thing so I'm going for the 20% game better he really gets on his life now I'm here in London to the UK I take medical cannabis prescribed by my doctors in the Netherlands and this is medicine this is standardized it's pure it's consistent each pot you open is the same in the UK the only medicinal form of cannabis that has been licensed is Sativex and Sativex is an extract of a particular cannabis strain and it contains THC and cannabidiol it's indications are quite limited it's only limited indicated for spasticity which which but it wears it probably does have a broader impact on other symptoms of multiple sclerosis particular like pain and sleep but the regulatory system in this country is so constraining that it was only able to get his license form for spasticity here I have chronic pain syndrome which means that I'm in constant pain 24 hours a day seven days a week I have a permanent you detach that shoulder there is no cure there is nothing that will ever help the only thing that does relieve even the remotest bit of pain a little shape just a little trip going up well I fly out to California from my third time now I'm going to have a look at the industry again like and and meet up with old friends and one enjoy myself and get some access to some decent medicine and to immerse myself from the industry because I think that's what's giving me a lot of the drive to do what I do is go into California and seeing the industry working there [Music] [Music] my name is Chris Haggerty I'm an assistant manager of the trim crew which is as you see everything behind us and now where we're going is strictly outdoor nothing but outdoor and these are the big plants these are the big boys I have to walk through the jungle a little bit all right this is the plane we're gonna be taking down it's called ISS which is just the abbreviation for island Suites go how it starts off as it comes out from the outdoor we get the big plants and then we hang them up we weigh them and after we weigh them we cut them down and we bring them to the trim table behind us that does the D leafing and the sweet leaves that they used when they cut the weed and the Leafs are falling into the tray they take those Leafs and use it for to make hash so every part of the plants getting used so what they're doing is they're taking their scissors and they're going and cutting all the Leafs every leaf has a point on it and they have to be tipped and there's also stuff that we call crow's feet or whale tails on the bottom of the plant so we have to take those off as well because they're not they don't have any medicine use or anything like that it's more trash so they're using the Fiskars they're called and they just sit there very meticulously and get every single leaf off as fast and efficient as they can and making it look - when you go to the dispensary and you buy it you're seeing what they do like that's the finished product that they come out with is what people are buying on the shelves [Music] I'm a hand trimmer I cut the buds by hand with my trusty scissors I do enjoy the hand Sherman just because it's a it's a it's a strange experience it's a zen-like experience too really get in the detail of the bud and get a manicure each piece I also enjoy like thinking about how many patients are gonna get to enjoy this bud like how many people that this is gonna make its gonna make their day better I I go through like 1,500 to 2,000 grams of trimming per day so it's gonna be that's gonna be making a lot of people happy and then what we do is we enter it in a computer so we have you know access to it at all times and then after that we could rack it up and while we while we hang it on the racks is so that every plant is wet when you cut it down and every plant needs to be turned upside down and when it turns upside down it's taking all the THC and everything and bringing it into the buds and out of the stems so by doing that it's hanging and making the wheat stronger more potent and that's why we do that and then stick it in the Cure and then they cure the wheat until it goes out on the shelves [Music] so basically here we have river rock the whole the actual real dispensary what the patients see what they deal with when they come in it's just it's a shopping experience the patient can come in and talk to a budtender and they can ask to see very specific things and about 10 it can pull that out and let them get a closer inspection of it in the first case of the medicine we have the top flight strains then you have a case full of just the indicas and a case of just sativas to kind of to separate everything for patients in a very easy way [Music] [Music] my name is Tracy I'm 27 years old I have lived in Denver for about a year and a half now and I absolutely love it I actually moved here for medicinal marijuana and moving here and being able to have access to medical marijuana has been a pretty amazing experience for myself river rock actually helps me through a lot of bad times like whenever I'm feeling that or down or so I come in here the employees in here are really nice they joke around make me feel like make me feel good about myself instead of trying to put me down or stuff like that and they have the best weed in Colorado when I say you know I'm having trouble with anxiety or I'm having trouble sleeping they know exactly what to pull out they have that education and that knowledge I use cannabis because my back I have a slip disc in my back and I and I had a tumor in my head I was when I first came in here my tumor was golf-ball-sized now my tumor is so uh peanut size being able to come somewhere like this instead of you know in some back-alley crazy place where someone I don't even know this is this is a much more comfortable family type environment they know my name they they know what my problem is and they take care of it had a quite an in-depth tour of the entire process we got a chance to have a view on and it was really really interesting really good to see and really really inspiring to make it happen back home it was like a pharmacy but for cannabis and it really was and it's really good to see patients getting a medicine that worked for them and getting the choice that they have they're like you know you go in and you've got 50 different strains of flowers to choose from like any patient is guaranteed to find something that's gonna work for them and in that range like they've got edibles they've got tinctures they've got concentrates they've got everything under the Sun that you could imagine that would be made out of cannabis they pretty much got it and patients in the UK should have that access and that level of access to be well because there were people here but if they go there it's cool river rock wellness for a reason because they make people well again you know I don't really want to go home to be honest but I guess I have to my stay is is coming to an end soon so [Music] [Music] medical marijuana legal in the state since 1996 the industry as you see it now I began probably around a decade ago when there was a state law passed by the legislature following up the voter initiative made it not entirely legal but a little bit more legal to have storefront dispensaries here in San Francisco you had Dennis Franz selling cannabis openly before the medical marijuana law passed at that place in that and at that time you in the Castro in the early 90s would have been politically infeasible to crackdown on marijuana entirely and so that's how people like Dennis were able to do what he did even though in flagrant violation of every law on the books local and state but people in San Francisco yeah there's absolutely a living legend of the cannabis movement alive and well right now at the Castro Castle and we have AIDS in San Francisco from a six by six radius of this area in his house 38,000 people died they had what they call a wasting syndrome where people who aren't hungry they didn't eat now I want to give him the munchies and it ease their pain so over that purposes it was great for AIDS patients until 1996 yeah dude every new everything I did was to legalize marijuana the medicine I sponsored proposition 215 that would be wife medical marijuana initiative now it's 20 states and I believe in marijuana and most people like it I believe in it look because people are going to jail sick people go to jail this is wrong I am I am the guy and led them to ever it's the swamp the prohibition and Blair Georgia returns I'm proud of it and I hope they continued on to the end of prohibition we never seen again in California all you need is a recommendation from your doctor nothing more than a piece of paper saying that they recommend marijuana for a serious medical condition [Music] I'm Juliana and I'm the founder of auntie Dolores co-op based here in California for a medical cannabis bakery people love edibles especially if they need higher potency medicine and they're maybe not getting what they need by just smoking or by just vaping it's a way to kind of supplement your intake and so we always kind of tell people that's a great way to get the medicine in your system and have it in there for a good six to eight hours just because for pain management alone I do feel it's a bit superior to just smoking for us it's great because we get feedback from patients and I mean from MS patients to cancer patients you name it I mean we get emails you know seeing how much cannabis has helped them and I mean that's why we do this it's just it's amazing [Music] well if you're using the product as medicine you need to know what you're putting into your body you need to know how strong the products are you need to know the the CBD and the THC levels so if if you're only using the product for recreational use then CBD really has no benefit for you if you have a social disorder and you need something that really gets you out and gets you interacting with people then you're gonna want something that's higher in THC so you're gonna need to know the balances in those you're gonna need to know which products are better for you for your ailments just knowing something is there that you can't see is a big thing for our patients right so if you were to go to a place that doesn't lab test and they look at a product that looks pristine and then it goes to the lab and it fails the mold test you have no idea that what's going into your body if it wasn't tested so if you were getting that product off the streets or if you were going to some of the lower market clubs that aren't testing their medicine that as a patient that's something that you need to know [Music] three years ago I could barely walk I was needing a wheelchair just to get to my hospital appointments I was diagnosed with MS and I was given the option of using Tysabri a form of chemotherapy which is usually reserved for people with MS I've had it for over 10 years as a second-line treatment you know I could barely do anything I could couldn't hold my bladder or my bowels I couldn't you know its stammer and talk barely be able to sleep I I could I couldn't walk I would be on eleven different prescription medications probably more now from all the different ones that they would have given me to counteract all the side effects from those medications but you know I didn't take that option I didn't go down that that route I knew there was a better a better way I knew that cannabis was a medicine underneath that cannabis could help me and and Here I am three years on well able to walk again and I'm gonna walk over the Golden Gate Bridge just to prove that cannabis is a medicine and just to prove that I can do it and just to prove just to prove that we need it back in the UK the truth in general has had massive impact on me I've learned a lot of things from meaning of the people that I've met and I've also been a lot better personally like in my own my own illness and my own problems dramatically reduced since I've been here and had full access to medical cannabis I've stopped using my walking stick that didn't take didn't take that long for me to stop using it and stop needing it really I've pretty much taken it upon myself to ingest as many cannabinoids as I physically can and that has had a had a massive beneficial effect on meal I feel much more well I feel able to do a lot more yeah I still have my bad days and it's not perfect by any means but my level of no my quality of life has dramatically improved dramatically improved we're close to halfway now my legs definitely aching but I'm determined to carry on going yeah it doesn't feel great if I'm honest but [ __ ] it let's do it I've got I'm doing this to try and prove right I've proved a point so I can be a little uncomfortable along the way I expected it [Music] all the things that I want to want to see in the UK happening here like money is spending on cannabis and then that money is taxed and then that tax money then goes into how all the people of California so actually helps the economy it stimulates the economy it provides jobs that provides a lot of jobs for a lot of different people across the board [Music] so making the impossible possible the story of the Golden Gate Bridge pretty thing right now we were just walking past a little display about how it was pretty impossible for them to build a bridge and that kind of resonates with me right now because it was pretty impossible for me to walk over it so there we go it's just interesting making the impossible possible [Music] you [Music] I'm Neil watts I used to be a police officer I spent 14 years working undercover on drugs operations well police same drugs in this country costs us 14 billion pounds a year the biggest proportion of that 14 billion pounds is actually policing cannabis oh my my my name is John Lee playing I'm a medical cannabis patient I've suffered most of my adult life from anxiety and depression I'm 47 years old I have a wife and child and I benefit and manage my symptoms with medical cannabis I was I was just sat down watching some football over there there was a really really big big big bang on the window just there and I was getting I to be honest I can't remember the exact words but I think it was something along the lines of open the door open the door we can smell cannabis open the door the phrase that is used right across the country by briefing sergeants everywhere is course on fear go in hard rush in lots of shouting don't stop shouting until you've secured the place everyone in there is trussed up and handcuffed and you've got control of that place and you know you've got control of that premises and as soon as I got that far I had it hang tough metal and Katherine [Music] and basically they wrestled me to the ground in there and I explained yes I am growing cannabis in the house so I admitted this right away and I explained that I use it as medication they had to search the house I was arrested and taken away and stuck in a cell for 20 or so hours while I let them know that police station that I suffered from anxiety and please because I was gonna have a problem being locked in the cell you know without some form of medication I asked them a little bit cheekily whether I could have some of my grow back because that would be perfect but nevertheless asked for the nurse because I would have needed to talk about my anxiety and there didn't answer my call for the entire evening you know in the entire night they just kept me locked up the law does not distinguish in any way between the organized crime groups who are using violence to intimidate and they're growing for the profit that they can get and somebody and there are a great many people who grow cannabis as medicine the law doesn't distinguish between the two and yeah I probably told them everything that they wanted in it and I was probably totally and utterly over honest because all I want to do is advice and my solicitor tell them everything so did what if they charged me with something that is going to result in a in a jail sentence because for the crime and that I may have committed you know they can they can put you down for up to 14 years what right have the police got on behalf of the government to interfere in the private lives of individuals now clearly they have got the right if you're talking about stopping somebody from assaulting another citizen or from stealing their property but I think we've really got to ask ourselves the question have they got the right to break into somebody's home if they're growing a few cannabis plants to deal with their multiple sclerosis or to ease the pains they've got from cancer to help them regain their appetite and this seems to me to be completely against the spirit of what the police are there to do one statistic though I was drawn to recently is that there is estimated 300,000 cannabis grows in this country that's to cannabis grows for every police officer so the idea that you can actually stop it is ridiculous should we really be deploying our police force there to serve and protect on this hugely expensive task which isn't delivering benefits but is damaging hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives every year it's a very very serious question that we need to address now why should point out is the vast majority of cannabis factories are actually run by organized crime the same organized crime groups prey on those individuals who grow themselves they follow people from color from grow shops they pay people for information of who is ordering stuff by mail order they prey on people who are trying to medicate themselves I had a small little tent in my spare bedroom in the house that I was living in at the time it's about midnight just before midnight as a knock at the door I could see a couple of figures through the glass and I just thought oh it just must be somebody unknown the as soon as we touched the door handle that was it as soon as they heard that click bang by four people in balaclavas through my front door yeah they sort of forced their way in I did start fighting trying to hit them back and stuff yeah ended up getting sort of punched to the ground I couldn't breathe and I yeah by generally that was the closest I think I've ever come to thinking I was gonna die or actually dying or being seriously hurt you know all for a few ounces of weed the real genuine unpleasant crimes that are going on within the world of cannabis can't even be reported because if they did they'd incriminate themselves so vulnerable people again are getting abused by gangsters and they can't even be protected by the state [Music] so this was my first ever time at spannabis I've never been before and I wasn't really quite sure what to expect of I've heard that it's quite big but I was quite blown away with how huge it is it's a huge Convention Centre just full of the cannabis industry there we counted and there was 45 different seed companies that had booths there that's just the seed companies you know there's hydroponic shops there was different grow light technologies there was nutrient technologies there was like people advertising different Expos they were across the board the industry was there representing and it was it was huge it was massive there was thousands of people there on the Saturday it was so busy it was it was insane so it was really great to see and it was really proved to me that how massive the industry is gonna be once we do end prohibition of cannabis in the UK because here where they have slightly better rules where the law is slightly more able to provide people with cannabis you know it's not legal here completely but it's much more tolerated and much easier than it is in the UK in Spain in order to legalize the consumption and possession of cannabis it must be based in a private location whether is your private house or a private club an association is pretty much that a private cannabis club and that's a way that the law in Spain allows consumers to legally acquire and consume cannabis contrary to what many people believe the possession of cannabis on the street it's illegal in one respect everything is legal from the door in but then on the other hand we keep playing cat in the mouse with with the cops it's not a perfect situation here there's still a lot of work to be done but it's a lot further than it is in the UK and it does mean that people do have access to cannabis and it doesn't mean people do have places to go where they can consume it and kind of know that they're safe consuming it there it means that there's a level of quality control it means that there's no different type so you you know you get a menu of different strains with different concentrates with edibles and all that kind of thing in the allows for that which you know simply we just don't get in the UK but there's lots of different things from the different systems that I think need to be put in place and none of them have got it perfect that's that that's the thing that I think I've taken most from from my travels and from seeing all this every Association in Spain is a nonprofit organization so we're not or not II know what you were not in a position to pay taxes even though even if we wanted to the the model of the Association may not be perfect but one thing is doing is is pretty much eradicating the black market in the head of the cannabis black market in Spain and it's eliminating the connection between the drug the average drug dealer that was handling also cocaine and MDMA and it's pretty much disconnecting that from cannabis I love the way you have the clubs here work I love the fact that they're more discreet like whereas in Amsterdam you know the coffee shops are very in-your-face very like you know they have their doors open their windows open the smoke billowing out and it smells all on the street here it's not like that at all yeah the club will have a little logo on the front but you're gonna have to go through several doors to get in it's going to have a ventilation system so that it doesn't smell outside and it gives that kind of level of respect to the neighborhood which I really really like and I really really think that if we do have what sorry when we do have cafes or coffee shops or whatever we are going to have in the in the UK that's something that really feel need to be implemented [Music] believe or not cannabis is not actually legal in the Netherlands what we have is a tolerance Act so the Cadore bolide or goodwill Act essentially made cannabis tolerable what that meant was it's not legal but there is an agreement that police will not arrest you and you won't go to jail for using cannabis I can go to a coffee shop they are allowed once again not legal but allowed meaning no one will be arrested to sell me five grams of weed and they are allowed to have 500 grams at any given time now the weird thing is and it's kind of tough for some people to grasp and even tough sometimes for myself to grasp um coffee shops are allowed to sell weed no one absolutely no one is allowed to grow weed and sell it to a coffee shop the way it went when I started in in my first coffee shop was in 1991 in the first weeks a hundred percent of what I sold was smuggled into Holland hash on Jamaicans anti weed and then after a couple of months I too like my hands on some good night a weed from Amsterdam because there was not enough being grown for the Amsterdam coffee shop so you really had to find it and then I started to get some people interested to grow it for me and things like that well he is later 75 percent of my cells was homegrown marijuana instead of a hundred percent a contraband that meant that the money that went to Morocco and Afghanistan was getting less and the money that were being made by growing marijuana stayed in the Dutch economy though that was a very good thing coffee shops they either just magically get their weed I guess if you're see no evil hear no evil or the reality is the coffee shops thereby have to be supported by so-called criminals because essentially anyone who cultivates cannabis indoors or on a commercial scale is a criminal you know I'm not like saying we are the example for the world or whatever but we bring in 400 million euros in Texas every year and I think that all the European countries especially the countries in crisis should benefit by legalizing marijuana that unique growers you need people in outlets whatever outlets to sell it so it employs a lot of people and it brings in tax money why don't you legalize it and tax it like in California it was bankrupt and they're coming back alive because they allowed growing of Mariano in Texas what's your relationship like with me and my dad had a very kind of strange relationship at the moment I mean for a few years we were quite close and we did speak to each other quite a lot but but more recently since I've been more involved with the Canada stuff he's kind of step back a little bit and doesn't really doesn't really like or approve of what I do I mean I honestly thought it to be brutally honest when it came to me being diagnosed with MS he wasn't there for me you didn't see how bad I was he didn't see the fact that I needed a wheelchair to the to my hospital appointments he didn't see me not being able to like get to the toilet whatever he's called me a day druggie before and that cut deep so since that I don't even know if he realizes how much that hurt me since he called me that I've kind of liked being a bit switched off towards him as well I got back from California and I had a little booklet called multiple sclerosis and medical marijuana so I tried to get him to read that just wasn't wouldn't have any a bit like my sister's like had completely turned off to the art to it as well like you know they go you know that's all you ever want to talk about it's like well this because my it's my life what else can I talk about when my entire life is actually changed by this plan you expect me to not talk about that you expect me to be quiet about that and it frankly the fact that they don't believe me just shows how little respect they have for me because if they actually respected my opinion maybe they go or hang in a minute if he's putting his entire life into this maybe there might be something in it maybe we should trust him maybe his blood maybe his family and maybe we should actually look into it at least because I miss my family I miss them I want them to support me in what I'm doing I'm still Harper on the political liaison for normal UK we've been here having our annual AGM so if the past couple of days what we've been doing is we've arranged for people to travel from all over the UK and what we've been doing is even having discussions about the various types of issues that are involved in the cannabis community saying the last twelve months we've had quite a bit of progress and we've we've getting a bit of more information out there and we did manage to gain quite a lot of local media coverage protests picnic protests that we held across the country we had about 13 of them and all of them going the local newspapers some have got on the radio one of one or two we've got on the TV that gave us the opportunity to engage with the authorities and get them like to understand you know we're here we're not actually just a bunch of stoners misfits that you think we are so we've been talking about medical news we've been talking about underage use we've been talking about cannabis social clubs and then what the best way is to set those social clubs up within the UK over the course of the next year before next year's AGM what we intend to do is to have at least 10 registered clubs that are active in their local communities what we'd be aiming to do over the course of the next year be to help those clubs to grow their numbers to help other clubs that just want to be involved digitally because there's about 60 UK CSC clubs at the moment so the idea is to be to give people help and aid not in breaking the law being helping them set up a club yeah it's been very useful we're always is to be able to talk to our members and our affiliates and it enables people from all different walks of life medical users who aren't normally able to leave their house or people that have particular medical conditions to come together in a friendly environment and to not only talk about cannabis but also in the case of a lot of the medical users being able to use it free from worry about harassment from the police or any of the authorities they lived here with my mum and Richard my stepfather when I was growing up it is a quite historic part of reading and during the Industrial Revolution it was a big brick and tile factory and it was one of the things that reading was most well-known for bricks beer and and the other be what's the other be biscuits this is the house here like yeah that's obviously the garage where Richard used to medicate I know that he he was medicating a long time before I actually realized or caught him or found out or anything like that and then eventually he got really bad and stuff you know he had progressive MS it just constantly goes down and downhill you know he was drip fed he could barely talk like it was a point is it you know it was horrible it was horrible cannabis was a big thing in his life because I mean it got to the point where you can really use his hands and the water couldn't roll for himself and I can remember I used to I used to pick up and they'd come like pre-rolled so he'd get like a bag of like 50 joints or whatever and whoever it was I don't know who but there was someone around this area who was helping him and they would roll them all for him before before they gave it to him and stuff like that so they never complained he never was was by oh [ __ ] my life he was never like oh we don't want to be here I don't want to be alive what can i what how can I print it words like how amazing he was and how much I've been impacted I don't know like I can't cuz it's I would've be me if it wasn't him the strength that rich has shown in his determination is a definitely a major reason why I feel I have to stay in the UK because he didn't give up so I feel like is it's not my time to give up I would love to move to Barcelona inevitably if I was in Barcelona I would have a much better quality of life I would be able to socialize a lot more I'd be able to have access to the medicine that I need and then with that full access to the medicine I need I think I would be able to have a job in the industry so I know Richard would be proud and they would be proud and they would this is now my new home say Brian I guess the main thing that I've been up to has been the launch of the United patients Alliance medical cannabis event tonight medicinal cannabis event with Caroline Lucas medical cannabis event Caroline Lucas tonight well tonight is the United patients Alliance launch night and I'm just out in the daytime trying to fire get a few more people down to the event our aims are to raise awareness of the medical benefits of cannabis and our goals are to raise that awareness both in the public and political spheres so that's the main goal and we really feel that once the evidence is raised and talked about it's inevitable that things will change so that's that's what we're doing with her from the United patients Alliance medical cannabis event medical cannabis event tonight so long now what's the time mahai is racing [Music] Sophie [Music] yeah just rushing about just trying to make sure obviously we are here to talk about a very serious issue an issue was really affects a lot of people a lot of people's life so tonight we really like to bring you the story then around August 2 a my doctor told me I end stage liver cancer with approximately three months to live he put me on a transplant list and in November two I received a liver transplant in the end they gave up and send me home to die with a large bag of morphine my wife Tina she helped me when I was scared she soothed me in the middle of the night when I was wracked with pain administered more drugs because my hands were shaking too much through the haze I could see very little and prayed now that I would die to end this suffering I managed to find some oil through some fluke or other and began taking on the 25th of April 2013 I began to sleep any better and after three days I stopped taking the morphine a couple of months later I thought I was cold enough blood okay someone went and bought me a microscope and software package to go with it but in hooked up to the computer although it's on to the screen and basement I photograph what I saw and with the aid of a software I was able to search and see what it was people simply contain this criminals for using a drug that's been used in the thousands of years and has proved his healing power is not just wrong this is preach about human rights and we will change the laws that's why the United patients Alliance was formed to give people a voice so they stand under that one banner and heard [Applause] [Music] [Music] it's not allowing access to this medicine to people that need it it's something that makes me very very angry this was the area that I feel most passionate about so they're all I've been given at UPA as political director I mean I think you do have to be conscious a lot of activists they feel obviously they've got one thing on their mind which is whatever they're activists about and therefore they've got 100% of their focus on on their side of a story whereas obviously a politician an MP has got everybody within their constituency that they have to listen to and they have to they have to be open to listen to all sides of an argument and it pays to be conscious of that came across a site called first time in prison calm which is kind of useful and gave you an idea of there's the sort of things they tell you that you can have and then there's a sort of things that you actually really need and I mean stuff like the pen and paper so that you can write letters I've been feeling increasingly ambivalent for the last last four or five days I'm finding myself actually in one of three states of mind that I'm either in a devil-may-care let's enjoy this experience and find out what will happen sort of view another one where I'm trying to think rationally realizing but this is a very very very very serious couple of days in the future of my life and I could lose my freedom and and that causes me a lot of emotions including anger but then I think about not being with my daughter for a while and I think about that and and I I can very very easily slip into being rather upset about it oh hello sweetheart it's lovely to see you how you doing darling well you've been up to today okay you were just joking that's alright thanks there was so much for calling darling love you now that so many people remind me you know remember you have a 9 year old daughter and without a shadow of a doubt it is absolutely the primary concern in my mind but alongside thee am I gonna get locked up for six months is do I really want to teach my daughter the lesson of do as you're told even if you think something is wrong I have to incorporate an element of no I want to teach my daughter that it's okay to stand up for what you believe in for me to capitulate and stand up in a court and say sorry and and illustrate that to my daughter just not a lesson I want to teach I want to teach her that actually when there's an unjust law that there are ways that you can stand up and be counted and try to make changes and try to make the world a better place that's as important as me actually being ever present I've never really been a hemp festival in the UK so product earth they decided that they were going to take on the challenge day but this really amazing show together it's a very good example and a very good cross-section of what the industry has got to offer live music outside businesses and companies from around the UK and Europe exhibiting order of their product a lot of people have come in and said whoa it's like spannabis like the visit in the UK so it's better the point about this is these are all cannabis related businesses not doing anything in lieu you're look at America what has been outer driving board its businesses getting behind it and turn it into a legitimate business that people paying tax on and this is all the fringe of the things that are involved with the cannabis culture and it brings all the people that are interested in in these things and in cannabis together all in the same place at the same time it's a unification event at the end of the day isn't it people are happy and impressed with what's going on in activism because they're prepared to pay their businesses and their reputations on the line to a host and event that is progressing our movement forward [Music] it's it's fantastic we're here we're all getting on with it anyway and we're all agreed to work together which is really nice as well and the more of that the better really I think that's that's something that we we really need to be working together as a community we need to get this sorted out we need the law has changed for everyone how do we you can take upon where it is now how do we take this enthusiasm and turn it into something that is gonna benefit us and the rest of society at the same time I think it's been a really quite a big struggle to get things going on over here and I found a know we're difficult at times so keep keep the momentum going because it is hard to sort of like keep pushing away and plugging the same things constantly because if people aren't seeing that progress like as fast as they want to see it they can lose interest and that's that can be disheartening the our movement has made a reach through the rest of society I'm seeing it now and all these little groups that contacted me two or three years ago I'm interested in doing it they started up the little page but now they've got a whole group of people that are turn up to events all around the country that's a huge change that is an actual progress and to be part of it is something special and for me it's really encouraging it makes me realise that he is worth it when you see things like that are we making a difference you know other people who are interested in reform having an impact the answer that is quite clearly yes but until everybody who uses cannabis stands up and wants to make a change then I think we're going to struggle we need everybody right into their MP every single week and you keep doing it every single week but we need to turn cannabis legalization into an election issue because at the moment they just don't think it is an issue and if they can get away with not talking about it they will I would argue that cannabis is the oldest medicine in the world it was a medicine in this country of course until 1971 when the Parliament decided to stop it being a medicine there no venca okay how can MP's decide what's a medicine or not you can't leave decisions about medicines do politicians who were clearly in the process of getting reelected cannabis users are always gonna use cannabis you're never gonna stop that you know our laws clearly shown that prohibition does not prevent people from wanting to use cannabis what we need to do we need to make using cannabis as safe as possible currently under prohibition there is no regulation you know we don't know what people are smoking we don't know what people are buying with a controlled and regulated market there is an opportunity to tax that market so do you have regulated licensed production paying taxes and those taxes could either be earmarked for specific benefits to the community or obviously just go into the Exchequer [Music] [Music] making cannabis the medicine is dead straightforward oh I used to happen is the Home Secretary she needs to write a letter to Parliament saying I have decided on the balance of evidence that cannabis has legitimate medical uses therefore it should be a schedule 2 drug instead of the schedule 1 and once they do that doctors can prescribe it job done that's all it takes one letter from the Home Secretary the disability care center downstairs who know that I have MS have made a complaint against me about the smell of cannabis so I've just basically been threatened with eviction from my home for the smell of cannabis what you've been through today is something that is something that you have to think about it's something that you have to deal with and it just adds that extra level of stress they just don't need I don't need this like I haven't I have a hard enough time just purely dealing with the fact that I'm inspired to be in the prime of my life and I'm oh I'm all the time well now I feel completely uncomfortable in my own home [Music] let's be frank I don't have access to the amount of cannabis that I need why I need a lot I need so much that it's just impossible for me to get it and afford it or or you know I just can't get it here it's infuriating because if I was in a place like California if I was in a place like Colorado if I was in a place like Barcelona if I was in a place like Amsterdam all these places are thin I could get it and I could have the amount that I need hello how's it going I'm Clark a founding member of the UPA and I am a medical cannabis patient I want it I need it and I need it now but I can't wait I can't wait for the law to change I can't wait for the government to suddenly realize that they shouldn't be looking at the evidence and change their minds I can't wait for that I need it now this is my life if anyone wants to donate for the running of the room that would be awesome yes so my dad's came down to Brighton to visit me about a couple of weeks ago now and we had we had a conversation about cannabis and about the past and about the things that he has said to me previously and he basically said I'm I'm really sorry and he said he said that he was really proud of me and they understood why yeah why I do why do yeah hi I'm mark obviously I am Clark's father from Clark's point of view I totally understand why to give him a day to die I don't today life sometimes I'll define our relationship quite distant and I have tried to connect more with him more so probably recently but I still I do fine at times it is it is it can be difficult because of that barrier between the right you're not a legal side and then the an illegal side it flashes out to California couple years ago now you know that Clark went back to the Golden Gate Bridge well I know you went back there to America yes I do know why I don't like boy he went with me which he won't vote post No I'm just pretty bad it's a great cruise that we need it making the impossible possible I'm proud of him because I am I told him that the word challenge isn't the right word he's he's done something for his self own self-esteem and he wanted to do that to prove it to himself yeah to prove it to himself that he's worth more he's a human being to be stigmatized by my own family it wasn't nice it wasn't Pleasant and it put a real barrier between me having a relationship with my family they have a breakthrough moment really I can convince my dad to convince anyone that's a really positive thing that's happened a really positive thing and a really positive change like something that I don't need to worry about anymore one thing that I contemplate a lot is what would you do like given my situation given my position given the fact that you know you know that cannabis helps you give what would you actually do bike would you stand there and do nothing would you or would you stand up and get your voice heard would you be stigmatized and be marginalized and accept it would you say no no I'm not going to have this no I'm gonna stand up and I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get to where I need to be to look after myself what would you do because that's a choice I get given every day they would choose my help would do I choose the law I have to choose my health I have to fight against the law that's not what I want to do I want to choose my house and be healing myself and have my energy and my focus on that healing but I'm forced to fight for my right to just be myself so what would you do if you were me what would you do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "ng1HnLZh1AM": "What is one activity you should tell your doctor about before having surgery? Tell them if you use cannabis. A recent study found cannabis responded differently to anesthesia medicine than non-users. Marijuana we know has sedative effect. It can also interact with anesthesia, so it's so very important just to be open and honest with your anesthesiologist if you are a user. And it really doesn't matter if you're smoking it, eating it, or using other methods to consume cannabis, talk to your doctor. Interestingly anesthesia drugs, they help people fall asleep during surgery, they help you stay relaxed during a conscious, what we call twilight sedation. But some doctors do say that the cannabinoid receptors, they may suppress the activity of other receptors in the brain, where those anesthetic drugs are meant to interact. And it's so important to be honest, because nowadays that cannabis has been legalized in so many parts of the country, we'll forget right? 'Cause doctors say what medicines do you take? As a supplement or, an over the counter which it is, medication so, and that's not the case. We need to know and we don't judge. We need to know everything that you're on before surgery.\nAlcohol. Supplements.\nCannabis. Well even like herbal supplements, yeah. You're healing.\nVitamin C, vitamin E. Fish oil, they all make you bleed. In this study it actually took three times the amount of one common anesthetic drug which is called propofol, to sedate people properly if they were regular cannabis users. So that's a big deal. You don't wanna wake up during your procedure because it didn't work. Good stuff. And again, I just wanna let you know how much I care about the two of you. Aw.\nThank you so much. We care about you too Travis. Should we talk more feelings? Just, I wanna stay connected. Yeah, I will. I wanna be, I do not want there to be any intimacy issues between the three of us. There is none.\nDrew. There is none. I really appreciate you buddy. I love it, I love the bromance, how sweet.", "symD2tw1-Bk": "[Music] this year's election there was a clear down ballot winner cannabis measures to legalize some form of the drug one in every state where it was on the ballot voters in arizona montana new jersey elected to legalize recreational marijuana while mississippi voted for legal medical marijuana and in south dakota voters approved the drug for both medical and recreational use that means that 15 states now along with dc have legalized weed for recreational use and 35 states permit medical use of the drug the four states that just legalized it for recreational use will more or less follow the same rules as other states that already allow it adults 21 and over will be able to possess and legally purchase cannabis states will regulate production and tax sales and people with prior cannabis convictions may be able to expunge the record those in arizona montana and south dakota will also be able to grow a certain number of cannabis plants for personal use new jersey on the other hand still needs to iron out some details in the state legislature now that this amendment is passed the work begins to ensure that it is implemented fairly justly and swiftly however the fact that new jersey has legalized cannabis is a big deal for the northeast according to experts the state could lead others in the region to legalize the drug especially in new york where governor andrew cuomo has previously expressed his support this year let's work with our neighbors new jersey connecticut and pennsylvania to coordinate a safe and fair system and let's legalize adult use of marijuana but don't go lighting up just yet weed won't be hitting store shelves until at least next year still it's been a swift legalization movement a decade ago there wasn't even a single state in the country where you could buy recreational cannabis it wasn't until 2012 when colorado and washington state became the first two to legalize it now about one in three americans live in a state where recreational marijuana is legal despite the success of state measures marijuana is still illegal under federal law but things may change under a biden-harris presidency i don't believe anybody should be going to jail for drug use we should wipe out we should we should decriminalize marijuana wipe out the record so you can actually say in honesty you ever been arrested for for anything you could say no though that's not to say president-elect joe biden hasn't had a complicated history with cannabis here's what he said just last year whether or not it is a gateway drug it's it's a debate and i want a lot more before i legalize it nationally i want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it and he took some heat for those statements this week i hear him literally say that i don't think we should legalize marijuana i i thought you might have been high when you said it one thing's for sure biden does support decriminalization legalization for medical purposes and rescheduling cannabis as a schedule 2 drug the election results show that voters are ready to move away from america's war on drugs beyond marijuana oregon became the first state to decriminalize the personal possession of small amounts of previously illicit drugs voters in dc also approved a measure to allow for the therapeutic use of psychedelic mushrooms the question now remains if the federal government at least on marijuana will catch up to the clear message cast on election day hey nbc news viewers thanks for checking out our

"g998giWQTyI": "okay and then I have some water getting ready to boil here for rye we're gonna infuse the sweetened condensed milk or the Vietnamese ice cream mm-hmm cannabis bye all right I brought a couple choices for you to smell here tell me what you think so we'll just do the you know so you can really just pick based on okay there's another one okay I know I'm definitely rule out the first one this one's really it's between the second and third but Ryu sounded kind of surprised that I would you up with the first one like I would pick any one of these um this one in the lineup I think is the most kind of a coffee like the second one that used to smell of is called snoop lion oh gee if that one's kind of a sour earthy og and then the last one was the orange believes it does have that sort of leather eNOS that you and then it's also citrus I've had coffee cocktails that have like citrus elements in them and they're super interesting what happens if you like put in all three would that just muddled too much honestly I would smoke all these things together in a joint since you said the first one is what you would do we were kind of going lean towards the bird so maybe we could try some of the first and the third yeah I think that'd be super cool actually so we're gonna use half a gram of each of these will be right at about eight milligrams per personal person and we're putting this on a cup did some corn flakes per oh that sounds amazing I didn't know about that part that's great I go play on breakfast you know it's all stuff you pi-1 eat if you're high yeah I definitely want to eat that and I'm definitely high right now so looking forward to that so this is the amount of condensed milk that we'll use in the recipe right okay great so I'm just gonna kind of sprinkle that in there and then we're going to boil it in a pot for about two hours that'll both activate the THC a and the THC and then it'll also in into the sweetened condensed milk", "oqLfX6zE0co": "want to get high without the anxiety or paranoia i know just the cannabinoid for you for marijuana morning news i'm brooke burgstahler cannabinoids are chemical compounds found in cannabis by far the most well-known cannabinoid is thc or delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol but lately there's been a lot of hype around delta 8 thc a cannabinoid cousin of delta 9. delta 8 thc is chemically different from delta 9 thc by only a few atomic bonds while delta 9 can exist in cannabis strains in amounts up to 30 to 40 percent delta 8 only exists naturally in fractions of a percent nevertheless companies are stoked on the idea of extracting and concentrating delta 8 for its unique effects word on the street is that delta 8 thc gets you high but to a lesser extent and without the anxiety it's also known for its appetite stimulating analgesic and neuroprotective properties and anti-nausea effects in a 1995 study conducted by dr rafael meshalim eight children with cancer who were being treated with different drugs along with chemotherapy were given delta 8 thc in conjunction with chemo and as a result vomiting was completely prevented with side effects reported as being negligible so obviously delta 8 thc deserves our attention there seem to be both medical and recreational benefits to the cannabinoid are you into delta eight throw those thoughts in the comments and

Six tonight There is a new product on the market that's being touted as legal marijuana without a prescription. It's hitting store shelves all across the Bay Area. It's something you should be aware of. FOX 13's Josh Cascio reports. Experts have a warning tonight. Sign inside Chillin Glass Gallery in Ybor City reads loud and clear trying this stuff. Delta eight, THC will get you high, Unlike your standard marijuana. This stuff is being sold legally to buyers without a prescription. The difference. What we're talking about here is Dr 90 CBN cannabis of the 80 s being available in hemp. Right. It's available in hemp. It's legal, right still gets you stone, and it's made it legal under the same laws. It made CBD illegal. It's said to be 70 to 75% as potent as the real thing. The best way to think about that is for every two hits off of Delta nine. It takes three hits off adult to hate.

It should be noted Delta eight will likely show up on a drug test. You could also get it, Do you? Why? If you're driving high on it, what we're seeing here today is not the end result. But the next step. And to find another way to Stone America. I'm worried about the health.

Tiffany Sizemore both with us thanks for joining us dr. Tiffany you said that you instead of opioids you've prescribed marijuana in many cases yeah a lot of the times I refer to a Medical Marijuana clinic I mean the opioid epidemic in this country is it's a big big big problem the problem with opioids is their addictive potential and it's a very small range where someone could be on an opiate for a week and they become addicted to it and they're looking for heroin on the streets whereas marijuana has a very very very low addictive profile and we see it more in teenagers and young kids that's why we try and avoid prescribing it to teenagers and kids but for adults the addictive profiles so low and it can cure or get help with pain it can help with anxiety so many things that can really help with without having to worry about that addictive potential dr. sue you know over 40 million Americans suffer from anxiety as we now talk openly about cannabis in the use of marijuana we've gone from these stereotypes of from the Cheech and Chong to the rapper to all these memes that were never real to now women of all backgrounds being able to openly say this is what's helping me function absolutely and you know 55% of Americans are saying that they're feeling stress throughout the day anxiety disorders are the number one mental health disorders and they affect women more than they affect men and in fact people that are using cannabis are telling you between 50 and 80 percent of them admit that they're taking it for anxiety for depression for sleep problems for stress what we do know is that in short-term smaller doses marijuana can be helpful for having treatment for anxiety however we don't know about the long-term consequences specifically for depression and it can make it worse for some people but alcohol for example if you drink alcohol that's a depressant right so if you're already depressed and then you add alcohol into it you're not helping yourself no no and this is the problem is what we're talking about what you're referring to is self medication and a lot of people do it a lot of my patients use alcohol or marijuana to feel better but what we want to do is look at a wider range of coping mechanisms I don't have a problem if somebody on a one-off basis says that this is something that makes me feel better in the short term right but I'm concerned that if you don't have more flexible coping mechanisms without spending in the home are we having dialogue with our partner are we getting the resources or we gots the source of some of this pressure stress and anxiety yes and I'm not dealing with the root problem it's just gonna get worse it's a great point as I said dr. Tiffany I one of my girlfriends is a cannabis counselor before I was pregnant with Moses she was like okay here's this coffee bean and it just relaxes me and she's like I do yoga I feel so relaxed I took it and my husband came home was like who are you I was like scroll within the bed I was like what just happened to me I don't know myself I had another experience and it was very mild very chill it was in the smoke form I hope I didn't just confess to a crime but I won't tell the state I was in what that said I felt completely different but most important to me I don't want to be on anything having a five-month-old and that was what was worrying me if something happened I wouldn't be able to react to Moses fast enough so this is something to remember there's different strains this is a plant that's been around for thousands and thousands of years and so there's hybrids and they're strains so an easy way to remember it for you for instance is indica is more of the suppressant kind of puts you to sleep like it in the couch indica okay and sativa is more of the stimulant and so what does it work the same way in everyone's body not necessarily no those strains do are known to have those separate properties but there's tinctures and you can do one to one or one to two and so you can kind of I feel like breaking bad episode I'm trying to measure to the point of regulation right so if you're getting this off the street you have no idea what you're fighting if you're getting it in a dismiss rate correct if you're getting it in a dispensary then they can tell you listen this is one to one this is probably what the effect you're going to get and you can play with it a little bit and that goes back to medical marijuana to their physicians that help you through this process right well and to your point doctor homer last but not least again dealing with the root problem of whatever it is in life right has to be addressed we can't just keep putting band-aids that's how we got into this opioid addiction in the first place yes so thank you both for your insight you", "2IZa69rdR0U": "[Music] we are here at CES 2020 taking a look at the latest we'd check around so right now I'm in front of a booth for a company called pax and they have had a vaporizer out for a number of years now but today they are launching their new AeroPro it's a new vaporizer that actually connects with these specific pods right here to be able to give their users more specific precise information test results on the CBD content the THC etc in the strains that they're smoking not only does it give you more transparency in the information but it also lets you personalize how you take hits so right here you can see that you actually get to personalize how hot you want to smoke a given strain and also you get to choose how many doses you want to take for every inhale not only does it give you full transparency on the test results on the strains that you're smoking but it also lets you personalize how you smoke it straight so that app actually stores your preferences for each strain so maybe one you want to burn hotter and one you want to just sip on over time right and basically by storing that information and sort of adapting over time to how you smoke you gain sort of a more personalized experience to you're smoking houses right and the arrow Pro actually provides haptic feedback so when you inhale you get a certain amount a certain dosage and if you inhale hard or soft it actually still tries to give you a sort of adapt it tries to give you about the same amount and it actually vibrates it gives me kind of haptic feedback when you finish the dose so it's kind of a cool contraption here it adds it a lot of transparency a lot of smarts it's really cool to see this shift over time where they're adding so many smart and so much transparency to this burgeoning industry for more of the latest tech at CES check out our youtube channel otherwise thanks for watching [Music]", "sWAl-6cdKxU": "(engine revs) - [Tony] As soon as it\nappeared that voters approved prop 207 the\nincrease began in earnest at The Downtown\nDispensary in Tucson. - We were inundated with calls the day after the\nproposition passed. So we're excited about that\nbut we can't serve them yet. - I think people are\nlike, Oh my gosh, yay. Now is the time. And unfortunately it isn't. - Including the right price one. - Moe Asnani opened his\ncompany with a business partner after voters approved\nMedical Marijuana in 2010. - We opened in August of 2013. We started with, you\nknow, three employees. And today between\nour three locations we employ over 130 people. - Like others in this industry, The Downtown Dispensary\nsupported prop 207. The use of\nRecreational Marijuana for residents who\nare 21 or older, although many policies\nmoving forward will have to be ironed out. Among other details, The Arizona department\nof health services still has to adopt the rules\nto implement and regulate Recreational Marijuana, and determine who will be\nable to supply it and sell it. The department is scheduled\nto accept applications from interested sellers from January 19th until\nMarch 9th of next year. - One of the most important\nthings for people to remember is that laws take a little\nwhile to get implemented. So we're really looking\nat early probably March, April of 2021 by the time you can come in and\nbuy 21 and over. (wind blowing) - Rules around\nRecreational Marijuana will also differ from\nMedical Marijuana. Taryn Remme is the manager of a Medical Marijuana\nCertification Business in Midtown Tucson. The company also has other\nlocations across the State. - So many legalities that\nthey have to sort out when it comes down\nto cultivation, selling it in certain\nStates and cities, they have Medical\nand Recreational sold\nat the same place. Some they have\nmedical take priority, rather than\nrecreational being sold. And then some can't sell in the same location\nas recreational. So that still has\nto be sorted out of what dispensary's and\nwho can sell at that point. - Arizona Medical\nMarijuana cards are permitted for residents\n18 years and older with conditions like cancer,\nglaucoma, or chronic pain. The card is good for two years\nand costs $150 in state fees. Plus 150 in office\nfees at this facility. More than 250,000 Arizonans have registered for a\nmedical marijuana card. And having one will let\nholders avoid additional taxes that will be levied\non recreational sales. - Let's say you, spend\na hundred dollars on your recreational cannabis. You will then most\nlikely pay $124.50. You are Additionally\nadding 20 to $30 more on your cannabis. - Also the amounts you\ncan obtain will differ. - Something like this here, the tipsy turtle, they have a chocolate\ncovered pretzels stick. It's 100 milligrams\nfor the whole bag. Each pretzel is 10 milligrams. That's what you could expect\nas a recreational patient. Anything outside of a\n100 milligrams in a bag would not be something that\nyou'd be able to purchase. - And for as an example\nyou have something next to the pretzels? - Yes, this is the INDICA PM. It is a 300 milligram product. So each piece in there\nis 15 milligrams. So this would be something that only a medicinal\npatient could purchase. Not something a\nrecreational patient would be able to purchase. - I have a father-in-law\nthat had brain cancer. And his dosing was over 800\nmilligrams throughout the day. Through an edible\namount, through gummies. And that was throughout\nthe day around the clock. And so a hundred milligrams just doesn't touch\nwhat's needed. - Even though the new law is not expected to be\nimplemented for a few months, it's already having an\nimpact in the State. Prosecutors and Maricopa\nand Pima counties where the majority of residents\nlive bowl set recently, they will drop or dismiss\npending possession charges for small amounts of Marijuana. - We absolutely supported\nprop 207 for multiple reasons. One is that it's access for a lot of people who\ncouldn't afford the card. Didn't wanna be on you\nknow, a list so to say. And also I think\nthe biggest reason, is that it decriminalizes\nyou know, small amounts. And we've seen\nincarceration in this State at such a high level for\nMarijuana over the years. So we're seeing an\nimmediate effect. You know, from prop 207\nand decriminalization.", "31wlVdeQVyc": "OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOR OF INITIATIVE 65, WHICH MAKES MEDICAL MARIJUANA LEGAL IN THE STATE.

bought this gram of concentrate from maniac sesh a cool little event that happens every Saturday in Los Angeles this company was there they had a booth and I thought it was pretty cheap so I decided to try some out I'm gonna open it smell it okay so what it looks like [Music] they put the little peepee on the bottom side the purple punch and you get like a berry smell a sweet smell a little bit of a purple smell the strain is purple punch or punch is a sweet and sedating in the cut dominant hybrid the genetics are Larry og and granddaddy purple and it's known for smelling like grape candy or kool-aid the healthy dab from this with that pretty big guy very huge all right here's to sampling it if you're under 18 years old please click out of this video this video is only intended for viewers who are 18 plus years old I live in a legal medical state so I'm a lot to do this I do not condone illegal activities don't do anything illegal Cheers I'm gonna taste this [Music] guys an ant happened to stumbled and landed on the tip of my dapper and somehow he was able to ruin my giant as that another dad no ants Cheers pristiq purple punch you're gonna be trying this let's see what it tastes like [Music] [Music] some of the berry flavor comes through I also get a lot of pine flavors overall flavor-wise I'll probably give this a 3 out of 5 the price is five out of five being at $15 [Music] the cool thing about the strain is it gives you a two punch effect both to the cerebral and to the body this is a perfect strain paired with desserts or as a dessert the effects may help with nausea stress body aches sleeplessness the main flavors that I smell from this is the berry and the sweet I get hence maybe Hensel flickery but doesn't come through very well on this batch and that's

something about moving legs go ahead saturday night october the third we're going to orlando baby we're going to disney give our studios all the way and we're bringing one of the seven troops with us that's right life for sale live [Music] four-point sheridan 5905 i drive orlando and learned a lot thank you ben you are the freaking man the information that he sent to us today was real wrong straight cut to the point and he's gonna leave no loose ends we had such a great time last saturday we're doing it again so anybody come on down book that special package deal get that room come hang out with me and the whole gang and let's have a real estate party [Music] should be a standalone building there it is currently so today we're going to diversify i mean phi this was classified as an essential business i mean you know you got to go to times this is what people want you got to get what they want i guess you know i don't really have a problem with everything in moderations okay alcohol people doing all kinds of stuff but um nice parking lot nice building they want a little too much for this thing but we're gonna see if we get a good cap rate out of this triple net no management and you know you know they watched them like a hawk on a build out the city probably wrong critiqued everything they got handicapped brands because a lot of people were handicapped need this stuff you know i tell you honestly uh i don't remember people you know when they smoke weed they get kind of mellow i wouldn't know personally but from what i've seen and i think it's probably a good way to calm people down you know maybe we should start giving it to the police you know when they come out and there's a domestic dispute you know the cop sits down he lights up a joint with the husband and wife i have i bet you in 10-15 minutes after they do that there's not gonna be any fighting the cop will lead the two you'll have a good time and uh that's a good way i think that they should start dealing with uh just domestic disturbances it's a busy location you got a big grocery store across street big publix you got you know people here are spending money they got whenever you see new car washes or car washes with business that means people around neighbor got money for car washes people ain't got money watch their own goddamn cars like me looks like something new is going in it looks like a buffalo wings to me and it's uh a busy good area but if they left is the building still worth 300 million bucks i don't think so i don't know maybe yeah i don't think so because they may be paying a higher cap rate because of the type of business they're in see everything is the cap rate is determined on the risk and all these different factors involved location risk the strength of the tenant uh how long the lease goes out uh there are options after the lease goes out there's a lot of factors in determining what the cap rate should be so you know you always got to try and fight for the highest cap rate he's got 10 years on the lease but then there should be options after that i would think i would think a guy like this wants to tie this building up for as long as he can but and there's a lot of homework to do this time i'm going to read that at least every letter at least because i'm afraid there might be a clause where the government comes in and says you know what you're shutting them all down or if the city says you know what we don't like it here there might be uh things like that that i need to look into i heard about so we'll see how are you sir so here we are today we're looking at triple net leases we have an expert broker with us and we're going to find out the whole deal on this thing 10 years left on 10 years left on the existing term all in is about a 6.75 cap 3.6 million well you know my biggest concern is i know it's a new thing i kind of like that the 10-year lease they're a real company it's a great location they got everything going on here you got money around here but it is a good look god forbid or somebody forbids that they can no longer be here or operate because of the feds because of the city because of who the hell knows what i mean there might be some clauses in the leases where they can get out you know through some problems they may have but what do we do three and a half million bucks looks like a lot of money to tie up for this older building it's been remodeled and it's nice shape yeah but what the heck am i going to do if they leave can i re-rent it and is it going to be worth three and a half million bucks well the premiums the premiums on the income 7 200 square feet on gandhi i think it's an easy or something like that you know that let's say it was vacant right now or is there any vacant buildings like this on this street right now well triple net hey what's up i'm gonna meet you what's up all right anything important all right price this makes sense but you're right i mean there is some there is right now it's very hard to re-rent retail i know i'm sitting on a ton of [ __ ] you know so there is downside risk but i don't think that marijuana is going away i think it's just like liquor store that's a lot of money per square foot still seven thousand square feet that's 400 square foot 500 a square foot all right so let's look at it this way the building's worth about 100 bucks square foot there's an old building let's face that 150 even well we haven't got to the land yet 7000 square feet you can build a box a building right here on this strip for probably 200 a square well 200 square foot's about a million five you know million four million bars yeah i mean you could do that i mean the lands weren't what i don't know you know i just don't want to get stuck and then you know i won't be able to re-rent it go through a whole big build out with somebody new the whole thing boils down and you know that's a lot of money to invest in one piece of lot this one here they won't unless you make an offer get a contract whatever they're not going to give us access to the lease the lease is the key to the whole thing here i understand you know i mean we drove in the back i mean yeah i'm sure the building's in great shape but um i mean can't we find out some more information on what that all i want to know basically is what their outs are yeah what are their outs because that's where i've gotten screwed in retail not knowing retail right there were provisions in a lease where they can bail on you if they don't meet a certain income criteria or if somebody else in the plaza moves out they can move out right retail is tricky you know you got to read the fine print it's a lot trickier than in regular multi-family housing let's find out what the outs are i mean it's a good area because trying to rent retail these days is not easy right you got time for lunch you got to be somewhere what 130 yeah you have a size hamper i have to talk to happy three and a half million you know i'm really the old saying there's no risk no reward but there's a lot of risk i gotta really do homework you gotta do your homework homework maybe homework i didn't do it in school but i'm doing it now happy father's day revisited no ashtray this is the most weirdest looking thing i've ever seen in my life this is my first wheelchair we had to buy readjusted to where i

east where medical marijuana is legal recreational use is decriminalized and will likely be legalized soon it's crazy that something that was forbidden in many places for over a hundred years may now

financial and medical potential and that is why israel became one of the world's top leaders in cannabis research my name is talupo and i'm an israeli-based cannabis scientist what is happening inside our labs will affect cannabis-based medicine across the world labs in israel are even doing research for companies and countries like canada we hope to get a deeper understanding of the plant's components and deliver a more personalized cannabis-based medicine they say cannabis can be used to help treat those with cancer epilepsy schizophrenia and many other conditions and israel has high hopes to soon export cannabis too the unique agricultural technology in israel could make it the ideal place to grow the plant so as marijuana prohibition comes to an end israel is preparing itself to lead in the cannabis market hospitals and doctors near you could soon be using developments made by israelis potentially treating millions of people with medical conditions across the globe whether

second that's delicious let's make some cupcakes I'm in legal Washington and I'm leaving Seattle behind to head to Vashon Island where I'm gonna meet a woman who runs the cupcake game here and also has her own line of infused edibles she's gonna show me around a bunch of farms on the island and then she's gonna teach me how to make cannabis infused cupcakes from scratch it's gonna be another weed full day on Bon Appetit so let's find the kitchen and get baked [Music] I hear that you're the cupcake queen of Seattle wow what an honor that's great yeah I have a company called cupcake Royale and we actually work with a lot of local producers we like the idea that we can support local agriculture local economy and create a better Seattle I mean I'm sure you big all kinds of different things what is it about cupcakes that's so special I think there's a nostalgic thing about cupcakes and it's kind of a food around celebration I've heard you also make a line of edibles is that right yeah I have a company called the good ship company so we make chocolate products and cookie products and other confections that we're getting ready to launch wow that's amazing and do you use all like the local ingredients right that's it absolutely and that's why we're here today because we're gonna make some cannabis cupcakes we're gonna use the cupcake RL recipe to make a chocolate buttercream but instead of the usual chocolate reuse we're gonna use good chip chocolate so first stop we need to get some butter and I want you to meet my friend Natalie who has this lovely farm that we're okay great so let's go check it out you know hi baby how are you doing are you doing very well I'm Natalie nice to meet you natalie has a dairy farm and we're going to pick up some cream and we're going to take that cream and turn it into butter and then we're going to infuse that butter with cannabis for our cupcakes and these are your milk factories right here huh exactly so I'm LT eat it this morning and I got her mouth and I have it in the farm stand for you if you like to taste something else that edith made i have some cream on one here this is the savory this has olive oil and salt and freshly ground pepper on it and this is just the fromage blanc with a little drizzle of local Vashon honey actually Natalie I have something to share with you as well some of Washington's finest but I don't know if you'd want to give this a go okay I can do it go yeah we can try okay great and it is from Washington it's called laughing Buddha and it really just one of my favorites on the market in Washington from a flower perspective all right I've never hot box before I'm standing before pretty great I gotta say let's let's get into that cheese okay so let's start off save that's your savory Wow really really creamy texture of it it's just amazing Wow so you guys are all about doing stuff from scratch yeah is that part of food culture here in the Pacific Northwest yes it's almost like a religion yeah I mean you can really taste the difference I'm going honey mmm Wow mmm holy crap okay here's your milk great what do we owe you for that that's okay you can have it oh really yes my gift to you in that case here's my gift to you it's this really fine bud you seem like you enjoyed that Jay I have to say I did excellent so enjoy the rest of that bunch and we're gonna go put this to good use I've got my jar of fresh milk that I picked up from Cornerstone farm and I've headed over to Vashon velvet where one of Jodi's friends an amazing cannabis farm where she grows some really banging buds we're gonna pick our buds and I'm gonna go put this thing down cuz my hands are freezing right now [Music] before we do anything everybody needs a name tag state regulations excellent want to be in full compliance how did you guys get into the cannabis business when the state announced the rules for getting a license to grow cannabis they said there was a 30-day window and they might never have another window open so I thought chance of a lifetime we went for it and never looked back enjoyed every minute of it Bravo that is fantastic awesome and are you a cannabis enthusiast yourself I never know and then if it's a Saturday night I'll try some of the Laughing Buddha yeah so I wanted to show you the strain that I think would make some really great cupcakes this is our platinum blueberry this is a really space-age looking grow right here go ahead and stick your fingers in and take a sniff wow there are so many different flavors going on there I mean beyond just that tart blueberry aroma there's so much else going on like a maple syrup or yeah I can't get enough of that smell and as you can see we use exclusively LED lights which use about a third of the energy of regular standard HID lights so we're trying to reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible so Patrick how far along are these guys right here these are about two to three weeks from harvest at this point oh that good karma is paying off because I mean you've got these incredible looking buds so Jody do you think this is gonna go well in your cupcakes I like the sweetness I'm excited to see what it tastes like when these guys said they make stuff from scratch they were serious I mean every single ingredient comes from the source I met the cow that we got our cream from and I met the cannabis plant that we're gonna get our buds from and now I'm hanging out with the chickens we're gonna get our eggs from and then we'll be ready to make cupcakes [Music] we have all the ingredients right here to make cupcakes and it starts right here and we're going to skim the cream off the top how do we turn that into butter we have to churn it and this is a butter turner it's crazy steam punk jar that looks pretty arduous for one person but here check it out I have an idea if you just hold the jar and I'll go like this Wow don't hit this a little bit how long does it actually take it's gonna take about 30 to 45 minutes yeah that looks like butter all right and what we're gonna do is we're gonna put this butter into this bowl and we're gonna press it against the side to kind of squeeze out more of that buttermilk all right I think we are ready to melt this up and to infuse it with our canvas okay Jody how much weed do we have decarboxylate in here this is one gram of platinum blueberry from Vashon velvet threw it in the oven at 290 degrees for an hour and that allows it to decarboxylate which means it releases the THC what we're going to do with that we're gonna put this in this 1/2 cup of delicious butter we've been working so hard on and infuse it for 30 minutes from super low heat we're starting to smell good already so you're ready to strain it we got some cheesecloth in a strainer here with the bowl underneath it we're just gonna pour this straight through the cheesecloth there's all our spent weed flowers okay so what goes into a cupcake batter

combine them just a little make them next step we're going to add our cannabis butter yeah we put a lot of butter we get last wrap alright that looks good I like how it's breaking up we're going to take some of our wet ingredients and mix them together we're gonna start with four egg whites so we're gonna add to that a half a cup of warm water we're gonna add a half cup of sour cream we are doing in this recipe one teaspoon of vanilla paste and this is Madagascar per bone vanilla so we're just gonna whisk this together and now we're gonna incorporate this is going better let that mix a

the fortune of seeing where all the ingredients are a lot of the ingredients that went into this came from really I mean it all just came together in the best cupcake I've ever had excellent truly thank you so much thanks for coming out to Vashon Island today barring out the beat thought about defeat mmm that is one good cupcake", "VN8Xi0hgFu8": "first and foremost this is a social justice issue the reason to pursue this is because of social justice it is the principle reason I advocate for legalizing adult use marijuana the push to legalize marijuana in New Jersey is on led by the state's new governor bill Murphy who's made it one of his top priorities and he's not the only one making the pitch the drug war in the United States of America has been a complete and utter failure we want to make sure that some of the revenue goes towards social justice issues the message has resonated with younger members of the black community it's the older generation that's having trouble getting on board me I grew up in our New Jersey home for me like you know we was everywhere you know I you know one thing that was consistent was that they will always look down upon me because they did I'll babysit getting drunk it was okay wait as long as they coming house smelling like reefer is that what they call it in Jersey it was always an issue so for me I was always you know scared to touch it what am I looking at man you looking at viola we're starting off we're just selling flowers slowly what we're really known for his actions life concentrates former NBA player al Harrington has clearly changed his mind about weed he's invested millions in his new company which grows processes and sells all sorts of marijuana products out west I'm 5 million I was in so I made a substantial investment you know obviously you know people do stuff to make money but you know I really feel like my company is gonna change people's lives you know and it's gonna change me lives to opportunities it's gonna change people's lives through medication and through education cannabis to me I mean it's a miracle plane what went through your mind when you found out that New Jersey was pushing to legalize marijuana there was a chance well you know the first thing I started thinking about was how I can go back into my old community and try to uplift the community by bringing this industry there and creating jobs where Harrington sees an opportunity older members of the black community who are still on the streets back home in New Jersey see a potential crisis last month the legislative black caucus hosted a hearing to talk about it how kids are smoking weed right now call the weed heads there is no EpiPen for marijuana or THC poisoning they don't get up in the morning they don't carry their butt to school it has an adverse impact on productivity the hair all messed up you know the look let's keep it 100 marijuana will take your heart out twice as fast as nicotine that causes our kids to now developing schizophrenia that's a fact a lot of the facts cited are widely disputed but they're driven by a desire to protect the community that's been ravaged by drugs and raishin for decades it's going to impact generation after generation like many older black leaders state senator ronald rice saw the heroin and crack epidemics firsthand and advocated for tougher drug laws to combat them if marijuana is legalized new jersey what are you worried will happen a word number one that people won't get themselves killed in my neighborhood I know it leads to other things I know it's gateway cuz I was a cop going back in the 70s a lot of the crack people and heroin people started with marijuana you feel like branding to push for legalization of marijuana in New Jersey as a civil rights issue it's not a civil rights issue the civil rights issue it's the way people are being treated okay that's the system it's all about money okay it's money driven Brice's thinking has evolved since the 70s because of the way the war on drugs has disproportionately targeted people of color he's introduced a bill to decriminalize marijuana in New Jersey but rice is only willing to go so far is there a recreational marijuana legalization build that you would support no well we should be telling we've been rolling this way we're not pulling from nothing it is definitely a divide but it's uh it's starting to come a lot closer why do you say that just because I'm seeing it every day you know my mom you know when I first got into this shoes very wary of it does your family feel differently about reefer now everybody does one of the concerns about legalizing marijuana in New Jersey is that there's just gonna be a ton of weed in lower-income neighborhoods a lot of black neighborhoods I mean is it's not a weed in the neighborhood now so what is the difference the difference if what's happened at West is any indication is that the black community could end up buying its weed from an industry that's almost entirely white do you feel like the black community has access to the industry at West  no they can't afford it you know what I mean at the end of the day it's cost so much to even submit an application you know what I mean I mean hundreds of thousands of dollars and then you have to show hundreds of thousand dollars of working capital that's why I had to continue to be an advocate to try to change some of these laws and break down some of these barriers so that we can allow some of the smaller people to participate and we can really uplift our community with this point the same plan that has arguably done really done the opposite in some cases destroyed a box that I just feel like it can right some of the wrongs you you", "EBLmGBlEnMY": "[Applause] [Music] what's the first image that pops into your head when someone mentions the word cannabis for a lot of people it could be this or maybe this and for those of you that are better at planning ahead maybe even this basically we're all thinking joints bongs and getting stoned but modern cannabis has become a lot more complex than that nowadays when we talk about cannabis we're no longer just talking about a plant we've broken that plant down into extracts compounds and building blocks with tremendous therapeutic potential as a result cannabis is starting to look a lot less like this and a lot more like this and that's actually great news for all of us because the new version of cannabis is a lot more exciting than the old one in fact cannabis has emerged into a modern-day superfood and if we can reset our image of this plant cannabis might actually become more important to your daily routine than coffee so let me tell you how cannabis became a regular part of my daily routine when I was in my early 20s I had a moment of what you could call youthful indiscretion that set my life down a very challenging path I applied for a job on Wall Street to make matters more complicated they hired me it was fast paced and high-stress and in certain situations that stress could become pretty overwhelming so I tried everything I could to manage my anxiety including prescription medications but those came with their own side effects on my mood and my energy levels so I searched for a different solution and it took years before I actually found one I stumbled upon a little-known can extract called CBD it toned down my stress levels but still allowed me to feel clear-headed and focused and suddenly I was back in control of my daily routine I felt confident and composed and relaxed and I just sort of felt like myself now before you all get the wrong impression let me clarify that CBD does not get you high that effect comes from a completely different chemical called THC and CBD does none of that you could take all the CBD in the world watch the entire Beatles Yellow Submarine movie and you're still not going to feel high and trust me on that one see CBD doesn't impair you instead it seems to have the opposite effect which sounds a little bit like magic until we dig into the science we all have a built-in system in our bodies that keeps our internal functions in balance despite imbalance in our external environment it's called the endocannabinoid system and it regulates things like stress mood and appetite think of it like the conductor of an orchestra when one piece starts acting out of rhythm for example an overactive stress response the endocannabinoid system can step in and smooth it out CBD happens to be one of the chemicals that supports the function of this system helping that conductor to maintain rhythm throughout the body in the brain and brain imaging studies have actually proven this through these studies we know that CBD can help to modulate activity in key brain regions involved in our stress response like the amygdala in other words CBD helps your brain to function in a more balanced state when stress level spike ok so why am I telling you about biological systems in brain activity well for one I paid a lot for a degree in neuroscience and I'd kind of like to get my money's worth the other reason is that this little-known cannabis chemical it's about to change the way we all think about our daily health it's made such a big impact on my daily routine that I now dedicate myself professionally to creating healthy CBD options for people that want to give it a shot and it's not just for people with extreme anxiety or panic attacks either CBT has this gentle calming effect on mood and stress levels similar to a meditation think of it like the volume knob on a stereo CBT doesn't shut the noise off entirely it just turns that dial down a little bit so you can hear the music and because of that it's being used to help people perform better in a wide range of daily stressful scenarios from interviews to networking people that used to have a drink to calm the nerves are now trying CBD instead it is even effective for public speaking [Laughter] [Applause] multiple studies have actually been done on the effects of CVD on public speaking and have found a significant reduction in stress and discomfort compared to a control group and the potential benefits of CVD you go way beyond stress management to because of the broad function of that endocannabinoid system CPD itself can have a wide range of benefits professional athletes are now ditching prescription pills and painkillers in place of CBD and insomnia acts are turning to CBD is a potential natural remedy for more restful sleep but before you go and toss out any prescription pills I should note this does not mean that CBD is going to cure your anxiety your insomnia or your arthritis there's no one-size-fits-all solution these things and for many people prescriptions will just be the best option but the implications for CVA are pretty fascinating particularly when you consider that we may have stumbled upon a natural remedy to common ailments that affect millions of people every single day better yet you don't have to ingest a handful of pills and supplements to get those results CBD is commonly infused into foods and beverages in a way that's healthy and convenient you can get everything from CBD waters and juices to CBD olive oil and hummus but before we all go run out of here and share a giant bowl of CBD hummus it's important to consider the risk factors is CBD actually safe and what happens if we take a lot of it these are all very good questions unfortunately we do have some answers reports currently indicate that daily dosages of CBD up to 1500 milligrams are well tolerated by the body which means they're safe and to put that number in perspective here's a graph that shows common CBD dosages and food products today versus what those reports deemed to be safe and you can see it's not even close you'd have to spend thousands of dollars every single day on CBD infused food even come close to those numbers the World Health Organization has also weighed in on this stating that CVD has a good safety profile and that no public health problems have been associated with CVD use even the FDA which sets the gold standard for safe food policy in our country seems to agree with all this just last year the FDA noted little indication that CBD has abuse potential or presents a significant risk to the public health even more remarkable CBD doesn't seem to be addicting either the FDA's data also found no evidence that CBD causes physical or psychic dependence so let's recap CBD comes from plants doesn't impair you safe for adults consumed and could help millions of people it's a pretty amazing discovery right I think we should all pop open a bottle of CBD champagne to celebrate well actually not so fast because we currently sit at a pivotal moment in the history of cannabis regulation one that will determine if when and how we're even allowed to purchase cannabinoids like CBD C as a country we don't like to change our canvass laws very often we've really only done it once before when we effectively made it illegal back in 1937 and since then cannabis has been vilified for its recreational use the idea that weed equals scary is so deeply rooted in our culture that it even affects the way we think about versions of this plant that have absolutely nothing to do with its recreational use like hemp so now after an 80 year failed experiment we're finally about to revisit the cannabis question and the decisions we make today will set the course of this industry for generations to come now this is obviously a ton of responsibility and it's very important that we get it right this time part of getting it right means doing more research setting the right market marketing standards right safety guidelines because as much as we know today there is still more work to be done and a lot of products on the Shelf today just don't hold up the right quality standards but we can't continue to put it off to kick the can down the road because the longer we delay our regulatory decisions the longer we deny access to a natural solution to common ailments that should be very treatable we need to move forward based on real science one step at a time now I'm talking you about CBD today because it happens to be a pretty great first step it's healthy its natural and we have a growing database of research to support its efficacy so how do we move forward on CBD regulation well first we all need to determine what it is there are a lot of people out there who will tell us that CBD should only be a prescription medication those people are called pharmaceutical companies and there and they're well aware that this industry is projected to be worth 22 billion dollars in a few short years but maybe we're a little skeptical of those motivations because if we removed the veil of cannabis stigma CP is nothing more than a natural plant ingredient with therapeutic potential it's really more like a superfood and fortunately we already have a pretty good blueprint for that thanks to America's all-time favorite functional food caffeine now I know it might seem strange for me to stand up here and to compare something from cannabis to an everyday item like caffeine but bear with me are they really all that different they both come from plants they're safe for adults to consume and we use them to improve our mood and our energy levels interestingly enough caffeine was once vilified too back in 1909 the United States government filed a federal lawsuit against coca-cola for marketing a product that contained caffeine which they deemed to be unsafe nowadays caffeine can be found in all sorts of products from food and beverages to cosmetics and even medication we ensure that caffeine products are safe and labeled properly and then we let people decide if they want it when they want it and how they want it and since I'm sure everyone here has had some form of caffeine today it's safe to say we're all pretty comfortable with that system we need to take the same step forward with cannabis because cannabinoids like CBD should be no more threatening than a cup of coffee and if we do it the right way this time we have an opportunity now to give millions of people access to something that could improve their work lives their social lives and their overall happiness but we need to take a step back first in order to move forward and toss aside those outdated stigmas because this plant is a lot more than just weed cannabis should be viewed as therapeutic so let's hit the reset button on our image of cannabis starting with a fresh look at CBD and if we can change our perspective on one aspect of this plan maybe we can take another look at the rest of it - thank you [Music] you", "dNScXlq2iPA": "hello home girls and home women over the world let me ask you something have you ever listened to Bob Marley while making love am i right hi I'm Laura Wilcox and this is feminine now ladies it is my distinct honor to get to announce to you today that we'd Lube is here ladies I want to make sure you get all the information you need so that's why I am going to sit down with a cannabis expert I just have to find one first so just give me one second hi yeah operator I just need to talk to a cannabis expert please what do you mean you don't have a listing for that sort of thing what do you mean you're calling the cups all right I love you bye-bye all right let me rethink this approach we're talking weed Lube which is a new thing what is this product how does it work this product is basically cannabis dissolved in coconut oil and probably people in New York don't know too much about it because right now it's only legal and available in California and Colorado so we're gonna we're gonna try this we're gonna just spray it on our hands and we'll see what happens this is in the name of scientific research I smell like a bomb so the ingredients are medical cannabis oil liquid coconut oil and love Pro so we'll see what happens not like half an hour though right right that's that's the issue is that you gotta be patient wait and see so absorbing cannabis through your skin how it is how is that different than like doing like a volcano bong right before you know having sex actually the absorption through the skin is not as good as when you smoke it or vape it or in even eat it however the mucosal tissues so not necessarily the outside the vulva where the clitoris and the labia are but the inside the vagina and the Batchelor mucosa you're gonna get more absorption in that area so it's kind of its kind of like your vagina is getting high what is that I didn't even know what could do that well there's lots of ways for them to get high this is just one of them right I did it's got a life of its own down there and it's not telling me anything one of them is dilates blood vessels so you get increased blood flow to the area that's alley oh there's work exactly we have almost as much erectile tissue as a guy does just internal oh so we have inside buggers how do you you know I don't feel like a different a little moisturize but yeah yeah but maybe I was just hungry does smell we don't run into any police dogs on the subway hungry turns out your third-grade teacher was right we are each a unique beautiful flower so it's kind of hard to know how something like we Lube is gonna affect your body specifically now while marijuana is not like a new thing products like for ia's we Lube our new and that they're specifically designed for female pleasure yeah I don't hate that right yeah but don't forget they don't mix well with latex so it'd be like really really careful guys okay yeah so uh if you'll excuse me I've got something I want to try until next time come back next time okay bye hey man I hope you enjoyed that totally awesome weed episode of BAM at if

you'll take this part of the plan and that's eventually what becomes the CBD it is yep yep at med farm Colorado's first licensed cannabis research facility CEO Albert Gutierrez walked us through how CBD is extracted from a cannabis plant to oil first it goes to a co2 extractor and is further separated with ethanol we're gonna separate the waxes and fats and we don't want in the product from the cannabinoids that we do want to see VD smell then the ethanol is separated in what's called a rotary evaporator that's usually about 75 to 80 percent cannabinoid content so what is this machine this is a white film evaporator we're loading that cannabinoid content that we just got out of the rotary evaporator into here and we're gonna let that content seep down into this jacket right here so you'll get CBD testing it then 90 to 99 percent purity and we'll test it right after this but that's going to be very high quality products and we call it that the money jar and this idea you might have a little bit as well okay for testing just to see can you extract it more from here absolutely her choreography we can extract it and make it isolated to be booty recessive teen performs a series

CBD trend for today Kristen Dahlgren NBC News Denver you", "2RMNuglsUAc": "[Music] it's a weekday afternoon in Los Angeles the epicenter of cannabis in the United States this busy dispensary is open for business but if everything looks normal it isn't this is in fact an unlicensed illegal dispensary part of the booming black market in California and around the country it's what the cannabis industry says could be the biggest threat to sky-high expected revenues Aysen Point California early projections of more than 1 billion dollars in annual cannabis tax receipts in 2018 are far from the three hundred forty five million dollars collected that's in large part because the illegal market can easily undercut the costs of running licensed dispensaries it's not hard to see how a team of CNBC producers equipped with hidden cameras visited ten illegal dispensaries throughout LA most aren't hard to find and they're open day and night some have signs others do not but they all have one thing in common they are brazenly breaking the law operating with no license selling potentially untested products and allowing customers to openly consume in this illegal dispensary down the street from the University of Southern California customers are dabbing smoking a highly potent cannabis concentrate and if you want free weed this store and others are happy to give it away as a sign say all you need to do is write a positive review on weed maps an online site that lists both legal and illegal dispensaries around the country [Applause] [Music] despite a daily limit on the amount of cannabis stores can sell to a customer you can buy as much as you want at many of the illegal dispensaries we can get as much as the black market has a huge problem in some states it's 70 to 80 percent of sales and it's a big threat and so a lot of states are thinking about how do we alleviate it the two things is price and convenience attorney Patricia here is the founder of cannabis law digest taking a lot of the profits away from operators and therefore from the tax revenue from a party in Toronto to Miami and New York City the tone is decidedly upbeat at cannabis conferences that optimism faces this reality an estimated 70 billion dollars in illegal marijuana sales nationally 7 times the legal market and know where our legal operators feeling the impact more than in California the country's largest legal cannabis market where voters passed Proposition 64 in 2016 businesses had to be in compliance with a license by January but as we found that clearly didn't happen we found illegal store after store selling cannabis at deeply discounted prices the parking lot is almost full as our producers enter this dispensary that openly advertises on the side of the building thank you we can go in this regular customer says he's a student at nearby USC at another location CNBC producers walk inside our asked for their IDs then our buzzed in a clerk offers a first-timer deal on a popular product called gelato there are more customers dabbing something our producers were told as common in illegal dispensaries elsewhere there are more perks at the illegal stores and easy to see why they are thriving with all the discounts offered we do not buy anything from the dispensaries this store is open past the state-mandated closing time of 10:00 p.m. another convenience for black market sales we showed a compilation of our video to Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer any surprises to you no I know that there are lawful dispensaries operating in the city it might be that some of the locations you just showed me are under investigation right now how big of a problem is this it's a very significant problem and from a public health and safety standpoint it's especially crucial that buyers of cannabis only go to the licensed shops and yet we see a number of illegal dispensaries opening up because the profit motive is so significant an illegal store can rake in ten to twenty thousand dollars a day authorities say so far 151 illegal dispensaries have been shut down with more criminal prosecutions pending is this different or worse than going after the guy in the corner selling weed before legalization oh no it's it's qualitatively different the amounts of money at stake are much more significant for example turning off utilities is a routine tactic as seen in this video shot by a witness during a recent raid at this illegal store in East LA the location was permanently closed but just over half the stores reopen within a week according to police on weed maps we found listings for 229 illegal dispensaries the Los Angeles Police Department puts that number even higher at 259 but no one knows exactly how many are in business there are just 186 licensed dispensaries in LA weed maps was hit with a cease and desist letter from the state of California last year for aiding and abetting in violations of state cannabis laws because it allows unlicensed businesses to advertise weed maps told CNBC it provides patients and consumers with valuable information about all things cannabis and businesses can post their own listings the company says targeting online platforms won't solve the unlicensed dispensary problem in California the danger in these illegal stores is potentially unregulated products like these sold to unsuspecting customers illegal dispensaries are required to sell regulated products which are tested the City Attorney's Office has attacked the problem with a recent civil complaint seeking millions in damages from one illegal dispensary and we've alleged in our complaint that the product contained a toxin something that is used as a pesticide on golf courses this is exactly why legal store owners like Cameron Wald executive vice president of project cannabis is outraged at how bold the black market has become we're facing especially in California and in LA specifically an illicit market that is extremely strong we're outnumbered three to one illicit operator to legal operator so you know we have outrageous price compression that we have to see at our stores how much easier do you think it is to operate as an illegal dispensary compared to what you go through it's a lot easier they have no compliance standards they had no permitting process they had no documentation no no legal process that they had to go through so they're breaking the law potentially threatening the health of consumers and they're threatening your business correct and they're doing this in plain sight in plain sight an illegal dispensary Walt says can charge close to forty percent less than project cannabis which has four locations in LA and must pay cannabis excise and sales taxes well thank you none of the illegal dispensaries we visited responded to our request for comment which isn't a surprise to david welch an LA based attorney who represents the cannabis industry California is the largest market in the world just based on population and consumption rates they are unable to actually realize the profits that people anticipate they're going to make because you have such a large illegal market statewide California's Bureau of cannabis control has issued more than 3900 cease and desist letters to illegal dispensaries and delivery services compare that to a total of 939 legal retailers what you find are dispensaries are not being enforced against even when they're enforced against they simply go and they open up the next day because the penalties are so low it doesn't dissuade them from violating the law and as we found in all the dispensaries in which our cameras captured illegal activity it appears the boom in the black market in cannabis isn't going away anytime soon", "KJxDWTy-we0": ">>IN

less pain medicine the us-based national cancer institute mentions that cbd may help elevate side effects of cancer treatment as well is cbd oil legal in india you", "oQhItiXuOJ0": "[Music] parents look closely at this picture it looks like regular coughs syrup if you saw it in your childhood room would you think twice about it it's called cush the drug got a Miami Dolphins player arrested in Collier County this week and then he was cut from the team we sent NBC to investigator David Hodges to find out what it is and you know if these illegal drugs are hidden in plain sight being a big issue for parents and Peter the biggest danger is that they're far more pwned than anything parents may have seen or even tried when they were young so to help your kids we're gonna help you spot them at a quick glance you might not recognize it what does this look like to you ketchup pills that looks like marijuana syrup the final answer is correct Kush syrup found in the car of Miami Dolphins player and Collier County sold in a medical marijuana dispensary in California but not untouchable for kids in South West Florida pretty much everything through online channels you can figure out a way together Steven hill helps kids with substance abuse at Sal's care he says teens will try something like Co syrup just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be able to tell your child is high she says the best way for parents to spot these drugs is to pay attention to the new products on the market educate yourself on the other forms besides the bag and the smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office told us they don't recall ever making any arrests where this kind of syrup was down before but many of these drugs come and wave so the best advice for parents be on the lookout if you didn't buy it or authorize it question it for the NBC to investigators I'm David Hodges call email or download the NBC 2 news app and submit your tip now", "AsHXOcp-bdU": "EVENING EVENING I'M EVENING I'M ERIN EVENING I'M ERIN RIGHT.

which one to try i just say try them all today i'm going to be dabbing on some garlic cookie sauce from grassroots let's crack the seal on this as you can tell it's super [ __ ] goopy i'm gonna try to keep it as level as i possibly can jesus christ dude the whole room just reeks of garlic trying to do this without spilling any there's literally just like a straight up layer of turp juice on top of it we're gonna mix this up a little bit make sure all those diamonds and terps get mixed together nicely just look how gloopy it is you guys this stuff's so hard to handle on a dabber bloop but it's fire i love the function of this recycler that's the perfect little drain let's get our dab ready i'm not kidding when i say this stuff's running you guys you really want to make sure you have a dabber that has some sort of scoop on it so you can make sure you get a decently sized dab all right let's go you guys [Music] this [ __ ] is crazy you guys i know i talk about garlic cookies a lot on my channel but the aroma and the flavor that you get from this is [ __ ] nuts like that aftertaste just stays for so long the dab is gone i've already taken it but i can still just taste that insane garlicky feeling and these are some great effects too i swear to god that one dab does the job but this is some live resin sauce most people just call it sauce though it's a pretty popular form of concentrate there's a lot of different terms to describe extracts like shatter butter batter crumble sauce diamond sugar the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of the concentrate not the quality everyone has a preference on their favorite consistency but none are just bad off of the consistency so just don't overthink it when it comes to quality of an extract it really just comes to what the quality of the product is going into it and the knowledge and experience of the person who's actually doing the extraction process it's not like chatter means bad sugar means good but sauce is a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a few dispensaries you've probably seen it or if you know a few plugs they probably got it it looks like a million tiny rocks swimming in a pool of like yellowy ambery liquid diamonds are their own form of concentrate typically they're on the bigger side and much less terpy where sauce is usually super tiny diamonds sometimes there's a couple big rocks in there but usually it's so small where you really can't even see them mixed with a crazy amount of terpenes but those little tiny diamonds are where the cannabinoids are so that's where majority of the thc is stored and the liquid portion is live resin terpenes so there's a super high percentage of terpenes in there and a super low percentage of cannabinoids which is why it's perfect to mix the two so the sauce might not get you very high alone but when you mix it with those diamonds it just packs a punch you get pretty [ __ ] lit and the terpenes add an additional entourage effect so it really does add an additional kick to the thc but i say it's time to take another dab [Music] uh oh [ __ ] this drink feels so awkward to hold i'm not gonna lie oh my god that train is [ __ ] crazy oh [ __ ] those terpenes are always super [ __ ] heavy on sauce so i usually try to make sure i get the strains i like when i pick it up i know i said that they're all pretty much the same thing but the main difference between sauce and every other strain is that it has like the most intense terpene profile plenty of other concentrates of high terpene profiles but the most overwhelmingly high is typically sauce and the terpene profile on this one is [ __ ] insane it's five point seven percent mercy and almost five percent carry off i mean four point five percent limiting and that's just the top three it's total terpenes is 18.4 if i did my math right like that's a lot of terps sugar also has a high terpene profile but it's a little bit more easy to work with let me open this jar real quick and show you what it looks like for those who don't know all right this is a fresh gram of bubba kush sugar as you can see it's still terpy but there's more of like a solid consistency to it there's still some sauce in there but there's much bigger diamonds that are a little bit easier to handle and work with these two are made of exactly the same stuff but have a completely different consistency but the main downsides the sauce in my opinion or how liquidy it is like i just said you really can't keep it in a hot environment you can't put it on its side for a long period of time and it's hard to work with on a dabber at least if you like big dabs like using a little needle like this would be so hard even using a scooper like this you really can't get too fat of a dab but looks are deceiving with sauce and sugar in my opinion if you're used to just only dab and shatter and you really haven't experienced sauce or sugar like you really don't realize how fat of a dab you're taking if you just scoop up a giant bit of it but again not all sauce looks exactly like this sometimes sauce looks like a mixture between the two concentrates that just showed you where they have a couple big rocks in there but it's majority that like super small diamond but a lot of companies really aren't that great labeling this stuff i bought some sauce before that was just straight up sugar i've bought some butter before that was sauce there's a little bit of like subjectiveness that comes to it where they're like i mean it's sugar but it's super terpy so let's just call it sauce they do try to label it as accurately as they can so that you can get a good idea for what you're going to consume nobody likes pissed off customers so they try to make it as accurate as they can but i'd be lying if i said i've never had it be a little off but to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all it's the best way to find out which one you like and which one you don't and it's like none of these are bad technically so you can try shatter you can try sauce you can try butter and you can see which one you like the best but i say we take one more dab before we head out of here this time i'm not gonna use the diver though personally this is my favorite way to dab sauce hey that's fire now that's the right way to dab sauce a lot of people message me and ask me to like clarify what consistency of concentrate they have it's mostly people

As Nate was getting into high school, the aggression levels just really started spiraling out of control. He randomly started running\ninto other classrooms, punching people for nothing. It took four adult men and\nhandcuffs to bring him down to the ground, cuff him and restrain him. At that time, he was taking\n18 pills every single day. And it wasn't even helping. I started researching the\nmedical marijuana states. We were able to come to California. I remembered seeing the\nbig neon cannabis leaf in the window, I'm like, \"Well\nthat's gotta be where we have to go.\" (laughs) (upbeat music) - [Interviewer] Why don't you\ntell me a little bit about your family, you have three kids. - Okay, my name is Jenni Mai. I have three sons on the autism spectrum. Each child is of course so\ndifferent, like any other child, and as far as them being on\nthe spectrum, Nathan is what is considered to be at\nthe very severe end. And rather than trying to\nfind the right medication, they just gave him more\nand more and more of it, and that was really the\nonly solution they had. I did not want him being\nchemically restrained in a bed, being (crying) taken care of by strangers. I'm sorry. I had come across this little video clip of a young boy who was just\nrepeatedly punching himself in the head. - [Reporter] 11 year old Alex\nEkels is severely autistic. His self-destructive\nbehavior brought on by-- - And it caught my attention because it was something that Nate had done. His parents were talking\nabout giving him some kind of an oil. I was confused, because it\nsounded like it was some kind of a marijuana derivative,\nand I was actually shocked and maybe even a little bit disgusted. - [Reporter] And after a\nfew months of treatment, the Ekels say they saw\na dramatic improvement. - Within just a few\nminutes of this boy taking the oil orally, he was\nsmiling, he was calm, and he wasn't hurting himself\nanymore, and I'm like, \"Wait, what just happened there?\" (laughs) I watched it a few more times, and I was completely\nshocked and desperate. - At that point, Jenni\nand her family just moved from Wisconsin to Missouri. Two states where getting pot\nlegally for really any reason is super difficult, but particularly medical\ncannabis to treat autism. Currently only 12 states include autism as a qualifying condition. Five other states and\nthe District of Colombia are considered autism friendly, meaning doctors can\nrecommend medical cannabis for debilitating conditions. So that leaves 33 states\nwhere you can't access medical cannabis to treat autism at all. - I was raised in the Nancy\nReagan \"Just say no\" era. - Say no to drugs, and say yes to life. - I would have never in\nmy life considered this to be a medicine, but I\nbasically told my husband, \"We have to try that.\" - Like most illicit drugs, the scientific and medical research of\nmarijuana has been challenging. But the tide appears to be turning. The first large scale\nclinical trials underway in Montefiore medical\ncenter in New York City. And it may be the key to\nunlocking access to treatment for children with autism, nationwide. Dr. Eric Hollander is leading that study. - I've been involved in research\ndeveloping new therapies and treatments, in\nautism spectrum disorders for about 30 years, and there's a big need to develop treatments for the\npoorer symptoms of autism. - This study focuses on a new\ncompound called Cannabidivarin or CBDV, it's an extract from\nthe cannabis plants similar to CBD, it doesn't include THC, the psychoactive drug that gets you high, and what Jenni uses to treat Nate, but it's the first step\nto studying cannabis to treat autism. - This particular\ncannabinoid has some effects on some of the underlying mechanisms that we think are essential to autism. The problem behaviors,\nthe destructive behaviors, and also in some of the\ncompulsive behaviors, or repetitive behaviors or\nperseverative behaviors, so it gets at a key mechanism\nthat we think is important. - There is reason to be optimistic. This new CBDV based drug is similar to one that's already been approved by the FDA to treat a severe form of\nepilepsy that shares some of the same symptoms that\nDr. Hollander is studying. This new research could\nhelp cement what has largely been anecdotal support of\nusing cannabis to treat autism. But while that research is\nongoing, parents like Jenni are moving to states that\nhave more lax marijuana laws. For Jenni and her family, that\nmeant packing up everything and moving all the way across the country. That decision may sound\nextreme, but for Jenni and Nate, it's been worth it. Their lives have been transformed since first visiting a dispensary. - We got home, and he\ntook a hit immediately. We got this one. - [Nate] Okay. - And within, not even five minutes, it was just like a light switch. He was happy, and just kind\nof looking around like, he had never seen the world\nin that way and he was smiling and looking at me, and\nI just knew right away, 'cause nothing acted that\nquickly or that positively ever. - Jenni has learned a lot since moving her family out to California. There she joined forces\nwith fellow mom, Ronda, to start the non-profit\nWhole Plant Access For Autism. Now it's a team of moms\ndedicating their lives to helping other families\nnavigate the challenges that come with getting cannabis\nfor their autistic kids. - I feel like a lot of people\nthat come to our booth, someone in their lives has\nbeen touched by autism, and they don't know that\nthis is an option for them. Other times we get people that you know, come to us after the event, they email us or they find us on social\nmedia and they want to learn. And that's kind of what we're\nabout, we're about educating. - We decided to take a\ndrive out to Joshua Tree. I had him vape and take an edible right before we left the house. He saw that I saw taking\npictures and most of the other pictures that I've\never taken of him in his life, it was kind of a vacant stare,\nhe wouldn't really look, he wouldn't really smile, and\nhe ran over in front of me and sat down. He sat there and he posed for a picture, like everybody else would\nin a situation like that. (sniffs) And I just, I'm like, \"That's it. That's basically his birth picture.\" You shouldn't have to go\nthrough the whole gamut of medications and side effects\nand long-term consequences of some of those side effects\nin order to get to it. Just look at cannabis as another tool in your tool belt to try. - Thanks for watching.

Recently I heard that he's playing\naround with cannabis cocktails. Now full disclosure, this isn't exactly like pot\nand cocktails. There's an ingredient called CBD which\nis supposedly supposed to mellow you out, but not actually get you like, f#%ked up. Let's go check it out.   \"Today we're going to make three\ndifferent cocktails, with the one of my favorite ingredients in the world: CBD.\" \"I mean, is this gonna get me\nhigh?\" \"CBD is a non-psychoactive component in the cannabis plant, so more or less\nwhat it's actually used for is to kind of help with bodily aches and pains. It's\nan anti-anxiety, anti-stress, antidepressant. So really what it does is it just kind\nof makes you feel fantastic, but it's not going to mess with your\nsort of mental state of being.\" \"This is my twist on the classic cocktail\nNegroni. So this is a Carpano Antica which is an Italian sweet vermouth. I'm also going to use Contrato apertif. I'm going to do a bar spoon of Ruby port just to give it some body, because that\napertif is a bit lighter. So I'm just going to give this a little\norange oil, drop that in there. I very purposefully decided to use\noil-based tincture for these cocktails, because if you go to an Italian\nrestaurant prior to your meal they give, you know, some olive oil and balsamic\nvinegar, right? I want people to see what they're putting in their bodies, so that\nthey can have that kind of residual fun effect. So this is the ingredient that's super\nimportant: five drops in your cocktail. So this is the Stoney Negroni.\" \"I love the presentation.\" \"It's super buttery and\nsmooth and you have a very subtle hint of that like herbalness from the...\" \"CBD?\" \"Do you see what just happened??\" \"Now is probably a good time to\njust move on to the next cocktail. It's an interesting twist on an Old\nFashioned and what we're using here is this organic bourbon from Chicago Koval, Mescal from Oaxaca called Benesin, some homemade bitters, and a homemade sasparilla syrup. So this is the Rolled Fashion.\" \"What's going on right over here?\" \"So the\ngarnish on this is a mini homemade vegan organic churro...haha which you can turn into a blunt.\" \"Just a great balance of flavors. The smokiness in the mescal works really\nnicely with the sort of like warm whiskey. The CBD is a little more subtle but you\nget that like very like mellow herbal quality from it.\" \"Let's move on to the third and\nfinal cocktail, and this is a vegan sour. So what's going to be in this, it's\nactually quite simple, it's a little bit of organic mint, some agave, some lime,\nsome tequila Blanco, a pinch of sea salt, and then we're going to put some aquafaba in there. The beauty of aquafaba is there's no risk of bacterial\ninfection, it's vegan, it's organic, there's no distinct smell or flavor\nwhereas with egg whites it can get a little hairy.\" \"So all of this frothiness is from the aquafaba.\" \"So right now I'm adding some ceremonial grade matcha, so this is the Sour T-iesel.\" \"This drink as compared to the two prior,\nI taste the CBD more, I think just because the ingredients here are more\ndelicate and not as pronounced, and I like the mint, it adds a freshness and\nvibrancy to the cocktail, and I think the CBD pairs really well with tequila.\" I think that's a great sort of like\nflavor across the board. You're so creative, I\ndefinitely don't know anyone else doing this.\" \"Cheers!\" \"If you want to learn more about matcha, click here.\"    ", "F0iV1rmjGoc": "hey guys i'm tara and i'm kendall and we're going to show you how to get a west virginia medical marijuana card in a few simple steps step one be a west virginia resident step two you must have one of the following qualifying medical conditions most conditions qualify conditions include chronic pain seizures ptsd and the following step three go online at greenhealthdocs.com or call or text 877 to schedule an appointment today we offer telemedicine visits statewide as well as clinic locations in martinsburg morgantown huntington and charleston step four bring your valid photo id and proof of your qualifying condition to your appointment proof of your qualifying conditions can be any of the following step 5 meet with our trained cannabis physician who will walk you through the process in becoming a legal cannabis patient and that's it guys following these simple steps will have you on track to become a legal cannabis patient in west virginia green health docs not your ordinary doctor's office for more information please call or visit us online you", "DENmSAifhmw": "week florida lawmakers are in session talking about the new items they want to see become law in 2021 and on the table is legalizing recreational use of marijuana the bill is getting new support because of how it may affect crime our christina evans is live in cape coral with more on this good morning christina good morning lisa medical marijuana here in florida is kind of easy to get if you come to a place like this if you have a prescription you can actually get your hands on it but if not the only other way to get marijuana is to get it off the streets and that can often increase violent crimes house representatives carlos smith and senator jeff brand is tag-teamed an effort to pass house bill 343 and senate bill 7-10 this means people 21 and older can legally buy amounts of marijuana without a doctor's prescription both lawmakers have brought up similar bills in the past but couldn't get enough support to make it law florida gulf coast university's economic professor victor clark says passing this legislation could actually reduce violent crime like murder which increased here in florida by 16 and a half percent just last year and if you decriminalize something that's currently criminalized and you allow it to happen out in the sunshine then normally a lot of the crime theft robbery murder those things often go away because there's more transparency now when things happen in the open if you turn selling marijuana into a business rather than into something that generates turf wars there's going to be less crime there's going to be less killing and in many ways people will be safer as a consequence professor clara also talks about the money advantage marijuana business daily predicts that the industry will generate upwards of 32 billion dollars by 2024 so money is sort of becoming the motivation behind this bill and wanting it to pass and coming up next i'll have more on how legal marijuana could actually increase tourism in our state in cape coral christina evans fox 4. they", "meN8qUmZ_oY": "CHLOE: PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS TELLING A MISSISSIPPI GROUP TO STOP SAYING THAT TRUMP SUPPORTS A BALLOT MEASURE THAT WOULD LEGALIZE MEDICAL MARIJUANA IN THE STATE.

legal questions Amy the attorney has the answers welcome to today's show and here's Amy hello and this is Amy the attorney I am welcoming Bob Reeg and Redman is that correct and she has had a business law firm in in Kansas City for quite some time she has focused primarily on probate in the early and middle parts hurt and I shouldn't say early in middle parts but she's now focusing on medical marijuana and has become a whiz kid about the ins and outs of Licensing businesses who want to become dispensaries I'm gonna mispronounce that so maybe you'll say it for me and so welcome hi thanks for having me all right so we're going to start and I really want to start with what is the state of medical marijuana in Missouri today is June the 11th of 2019 I know it's a rolling ball could change but from what what was passed in November what is happening now so patient caregiver and business license applications went online a week ago on June 4th the regulations while people will refer to them as final they're not final there are emergency regulations and there's going to be public hearing on those next month in Jefferson City which I'm hoping to make - and essentially the situation you have now is patients are currently going to their doctors or cannabis friendly clinics to get their certifications and recommendations because those have to be 30 within 30 days old by the time you apply and the soonest you can apply as a patient or a caregiver is going to be July 4th then on the business side you've got business owners who are getting together their standard operating procedures which I call SOPs they're you know getting the real estate lock down trying to figure out where they're going to place their businesses because the licenses are going to be attached to the premises and they're getting their documents from the Secretary of State business organization stuff like that so that's on the business licensing and application side on the law and the regulatory side we're still having a conversation with the department about what can be on the licensing application what should be on the licensing application and then maybe challenging some things that people are having a bit of an issue with and so that dialogue is continuing and the department emailed me this morning on an issue that I had addressed with him the other day and told me that they would get back with me next week but right now they're updating their FA queues and trying to iron out some of these details as well so okay yeah it's I'm so happy it happened I love reading your Facebook post because you seem passionate about the issue but also in a very holistic way including talking about people that are currently imprisoned for marijuana and what the state should be doing to address those people we're going to get to that but I want to break some of this down of what you're talking about so first I want to talk about you mentioned caregiver user is there a mechanism for somebody that cares say for somebody who couldn't be licensed I mean is there a differentiation of the caregiver and user yes sort of okay so first you have your patient right and to be a qualified patient under amendment 2 there's 10 different categories that you get your certification under everything from autism and migraines and multiple sclerosis to the last category which is anything your doctor thinks it would be beneficial for realize that most doctors won't certify under that last category so early in the game because they're worried about getting audited so they're just gonna go with the easiest thing so if you have a patient who is younger than 18 years old or maybe is well let's just start there their parent or guardian can be a caregiver for them and so what you do is you turn in your patient application with your doctor's certification that has to be less than 30 days old and then the caregiver turns in their application to be your caregiver which will allow them to purchase marijuana on your behalf to transport it on your behalf to administer it on your behalf and if you pay an extra hundred dollars to grow it in a locked facility on your behalf and also to administer it to you and that caregiver status works the same if you're an adult you know disabled person or even if if I wanted to be a patient and I didn't want to grow my own I could hire a caregiver to grow mine for me and a caregiver can have up to two patients that they grow for as well as being able to grow for themselves so a caregiver can also be a patient they just can't be so incapacitated that they don't understand what they're doing for someone else okay so this would be that's a separate application separate process for the caregiver persona or caregiver role in the in the business correct okay all right so let's talk about the user and the process you said the applications begin July 4th where do they apply so they apply online through the Department of Health and Senior Services website so if you google Missouri DHS s Medical Marijuana you can't miss it it will take you right there on the top right hand side of the webpage they're going to have a drop down menu where you could choose you know for facilities for patients you know whatever you're going to go to that patient button and you're going to click it and it the applications right there you can actually look at the application now and even print it off and fill it out so that when you go to apply online you'll have all of your information already there things that patients need to realize that they need to have number one that doctor's certification is less than 30 days old number two they need to have a 25 dollar application fee ready to go a copy of their driver's license or state-issued ID and also something akin to a passport photo that is less than three months old so they need to turn all of those things in and be able to apply that way if they want to grow their own there's a special section on the application where they have to explain to the department where they're planning on growing it and how they plan to maintain the security of that area so only the patient can have access to that area or their caregiver okay all right let's let's backtrack so online is going to be the only place that you can apply correct unless online shuts down then the department is going to notify people through their website of alternative means of application okay good all right so let's talk about the grow you tell you growing your own you talked about it a little bit in the previous two segments but I want to nail it now what are the costs involved and what are mean are they doing this in their basement what is half you know what would give me the whole deal on growing your own so a patient can grow up to six plants six flowering plants I should say at one time you can have what they call teenage plants that are under 14 inches tall you can have clones but you can only have six actual flowering plants for people who don't understand how grows work flowering depends on deprivation of light so in a controlled environment for an indoor grow and most the time when you're getting the plant started early on and the clone stage or even the teenage stage they might get 18 to 24 hours of light a day but then when you want them to start flowering you back that off to 12 and 12 and so they get 12 hours a lie 12 hours of dark they start flowering so at that point the patient can add an extra hundred dollars to their application to apply for a home grow you know what if you've got a closet at home you can actually grow in your closet as long as you're able to lock it and no one else is going to be able to get into it but you just basically have to have a secure location whether it's in your basement whether it's a closet whether it's a spare bedroom I even have some clients that are talking about basically creating a facility where there's different rooms or different pods that they can lease to patients and caregivers to grow their own so that's also going to be an option if you want to do an outdoor grow there has to be a screen over the top so you cannot access it from the top there has to be slats so that you can't necessarily see what's in there and of course it has to be locked so it's not like you're trying to keep the squirrels out of your garden you're trying to keep everyone out of your garden and I think it's going to be a lot more difficult to control your growing conditions in that kind of an environment but Missouri has is one of three states in the country with some of the best soil or cannabis cultivation the other is Oregon and I believe North or South Carolina so you know we do have good growing conditions here but for the patient the cost is going to be lower to grow outside potentially because you're not going to have the electricity stock that you're going to have with the lighting situation that I just told you about but the other issue is that you may not be able to have as consistent of a supply depending on what your needs are and we can get into quantities if you want but at the end of the day the only way that you're really going to be able to as a patient that the standard is 4 ounces of dried flower per 30-day period or its equivalent and don't ask me for the equivalent off the top of my head because I'm really bad at math and you're not gonna be allowed to use combustible extraction methods in your home so if you do want an extract my best advice to patients is just once it becomes available go to a dispensary and by your DAB's try to make a bed at home so in under the the new law is it's not just the smokeable marijuana that we're talking about it is the all the different products I've been to Colorado so I've seen what's available are all the things like you said dab oils I can't even wear some of them are all of those going to be legal in the state of Missouri as well if you have a card yeah and we in the last legislative session they were trying to put in place a ban that would have prevented edibles that would have appealed the children can't be shaped like a fruit can't you know have a cartoon character on it can't you know be sweet or whatever that went nowhere thank God but you know yeah you should be able to find it you know and they even allow suppositories in Missouri which a lot of people are like oh who cares about that well actually somebody who is in a horrific amount of pain does care about that because that is probably the most effective delivery method it enters the system rather quickly it lasts for a very long time and you can take very high doses that way without the corresponding head high or whatever you would normally get if you were to ingest that amount like through it edible or whatever and the reason that's important is a lot of states don't have suppositories they're very very difficult to find so our law specifically allows for it which is great okay let's talk about when you have the card and where you can and what we're going to specifically talk about smoking just because it's probably the most obtrusive and most noticeable what is the law regarding what where can you smoke that legal marijuana not in a public place so basically you'll be safe in your home and theoretically and practically speaking you shouldn't be doing it around other people in Missouri who aren't patients because then you don't you know if the smell attracts law enforcement or whatever and you're the ones smoking it they're going to assume everyone else is partaking and then you're going to have a bit of explaining to do so typically in the privacy of your own home is is the way to go however some locations may be able to provide a spot for a patient and either a family member or a caregiver if they want to have them with them to consume their cannabis medicinally on premises it'll be like a little room you go in there by yourself and get the job done but the trend nationally is towards consumption lounges so I've got a client in Southern California who opened up the first legal consumption lounge down there and it's just like a bar except no alcohol cannabis instead and lots of water and snacks so that's on the horizon and I've been telling my dispensary clients you know if you're if you're smart you're gonna get a premises where you can't you have extra space so that when that does become a possibility you can easily retrofit your space and then you don't have to apply for a new a whole new license you've already got a license on the premises let's talk about the business side of this which is where you're representing probably the most amount of people what are the different kind of businesses associated with the medical marijuana industry we use there's dispensaries but I'm sure that there are other kinds of I mean start with the dispensaries but there's probably other kinds of businesses that are associated with this industry so I'm just gonna go down the food chain so first you got to have a cultivator which is your classic pop farmer okay and it's either going to be an indoor grow an outdoor grow or a greenhouse which is kind of considered a combination of the two to get it from the cultivator to the next stop you're going to have a transport company so transport companies are going to take the raw flower plant material to the testing facility testing facility is going to test the product tell you how much THC CBD CBG and whatever is in that product they're going to make sure that there's no pesticides solvents things like that in it that's not contaminated from there the product can be taken to a manufacturing facility so it's a manufacturer of infused products I call them MIPS but basically they're the ones that make your gummies they make the oils shattered ABS bait pen cartridges all of that stuff they may take that back to the testing lab make sure that the solvents are completely out of it that they use for the extraction process then you're going to take it to a dispensary and the dispensary is where you're going to ultimately be able to purchase these items the dispensary the myth the testing lab the cultivator they all use the seed to sale tracking system seed to sale tracking gets implemented for everybody December 2020 the reason for that is how are we going to get the original plants and seeds here when it's illegal to transport across state lines so we refer to that as Immaculate Conception so there's an Immaculate Conception period in the state of Missouri for one year and so January 1st 2021 that's when you're going to start seeing you know that you can only then if you're trying to buy seeds or clones you'll only be able to buy them from dispensaries or a licensed business so you know they're not going to don't-ask-don't-tell how it got here before then it is very policy that's surprising yeah well I mean how else is it gonna get started so um but you know when you go to these trade shows every possible industry that you can think of is in the cannabis industry you've got to have HVAC people to get the exhaust just right you've got to have soil guys who do nothing but produce soil for this you have I saw a dry ice guys show up the last conference I went to in Vegas he looked like he had been just dropped there out of a helicopter he had no idea why it was there and I and I said what is the dry ice machine about he goes I have no idea there's that there's a manufacturer down there he can tell you well I wasn't asked him and what they do is they they take the flour and they put it on a screen and they put dry ice on top of it and all the kief which is the pollen and the trichomes and everything falls through the screen onto a metal plate because they're dry ice and that's what they make really really highly concentrated concentrate that up so yeah every single industry will be affected by this every single area of law will be affected by this absolutely absolutely alright we are going to get to the criminal part of it but I have a couple questions the testing facility is homegrown exempt from having to go through the testing facility yeah that's correct it's very expensive to get your cannabis tested number one most home growers probably aren't going to want that expense although if they wanted to they could but number three interesting factoid for the criminal defense folks out there there is not a single lab that is DEA certified in this country to test for THC levels okay because this is schedule 1 controlled substance under the CSA so no level is an acceptable level right all right ok you talk about CBD and hemp and because basically they be scheduled lized THC derived from him but not any other form of THC and is that I mean this is just kind of from left field just is that just pilots because I mean like what is keeping the United States government from making it not a Schedule 1 substance me what is happening politics politics but what is the projects the the politics is basically that there there's a certain segment of the population that still buys into the fake news of reefer madness and still thinks it's going to kill brain cells and cause people to be stupid and unproductive and whatever the case may be and it's just it's just a matter of getting out there correcting the history correcting the the narrative on this and you know moving forward with science which and we'll talk about that when we get to criminal and DUI and stuff but there's not a single study out there that will link THC to impaired driving and also they have not been able to do a single study that verifies that a person can physically overdose from this stuff it's impossible so there while there may be cannabis related deaths like there is drunk driving related deaths or drinking related deaths like somebody gets wasted and falls into a pool and drown so I'm sure that's happened with cannabis right like cannabis does not directly cause death in and of itself like a fall can or anything else again is a delivery going to be part of the mechanism here in Missouri could you deliver marijuana to somebody absolutely so if you get a cultivation license a MIT license a dispensary license it includes your ability to transport transport so every facility license is going to have different transport requirements so a cultivation facility can transport to another licensed facility whether it's a testing facility or a myth a myth can transfer to test to a dispensary and a dispensary can deliver to its patients and caregivers that's that's wonderful I mean yeah I mean because I mean if the whole plane is acts patient access and you're dealing with severely disabled people who may not be able to drive or may not have reliable access to transportation then absolutely the only thing is before it leaves the dispensary it has to be paid for so they may have to take the payment over the phone or something to that effect but they're not going to allow the product to leave the dispensary until it's paid for okay on these businesses that are the businesses that you're helping Shepherd through the this process what are the costs associated for them oh that is such a loaded question so it's it's it's going to really depend on their business model so some of my clients are what's called vertically integrated and what that means is they're getting a license not just for a dispensary but also a myth and a cultivation as well so they can do all three things and so it's going to be very expensive for them because they're going to have three separate applications potentially three separate locations and so you know they're going to have a lot more cost if you're just doing like a thousand square-foot dispensary your costs are going to be much lower part of the issue that I raised with the Department of Senior Services Health and Senior Services was they had implemented capital requirements in their licensing structure it was five hundred thousand dollars liquid capital for cultivators and three hundred thousand apiece for MIPS and dispensaries it got reduced to three hundred thousand dollars on cultivation and a hundred and fifty thousand dollars permits and dispensaries but think about that in an industry that doesn't have any banking whatsoever you can't get a traditional bank loan you can't even locate your business on a property that has a more a bank mortgage on it where are you going to come up with a hundred and fifty thousand dollars liquid capital to show these folks and that's you know a significant amount of points on your license application so um I did make an argument that I thought that that violated equal protection because of the disparate impact that that has on urban communities and people of color who I think belong in this industry but are going to struggle even more with access to capital than the average person so the costs are considerable the other thing is if you have a dispensary or depending on the type of business model that you have they're requiring you to have a pharmacist on call or on retainer which is crazy to me because the pharmacists have never been able to prescribe this and I'm not really sure what kind of education they get on it other than just cursory education because less than 10 percent of our medical schools even get into the endocannabinoid system with their residents and their and their students so but it's an extra expense that you're just going to have to have in order to apply and clients will sit there and say well I'll just put it on my application and I won't do it well no you can't do that because your application signed under oath and if you have a significant deviation from that after you've been awarded your license your license can get yanked if you don't notify the department after the fact that things have changed so whatever your plan is now you need to kind of stick to it what is the money that the state has allotted for enforcement both in the business sector and in the user sector or home grow sector what are the enforcement mechanisms and the their money and people for it I don't know how to answer that question it's a very good question so all the money that they have taken for prepayment of application fees it totals almost three and a half million at this point that money is earmarked for veterans programs so also in the legislature last year something that didn't make it was they were trying to say well if there's lawsuits or whatever involving this law and it's enforcement against the department we want them to be able to utilize the veterans fund to pay for Legal Defense which I found kind of egregious and I think it's unconstitutional under a - but that's just my opinion that didn't survive luckily so the money issue I'm not really sure about to be quite frank I don't know where it's gonna come from if they're going to use it out of the veterans fund or if they have a certain portion of that that they're gonna earmark I do know that there's going to be seven enforcement officers for the entire state of Missouri know you're gonna have a hundred ninety two dispensaries 60 grow facilities and about eighty two MIPS so I'm guessing that the emphasis is going to be on enforcing business as it has been in other states that have done this rather than attacking the patients and the caregivers unless there's some sort of report of abuse or law enforcement involvement we're gonna what about you actual smaller municipalities cities counties and their reaction to this I happen to be on the Grand View website for Grandview Municipal Court and there was a notice of a meeting a general public meeting to the legislative their City Council to discuss the new marijuana regulations and how it would affect Grandview can you speak to that at all not Grandview specifically all I know about Grandview is they're going to have a hard time placing dispensaries or any businesses there because unless they implement a variance through their ordinances the law basically says that they have to locate these kinds of businesses a thousand feet away from any Church secondary school primary school or daycare and grand views got a lot of churches it's going to be very difficult to find a spot and in Grand View unless they shorten that distance and some cities have some cities in Missouri absolutely have Columbia for example in and I should say the law doesn't allow any municipality in this state to prohibit a cannabis based business okay what it does say is that the city can regulate reasonable time place and manner right and of course you can't have a big pot leaf out front or anything like that advertising is going to be very strict that's why when you go to Colorado you see all these adopt-a-highway signs with the cannabis businesses on them because that's how they get to advertise on signs so there's going to be restrictions like that like in Columbia they tried to say well in our downtown district you can only put them on the second floor of a building and and that failed and so there have been lots of little skirmishes and the City Council meetings as to how this is going to work but most of the time the trend is to say okay we're going to be welcoming because they realize it's gonna bring revenue but at the same time they can't charge any additional tax on the marijuana and they can only do reasonable time place and manner restrictions and there's a meeting coming up in Kansas City I believe on the 12th so maybe tomorrow I think it's tomorrow will there be areas in the state of Missouri that it will be harder to get medical marijuana than say the city's I mean will there be a dearth of dispensaries and businesses in out state or mid Missouri well I think part of the problem that you're facing is and you can see it in some of the application requirements right so with the merit-based scoring system if you locate your business in an area that has a lower employment rate you're going to get extra points on your license and so there are people that are actively looking in congressional districts in zip codes that are economically distressed because they could potentially bring jobs to those areas however isn't economically viable for a business to locate in an area like that and we're not really sure I mean if the income is lower there then they're not going to be able to mark up their product like they're used to there's about a 300 percent markup on average nationally just because if you're a dispensary you don't get the tax deductions under 280e that a normal business does so you're right offs are less and your markup is higher but in an economically distressed area that may be a problem what abysses mentioned just amid some tax and then obviously licensing what are some other cross-sections of the law that are going to intersect with the medical marijuana in Missouri banking so triad bank is the only bank that's going has said that it's going to assist these types of clients and the fees are probably going to be pretty high there is a banking bill currently pending in the United States Congress that might change all of this they hope to get it passed by the end of the year but we'll see child custody and divorce cases it's no longer an illegal drug if a parent is medicating with cannabis that's not going to be grounds to be an unfit parent probate and Trust law which is my baby in the background that I come from my big concern is with patient and caregiver home grows because there's just a tiny little blurb at the end of the regs that basically say okay you've got 10 days to notice that notifying the department if somebody dies then we're going to give you a letter that allows you to transport their cannabis whether it's plant cannabis or whether it's purchased cannabis to a local dispensary for disposal well number one who's going to pay the dispensary to dispose of it because disposal is kind of expensive sometimes depending on whether or not it's a hazardous material and they won't know whether it's a hazardous material because they won't have it tested so they don't know what's been put on it in other words um number two in probate we have to inventory every single asset so are you telling me that the cannabis is not an asset doesn't have a value that creditors can come after to get their debts paid and it's not available to the heirs I mean so there's a lot of issues there or if somebody who owns one of these businesses dies is their license transferable how does that work when it comes to DUI laws you know the the I believe it was the Highway Patrol at any rate some state level of law enforcement up in Michigan commissioned at us to get done to try to see if they could figure out what a legal limit would be for drivers and the test said there's no way to determine a legal limit for this they recommended none employment is another big one a lot of states are doing away with employment discrimination against cannabis users and some states are saying you know you can't test for this any more work comp in Missouri our work comp statutes basically will only deny benefits if you are found to be under the influence at the time of the accident so that's not gonna cover somebody who just you know went home the night before had some before bed woke up fine the next day and was injured on the job so I mean insurance coverage is insurance gonna start to cover this oh you know what are we gonna do under the Affordable Care Act it's something it's like it will literally affect everything yeah I just love being talking to you because I just know you you're passionate about the issue and you're just giving us the whole view of it and it is going to impact us and even you know for people that wouldn't think oh it's not gonna impact me Fanning it is going to be in your life in one way or another and you may not even know it until something pops up yeah absolutely all right let's talk about criminal enforcement of marijuana laws I had read on your blog that you know Jean Peters Baker who is the prosecutor in Jackson County pretty much after the amendment to past who then said we were going to pretty much stop enforcing it with some exceptions she didn't say everything but then we will no longer prosecute marijuana cases is that's a trend that you've seen across the state tell talk to me a little bit about that so we've got that now in st. Louis and in Kansas City and it's a I believe it's a hundred grams or less you would probably know better than me I had a gentleman call me about a month ago he was flying in from Denver he was an amputee so he's missing a leg and he had two cartridges in his backpack vape cartridges he went outside to smoke a cigarette to wait to get picked up his friend was inside to claim the bags and they saw a k-9 unit tag his bag a bag claim and of course you know it was the situation of am I in trouble and I said well okay CPD has jurisdiction over the airport so you're probably just gonna get a citation nothing ended up coming from it to be honest with you and I was very happy about that but yeah that that seems to be the trend and there there is a growing trend towards decriminalization of numerous types of drugs psilocybin and peyote most recently in denver and oakland respectively and i know that there's a groundswell for that here too i mean most people are like oh hold on we just legalized marijuana here i mean you know but what's happening is as the trend grows towards what some people refer to as recreational use I'll call it adult or therapeutic use there's also a trend towards just decriminalization of other substances in general too just because everyone's starting to realize that criminalization has been based primarily on politics not on science and so I think you're gonna see more of it and I wouldn't be surprised if we had full adult use here in Missouri in the next two to three years and you know maybe also psilocybin or magic mushrooms would follow that just because of its therapeutic use on PTSD and severe depression when nothing else works how do the legislature address at all people that are incarcerated for marijuana at this time while they were I mean I know the amendment to pass they're doing some law so anybody in Jeff City talking about the people that are incarcerated right now yeah there there was a rep out of st. Louis I would butcher I would say his name but I'm gonna butcher it's all good you rep out of st. Louis and there have been a couple other reps too that have put forward expungement bills that just didn't really make it anywhere and that's super disappointing because when you think about it these are people are incarcerated for doing something that is now pretty much legal in a majority of the states across the country and there are people like Augie Busch who are making millions if not billions off of this industry while others are being locked up for the exact same thing I find it morally abhorrent that being said you know in California and Colorado and in other states they're really starting to push that decriminalization and the expungements and and all of that and I think that it should have been the first step and then you know businesses should have been the second step but I mean no one listens to me so right it's money yeah money right you're absolutely right that's it so let me ask you this okay I keep saying that let me ask this I do that every time what about the doctors like I know that there are specific clinics in Kansas City that are going to start seeing patients to get the license is that gonna be the trend or rebels I asked my doctor in January after had passed and she was like I don't feel comfortable doing it I'm not going to do it III don't know if she has changed her mind but will be the trend be a specific doctor that pretty much sees these patients that need this or do you feel like it will expand to general practitioners somebody's doctor I I'm not sure how to answer that question either because right now yeah the trend is to have places like the green clinics which by the way I highly recommend excellent organization or you know business company whatever you want to call it franchise they are incredible and what happened is you take your medical records from your treating physician who has already diagnosed you and you go to a doctor that understands cannabis is knowledgeable about it is not afraid of it it won't fear monger it won't make you feel like a criminal for going in there they review your medical records they give you an evaluation based on those medical records and say yeah I can check the box for migraines so a couple things about that thing number one is you can get a medical card from another state for instance California doesn't have a residency requirement and say you have a medical card from California you're in Missouri and you have less than your four allotted ounces on you you're immune from prosecution period but you're not going to be able to probably buy it in a dispensary which is another odd constitutional argument where you're given an immunity from prosecution but not the privilege of buying it so does Full Faith and Credit really exist medical tourism has become big in the states that do allow reciprocity like Nevada but then you know you've got this other issue too will these doctors start to come online and part of that is actually a cost issue for them I saw one doctor and one of the groups that I belong to and get my information from her insurance premiums went up a thousand dollars a month just for recommending medical cannabis do they go up a thousand a month for recommending fentanyl I mean I I don't know but it might be an economic thing for some of these doctors I think again it goes back to the education thing if we can get out there and start educating people and getting rid of the fake news that was done by reefer madness then maybe you know we'll see these insurance rates drop it becomes more economically feasible for these doctors to do this also you know as as lawyers amendment to protects professionals it protects CPAs it protects you know lawyers it protects doctors from you know working legally in this industry on a state level but one thing that hasn't happened yet is that our office of chief disciplinary Council has not yet come out like they have in Colorado and said if you're a lawyer and you're a patient we'll protect you they haven't done that yet and so you know there's some of us that are eagerly waiting for that decision and wondering if our ethics counsel is even going to touch it at all so and I think there's probably something going on with doctors in that realm too there's there's a lot of fear for professionals yep yeah that makes sense that makes sense all right so what have I not asked you that you think people are wanting to know or should know about you know often I get asked and I'll just kind of go through the the typical questions I get asked on a regular basis great how much money do I need to to open up a dispensary you're probably gonna need about half a million dollars to get a sensory up and running and that's gonna be hard to come by until you get your license and once you get your license then you're gonna get a bunch of investors you have to be 51% Missouri owned in order to get a business license you have to be a Missouri residents resident with proof of residency in order to get a patient card here and be allowed to grow your own if you're a caregiver you can have two people including in plus yourself so three that you can grow four and then if I'll be able to stock you can the caregiver sell that marijuana to the other two people you're just growing it for them they're growing it for them now it's not a situation where sale of the product is a lie sale of the service is a gray area so there's that okay what I'd like it depend land it depends I mean you go to these conferences and you you can talk to people who have been in this industry for ten years in another state and you'll ask them questions and their answer is we're not really sure what's happening we don't really know what's going on so I mean it's kind of the Wild West we're just sort of muddling our way through it the best we can and you know I should say that the state is doing a really good job implementing this I mean there there have been other states that have had nightmares situations like Arkansas God when did they pass their law like four years ago and they only have three dispensaries in the entire state so I mean I know everyone's impatient but you know for all of their faults the department's doing a very good job trying to implement this on the timeline that they were given and we do need to be grateful for that but like with any other law it's imperfect and if there are questions or comments that people have they need to let the department know they're actually fairly responsive but you know there's there's lots of constitutional issues here and one of those issues I pointed out the other day to the department was they want people to on our application describe how they're going to handle financial transactions when there's no bank involved um that violates a federal money laundering statute right so you're you're asking people to put down in writing in a thousand words or less how they plan on handling financial transactions that are illegal under federal law and then they sign that for under Oh this amendment right against self incrimination so you know there's so many areas here that just have to be parsed out and it would just be infinitely easier if you just d schedule at all um and i know we're here to talk about cannabis but i get asked a lot about the CBD situation okay great and the issue with that is also nobody knows but they they have the farm bill in 2018 which d scheduled heme derived THC so essentially what that means is someone could grow acres and acres of hemp take it to a lab have all the THC extracted out and theoretically that THC is not a schedule 1 controlled substance and is legal whereas you could grow a pot plant and that is illegal so I mean there's some interesting stuff there and I call it quasi legal because there have been raids on CBD facilities where they are pulling all of the edibles off the shelf and that's because the FDA has yet to come in and say whether or not it's a safe food additive and put regs in place for that and then also the USDA is going to be granting licenses to have farmers through local state and educational programs so theoretically if you don't have a license to grow hemp that would also be illegal even though it's being bendy scheduled so I mean even CBD is in flux right now explain to me CBD and THC okay so you have a you wanna chart I can show you a chart sure okay so essentially you have a plant that has a ton of medicinal properties a lot of different medicinal compounds but they're all different and so what they're trying to do is they're trying to isolate certain compounds and really people who tend to be advocates of this plant want a full spectrum so what you have here can you see that yep so basically these are all the different cannabinoids you have in the plant and every single one of them has a different medical use okay and so for instance if you have CBD it says here that it reduces spasms anxiety it's a sleep aid muscle relaxant antidepressant increases appetite pain relief reduces nausea inhibits tumor cell growth and is anti-inflammatory THC on the other hand is a pain reliever increases appetite relieve spasms antioxidant muscle relaxant and relieves nausea there are one two three four five six seven eight nine ten different compounds in the plant and we only really talked about two of them which is CBD and THC and THC is the psychoactive component in the plant so CBD is it doesn't necessarily get you high I like th sleep s well in fact if you were to vape it or eat it or whatever you're not gonna feel all stoned you're not gonna feel high you might feel less pain you might feel less anxious but it's not gonna be the pronounced oh yeah I'm gonna sit back here and relax right you know you're just gonna go about your life like you took an Aleve is what's gonna happen did the Department of Health and Human Services create a entire division or is it just under the general auspices of Department of Health and Human Services they created a special division and I don't know if they call it a division but they have you know all different kinds of divisions within them for instance they're the same entity or the same body that regulates mo HealthNet which is our Medicaid program they also put out regulations for nursing homes they do all kinds of things right so yeah it's a subsection of that department and if you save you to get a hold of them would you just be the same thing that you mentioned at the top of Google Department of Health and Human Services marijuana and gets you to a place where you can ask them questions absolutely and they they have an email and they also have a phone number that you can contact them at to comment or ask questions okay and we'll get those on the screen during the edit I am so happy you came on I this is a subject that is always interested me I'm so glad it finally passed in Missouri and I hope that we do you say two or three years down the road that it's legal for everyone and I want to work with you or anyone that wants to work on expungement and exoneration of people or that are still incarcerated because of marijuana it's ridiculous I've been doing criminal defense since 2002 and I'm always just stunned at the lack of knowledge around marijuana and by prosecutors and they're somewhat veel and are their zeal about prosecuting this harmless I mean what I consider to be somewhat harmless drug and I'm ready to see that change and I'm happy it's changing in my lifetime I feel like there's a lot of stuff in the criminal justice world that is changing this the pendulum is swinging and I'm just ecstatic to be seeing it and being a part of it because it's a long time coming and has so much to do with race and class and money and it's it's time for some justice so thank you for coming on to the show so much for having me it's been a pleasure [Music] you you", "9kTeuZ_kka4": "if i hadn't gone through what i went through in utah i wouldn't be showing up in wyoming christine stenquist leads together for responsible use in cannabis education she backed proposition 2 which legalized medical marijuana in utah and sued the state when the legislature overrode what voters approved with a highly regulated program medical cannabis advocates in wyoming asked for her help so she went on a speaking tour i was hoping to bring what i learned from my experience in utah to wyoming to see if the legislators and the advocates could work together on a piece of legislation now she's involved in efforts to get medical cannabis legislation off the ground in wyoming she says it's different than working with the utah legislature let's be frank because we have a different element in this state than any other state and what makes us conservative as opposed to a conservative another state has to do with the religion i have spasticity that just about throws me out of my wheelchair sometimes it just depends on the day what it's going to do but those type of therapies would definitely help somebody like me madonna long is an advocate for people with disabilities she's been pushing for the wyoming state legislature to address medical cannabis the people in wyoming are ready and now it's just up to our leaders to decide which way they're going to go forward with that type of legislation wyoming lawmakers are starting to seriously consider medical cannabis legislation following a similar path the utah state legislature took leading up to proposition two i've been watching what's going on around us and i'm particularly interested in utah representative bill henderson has introduced a bill to conduct a study on whether medical cannabis is good for wyoming it does not legalize medical marijuana but it's a proactive it's intended to be a proactive comprehensive due diligence study you know i i believe if if you want to implement good policy it's better to understand what the requirements are it's not the only bill in the works in the wyoming state legislature fox 13 is told there could be as many as three including a marijuana decriminalization and grow at home bill and one that implements a full program advocates want medical cannabis dispensaries like other states have we have to have brick and mortar because we shouldn't limit access for our most vulnerable people who are really the people that are suffering representative marshall burt is wyoming's first libertarian party lawmaker who's also been working with stenquist on cannabis issues we can continue to hold off and push it down the road that it's never going to happen in our state or we can we can look at how we can embrace it he's offered to co-sponsor cannabis bills that implement policy but warns that like utah wyoming voters could take matters into their own hands if it goes that way then by all means we'll push a ballot initiative we will we will get the work done we will get it on the ballot and we will see where the people want to want to go with it but like utah discovered a ballot initiative carries risks i don't want wyoming to fall in the same trap that utah did and get it back to the state and the state controls it again and the people's voice can't do anything regardless of where it goes lawmakers in cheyenne acknowledge they have to start talking about it now it's legal in a different form in each of the states around us except idaho i haven't decided then i think we need to we need to move ahead in the right way but we need to be ready for for what we what we're going to face i support the discussion i haven't made a final decision on exactly how the legalization aspect of it would would turn out and similar to efforts in utah wyoming advocates are preparing to push lawmakers to legalize medical cannabis we're going to be bringing them our voices we're going to be bringing them our stories i'm very hopeful for wyoming i'm very optimistic in what they're trying to do i think people need to keep watching they're not done yet they're not done they they may go slow but i think they'll set an example for other conservative states that this is something that they can move forward on wyoming cannabis advocates are asking people in that state to call their lawmakers and urge support any bills the wyoming state legislature takes up will be

here is it true that in general covet 19 death rates have actually gone down okay so it depends what window of time you look at and where at the overall curve you are looking right now according to the department of hhs we're actually seeing those numbers go up but if you compare it to let's say february march april yes we have made incredible progress the learning curve for the critical care of patients with severe and critical cova 19 has been very rapid on the part of intensivists critical care specialists all of the nurse anesthetists etc so we are learning how to treat these patients better but right now our death rate is climbing all right and our final question i've heard rumors cannabis may help treat covid19 complications is there any truth to that so i am a big believer in the therapeutic modality of cannabis i think we're just at its infancy right now in terms of studying it and understanding its benefits as well as its risks the short answer is based on existing data there's potential help but there's also potential harm overall cannabis users can be at increased risk of covid but there is a drug that actually was approved by the fda to go into phase one clinical trials by the end of this year it's a synthetic cannabinoid and it is being targeted to be studied in patients with that so-called cytokine storm to reduce the inflammation so not yet ready for prime

entertainment and this is the moment we've all been waiting for this is the top 10 flowers out of the top 100 best strains that i've tried since they've had legal licensed regulated marijuana including medical marijuana and recreational marijuana i had to buy 1500 strains to make a list of 100 and now we're all the way down to the top ten you'd have to buy fifteen hundred flowers to have this information and this list is so good because i get a lot of tips every day i post one flower in my review and then people give me tips to buy the flowers so now because it tips the flower picks are through the roof and the list is through the roof and this is the winner this is number one but i'm not going to tell you what it is till the end we're going to start with number 10 today and we're going to go to number one and i'm telling you this is the list of lists if you're hunting flowers follow this top 100 i'm telling you it's a winner winner chicken dinner and this is number one so let's start the countdown coming in at number 10 from alien labs is something called baklava and i got this at buds and roses in studio city and it's a hybrid and it's got 25 thc and this is one of the flowers that i was looking for and looking for and finally it showed up and it's always great when something you have expectation for meets expectation and baklava is good and it is strong and it's got focus and it's got you for you and it made it all the way to the top 10 to number 10 coming in at number 10 baklava by alien labs but we're moving up to even better flower coming in at number nine we have something called biscotti by connected and this flower is good 30 thc and a hybrid i got this at museums and i'm telling you once you get to this level of flower all these flowers are good so the top ten can be mixed around a little bit i have my favorite and we're going to talk more about those later but coming in at number nine is something called biscotti by connected cannabis it was my ninth favorite here in los angeles if you see biscotti it's definitely worth the try but we're moving on up coming in at number eight if you can imagine we have another connected strain and this one's called connected gushers and the gusher seems to be good amongst all the different cultivators i don't know why but the one of the good ones the really good one and i got this at museums this is a hybrid with 30 thc is connected gushers if you see it it's definitely worth the try this flower is awesome and it was my eighth favorite here in los angeles but we're moving up to even better flower coming in at number seven we have something from top shelf cultivation who wants to guess what it is right it is whoa see whoa this is a good flower 31 thc it's an indica and this flower is top shelf this flower will stone you to the bone it is got focus it's a good one i liked it and it was my seventh favorite that i've tried here in los angeles whoa see woah top shelf cultivation is a good one to try and it comes in at number seven but we're moving up to even better flower coming in at number six and i love this flower i really do this is from the cure company and there's no props here to anyone even though we always have respect this is all about the best flower and coming in at number six we have the marathon marathon og nipsey may rest in peace your you live on as a flower it is a marathon this thing will last you all day this is a good flower it's an indica it's got 26 thc and i bought a lot of this flower this flower is consistently good so far for me if you want something that can last a whole day it's got you for it makes you stoned enough this is a really good one but i think my favorite part about this is it really lasts a long time 26 thc my sixth favorite marathon og by the cure company but we're moving up to even better flower and it's looking like connected's doing pretty good here today we got another one by connected covenant number five guava times biscotti and this one was a sleeper to me i really like this flower i marked it higher than the gushers and the biscotti i thought this flower was fantastic i got at the museum's dispensary and museums how's it connected that's why i run down there this flower's got 24 percent thc and it's a hybrid and this flower is euphoric and fantastic let me turn around so you can see the name this flower is absolutely fantastic if you haven't tried the guava times uh biscotti it's definitely worth the try and it was my fifth favorite flower of all the flowers 1500 of them here in los angeles but we're moving up to even better flower top four number four we've got a bag product and all these people that are in the top that are bagged shame on you you should know better your product is so good why can't you give us a jar right coming at number four something from mad cow i ran all over the city there's three dispensaries to get it and you can see this is an unopened bag because i got an ounce of double up mints this flower has 38 i think 0.85 thc oh my goodness and i'm usually scared of such high thc flowers but i learned not really this flower the first time i tried it i felt the young stone again and you can't do that all flowers if you get a really good one it can't consistently do that but it was able to really stone me to the bone and i'm like oh winner winter chicken dinner double up mints made it all the way to number four i got the the artistry uh down in uh west hollywood they're really nice to me uh this flower is an indica and if you haven't tried the double up mince by mad cow grab this one it's in the market right now this is the one to try this one get it you know get it it's a good one and coming in at number four double up mints by mad cow but we're moving up to even better flower coming in number three is the highest of all the cookie strains and i think this flower's got some controversy going on people don't understand cookie says indoor versions and outdoor versions and cookies also has figured out that it has to be a certain level of thc otherwise they've got to dish this flower out to someone else who can grow it better because we saw this flower on cookies called gary payton the glove comes in at number three but we saw this flower go all the way down i think to 16 thc and then people say or 18 people didn't like it right but this one that i've got in my hand is 23 the original drop from july 19 i was able to get like three ace of this i still have one unopened eighth and this flower stoned me to the bone in the right way that i'm like oh my god they did gary payton so right with this flower and then i ran with the bulls and i went down to cookies down in melrose and got the 32 version of this and i could see that the the buds looked similar the feeling was actually the same but the more you went on the 32 it became not as euphoric and more heavy and more heavy or this one the 23 you could keep going on going on it was really fork and if i picked them i did a comparison i picked the 23 but it's all good you could just do less of the other one and have the same feeling coming at number three of the top 100 strains in los angeles gary payton cookies i love this flower but you got to buy right don't buy the outdoor you got to get a thc 23 or above and you'll win with this flag that's what i think but we're moving up to number one and at number one we're gonna stick this flower down into uh vapor cup straw and coming at number one oh no excuse me number two we're only on number two i made a mistake but so good stony mouth is never good right coming in at number two we have such a good strain and i got this is the dr green thumbs and it's funny as you really fish around all these dispensaries and you get something and you look at the packaging and you hope that the product inside is just as good so this is called the gushers just plushers and originally i bought this as the plushers and it was

blood which often impacts joints especially the feet if you have gout you'll feel intense pain that's often condensed in the big toe which is the biggest indicator of the disease you have an especially increased chance of getting gout if you are middle aged postmenopausal drink alcohol use diuretics or have conditions like high blood pressure kidney or thyroid disease diabetes or sleep apnea certain blood kidney and thyroid disorders often make it difficult for the body to remove excess uric acid but gout can also be the result of a diet that's high in purines high purine foods include organ meats red meats oily fish like sardines and anchovies beans mushrooms and certain vegetables like asparagus and cauliflower what sets gout apart from standard arthritis is the level of pain that's involved gout attacks are described as acute sudden intense joint pain that inhibits livelihood and is often the headlining symptom standard treatment for gout often includes anti-inflammatory and corticosteroid medication but did you know cannabis can help the body's endocannabinoid system plays a huge part in tackling joint pain cannabinoids and terpenes play a big part in alleviating the inflammation and intense pain that plagues gout sufferers and research has also shown that cbd is a promising option to incorporate for pain and inflammation treatment gout is one of the more painful types of arthritis which is why having access to effective and low-risk treatment options such as cannabis is so important if you're interested in having legal access to cannabis or just want to know if it's right for you contact us at berryhill and we'll help you every step of the way thanks for watching", "z7rJd1mXAWY": "it says a light spectrometer in it and what it does is it sends a bunch of light waves up and down through the cannabis and it tests the frequency that it bounces back through the thc uh and then compares that against known samples registered by the state uh both in washington uh oregon and california so it's accurate within one percent up or down um but it's circumnavigated so you don't you don't get to circumnavigate the state test but it does give you a really accurate uh understanding of what your thc level is as well as your cbd um plus or minus and the nice thing is you really only need like 0.2 at most uh to test with so you're not you know throwing a couple of grams so at the end it doesn't it doesn't get you like away from your state test but what it does do uh it gives you a really great opportunity to phenom hunt well before you send it off to a laboratory so if you're you know growing for yourself you it's pain in the ass to send it to a lab on its own uh if you are you know a cannabis company then every time you're phenomenal you're sending what 10 tests at 100 250 bucks a piece yeah you're saving yourself a little yeah you're selling yourself a little bit of money at the end of the day you know i've i've had this for now what a year and a half i use it like three or four times a week um and i've had zero issues as far as using it besides like your general connectivity like if you're in a hotel room and sometimes your wi-fi sucks so wait a second it's just the bot what what does this connect to where it works so this is this is plugged in this is just charging also micro usb charger i just plugged in the wall because it's dead because i smoke weed and sometimes i forget to charge my [ __ ] if i'm just being honest if we're being honest about it so you just grind yeah you grind up like 0.2 uh you go to your phone you download a uh application the purple pro application uh i'm gonna measure measure now i'm gonna wait a little while no that's crazy this this used to be done with like computers and yeah this this used to be done in like a lab situation so uh your miracle whip tested at 19 thc and greater than two percent or greater than two percent cbd is that good that's great i mean 19 my opinion is phenomenal uh i don't see any reason why people are buying into the misnomer that like your cannabis needs to be 22 23 27 like at the end of the day the terpene profile on cannabis like this and not understanding the endocannabinoid system to any real major uh level i mean no one can really say that they do who's to say that thc is the only uh vehicle to getting you the medicinal benefits from cannabis let alone the recreational so well that ignore terpenes would be to ignore the vast majority of the plant there's thc thca uh you know and then cbds a few cbn cbgs but it's mostly terpenes and plants so but is the two percent cbd is that considered good discussions are great especially if you have uh if you're looking at a focus of thc and not cbd um if you're growing a hemp plant you're gonna see you know larger five percent to nine percent even twelve percent uh cbd uh or greater than but that's for a implant you're you know when you're looking at thc uh and the response to the endocannabinoid system and what we understand about it is literally cbd counteracts thc so if you're looking for thc you're probably looking to have a lower cbd content unless you're pushing for the you know holistic side of it but recreational weed less cbd more thc okay according to you know the current myth of what is you know cannabis awesome so that's that's the uh the miracle with your favorite yeah no that's fire i absolutely love this miracle whip this this is really impressive no i'm gonna actually delve into this miracle whip later on this year i'll definitely get you a cut um that'd be huge that would be good this this is the wedding cake the wedding cake yeah certainly clean this off so at least we get like a clean test that's not all right so after you're done with with the yeah when you're done you can discard it it's still usable cannabis all you did was run it through a grinder so just kind of clean it out and i used a microfiber towel just because like in the day you know with to try to be as scientific as you can in a hotel room so i said again you you really need very little damage to this you know dance it's probably well more than i actually need but we'll see she doesn't want to go down my grinder it's not the first day that i ground that weed so we'll get this worked out yeah this is actually one of my one of my personal favorites it should be enough if not we'll grind up a little bit more yeah actually when i broke that down fingers are super sticky it smells better than it did just straight out of the drawer to me it smells like like like a lemon so yeah 23 thc yeah it's it's definitely got that like limonene uh back end to it no i really like that and like i said that's 23 thc so and still two percent are the two percent greater than yeah and it we could go big we could go uh you know a little more in depth on that i've got to update uh the tester but yeah 23 cbd for you know you what you're doing that's phenomenal again it's very little bit very little cannabis that you actually have to test so what is up next that is fire this whole hotel room this is not a purple punch yeah yeah let's test that this this purple punch man like honestly i and again i was when you when you said like you had a joint of it and you're like here man and i was really trepidatious about it but just just because i i just don't have a great experience with purple punch in in the past but this uh itself like the bud structure is [ __ ] phenomenal it doesn't have those weird ass spindly leaves uh it's it's fire like i when i first when i first tasted i didn't actually even see the the buds i just saw the uh the joint and i was like man this this tastes really good for purple punch yoga told me it was like i don't know banana hammock and i've been like yeah this tastes great dude but then you said it was purple punch and i was like [ __ ] i don't like purple punch traditionally but you know i do like to concentrate i did say that once it comes to the concentrate it is really good but as far as the flour is concerned i i've never been super impressed but this this does have this does have uh this has like bag of peel nose appeal i'd buy this without having to smell it you could look at it until it was just [ __ ] fire you go oh man that's fine yeah no i have heard a lot of things about the the purple punch and it being a strain that got passed around a lot but then again not everybody also had the right cut of purple punch so that that could be that that very well could be it yeah you know that i was i i found purple punch i think the first time that i saw it was that vhhc in vallejo california not that that's a shout out to him i'm just being you know very honest about it and then i saw it a few times at cloud sesh i picked some of it up um uh a girl that i date her dad really really likes it um but i just wasn't super impressed by it um except for in the concentrate except for the concentrate um and so at the end of the day this this has probably been one of like the more fire cuts i've seen looks like a [ __ ] mess over here this is a this is like a real demo at a real like place i would be ashamed of myself so let's run this no i said and i you know i really appreciate the opportunity to run this thing oh no i think that this is fire and you know if you got 20 19 let's do a new measurement so we've done two in a row and had really great results so you hold your breath on the third holy crap there's a dead that hurts pin dropping here man so 17 and so like i said man 17 every everyone's always telling me like i really want this like 27 percent thc definitely no the taste is is definitely worth it yeah absolutely it's not gonna taste like hash it's not gonna just taste like some some [ __ ] like this tastes like somebody actually cared about what they were doing they're like i'm very interested in this plant let's see what i can do with it and got the most out of it some you know i guess maybe it's when you produce it for for production for out value as opposed to like you know really a connoisseur uh style of growing then then maybe you stray away from it this is really good i'm i'm also really blown away by this both of these both of these the miracles like the miracle whip the miracle whip is crazy this is we have uh we have another test here we have this the lotto this this will probably be like the lesser thc out of uh out of the whole bunch i believe okay okay yeah i thought i always thought the wedding king did have a higher potency just because when i smoke it it has that that hit yeah but that's i'm that's where like you like i said we've we've been lied to and i'm not going to call anybody out by name i'm not going to be like hey guys this is your fault but there's some like these big name hitters there's these big these big grow for these big grow houses that grow exotic cannabis that are like hey man uh my shit's 28 plus percent thc and i'm just like yeah i that's phenomenal great you've really exploited the fact that you can produce thc but what's it taste like yeah how high does it really get you like am i am i again going to be high for 30 minutes where i'm going to be running back to you know hit this again it's it's so so the the argument is is there again like i said i and again don't don't take me for a fact i'm i'm speaking specifically in hyperbole i'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] i i don't know what the hell i'm talking about i'm a [ __ ] all the time but that's that's why i firmly believe from a guy that like i was buying weed back when like you know it was still a felony in california and then turn around and selling it like we had to trust our nose there wasn't you know you kind of go and use a thc tester uh let's pull from the bottom let's let's give this the worst chance possible just because i feel like [ __ ] even that i don't know yeah it still smells like some fire just a lot of smells like some absolute fire you don't need much to test we'll pull this from the bottom this is probably this is probably the worst opportunity to give it i feel bad now i'm like damn damn damn glass i didn't mean to do you like this but i got you it'll be fine i preface this again with like thc uh production like i said if you're if you're up above 16 percent you're dealing with uh some doty measurement yeah no i'm definitely happy with the results especially that that wedding cake i would have never expected it to be that good i mean no but that's like i said that that plays into this misnomer that like everyone's talking about we have to have to see seventeen people wow so i went to what was it in december before covid before the world shut the [ __ ] down we were down in vegas and uh we we ran this tester and i had some stuff that came in 16 and then sitting right next to it had some stuff that was 28 both of them look fantastic you couldn't really tell the difference between one or the other uh we rolled both of them up and i didn't tell anybody what it was and i was like which one did which one do you did you like more and it wasn't like i went here smoked this one here so this one night one i was like here smoke this it was the first smoke after the convention they're like yeah that was good i gave him the other one i'm like yeah that was good and then i asked him which one was better they're like well night one i was like well that was 16 yeah it was 28 the night the first night you could you could lend it to being in vegas or you could lend it to whatever but like i do this [ __ ] regular my guys what's your weed like i have a [ __ ] i have a weed tester man yeah legitimately i can put anywhere in my car so i like to run around i'm like is your [ __ ] good or is your [ __ ] not good and more often than not the more interesting more compelling uh cannabis i find 16 to 22 you get over 22 percent and it's just like yeah you're getting high but you i feel like you start to lure us on terpenes i feel like you lose out on that flavor i feel like this it it's it's it's a real fast up and then it's a real quick down and it has you looking to smoke more weed where like something between 16 22 that that's the world to live in that's real connoisseur weed the", "1RJjCc9rKsg": "THIS WEEK SOUTH CAROLINA LAWMAKERS PREFILED MORE THAN 800 BILLS

metered dose inhaler with 400 milligrams of thc in it now i've been seeing the inhalers for a little while since i've moved here but i haven't tried them yet i think only one store has them and i finally picked one up and this is the higher thc one it has about 415 milligrams of thc and a little over three and a half milligrams of cbd i think they also had a one to one or it was like 200 and 200 but i went ahead and got the higher thc one because i wanted to see if it could get me high and i think a lot of people were confused on how many pups but it says right on here delivers approximately two milligrams of active product per activation and if it's 400 milligrams that's about 200 activations so pretty interesting this thing has close to a half a gram of thc in it and the other ingredients are that you would find in an inhaler it's got tetrafluorethane ethanol sorbet pan the triolet cannabis derived terpenes and polysorbate 80. i know all those words but i looked them up and that's just what they put in regular inhalers so pretty interesting note you will not see any exhaled vapor no clouds guys this is this is discreet though could you imagine you're [ __ ] anywhere and you're just like well i'm just going to in my inhaler [ __ ] nobody's going to be like there might be weed in there [ __ ] nobody even me and i've seen these things i have one in my head i will never think maybe unless i see the [ __ ] dispensary logo or something i'm not gonna think anyway let's hit it back clouds oh i think that was 10 seconds it's kind of weird it's just you hit an inhaler you know it says that's cannabis derived terpenes in here but i don't i don't know if i'm tasting them two milligrams and i have to hold my breath for 10 seconds i don't know how it works but we're gonna see if we can do a bunch of hits on this and get high i'm just gonna get right to it but first if you haven't already check out my other socials your boy posts a lot of content a lot of places we do a live sessions on twitch every night i post pictures all my hauls on instagram and stuff just check them out i'll figure it out alright let's get high i'm gonna get high from holding my breath but let's keep trying i feel like i can do like a few puffs on one inhale without really [ __ ] up i don't think i can just just keep pushing in my mouth is that gonna work it's surprisingly uh kinda harsh it's not terrible and i i would say the first couple of hits out of this maybe the first ten or so or harsher than this i wonder if it has something to do with how well it's shaking up or whatever i'm getting high but is it from holding my breath [Music] okay oh oh my mic is way up there i'm moving my mic down uh that's gonna be fun editing the audio i don't i really don't we're just gonna keep hitting it it's not like i'm not i'm not super harsh after a hit i could just keep going i feel like because it's not actually it's got like a little bit of a harshest it's not that bad the second ingredient is ethanol i wonder if that's why [Music] i'm gonna breathe next to it away from it breathe out away from it so this thing is 400 milligrams for the whole thing i had somebody ask me is it 400 milligrams per hit and i mean that's like a genuine question but could you imagine if you push this [ __ ] and it squirts out a half a gram of thc into your lungs could you just imagine if it really was 400 milligrams of phd per kit that's close to a half a gram could you imagine how thick let's keep it going inside of me hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] now holding for about 10 seconds is is like the whole part of it all right let's keep going [Music] uh i don't quite know how many milligrams we're at now but i'm feeling uh i i think i'm feeling kind of high but i've just been holding my breath for like 10 seconds every 20 30 seconds i think it's that but let's keep going and then i'll chill for a second and then we're gonna we'll get an assessment if i'm high but let's keep going because we're not quite there yet all right this is gonna be the super one i think i'm normally doing three we're gonna see if we can get five on this one even though i don't know if that's the best way to do it foreign oh okay i actually saw a little bit of vapor there that was a big one i'm gonna i'm gonna see if i could do that again it just like i need to click it faster and keep a nice steady inhale i think that's the trick but i feel like i feel like i just took a long rip after that one like not not the the same level of harshness but i feel like i just got a lot of thc wretch i think we're getting there i think the highness is working okay yeah let's let's keep it going making my eyes water all right we gotta wrap this up soon holy [ __ ] all right so i've been chilling for a little bit just so i could uh get an idea yeah this gets me high is it my preferred method of smoking no i would think based off the dosage and how and how it really delivers i would just need to sit there and hit it a hundred times for me to get there but this is definitely great for somebody with a low tolerance somebody that doesn't like smoking maybe can't smoke this might be a much easier option for you it probably feels the same as a regular inhaler if you've ever used one i think it was only like 50 bucks for 400 milligrams which is about what you'd pay for a cartridge with the same amount of thc in it so not a terrible price it's just interesting to see the technology what you could possibly do having this metered dose inhaler somebody's trying to take exactly six milligrams one two three puffs and this is about two each easy way to do it i'm probably not going to be buying a lot of these in the future but it is something that's kind of cool to have and uh very discreet if i really do need to get some thc in and i'm somewhere where it might not be appropriate to do it this might be the way so pretty cool thing overall but makes me excited to see what else we can come up

For decades, this view persisted and set back research \non the drug's mechanisms and effects. Today, marijuana\u2019s therapeutic benefits \nare widely acknowledged, and some nations \nhave legalized medical use or are moving in that direction. But a growing recognition \nfor marijuana\u2019s medical value doesn\u2019t answer the question: is recreational marijuana use \nbad for your brain? Marijuana acts \non the body\u2019s cannabinoid system, which has receptors \nall over the brain and body. Molecules native to the body, \ncalled endocannabinoids, also act on these receptors. We don\u2019t totally understand \nthe cannabinoid system, but it has one feature \nthat provides a big clue to its function. Most neurotransmitters \ntravel from one neuron to the next through a synapse to propagate a message. But endocannabinoids \ntravel in the opposite direction. When a message passes \nfrom the one neuron to the next, the receiving neuron \nreleases endocannabinoids. Those endocannabinoids \ntravel backward to influence the sending neuron\u2014 essentially giving it feedback \nfrom the receiving neuron. This leads scientists \nto believe that the endocannabinoid system serves primarily \nto modulate other kinds of signals\u2014 amplifying some and diminishing others. Feedback from endocannabinoids \nslows down rates of neural signaling. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it slows down behavior \nor perception, though. For example, \nslowing down a signal that inhibits smell could actually make smells more intense. Marijuana contains \ntwo main active compounds, tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, \nand cannabidiol, or CBD. THC is thought to be primarily responsible\nfor marijuana\u2019s psychoactive effects on behavior, cognition, and perception, while CBD is responsible \nfor the non-psychoactive effects. Like endocannabinoids, THC slows down signaling \nby binding to cannabinoid receptors. But it binds to receptors \nall over this sprawling, diffuse system at once, whereas endocannabinoids \nare released in a specific place in response to a specific stimulus. This widespread activity \ncoupled with the fact that the cannabinoid system\nindirectly affects many other systems, means that each person\u2019s \nparticular brain chemistry, genetics, and previous life experience largely determine \nhow they experience the drug. That\u2019s true much more so with marijuana \nthan with other drugs that produce their effects \nthrough one or a few specific pathways. So the harmful effects, if any, \nvary considerably from person to person. And while we don\u2019t know \nhow exactly how marijuana produces specific harmful effects, there are clear risk factors \nthat can increase peoples\u2019 likelihood of experiencing them. The clearest risk factor is age. In people younger than 25, cannabinoid receptors \nare more concentrated in the white matter than in people over 25. The white matter \nis involved in communication, learning, memory, and emotions. Frequent marijuana use can disrupt the development \nof white matter tracts, and also affect the brain\u2019s ability \nto grow new connections. This may damage long-term learning ability\nand problem solving. For now, it\u2019s unclear \nhow severe this damage can be or whether it\u2019s reversible. And even among young people, the risk is higher the younger someone is\u2014 much higher for a 15 year old \nthan a 22 year old, for instance. Marijuana can also cause hallucinations \nor paranoid delusions. Known as marijuana-induced psychosis, these symptoms usually subside \nwhen a person stops using marijuana. But in rare cases, \npsychosis doesn\u2019t subside, instead unmasking \na persistent psychotic disorder. A family history of psychotic disorders, \nlike schizophrenia, is the clearest, though not the only, \nrisk factor for this effect. Marijuana-induced psychosis \nis also more common among young adults, though it\u2019s worth noting \nthat psychotic disorders usually surface in this age range anyway. What\u2019s unclear in these cases \nis whether the psychotic disorder would have appeared \nwithout marijuana use\u2014 whether marijuana use triggers it early, is a catalyst for a tipping point \nthat wouldn\u2019t have been crossed otherwise, or whether the reaction \nto marijuana is merely an indication of an underlying disorder. In all likelihood, marijuana\u2019s role \nvaries from person to person. At any age, as with many other drugs, the brain and body become less sensitive \nto marijuana after repeated uses, meaning it takes more \nto achieve the same effects. Fortunately, unlike many other drugs, there\u2019s no risk of fatal overdose \nfrom marijuana, and even heavy use \ndoesn\u2019t lead to debilitating or life-threatening \nwithdrawal symptoms if use stops. There are more subtle forms \nof marijuana withdrawal, though, including sleep disturbances, \nirritability, and depressed mood, which pass \nwithin a few weeks of stopping use. So is marijuana bad for your brain? It depends who you are. But while some risk factors \nare easy to identify, others aren\u2019t well understood\u2014 which means there\u2019s still some possibility\nof experiencing negative effects, even if you don\u2019t have \nany of the known risk factors.", "YyXDwc9OQ2M": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 where we give you the most in-depth reviews as efficiently as possible and today we're gonna be checking out this crumble or this bubba kush crumble by Regulator extract and with that we're gonna go ahead and hop right into the numbers so THC a comes in at or actually THC comes in at 60 to 0.5 they don't have a whole lot of other stuff but as you guys know I don't buy my candles based off of THC the reason I really picked this up was because it looked really good and it was a steal so I can't hi guys know I don't really mention prices so I'm not really gonna go into it but just know that this was really affordable this was definitely something that I would consider budget-friendly and I'm trying to open this right now and it's not working give me two seconds there we go alright so sorry guys I've been fighting kind of cold so if I sound a little funny I apologize all right so here we go sorry it really is that far off camera I was so as you can see this looks really really good zoom in for you guys so you can check that out let me educate this and play with it a little bit so the color that comes off on camera is about two shades lighter than the color that's in the actual like in person I would say it's a little bit darker than what you guys see here but it still looks really really good ooh as far as the scent is concerned it just has that really clean floral you know good concentrate taste but with that I'm really excited to try this and I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this hey guys what's up I went ahead and tried that bubba kush and as far as the flavor is concerned it doesn't have a whole lot outside of like a regular clean concentrate floral flavor then the hai itself is more of a relaxed stone enos that kind of hits the body but that leaves your brain kind of clear-headed this one was a good one I would say it was a little bit longer than I expected it to be especially for the price and then the way that we ended up smoking it for the majority of the week and I think we still have a little bit of it is we end up topping other stuff that isn't quite as strong or just like you know you dip it in you know you take your other concentrate dip it into some of this and the combination of this with other stuff has been really really really good I honestly think we might end up picking this up again just for the simple fact that if you do end up getting something else that's not quite cutting it you can just dip it into this and boom it's good to go so all around a really good concentrate if you're a newbie I would say you could probably just go ahead and try a normal-sized dab with this because it's not gonna throw you so far out of your element that you're gonna feel uncomfortable and it is gonna give you that concentrate kind of feel if you're a newbie also remember that the THC percentage isn't relevant to you any concentrate is gonna get you higher than any sort of flower that you've ever had before just because it is a concentrate so just keep that in mind when you're out there purchasing your stuff with all that if you guys enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "ciQ4ErmhO7g": "Translator: Queenie Lee\nReviewer: Rhonda Jacobs Alright. I am so stoked\nto be up here with you guys tonight to talk about weed, bro! (Laughter) I'm just kidding with you guys. We are going to chitchat just a little bit\nabout medical cannabis, though, tonight. (Laughter) Back in 2010, I had the honor\nto help co-author a House bill here in Colorado that I had hoped would\nhelp very seriously ill patients get access to medicinal cannabis, while allowing for responsible\nrules and regulations around what I think most would consider\na very misunderstood industry. However, what happened, in my opinion, were some of the most loathsome\nexamples of the misuse of cannabis law and cannabis usage\nthat I could have imagined. Now you guys, come on,\nyou all remember this, right? This is back when that horrible,\nhorrible epidemic of back pain just swept across college campuses. (Laughter) It was terrible. (Laughter) People like my friend Ben here,\nfor example, right? Yeah, he never tires of thanking me\nfor all the work that I did so now he could enjoy the freedom\nof his recreational pleasure. That's not really what I do,\nso that got under my skin for some time because I really felt like\nall of the work that we did had quite literally just (Inhales, blows out) gone up in smoke. But, you know what, my disdain for this type of abuse\ndidn't last that long, because I realized\nthat if it weren't for old Ben here and the back pain epidemic, none of us here tonight\nwould have ever had the opportunity to meet a very special friend of mine, Charlotte Figi. (Applause)\nYeah, you can clap. (Cheering) Charlotte, besides being dear\nto my heart, is a six-year-old, and like most little six-year-olds - Yup, there's Chase.\nThere's her twin sister. And like most six-year-olds,\nCharlotte, she just loves the color pink, loves to go play in the woods\nwith her twin sister, Chase, and her older brother, Max. I hear you, baby. (Laughter) Charlotte's an explorer, and for good reason, that we're going\nto get into here a little bit later. She also happens to be one of the most\nfrequent cannabis users that I know. There it is; there's the word: cannabis. Incites all kinds of different people,\ndifferent things to different people. To some people,\nit's the devil's weed, right? Others, it's just a pseudo\nmedical excuse to get high, and yet, others find\ntrue medicinal benefit with it. But, at the end of the day,\nwhat are we talking about here? We're just talking about a plant. OK? This is a plant that grows anywhere\nfrom three to eight feet tall, typically. About every seven to ten weeks, it'll produce a flower\nor a bud, as you know it, but that's it, just a plant. It even grows on six continents. But it's a plant that\nCharlotte Figi uses a lot of to control her grand mal seizures. And in no uncertain terms,\nCharlotte's life depends on this plant. You see, Charlotte was diagnosed\nwhen she was three months old with a very, very rare\nand violent form of epilepsy, known as Dravet syndrome. And Charlotte will experience a very high\nnumber of what we call tonic-clonic, or grand mal seizures - about one every 20 to 25 minutes, guys. And these seizures, these seizures will last anywhere \nfrom 15 to 25 minutes. So in essence, Charlotte's life is spent\nin a seizure and catatonic state. Twice, Charlotte's mother, Paige, has had\nto bring her back to life using CPR. At any given time, Charlotte will be on seven daily different\npharmaceutical seizure medications, none of which control her seizures. When Charlotte was five years old,\nher seizures had reached their worst. And her medical team\ntold the Figi family things like \"Start making\npreparations for her death.\" She was probably not going\nto wake up from this. The Figis reluctantly signed\na do-not-resuscitate order for Charlotte around this time. She was sent home with a fitted chair,\na feeding tube in her belly as she'd lost all of her life skills, and the family had to say their goodbyes. Now - Didn't look good for Charlotte.\nDidn't seem like she'd pull through. But remember, thanks to my old friend Ben\nand that back pain epidemic, it wasn't the end for Charlotte, and the Figis weren't about\nto give up hope. And they set out on a journey\nto find, of all people ... (Ha) my family. Well, I come from a very, very large family. OK? I'm the oldest of 11 kids. Nope, we're not Mormon;\nwe're not Catholic. (Laughter) Apparently, they were just\nincredibly fertile. (Laughter) And me and my five younger brothers,\namazing brothers, Joel, Jesse, Jonathan, Jordan, and Jared, and our honorary brother,\nDr. Sanjay Gupta, we set out on a mission, a very unique mission, to breed\na special strain of cannabis plant, one of these was essentially\nfree of the psychoactive compound that you all know\nis tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, right? And one that was very, very high in the little-known\nnon-psychoactive compound called CBD, or cannabidiol. Well, we succeeded in\nthis effort in January of 2012, and this is right around the time that the Figis were signing \ntheir do-not-resuscitate order. And as luck would have it, Paige Figi found us in February of 2012. Now, my brothers and I\nhad been reading a lot of studies, a lot of research, that had been coming out of Israel \nfrom the 80s, 90s, and up to today on this research, although,\nstrangely enough, seems like America knew\nabout this 65 years ago, but that's a talk for another day. My brothers and I thought that this little-known compound\nmight just be the missing link to provide some validity\nin the realm of cannabis research. And as it turns out we were correct. Now, the plant that we had created, while it may have\nimmense medical benefits, completely non-psychoactive, OK? Completely useless to Ben. So we named the plant\nThe Hippie's Disappointment. (Laughter) And while it didn't prove useful to Ben, it proved incredibly useful\nto little Charlotte. And so when Paige called us that February,\ntold us of Charlotte's condition, we were ready to jump in;\nwe were ready to help. In fact, we couldn't wait ...\nuntil Paige dropped the bomb on us: Charlotte was five years old. And think about it for a minute. We're going to give\na five-year-old cannabis? Literally, visions of this\nwere popping in my head. (Laughter) Mm. But we got over this, pretty quickly, and we began to extract\nand formulate, and ratio, a non-psychoactive, lab tested\npediatric tincture for Charlotte. And I'm happy to tell you\nthat within the first administration, Charlotte went from having a seizure\nevery 20 to 25 minutes - that's 400 a week, guys - down to 0-1 per week. (Cheering) (Applause) Thank you. And, Charlotte was off\n100% of her pharmaceuticals. No more pharmaceuticals. (Cheering) (Applause) Thank you. Charlotte is now awake; she's alive. And guys, a real special treat\nfor you tonight. (Video) Charlotte: Ballerina!\nMother: Ballerina. Child: Ballerina. Mother: Dance. (Tap shoes tapping) (Video ends) (Cheering) (Applause) Isn't she amazing? So we changed the name of the plant\nfrom The Hippie's Disappointment and now the name is affectionately\ncalled Charlotte's Web, in honor of Charlotte,\nand it always will be Charlotte's Web. Now, Charlotte's not\nan isolated incident here. We currently treat over 40\npediatric patients here in Colorado with the same, similar, and believe it or not, even better results\nthan what Charlotte experiences. And currently, there are over 200 families\ncoming from all over the world to Colorado to take part in our treatment program. We're soon to move into California as well where we literally\nhave over a thousand children with pediatric epilepsy \nand their families waiting for us, and we'll be moving to other states\nas soon as laws will allow us. And we have a very special young man\nhere in the audience tonight. Where are you at, buddy? Zaki Jackson? There's my man. (Cheers) Buddy! (Applause) (Cheering) There's Zaki. (Applause) What's up, Bubba? Right here! Eh, man! Give me five. Zaki Jackson is number two patient\nright after Charlotte, a great friend of ours. Zaki, unfortunately, he suffers from\na syndrome known as Doose syndrome. And before this treatment, Zaki\nwas experiencing over 200 seizures a day. OK? I'm happy to tell you guys now,\non October 4th, in two weeks, we're all going to get together to celebrate Zaki's one year\nseizure-free anniversary. (Applause) (Cheering) And you know, it's very, very difficult\nfor me as an outsider to relay what this means to families, and I wanted Zaki's mother,\nHeather Jackson, to tell you guys what this has meant to her. (Video) Heather Jackson:\nAnd I get to say, after almost a decade, I get to meet him for the first time,\nwithout all this seizure activity. He had drugs. If you can imagine\nwaiting ten years to meet your kid! (Video ends) So, you can see, this has\na positive impact on a lot of families. So, in light of that, my brothers and I\nstarted a nonprofit organization called the Realm of Caring, and the Realm helps\nto provide support, resources, education, physician-backed\nmedical studies, as well as safe and affordable access\nto our treatment program. Currently, the Realm is in the middle\nof setting up study protocols with some of the country's\ntop epileptologists in order to start getting down\nto the bottom of the science even further, as to why this plant\nis working so well for these children. So, why is this plant working so well? Well, cannabidiol\nhas the highest anti-inflammatory and neuroprotectant properties\nfound in nature, and CBD actually interacts with structures\non the surface of brain cells known as receptors, and acting as that neuroprotectant\nand anti-inflammatory helps to decrease, and as you've seen,\neven eliminate seizure activity. Now, while we don't know, it seems as though CBD is actually playing\na role in the repair of brain function. And research scientists and our doctors\nbelieve that this is why Charlotte, Zaki, and other children\nin this program are actually experiencing\nan ongoing progression of motor, social and developmental skills, meaning that they're actually\ncoming back to cognition more and more and more every day. They're getting better, guys,\nI mean, it's phenomenal. I think it's also important to note here\nthat epilepsy is not the only thing that CBD seems to be helpful for. According to some of our early studies\nand studies out of Israel right now, they're showing\nincredible results in PTSD, in migraines, depression, arthritis,\ncancer, and heart disease, and even further studies,\nbelieve it or not, are showing this little-known compound\nmight have the capabilities of helping to stop progression\nof Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS, MS, and diabetes. Now, I think it's quite clear, we all know very, very,\nvery little about this plant. We've lived in the last 80 years\nin this country under a cloud of propaganda and fear. We're just now, though,\nstarting to wake up from that fear. We're starting to replace\nthat fear with acceptance, understanding, and education. What's happening? Amazing things, right? Amazing discoveries. And that's what happens\nwhenever you're able to lay fear to rest. But, we have a long way to go here. I want you all to think about\nsomething with me real quick. Charlotte is awake now, OK? After experiencing a five-year\ndarkness- and fear-type nightmare. I don't know how you'd feel, but me, I'd feel like\ndoing some exploring, I'd feel like seeing the world,\ngetting out there. Well, imagine Charlotte feels\nvery much the same. Yet picture this: She can't even\nleave the state of Colorado. If she does, she faces a life-and-death\nsituation without her medication. Not to mention the fact\nthat the minute the Figis family, when they leave the state of Colorado\non a family vacation with her medicine, they become drug traffickers. (Laughter) Yeah, they look like a pack of hardened\ncriminals to me, don't they to you? (Laughter) You know, we can joke about this,\nand we can bring light to this, because, honestly, the situation is ludicrous people! It's ludicrous! Charlotte can't leave the state. How many other children can't get\ninto the state to get this treatment? It's not that easy\nto pack your whole life up and move from wherever\nyou are in the country, or the world for that matter, and just relocate to Colorado. And furthermore, they shouldn't have to! Colorado children\nare not different, physiologically, than a child who lives\nin a Midwestern state. It hurts me to tell you this next part, but this is a reality we face\nall the time here. Just last week, a very special young boy\nin Indiana with Dravet syndrome passed away because his family couldn't get out here\nto get the treatment in time. And we couldn't send it to him\nbecause the law doesn't allow it. If the law allowed it,\nit's a next-day air package. It's that easy. Folks, children are dying. Come on! We can do better than this. As humans, we must do better than this. And I'm confident that we will\ndo better than this. Now, just how many more Charlottes? How many more Zakis? How many more children are out there that this plant could\npotentially provide relief for? This begs us to ask the question: Are we willing to change our national view\non medicinal cannabis and trade to save a thousand more lives? How about just one more life? Well, guys, I have a very\nspecial friend here tonight who strongly believes this to be the case. And if you all don't mind,\nI would love to introduce you to one of the most courageous little girls\nI've ever met in my life. Please welcome and meet Charlotte Figi\nand her parents, Matt and Paige. (Applause) (Cheering) Can you say hi to everybody? (Applause) Host: I think she's fascinated with you,\nand we're fascinated with her. (Laughter) Oh, we've got more. (Laughter) Thank you so much, Josh. That concludes our talk, but I wanted\nto ask a little bit more from the parents, I mean - How many other parents have you met, and is there a network of people\nthat are in contact the Stanley brothers, and how's that going? Paige Figi: There is a large network, Amanda and Heather\nare running the Realm of Caring. And there's a huge\namount of people coming here, having to move and uproot\nand coming here. I can't even give you a number;\nwe take 4,000 calls a month. (Audience responses) Host: I think there are some parents\nin the crowd tonight. If you're a parent, can you say hello? There's a couple. I mean parent, yes - I mean parents of - Is there anything that surprised you\nabout the treatment, I mean, a) probably that it worked, but is there anything else\nthat wasn't covered in the talk? PF: it was the first treatment\nthat we tried, and we tried everything - even diet that seemed seemingly harmless - it was the first treatment\nwe tried that worked this well, and that had beneficial side effects. There's not a one negative side effect,\nand it's just been beneficial. That is unheard of with epilepsy. Host: it's just an amazing story. We have a break. We were hanging out\nwith Charlotte backstage. It's just amazing to watch somebody grow, and there's a lot more\nparents in the audience that have been in contact\nwith the Stanley brothers. Thank you for being here.\nThank you, Josh, amazing talk. I really want to see that online. PF: Thanks for having us. JS: Thank you all.

((AARON)) THE RUSH TO BUY", "uHYJQ1KXFAw": "\"Does Marijuana Cause\nStrokes and Heart Attacks?\" Does the so-called dark side\nof cannabis include stroke, here said to be associated\nwith non-synthetic marijuana, by which I assume they\nmean, uh, marijuana. There have been case reports of artery\ndamage due to the vasoconstrictor effect of cannabis, something\nthat's been well documented. One study found cannabis users had\n100 times greater odds of suffering from something called\nmultifocal intracranial stenosis, where the arteries inside your brain\nclamp down at multiple points, but that's a rare condition.\nWhat about strokes? The lack of high-level evidence regarding\nthe adverse effects of marijuana usage on brain artery health has led to this notion\nthat recreational marijuana may not be a problem, so they decided\nto put it to the test. \"You want high level evidence?\" they said. Well, how about a study of literally\nmillions of pot smokers? OK, then. And they found that recreational\nmarijuana use did seem to be associated with an increased risk\nof being hospitalized with an acute ischemic stroke, but this may just be among those who\nsmoke regularly, at least once a week. The reason we think it's cause-and-effect\nis that the majority of recorded strokes were during or shortly\nafter marijuana exposure. And there are even cases in which strokes\nrecurred after marijuana re-exposure. So put all that together and it makes\na convincing case, though you'd really have to like randomize people to\nsmoke pot or placebo pot to be sure. It s like the heart disease story. A similar temporal relationship has\nbeen found between marijuana use and the development of heart attacks\nand sudden cardiac death, meaning the heart attacks seemed to happen while\nthey were using or right afterwards. However, this is complicated by the\nfact that cannabis is often used in combination with other drugs,\nsuch as alcohol or cocaine. So you can't just ask heart attack\nvictims if they were smoking pot at the time and make the connection\nwithout asking about other substance use. Within an hour of snorting cocaine,\nfor example, the risk of having a heart attack\ngoes up more than 20-fold. That's about five times more\nthan after smoking pot. The hour after you smoke marijuana\nyour heart attack risk does appear to nearly quintuple, but only for that hour.\nThen your risk drops down to normal. OK, but what does that mean? Even\nthough heart disease is our #1 killer, the risk of having a heart attack every\nhour is only like one in a million in any particular hour. So even if you\nthen light up a joint, that may quintuple your risk, but that would only bump it\nto like 1 in 150,000 risk in that hour, that's just for that one hour. So even if you smoked every day,\nyour annual risk might just go up a few percent. But why\nthe increased risk at all? Well, we've known since the 70s\nthat within an hour of smoking a joint, pulse rate goes up about 35%. Smoking a single joint\nincreases blood pressure too, as well as carbon monoxide levels\nin the blood of angina patients and cuts their ability to\nexercise nearly in half. Now is that just because of breathing\nsmoke, any kind of smoke? No, smoking a placebo joint, a joint\nwith marijuana from which the THC has been removed, only cuts down\nexercise capacity like 9%, compared to cutting the time they could\nexercise before the chest pain started by 48% with the cannabis. So it does\nseem to be a specific drug effect. Now, whether that's as bad as tobacco\nwe'd never know... until a year later. Smoking a marijuana cigarette decreased\nthe exercise time until angina more than smoking a tobacco cigarette, which only cut exercise capacity 23%,\ncompared to 50% after the joint. This may be because marijuana\nputs more demand on the heart; so, no surprise then, it\nwas worse than tobacco. It may also be the carbon monoxide. Smoking marijuana leads to nearly\nfive times more carbon monoxide in your bloodstream than smoking tobacco.\nThis is because pot smokers inhale deeper and then hold the smoke in, allowing\nmore carbon monoxide into your system. So between that and the cardioacceleration\n---the increased heart rate and pressure--- that could account for the accelerated\nchest pain in heart disease patients. Does it have any chronic\neffects on our arteries? Cannabis users do seem to\nhave relatively stiffer arteries for their age, suggesting an\nacceleration of the aging process, and we are only as old as our arteries. Even second-hand marijuana smoke\nmay be harmful, according to this recent study in the Journal of the\nAmerican Heart Association entitled \"One minute of marijuana\nsecondhand smoke impairs vascular endothelial function,\"\nmeaning artery function. And so there was a call to protect\nvulnerable populations, including the elderly and disabled, and\nresidents of multi-unit housing, pregnant women,\nand children even just one minute of exposure to\nmarijuana second-hand smoke in rats. So it's not clear how applicable this is, outside of perhaps not\nsmoking around your pet.", "9-8Etzgd-lc": "with cannabis edibles and extractables becoming legal later this year there's going to be a wide range of new products hitting store shelves with an exclusive look at what we should expect this October we're joined now by B and M Bloomberg's David George cos you've got a great piece on our website with all of these details but tell us what to expect so Canadians should expect a big laundry list of new products to hit the cannabis store shelves this October when they should be formally legalized a total to be exact of 17 new products and that ranges from concentrates beverages edibles and topicals there's a very long list I'm not going to say what every one of these 17 products are although we have something that you'll see up on our screen right there but this is going to really dramatically increase the scope of the cannabis market here in Ontario and we've been talking about for the past several months on the sluggish start there's been supply shortages there's been issues in terms of retail rollout but now the the actual amount of products we can disclose is going to expand fourfold from what we currently have on the market that's going to be great for producers in terms of sales figures and and the interest generated by that but it's also going to square up the legal market with the illicit market so there's been a lot of discussion how the illicit market the black market is still flourishing but once you're gonna have the same products that the black market already has in place these will be formally regulated you know great hopefully great products that will that we'll be able to squeeze out that black market player and and really generate a lot more revenue for for these cannabis producers I have so many questions please okay the first one is I understand a producer making cannabis and then selling that cannabis but when we're talking about chocolates and candies are the cannabis companies we talk about like all these hot stocks they know how to make chocolate sinan how to make candy they're learning - okay sure and and we've got facilities and they're doing that and they are yeah that's right one example I just want to bring up is Organa Graham which is a Moncton New Brunswick based cannabis producers one of the top ten in Canada and of their their capacity they've hired a specialty kitchen and they're building a special chocolate food processing plant for this particular product to have cannabis infused chocolates hit the market this October and that's just one example can't be growth the biggest cannabis company in the world is putting the finishing touches on their bottling line in Smiths Falls Ontario \u00e1free\u00e1 down in Leamington has a very high-tech automated facility to process a lot of these concentrate materials such as rosin and wax and Shatter descriptions you can read in my story I don't think we have enough time to really describe what each one of these are but but there's going to be the second wave of Canada's products it's going to be very exciting for the industry and now we have a little bit of clarity on what exactly these products are going to be and then what about the marketing like we did all this coverage around what the products could look like when we had legalization and there are some restrictions from the government on what what things can look like they're about candy and chocolate or like we're moving into an area where it's all about the packaging and the colors and the fancy titles what's the balancing act they're like well as it stands a lot of these packaging requirements are going to be that that we see for flour products are going to be set in place for these edibles and extractables nothing's really going to change as far as the proposed draft regulations go you're still going to have a very significant warning label as well as a very you know large warning sign that this is a cannabis product which is going to be bigger than the actual brand itself there is a lot of lobbying going on right now between these producers and the industry and the government to see if there's a middle ground that they can say look we get it we don't want to make sure that these products are going to be marketed to children however you have to be a little bit flexible in terms of how it can actually market this to the Canadian consumer this is a huge thing I think about I mean as much as there's demand for it I do have this fear about you know kids somehow mistaking this stuff the other question I wanted to ask you and I'm serious about this a lot of the CEOs have said they're not cannabis users are they trying these products because if taste is important now with edibles shouldn't they be like seeing if this stuff tastes good isn't that going to be the first thing the people who haven't tried edibles before think about when they're consuming this can of yeah that's tastes good it's like when you're the king and you have like a royal tester to make sure that the soup that you have is employees in there you want to make sure that so these are good so you know it's it's that's a hard question for me to answer I just they're gonna be out there they're gonna talk about how great their product is but if they haven't tried their product so so I did a story a while back for the BNN Bloomberg website we're about two-thirds of Canadian cannabis CEOs actually do use cannabis okay so a lot of that being said every one of these companies also has a very significant Quality Assurance Department where there's someone hired and their only job is to test all the cannabis products out there the company's own as well as their competitors yeah to make sure that their quality is up to stuff and as well that they're you know they're competitors aren't doing better than they are so there are people out there and making sure that what they what they're producing is actually good product I was going to say in fairness like we're talking about Tyson Foods earlier I didn't say does the Tyson's food CEO eat chicken or meat but I'm just curious about it", "_0ojs3AFono": "DRGUPTA'S NEXT SPECIAL  ABOUT WEED I AIRING  HERE ON N.

Hello someone who isn\u2019t me, Jules here for\nDNews. Drugs are a mixed dime bag. On the one hand, they get you high. On the other hand, they come with a bottomless\nlist of side effects. From heroin to coffee, drugs are drugs because\nthey change something about you, whether it be your level of pain, your mood, your decision\nmaking skills, and so on. But one of the big effects commonly associated\nwith various drugs, like marijuana or alcohol, is that they make you more creative. Stoners are quick to point out that even though\nthey might be too couch-locked to actually pick up a paintbrush, they feel much more\ncreative when they\u2019re high. And a similar idea follows the consumption\nof alcohol; Winston Churchill and others like Mark Twain and Beethoven have espoused the\nidea that it\u2019s important to get drunk before embarking on anything creative. Clearly, Churchill, Twain, and Beethoven have\nproved their aptitude for creativity, so does that prove them right? Well, interestingly, it might. In 2004, a study at the University of Colorado\nfound that about 15% of Caucasians carried a genetic variant that changed the way they\nresponded to alcohol when compared to the rest of the population. This so-called \u201cChurchill gene\u201d made them\nreact more strongly in mood and behavior. Those with the gene reported feeling happiness\nand elation after taking a shot of alcohol. Sorry, let me clarify: participants were literally\ninjected with alcohol so that absorption rates were consistent. Don\u2019t try that at home. Anyway, this shot was followed by a period\nof relaxation and creativity. In those without the gene, this creativity\nwas not as amplified, and on an aside, those with the Churchill gene were much more likely\nto end up with alcohol problems, like alcoholism. But for those with and without the Churchill\ngene, being drunk can make you FEEL more creative, even if you aren\u2019t. That\u2019s because alcohol inhibits brain activity,\nwhich can lower judgement of your own creative pursuits. So, you might feel like a genius in the moment,\nbut in the morning, you\u2019ll probably be disappointed. And hungover. Now, there is some evidence to show that a\nsmall amount of alcohol can promote creative thinking. In 2012 a study was published by the University\nof Chicago, wherein participants had a blood alcohol level of .075, which in the United\nStates, is just shy of the .08 that is considered legally drunk. They were asked to find word pairs based on\nthree given words. So, given \u201carm\u201d \u201cpeach\u201d and \u201ctar\u201d,\na correct answer would be something like \u201cpit\u201d, creating arm pit, peach pit, and tar pit. When compared to their sober counterparts,\nthe drunk group was able to think of more answers, faster answers, and more insightful\nanswers. So that\u2019s alcohol, but how about Ganja? Dank? Herb? Chron? Kush? The Devil\u2019s Lettuce? What about weed? Just based on the hundreds of different names\nfor it, it MUST make you more creative right? Well, a study from The Netherlands attempted\nto classify \u201ccreativity\u201d as divergent thinking -- the ability to brainstorm, think\nflexibly, and come up with new solutions to problems. In this case, participants were given two\nobjects (like a shoe and a pen) and asked to come up with new uses for them. Using this criteria, they found that when\nparticipants inhaled a low dose of cannabis there was almost no effect on creativity. When they took high doses, researchers found\nthat their creativity actually plummeted. But perhaps more interestingly, instead of\nbeing linked to actual drug use, creativity seems to be linked to expected drug use. Another study found that when participants\nwere tricked into thinking they\u2019d eaten a marijuana laced biscuit, they showed more\ncreativity than participants who hadn\u2019t eaten any biscuits at all. Unsurprisingly, the placebo effect still works. So depending on your definition of creativity,\nhaving a beer or two could make you a little more creative, Churchill gene or not. And for you potheads out there: you\u2019re only\nmore creative because you think you are. And if you\u2019re high enough, that last sentence\nshould keep you busy for the next seven hours, or however many minutes that is. But if you are creative, on drugs or not,\nyou probably like listening to music.

And for all you potheads out there, you might've\nheard that marijuana is stronger now than it used to be decades ago. But why is that? Find out in this video. THC is also the thing that gives marijuana,\nwell, its high and euphoric feeling. Basically, the more THC the pot has, the stronger\nthe high. Potency has been monitored for about 40 years,\nbut the rumor is lately, that today's pot boasts more THC than in prior years. So what do you think? Are there other drugs that might boost creativity?

opened up but experts say there isn't much political appetite in columbus for a recreational program in ohio lawyer tom herron says those lawmakers may not have a choice soon you can't do nothing i mean doing nothing is really not an option it's all because of how the state's drug laws are written we don't have a prohibition in ohio on possessing marijuana we have a prohibition on possessing a controlled substance and those controlled substances are separated based on their schedule across the nation marijuana is a schedule one drug the most serious classification right up there with heroin

possessing or selling pot in the state what you don't want is a highly regulated medical program and a free-for-all outside of that program that probably wouldn't happen but ohio lawmakers need to take action to avoid it they can tighten up the legal language to specifically outlaw marijuana but heron says voters will be watching marijuana polls just as well if not better than any candidate on

mantra I will work with the smartest people in the world my second mantra I will change the world two very simple ideas but very powerful and executed now I have to admit at the time I didn't know how I was gonna work with the smartest people in the world let alone how I was gonna change the world but I kept telling myself this over and over again I would talk to myself I'd say Clint you're gonna work with the smartest people in the world and you're gonna change the world Clint you're gonna work with the smartest people in the world you're gonna change the world I was convincing myself it will happen through repetition within five years of taking action and practicing my daily mantra I built my first successful company into a powerhouse in the staffing and recruiting world earning the ranking of the fifth fastest growing HR company in the nation making the Inc 500 fastest growing private companies and having close to a thousand employees I was working with executives that ran billion-dollar organizations in aerospace food automotive electronics and technology and as time passed by it hit me like a ton of bricks I was living and experiencing my first mantra I was working with some of the smartest people in the world my company has one division that focuses in a particular area agriculture I developed a passion for agriculture after I unexpectedly received a very rare and special invitation to visit the Amazon and Peru and study plants with the Shipibo tribe that's when I fell in love with plants and their healing abilities before that the scope of my experience with plants wall kind of entailed rolling joints in the back of my high school parking lot sorry mom I love you but seriously speaking we're a nation founded on farming and I found an application to use my extensive experience with plant medicine to change the world for the better and no no no no no no no I'm not talking about my experience with purple haze or edibles sorry mom I'm talking about using cannabis responsibly for medicinal needs because I believe in the power of happy and healthy people my vision is to help the world experience the benefits of cannabis I asked myself how can we help cannabis companies flourish on a large scale you see the difference between global industries today and that of current cannabis companies is that global industries utilize platforms that center around managing their human resources their very own people so I asked myself what if we build a revolutionary comprehensive HR platform that could legitimize the illicit cannabis industry can this change the world can this satisfy my second mantra it got me thinking even farther you know instead of using my experience to create some proprietary platform I decided to do what Elon Musk did at Tesla on June 12th of 2014 Elon Musk made an unprecedented move of opening all of us electric car pans to outside use it's a time when you have Apple and Samsung spending billions of dollars in legal costs to secure their patents all while Elon is just giving his away for free you know a lot of investors in Wall Street thought this move was ludicrous dangerous crazy but it serves a much much much greater purpose serves his mission to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy so I'm standing here today to try and help the cannabis industry in the same way now imagine trying to build a company in this case a cannabis business where you are selling a registered scheduled one control drug here are some of the registered schedule 1 controlled drugs that the government itemizes assent that amine heroin was before that and now you have cannabis now that you know what you're up against would you do it how would you go about doing it dealing with the banking the credit the licensing trying to find qualified employees today if you're expecting to open a cannabis visits expect the capital requirements to be astronomical and this isn't discourage you but to make you realize the current marketplace and regulatory issues that we face right now the current market risk in cannabis include high regulatory and application costs licensing cost legal costs compliance costs insurance costs distribution costs security cost you guys get the point right if you want to be in the cannabis industry maybe you're interested in opening a dispensary or maybe you're interested in creating a delivery service or maybe you're a really great agricultural list and you grow some amazing cannabis and all your friends tell you about how great it is whatever it is it's for a great cause what you're gonna need some help along the way one of the first areas where you're probably going to need some help in is payroll in taxes now I'm not going to bore you with the complexities of payroll and taxes actually wait I take that back parallel taxes is totally boring but the cannabis industry faces huge hurdles in this department and it's really important to understand why so today if you're a cannabis business you're most likely paying your taxes in cash and operating your business in cash today it's estimated that cannabis cannabis businesses across the United States will owe 2.8 billion dollars to Uncle Sam according to new frontier data and if you pay those taxes in cash the IRS reaps an additional two hundred and eighty million dollars in penalties and fees from you meaning the government taxes you an additional 10% tax for paying your taxes in cash that's a lot of cash house is not boughten vacation is not taken and Ferraris not driven my friends but wait a second is that what the cannabis industry is really about is it really about buying fancy houses and taking fancy vacations and driving Ferraris no it's not the cannabis industry is about exercising our divine right to wellness and having the access to the medicine that we so dearly need and because it's still illegal the federal government is the real Al Capone of our era today cannabis businesses lack the internal accounting and finance infrastructure because the system is predicated on cash so to establish and grow your business you're gonna have to find and navigate those waters find some way that you can process your payroll some way that you can bank your cash and hopefully not pay your taxes in cash now you may think that banks will open an account for you because well cannabis is illegal right and you're right I challenge you go down to your local Wells Fargo Chase Bank of America they're not going to open an account for you however we found that banking your cash be accomplished through state chartered banks state charter banks that operate and legalized states are banking cannabis cash right now and they're not going to tell you because they're not advertising about it and they're not going to until it's federally illegal however some of the largest banks in the world are baking cannabis cash right now through their state sub Seri charter banks so if you can't find a bank to operate in then try and navigate those waters and find a way that you can somehow run your payroll without paying your employees and cash paying your taxes not in cash and trying to increase your legitimize expenses for your cannabis business this will greatly improve what matters most in any business which is your bottom line the next area where you're going to need some help in is workers compensation and insurance now here's the funny thing how does that work can you go about insuring something that's federally illegal well insurance companies will actually insure anything trust me but because the cannabis industry is a new industry insurance companies lack the data to predict risk predominantly workers compensation risk you know when I first started working with cannabis companies I would ask them a technical question I'd say what would you do in the event an employee got seriously injured at work tell me about your illness injury prevention program and the steps that you would take to get them back to work the response cricket's I'd go back to when I say do you know what the government would do in the event that you don't have the proper insurance and programs in place they would roll their eyes and look back at me and I'll tell them fines for not having the proper insurance and programs in place can cost you up to $100,000 in occupational health and safety fines so no it is OSHA and there's some of the harshest in the nation I'll share with you another tip when looking for insurance try not to go through the state fund try to go to outside services that can harbor your risk for cheaper and protect yourself against liability this can be found through the private markets if they're insuring it through professional employer organizations or even staffing companies that can underwrite the liability for you okay the third area we're going to need some help is through staffing and recruiting unlike other industries where you can go find credible and reliable employees the cannabis industry lacks the staffing and recruitment platforms to help you source quality employees it's not like these employees are on monster Careerbuilder or linkedin or zip recruiter it's been a black market right so how do you go about finding them well today there's over three hundred thousand job openings in the cannabis field making it the nation's second largest job market and with barely half the nation legalized there's a tremendous void in our workforce that filling this demand so the number one biggest hurdle is gonna be you training the workforce to work in new processes of cultivation extraction laboratory and sciences genetics or research and development how we train new employees for cannabis is by transitioning agriculture-based employees into cannabis and by using some form of technology to help train and certify these employees in cannabis specific processes the next area we're going to need some help in is occupational health and safety and how it relates to corporate responsibility that's a fancy way of saying HR compliance and safety it starts with education on how to use the plan and what I'm trying to describe to you is you need to use some type of set standard certified knowledge base to educate your staff on how to use cannabis responsibly we would also educate your staff on cannabis manufacturing processes and regulatory requirements in a cannabis environment you know one of the many concerns of OSHA and insurance companies is they believe the majority of employees working in cannabis are stoners and potheads you can see why they're reluctant to insure you this just doesn't pertain to canvas though when cannabis well legal in California many of my clients in the aerospace automotive and manufacturing fields all had concerns how this was gonna affect their workplace if workers are enumerated while working with heavy machinery it poses a huge threat to the safety of the employee their co-workers and the employer and the truth is they're probably right if employees are operating in an environment where the product in this case cannabis is accessible many of them are probably actively using it at the job just how we prohibit the use of alcohol while operating heavy machinery we can't have workers operating machinery while under the influence of cannabis so using some kind of an HR platform to educate cannabis usage will ultimately lead to a safer work environment another advantage to using a platform for your cannabis business is to vet new hires and this just doesn't go for cannabis this also goes for other corporations when I hire a new employee I predicate the job offer on the employee passing a drug test right like the majority of other companies out there today I'm going to change the way I drug test my own employees rather than testing for any and all substances of cannabis I'm going to start testing for what cannabis compounds are actually in their system there are two molecular cannabis compounds CBD and THC CBD is the non psychoactive ingredient doesn't get you high and it doesn't affect the clarity of your own decisions therefore why are we still testing for it it's up to companies today to stop discriminating against those that use cannabis responsibly and start incorporating new THC drug testing models to vet and hire new employees the fifth area where you gonna need some help in and that can really change the world is in healthcare when an employee gets injured at work in any industry like a slip a fall maybe even a broken bone that employee is prescribed pain medication from a doctor what if you made cannabis as an option in your health care plan according to Kaiser Family Foundation and employers are spending nearly nine times more to treat opioid addiction than they did 12 years ago from 300 million dollars in 2004 to two point six billion dollars in 2016 this will cost employers up to six hundred and thirty five billion dollars in medical costs and lost productivity costs so today injured workers are becoming addicted to opioids that are prescribed to help manage their pain so let's look at the cycle of what occurs here right first a worker is injured on the job second a doctor prescribes opioids to manage the pain in the injury third the doctor advises the employer and the worker that he or she is unfit to go back to work while being under the influence of opioids fourth the employee becomes withdrawn from society social and working life which often leads to greater dependency on the drug itself and fifth and the worst case scenario the employee overdoses and in some cases dies so employers want to prevent addiction but have no choice but to send their worker to a doctor who prescribes them opioids all while the alternative to a new solution and plant medicine is sitting right in front of our face what I'm describing here today is self-insured health care by incorporating cannabis into your health care plan it provides employees with the access to the medicine that they need that is much safer it also gives the tools and resources for that worker to become a happier and healthier worker which leads to greater productivity in your workplace so using an HR platform that can provide cannabis health care options will give them the access to the medicine that they need and help you reduce your turnover and more importantly increase your long term retention and the reason why I'm talking about it from this stage is because I hope that this will inspire other companies to incorporate cannabis into their HR models as a cannabis plant transcends and starts to reclaim its place as a teacher and most importantly as a healer currently this doesn't exist I'm trying to build it right now and today I'm challenging the big players like United Healthcare Kaiser Blue Cross and others to incorporate cannabis into their health care plans and you know what I want you to challenge them with me because my second mantra is I will change the world and together we can do it [Applause] [Music]", "yf8YU8jyDnc": "hey guys dr frank here the founder of addiction mindset recovery coaching programs we help people quit nicotine thc products energy drinks and other drug addictions including gambling pornography social media gaming and alcohol so we're going to jump into this video today talking about the 12 signs or 12 questions that you can ask yourself to help you determine if you are addicted to marijuana or thc containing products people ask me all the time on my channel hey how do i know if i'm addicted to marijuana is it a dependency is it an addiction are they the same thing if you guys watch my channel you know i say dependency has a shadow and that shadow is addiction right so we're going to talk about 12 questions these 12 questions are taken right from marijuana anonymous i put the link below for the website it's a support group just like you have alcoholics anonymous like you have narcotics anonymous there's enough people addicted out there to marijuana that there is now a marijuana anonymous so we're going to go through these 12 questions and if you answer yes to even one of these questions you might need to consider that you're struggling with a marijuana addiction so let's start right off the bat question number one has smoking pot stopped being fun this is a really important question in my opinion when it comes to marijuana addiction a lot of people romanticize about the good times when it comes to smoking about the fun they were having with friends about the the past times the good old times but the reality of your situation right now might not be that and for a lot of people who are addicted to marijuana it's very very hard to accept that the good times might have ended these might be really really bad times right now that you're stuck in really depressing times addiction is a depressing place so has smoking pot stopped being fun yes or no do you ever get high alone question number two so a lot of people are going to answer yes to this question and i would you could probably argue that if you answer yes this doesn't mean your addiction a lot of people probably smoke alone but i'll tell you the dangers of getting high alone or the dangers of this life and trying to become successful in life is about making connections and a lot of those connections are social connections they're networking connections right it's not what you know but it's who you know in life so if you're starting to live a very isolated life and you have goals and you have ambitions and you have dreams and you're an entrepreneur you want to be an influencer you want to build a business whatever goals you may have probably require a degree of networking social influence and just you can't live in isolation you can't live in isolation in today's world if you want to go accomplish big things you have to have those social skills so getting high alone i think can be a very very dangerous thing okay question number three is it hard for you to imagine life without marijuana i remember when i first started smoking i said to myself i am never not gonna smoke i was all in on the lifestyle the stoner lifestyle i had a pax vaporizer i had a one hitter i had a bowl i had a bong i had a volcano vaporizer and then eventually went into the dab pens and the carts but i i i remember telling myself i'm never gonna quit and i remember being at an age throughout high school college and early adulthood even right up to the age of about 28 saying i'm never going to quit this drug it's an incredible thing i don't want to live without it um unfortunately that was a lie that i was telling myself that was a lie question number four do you find that your friends are determined by your marijuana use dan pena motivational speaker show me your friends and i'll show you your future so if you have big dreams for your your future if you have big goals that you hope to achieve and you you're struggling with an active addiction and you're surrounding yourself with people that promote and encourage that active addiction you you might want to start to question that are you choosing your friends based on your use and if so i would question even more importantly what people are you blocking out of your life what people are you neglecting what people are you isolating yourself from that could potentially be leading you to that next opportunity that next step so question number five do you use marijuana to avoid dealing with your problems a lot of people use drugs to cope i know based on the tick tock videos a lot of people use marijuana to escape reality to cope with problems whether it's anxiety depression and i'm not talking about people using marijuana for medical uses although they still might be addicted to it and the addiction might outweigh the medical benefits i'm not talking about that i'm talking about do you smoke do you use marijuana to avoid dealing with your problems so what are these these problems that you're avoiding dealing with it is this is it a school project is it a work project is it an anxiety that you're suffering from is it a depression that you're suffering from obviously using a substance doesn't fix any of these things in fact i bet if you think about it it's only making these problems worse people say i smoke because i had a stressful day at work well maybe you have work that you're supposed to be doing when you come home i smoke because i don't have money and i'm stressed about finances well maybe you shouldn't be spending your money on this maybe you should be investing your money into something that's going to move that needle forward for your future career for your future self um i always ask myself when i look at an addiction how is this addiction going to get me to where i want to be in life just something to think about do you use pot to smoke with your feelings question number six kind of like we talked about in question number five look a lot of people use marijuana and they say it helps with the anxiety it helps with the depression yet they're still suffering from anxiety and they're still suffering from depression especially those individuals who at this point where marijuana is actually making them sick remember marijuana is a biphasic drug at too low of an amount and won't do anything at too high of an amount it could cost the opposite effects so if you're taking it for anxiety it can actually trigger anxiety attacks in an individual who's using too much i know i certainly was using it to cope with my feelings very dangerous question number seven do you use marijuana to let you live in a privately defined world i never really understood this question i would say this relates closely to isolation do you ever get high alone are you living in a privately defined world i can't talk about that one a lot because i can't relate to it question number eight have you ever failed to keep promises you made about cutting down or controlling your use of marijuana so the answer is probably yes if you're watching this video you're trying to take a tolerance break and you only make it through the first one or two days you only make it for a week and you want it to go through for a month um this is a clear clear sign of addiction this is a clear symptom of addiction you say you're going to stop you tell other people you're going to stop and you don't and i'm going to warn you this is an extremely dangerous thing when it comes to addiction because when we say something and we don't see it through we start to train our brain to accept a lack of success if i say i'm going to do something i want to do it and i want to make sure i give it my best shot because that's ultimately what's going to lead to success in life that never give up attitude if you look at elon musk uh jeff bezos people just the the great people in life who have accomplished things um amazingly huge things people have changed the world they they saw it through they they don't stop they don't give up um and if we're constantly going back on promises that we make to ourselves that wears away at us over time it takes a lot from you mentally and physically question number nine has your use of marijuana cause problems with memory concentration or motivation were you once a great athlete were you once a phenomenal student were you once the the person that remembered everything about everyone which made you more sociable a better individual to be around have you noticed issues in those areas are your grades suffering is your work life suffering are you constantly not knowing where you put your keys or your wallet in the morning clear signs of addiction okay question number ten when your stash is nearly empty do you feel anxious or worried about how to get more are you constantly asking your plug hey are you around i really need some this weekend are you constantly nervous about your stash and how hard are you working to maintain maintain that stash how much time are you putting into going to pick that stash up how much are you overpaying for that stash in times of drought or in times of need something to think about question number 11 do you plan your life around marijuana use if the answer is yes this is probably one of the most important questions on here you should be planning your life around the future that you want to create for yourself and i know you probably dream big i know you're probably an ambitious person i know that success is definitely in the sober version of you future your future if you're planning your life around marijuana use you're not planning your life around your goals you're not planning your life around your ambitions and your motivations you're planning your life around chasing an addiction and not an ambition so planning your life around marijuana use means you're not planning your life around other things that may be very very big opportunities for you or things that you truly cherish and value question number 12 have your friends or relatives ever complain that you're using is damaging your relationship with them this is a great question have you lost relationships due to your marijuana use have maybe your use is holding you back from discovering that amazing relationship we always tell people before you get into a good relationship especially when you're in recovery when you're quitting a substance you have to focus on healing yourself before you're going to be able to connect with someone else at least for uh you know long-term stability purposes so how many times have you lied to family members how many times have you lied to your spouse your boyfriend your girlfriend your parents about marijuana use that constant line eventually takes a toll on mental health and if we put all this together if we put together the isolation if we put together the fact that maybe this addiction is something that you're not having fun with anymore if we put together the fact that maybe um you you keep going back on your promise to take a tolerance break or cut down if we put together the fact that you're planning your life around this it's it all adds up to classic signs of addiction we'll talk about dependency in another video um if you're answering yes to more one or more of these questions you you may have a problem and it may be time to seek out help it may be time to ask for help and you can schedule with our offices here at addiction mindset recovery coaching the numbers on the bottom of the screen the website link is in the bio in the website there's a free pdf on quitting addictions including marijuana

if you need help take this addiction seriously unfortunately a lot of media tells us these days that you don't have to treat this as a serious addiction and i can assure you this is a serious addiction stay tuned for more videos thanks for tuning in reach out if you need help", "mEhjDjxkxrI": "hi this is dr. cha thanks for tuning in to another YouTube video today we're going to talk about the THC predominant cultivars of medical marijuana so those are basically going to be your sativas and your indicus now traditionally sativas and indicas basically were descriptions of how the plants looked and grew but eventually patients figured out that they could also generally subdivide the plants into sativas and indicas based on the effect that they had so let's talk about the sativa affect a lot of people like sativa is for daytime use they generally feel that it's an energizing type of feeling a clear-headed feeling a body high basically they feel that it helps them to function better during the daytime now there can be some side effects from sativa again because they are typically energizing a lot of people feel that it can be anxiety provoking or it helps it affects them from getting to sleep at night another type as we discussed earlier was indica a lot of people like indicas for nighttime use they generally describe it as sedating lethargy inducing body relaxing so if you've just come home from a long day of work this is a good solution if you're looking for something that's both pain relieving as well as sedating however as I said before there can be some side effects if you're the type of person that needs to work a job during the day or if you have kids you're looking to take care of this may not be a good choice for you you may also have heard recently about hybrids well hybrids are basically just combinations of indicas and sativas basically the goal was to produce something that had more of a smoother effect for patients so basically something that a patient could take both daytime and nighttime there's obviously many other factors that go into determining whether what the type of effective patient is going to have levels of CBD minor cannabinoids and terpenoids indica versus sativa distinction was originally made based on the botany of the plants basically how they looked and how they grew there's a lot of variation overlap when you're dealing with specific subtypes of sativas and indicas in terms of the patient effect also there's many other things your doctor is going to consider when he goes over your treatment plan besides picking sativas or indicas he's also going to have to decide how you're gonna administer the medicine which will determine additional side effects and effects the dosage of the medical marijuana how he wants you to time the dose and so there's a lot of things that go into putting together a patient's treatment plan so that's one of the main reasons why you should look to get an experienced medical marijuana doctor when you're looking to do medical marijuana this is dr. Chow thanks again for tuning in", "xvOEzUvjP94": "[Music] and just that quickly Riley mailer takes from medical marijuana I take it four times a day one in the morning and then during lunch and then during dinner and then at night before I go to bed the thirteen year olds from Delaware says cannabis oil has helped treat the tumor that was eating away at her bones in second grade and my face started to grow and it was getting bigger my mom decided to take me to the hospital the news from the doctor was grim Riley who was seven at the time was diagnosed with aggressive giant cell granuloma only a handful of people in the world have the disease I was just like so uncomfortable because you know like seeing my face in the mirror and it's like Oh big and it made me really sad and stuff I was also in pain because of my seizures that I started having my stomach would cramp up and I would start I started to hallucinate it's an actually like a gut emptiness of when the doctors you know first described to us what was happening and what they thought was gonna happen after surgery Riley's mom decided to give her medical marijuana to see if it would help her symptoms I was so scared anytime you give your child any kind of new prescription you're scared to do you're looking for those side effects we just researched a lot and came across you know medical cannabis as a possible alternative that could help her heal and I couldn't find anything that was detrimental with using that the tumor it shrunk the seizures they stopped the way smaller than it was before I haven't had a reoccurrence in about four I'm taking cannabis oil it made me feel so much better and my bone was growing back the roots of my teeth were growing back before they were held in with stitches and I was told they wouldn't live but the roots regenerated and I still have my teeth dr.

the largest cannabis etfs the reason why it was so important for me to make this video is because the quality of these etfs varies very significantly so unlike other sectors where you can buy different etfs and have relatively similar performance in cannabis you can buy one etf and do very very well and then buy another and do very poorly so we're going to take a look at all the different etfs within the space so the six etfs that we'll be reviewing here today will be mj we'll be looking at msos we'll be looking at yolo hmmj and thcx so without further ado let's hop into this and what we'll be looking at with these companies we're going to take a look if they're actively managed or if they track an index uh we're going to take a look at the management expense ratio how much you're actually paying to hold the etfs we're going to take a look at how much each fund has under management and most importantly this is what we'll be mainly focusing on is the holdings in the fund i don't mind paying a higher fee if the holdings are higher quality so ultimately that's going to be the determining factor of how these funds rank and as always i'm not a financial advisor this is not financial advice this is made to be entertaining purposes only so to start it off might as well go in alphabetical order here starting off we have hmmj management expense ratio of 0.86 with assets under management of 684 million fun fact this was actually the first cannabis etf ever launched uh so what we're going to be looking at here we're not going to be looking at uh if the fund is tradable or the short-term opportunities we're really going to be focusing in on the long-term sustainability of these funds we're going to be taking a look at the actual fundamentals of the underlying holdings within these funds so because hmmj is listed on the toronto stock exchange it actually limits them from owning companies that operate in the u.s but we will still look at this objectively for what it is which is a canadian fund so starting off with their largest holding canopy growth definitely the best canadian operator seemingly the only canadian operator with a meaningful strategy to enter the states uh through acreage and terrace end so without a question the best canadian operator in my opinion uh aphria not super crazy about afria not a terrible operator either uh i'm kind of neutral on afria kronos only thing holding this company together seemingly is the ultria partnership other than that company doesn't seem like it has too much going for them uh gw pharma definitely a great company no complaints there same with iipr big fan of that company these are gw pharma is more of a research related company and ipr is a reit in the states uh that is listed on the new york stock exchange uh scott's miracle grow not really a cannabis company more of a fort fertilizer company only one third of the revenues actually come from cannabis then we have tilray which is merging with aphria village farms probably one of the highest quality cannabis operators as well and then everything under that is relatively small holdings just looking through it we have aurora hexo organogram sundial none of these am i too crazy about um so those definitely take away from the fun but the top holdings are all looking all right as far as canadian operators go next up we have hmus listed on the neo exchange that's when you don't hear too often this is also managed by horizon management expense ratio higher at one percent so now on the flip side from hmm j's uh fund uh hmus is actually 100 in the states so this one i am a much bigger fan of if you're looking at the holdings uh they own some great multi-state operators you have columbia care green thumb true leaf cresco cure leaf paris and jucie all of these names i am a big fan of uh charlotte's web i'm so so on acreage as well uh tuscan holdings is a spack as far as i'm uh aware uh you have air and liberty which are going to merge hopefully within the next uh within the next quarter uh but just looking through the holdings here everything looks fine i'm not seeing anything that sticks out as a really bad holding other than med men at a very low weighting of 0.75 so overall this is a great uh fund only thing that i'm not crazy about here is that it is uh traded on the neo uh so definitely a lot less liquidity than some of the funds that would be listed on the toronto stock exchange or on the new york stock exchange so now next up we have mj for some reason this is the largest cannabis etf in the world assets under management of nearly 1.8 billion with a management expense ratio of 0.75 percent so aside from hmmj which i feel did a great job building a canadian portfolio uh mj we'll take a look at their holdings here uh so you have aphro tilray as a quarter of the whole portfolio not sure why they would have that above canopy grove but they have that as the top holding then we have gw farm growgen that's all fine and then that this is where we run into a hiccup we have chronos aurora hexo and organogram as relatively large positions in the portfolio which i'm not too crazy about now to take a look at msos managed by advisor shares this one currently has assets under management of 684 million which has ballooned since they initially launched with a management expense ratio of 0.75 now if we look at msos's holdings it's actually very similar to what i have as my top 10 cannabis stocks for 2021. i'll actually link that video down below so you can take a look but this is very similar to what i have here so this portfolio is a hundred percent listed in the states and it's quality so you have green thumb cure leaf true leaf and cresco as the big four those are forty percent of the portfolio and then you have all your tier two names that you'd want uh so you have ayer you have tara send columbia care harvest health and juicy then you have the ancillary place as well grow gen and ipr this portfolio is great this is pretty well everything that you'd want i think i couldn't have done a better job allocating this myself and next up we have thcx this is actually the smallest one on this list with assets under management of 126 million and a management expense ratio of 0.95 uh so same thing here they actually have their top holdings as the afria tilray combo uh then you have grogen canopy growth village farms and gw farm which is definitely a fine uh those are all fine names uh but then here's the thing again you have um you have organogram you have aurora you have hexo you have supreme down there so this one's a little bit more spread out it's less concentrated towards the top and it has it's more spread out again uh among some of the uh smaller cap names which are lower quality which i'm not too crazy about and then finally we have yolo also managed by advisor shares an actively managed etf uh this one has assets under management of 367 million and a management expense ratio of 0.75 percent now this one here is a hybrid of both canada and u.s companies uh the thing with this one here is it seems like their weightings are just upside down uh so you have the kind of top names in canada you have vff you have uh gw farm you have aphrya cgc grojan these are all fine names but then the thing is is after these names then you have cure leaf you have harvest health ahead of true leave and then you have cure leaf columbia care cresco labs so it just seems like the waiting on this is a little bit backwards so if we were to rank these etfs from best to worse the way i would rank them is the us names at the top so you would have ms os as the best hmus as number two then the hybrid play which is yolo as number three uh then i would put the best canadian etf which is hmmj as fourth then thc x and then mj so that's my list again not financial advice this is strictly my opinion overall i'm a much bigger fan of the u.s market over the canadian just because you have 10 times the addressable market overall much bigger fan of the fundamentals in the states the canadian names could do better over shorter periods of time sometimes you see short-term outperformance but usually it's just based off of trades and hypes us really delivers the long-term fundamental value the youtube algorithm absolutely hates me so if this provides any value to you at all please consider liking commenting and subscribing so i can fight this youtube algorithm and get to a wider audience but overall thank you so much for watching very much appreciate it and have a great week you", "COxEoW_rsLw": "well hi everybody great to be with you today as an accent my name's Samantha Miller I'm the president chief scientists of pure analytics and chief science officer of Humboldt brand products really excited to share with you today everything that I can about major and minor cannabinoids and how they work in your body along with some great things about current research on PTSD cancer neuropathy and more so let's get started you know cannabinoids are substances that are produced both in plants and in the human body and they're responsible for some but not all of the effects that you experience from cannabis and in fact some of the other effects may be due to things like terpenoids and flavonoids phyto cannabinoids are one type of cannabinoid so you'll hear the terms phyto cannabinoid and endocannabinoid phyto cannabinoids are the ones that are produced by plants the cannabis plant is the only plant that's known to produce really significant amounts of this viscous resin and when you look at close-up shot of the surface of a cannabis plant you can actually physically see the phyto cannabinoids accumulating in the resin glands so the resin glands are those little structures on the plant have a little stalk with a ball on the end and that's where the phyto cannabinoids actually accumulate so the THC and CBD are right there in those resin glands endocannabinoids are a very similar class of substances but what's really interesting about them is that they're made naturally in the human body you know back in the 80s when I was a little kid we used to see these commercials this is your brain and this is your brain on drugs and you'd see the two eggs in a frying pan it was really interesting to me to learn was that we actually didn't even know that there were things called endocannabinoids or something called an endocannabinoid system in our bodies that's a natural architecture for interacting with cannabinoids and that's actually the reason that humans have such strong interactions with cannabinoids is because we have this natural architecture in our bodies to interact with them the endocannabinoid system is a network of receptors in our body receptors we can think of receptors as little docking sites right in your brain and all over your body these little docking sites that cannabinoids connect with and cause all of the different things that you experience from them let's talk a little bit about THC and CBD and CBN those three together are often referred to as the major cannabinoids the reason is is because they're often the most prevalent although current analysis is showing that cbc maybe should be called a major cannabinoid these days as well because it's present in almost every sample and at a decent level sometimes higher than CBD the relative amounts of THC and CBD are of a lot of interest to people right now you hear people talk about ratios one to one and two to one and 15 to one and twenty to one and it matters it matters how much THC relative to CBD there is because those are specific for specific ailments so a 20 to one CBD to THC cannabis flower or tincture for example may be good for addressing one thing like seizure control where a one to one or a two to one CBD to THC substance or tincture might be the best thing safe for pain relief so the ratio is specific to the application so that's why we care about ratio and that's why we talk about it a question I get asked a lot is is there anything you can do during the growing stages of the plant to change it from a THC plant to a CBD plant and unfortunately the answer is no you know I've been asked is there a nutrient can I water starve it can I change the light can I do anything to it to change that THC plant to a CBD plant and unfortunately the answer is no whether a plant is THC dominant or CBD dominant is actually determined by genetics so if it's a 15 percent THC planner is a 15 percent CBD plant the fact that that's the dominant cannabinoid isn't something that you can change but what you can change is the total accumulation of the plant so that can be affected by growing conditions you know if a plant doesn't have the right growing conditions nutrients soil and water it won't produce as much cannabinoid and the final potency percentage won't be as high so that is something that you can affect now there's three main types of cannabinoid ratio that you can consider there's cannabis that's very high THC there's cannabis it's very high CBD and right in the middle there is cannabis where you have equal amounts of THC and CBD and again which bucket cannabis ends up in high CBD high THC or equal amounts of the two is determined by genetics of the plant THC is probably the cannabinoid that we're all the most familiar with it's the one that's been talked about the most it's the one that for a long time people attributed most of the effects of cannabis to this one molecule to THC we know more than that now which we'll talk about throughout this presentation today but the reason that people talk a lot about THC is it has some pretty big effects you know THC is the main psychoactive or intoxicating component in cannabis you know when we talk about that it's to indicate that there's a shift right and the way you feel in your emotional state when you consume THC now THC is referred to in a few different ways out there you'll see THC you'll see Delta 9 THC Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol so those are all the same thing THC is generally the most abundant cannabinoid in cannabis but that's been changing as more people have focused on developing more CBD strains and we'll talk about CBD a lot as well today one of the fascinating things about THC is that it actually exists in different forms in the plant so you actually have THC acid as its dominant form in the growing plant and THC is the form that you find after it's been heated so when you put something in your pipe and smoke it you're actually doing some chemistry converting THC teach the acid to THC now there's a lot of confusion amongst patients about THC acid and THC you know a lot more is known about THC THC acid is just coming into our purview as something that we're interested in and we want to know about the researchers who are the original people who pioneered cannabinoid research when you ask them at the conferences you say ruff Raphael Michelin like why aren't you studying THC acid he was like oh there's nothing to it there's nothing there it doesn't have strong effects in the body near Raphael's around it's because of people who went out there is evangelists and as early adopters and tried this and have built bodies of anecdotal evidence to say there's something interesting going on here with these acidic cannabinoids so THC acid is the form it's in like I said before it's been heated that means in the growing plant or in dried material let's say on the shelf in a jar and dispensary that's the form that most of it is in the conversion of THC acid to THC is called decarboxylation that's a big word I like the word activation more and I think it's a little bit more intuitive so you'll hear me use the term activation and decarboxylation interchangeably at room temperature decarboxylation can actually also occur over time so as your cannabis sits in that jar you can actually have some of that conversion as well so it's not entirely stable smoking or vaporizing activates or D carboxylates THC acid and turns it into THC making it available for those experiences that you're most accustomed to for reliable decarboxylation of THC acid to THC you know a lot of people are interested in that because they're making their own medicine at home if you want to do that my best advice is to heat your raw cannabis you know don't put it into butter first but just the raw cannabis itself on a baking sheet in the oven so if you pre-heat your oven to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and you bake it and keep it in a thin layer to make sure that the heat can actually penetrate all the material he did for 90 minutes and you'll have great THC acid to THC conversion so so why do we care so I've talked about this thing exists we have it how do you convert one to the other so but why do you care about it well the reason you care about THC acid and THC and the difference between them is because the effects are totally different and in many cases the therapeutic application is totally different depending on the patient and their needs and what's right for you it really depends on your desired effects and the relief that you need THC acid has been exciting to people lately because there's a lot of new people coming to cannabis and they want to try it for the first time they've got one hesitation though that's the intoxication component to it maybe they're not comfortable letting go not having control in that moment so THC acid preparations tinctures especially you can find THC acid in are a great way for people to try cannabis for the first time without a whole lot of danger of fear of intoxication there's a lot of interesting findings from these bodies of patient anecdotal evidence that we've been putting together to show that THC acid has some pretty substantial anti-inflammatory properties and may have some anti [ __ ] properties as well more work needs to be done on that but there's some clear indications that there's more to learn there you know when I talk about THC acid patients are really you know interested and concerned how can I get access to that like what kind of products can I find THC acid in well the the most direct way is through juicing so you can actually juice raw cannabis both the leaves and the flowers if you're juicing flowers you do need to add a little bit of water into your blender as well or school turn out quite right wheatgrass juice blenders juicers are actually the best ones to use because of the way that they process the material some juicers can actually activate the THC acid and converts it to THC during the process of juicing because of the amount of heat that's used so you want to use a juicer that doesn't have a lot of heat if you're concerned about preserving your cannabinoid acids glycerin tinctures that are made without any heat or alcohol tinctures made without any heat are another place that you can find acidic cannabinoids water extracted hash will often have a small amount of activation but you can keep the majority of it in the acid form as well and you can capsulize that so you can take it as an oral ingestible as a capsule so those are some strategies in ways that you can access acidic cannabinoids and try them if you're interested one of the other things that's been interesting as i've have worked with several patients concerning the use of THC acid and THC is there's a distinct time-phased effect that's different for THC acid what we've learned is that if you're interested in pursuing THC acid therapy you have to try it for a while to make sure you're actually experiencing the benefit for many patients is actually up to three to four weeks after daily use that they truly start to experience the benefit I have a lot of patients who approached me and they say Samantha you know I'm trying to choose is it THC acid therapy or is it th which one is it that I want you know aren't we funny as humans that way right we want to be an a/b thing but really the answer is it's probably both you know I myself I have fibromyalgia so I deal with chronic pain and there's days where I have really acute days they're really bad days acidic cannabinoid therapy on a daily basis is something that can lower the overall symptom level of someone who has a condition like mine chronic pain condition but on those acute days I probably need some THC and so they can really complement one another so the acidic cannabinoid therapy to bring down that total level of symptoms that you're feeling and the activated cannabinoids to really help you deal with that in the moment situation because THC as you know you feel very immediately and can give you that immediate relief if you need it to help promote your quality of life and keep you functional for that day when you are pursuing THC acid therapy especially if you're doing it to avoid intoxication you really do need to make sure you understand that there is going to be a small amount in that activated form THC present so you may still feel a little bit of psycho activity but it certainly should be a lot less than if the whole thing was activated again most of our evidence around THC acid therapy has to do with patient anecdotal evidence that's been gathered by various clinicians even dispensaries who are doing their own research there's a certain dispensaries have gone on a mission to gather data and figure out what's really happening with some of these unique substances some of the things that we've observed are reduction in inflammation and muscle convulsions in spasticity but the one that fascinates me the most is changes in cognitive development in children who are taking acidic cannabinoid therapies we see some really amazing shifts in their behavior both from THC acid and CBD acid we see changes and emotional intelligence in speech and cognition I'm fascinated to see what the further research on THC acid reveals and we should be really fascinating people often wonder what's normal for THC should it take care of my pain should it take care of my nausea like what is it really supposed to do for me there's been a lot of research that's been done there's certainly more to do but we have some really clear ground that you can stand on and say THC is great for these things it's great for mild to moderate pain relief and it's become because of that has become a great option for people to wean themselves off of opioid therapy say from post-surgical pain for some people they can deal with post-surgical pain using cannabis for many people that's a challenge and they often need the opioids for a few days but cannabis can be an incredible tool for getting yourself off of that addictive medication as quickly as possible so you don't experience those side effects control of nausea is a very significant finding around THC people with cancer and AIDS and who are taking a lot of different pharmaceutical regimens to help get them through their condition off an experience a lot of nausea and also the need for appetite stimulation as we all know THC does a great job at appetite stimulation sometimes when you don't want it to THC can also be a great solution for insomnia for many people helping people go to sleep and then stain is sleep a little bit longer the one thing that we should always consider especially for new users to cannabis who are trying THC for the first time is that for some people it's not always totally a great experience so if you suffer from anxiety or you find yourself on the bipolar spectrum or with schizophrenia or with conditions like that THC may exacerbate your condition so if you fall into that spectrum you really want to make sure that you work closely with your doctor if you're just thinking about exploring THC dominant cannabis and your therapy regimen and make sure that it's the right choice for you and then it's done in a controlled manner because everybody needs to be successful and their therapeutic regimen that one might need a little bit more guidance and some THC levels for flowers are really interesting you know in owning the lab for the last seven years it's been fascinating to actually watch that potency average rise in addition to the the potency average of flowers rising you see all these other kind of new products coming out but a lot of people wonder like what's normal for flowers what's average what's high what's low so in Northern California where my laboratory does testing we see the average range of THC dominant flowers to be about sixteen and a half percent once you get over about eighteen to twenty percent that's near in the strong range and over 21 percent you have a lot fewer strings that qualify and if another dividing line is 25% you do have some strains that perform over 25 percent THC but it's a lot fewer than below so it's good to understand what average ranges are and also that there is actually a value associated with those ranges and so if your economics of cannabis use matter to you then it might be good to understand what things fall into your price range and how you can best use those in your therapy regimen there is a whole class of patience right now who's really interested in the mild to moderate range of THC potency especially older people I know as I get older my response to THC definitely changes we often have a lower tolerance level for it as we get older so those lower THC products say 10% THC and below are becoming more attractive to those new people who are coming to cannabis for the first time so just because it's low potency doesn't mean it's bad it just means it's right for a different person than something that's high THC so we've had this explosion of concentrates especially in California I mean in every legal market I'm sure but I'm here in California so that's where I see it the most I remember the first time I saw a BHO wax I remember the first time I saw a shatter and as a chemist I was fascinated by it and I asked them about it and they wouldn't tell me anything it's top secret in others videos all over YouTube the times I think all of this stuff so it's certainly no secret anymore and as the secret has gotten out the proliferation of it's been amazing and what's really fascinating is it's really changed the potency thresholds that people are accustomed to and that they expect in the marketplace so interesting to know that Keefe you know so that's a cannabis that's been run and over a dry sieve say and the resin glands collected generally doesn't get over about 30 or 40 percent THC and more often it's actually a little bit below that with hash so traditional hash like you used to see coming se out of Afghanistan and Pakistan in places like that which you actually don't see much of anymore generally ranges between about 10 to 60% with average being at about 48 bubble hash which is water extracted hash still popular all it's waning in its popularity as other extracts come into the market co2 extracts and BHO extracts and all these different things that people are doing but water extracted hash you know averages at about 50% and really tops out around 65 or so you do have a few rare ones that go higher than that but the average is a real solid 50 percent wax or BHO or shatter co2 extracts you know those are chemical extracts so bubble hash hash and Keith are all made by what we call a mechanical process right where you physically remove resin glands and gather them and press them together whereas these new concentrates are totally different so they come from a process of chemical extraction so the extraction of cannabis with butane with co2 with propane some with nitrogen there's a variety of things that you can use but that chemical extraction as you might expect as much more efficient so you get much higher concentrates um ranging upwards of 90 plus percent definitely something to be careful with if you're a new user but can be a great source of relief and very concentrated dose of cannabinoids if needed for the right patient let's move on to talking about CBD a lot of talk about CBD people are really excited about CBD you know when I first started speaking to patient audiences seven years ago I would ask people who's heard of CBD in here and I get a couple hands half timidly raised when I asked that question to an audience today everybody raises their hand until they know what CBD is which is a really cool thing to happen in five or seven years so why do we care about CBD and what's the buzz you know what is it all about well it's different from THC in many ways in both the way that it makes you feel and a therapeutic applications so CBD has been called non psychoactive or non intoxicating the way I like to say it is you'll still be able to operate heavy equipment afterwards probably so CBD is a great option for people who again who are seeking cannabinoid therapy are a little concerned about the feelings of intoxication they might experience from THC and would really prefer to take baby steps in to cannabis they feel safer so CBD has become one of those things that people can try in a safe way in a safe place in addition there's a greater level of permissions right they've been created around CBD both legally and culturally in our society and that entry point of that kind of environment of permissions that's being created for CBD is really exciting because it's really been the impetus for changing the conversation around cannabinoid therapy focusing on the medicinal therapeutic and less on the psychoactivity and intoxication components that have historically been our kind of cultural association with cannabis CBD is interesting in that it's usually found at low levels so sub 1% less than 1% but in some cannabis it's the dominant cannabinoid although that does occur more rarely than with THC there's a lot of efforts underway to create more CBD strains their seed collectives there's independent growers there's companies who are making products now and they want the only specific cannabinoids to be present especially CBD so there's a lot of work around developing more CBD strains and creating more access to CBD for patient population so interestingly CBD like THC also has an acid form CBD acid or CBD a fascinating of course that both of course are non intoxicating as CBD is not intoxicating if THC is present though it's good to understand that you may still feel some feelings of intoxication so CBD does really lower the overall feelings of intoxication that you're going to feel from THC because of the way that they interact but you still may feel a little bit so if you do feel some intoxication don't be surprised it's because of the THC present the therapeutic uses of CBD and CBD acid are different a lot less is known about CBD acid fewer people have used it but it has been the one that has shown some pretty incredible shifts in children who are using it again as with THC acid the time to feel the effects are different so with CBD acid therapy you may need to be using CBD acid tincture or juicing three to four weeks before you actually feel that overall reduction of your symptom level one of the best stories that I heard about Beadie acid therapy was out in the village of Mendocino in Northern California and I was visiting a little collective out there called the Leonard Moore cooperative we've done a lot of work to try and promote CBD and there was a patient of theirs that had ALS and it was a fairly far advanced case of it and she was about to go into Hospice and the family was really upset about that they really wanted her at home you know everybody does better at home and so you know there in that moment of desperation and they were gonna try anything and they got some juice to cannabis from Leonard more cooperative and that juiced cannabis being given to her on a daily basis is what kept her off of a feeding tube and kept her out of hospice and so she was able to have really an incredibly higher quality of life through CBD acid therapy and there's there's so many stories like that we don't have enough time to tell but it can be a very powerful alternative to the drugs that people are using or the care regimens that we start to pursue as as people go into end-of-life so like with THC acid there is a recipe for conversion if you need to convert CBD acid to CBD say for a product or a tincture that you're making to help with your own therapeutic regimen and there's some specific conditions so again heating raw cannabis in your oven so not in oil or anything else is the best way to do it you want to spread it out on a baking sheet pre-heat your oven to 295 so it's a higher temperature than with THC and heat it for ninety minutes and you'll get great CBD acid to CBD conversion if you don't go to that 295 degree temperature your conversion probably won't occur or I'll occur in a partial way so really important that you hit that temperature and because it's important you hit the temperature I recommend that people buy an additional temperature gauge for their oven so you can often buy them right in the grocery store and the little gadget aisle you can hang it right in your oven and make sure that you're actually at the right temperature because I'll tell you our oven thermostats are terrible for the most part I have learned so when people are looking for CBD and they're looking for it the flower form they're often kind of restricted to asking about specific strain names some strains that you can look for that are likely to be CBD dominant are things like tsunami Harlequin canna tonic Harless sue can ASSU stinky pink diesel and of course Charlotte's Web that we heard about a lot from Sanjay Gupta interestingly stinky pink diesel was the first I know it's a funny name was the first high bead high CBD strain that was isolated and identified here in California through lab testing that happened at Harbor side it was a strain that came out of very very small growing community in Mendocino County called Koval oh and I remember doing a seminar out in Koval Oh about six years ago now in the public library there and as a very small place about six people came and the woman who actually had created that strain and submitted it for testing and was it was actually there so it was a pleasure to meet her she stills got those genetics and is holding on to him tight you know that's one of the things that's been interesting about CBD is because it's been so limited in supply and there have been so few people who have held the genetics there was a tendency for a long time to hold on to them and and not share them with people what's really exciting is that we've had some producers and breeders and creators like Lawrence Ringo who made all of their genetics available in seed form to whoever wanted to buy them so that's been a really exciting change in CBD is it's now very publicly available for people who say want to grow it themselves or work with it themselves the therapeutic uses of CBD are different from THC complimentary but different so it definitely deals with pain just like THC does but it attacks pain from a different side than THC it definitely reduces inflammation as THC does but it specifically deals with pain due to spasticity and there are a lot of chronic pain conditions that originate from muscle spasticity fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis I mean epilepsy it's origin is spasticity and that's why you've seen CBD become a go-to therapeutic alternative for many people who suffer from these spasticity related conditions CBDs also been shown in some more modern research to be very effective for eliminating chemotherapy induced neuropathy and also neuropathy in general even diabetic neuropathy so that work was done in a very formal setting and was actually very clear so CBD has a lot of different uses especially for people suffering from chronic pain one of its other major applications is as an anti-anxiety substance so CBD for many people who suffer from anxiety really seems to provide them incredible relief now I never recommend that somebody go off of their anxiety medication without consulting their doctor but for many patients they've been able to either find it as a compliment or a substitution for a more traditional pharmaceutical regimen that they were previously on CBD has also been shown in some research to perhaps have some anti-tumor activity for particular types of tumors a little bit later in the presentation we'll talk a little bit more about that research for people who are using CBD and THC together they have some interesting interplay with one another that's good to understand because they become tools in your toolkit as a patient and a user with a therapeutic regimen that you're trying really to have be successful so CBD actually prolongs the effects of THC and the way that it does that is actually inhibits the enzyme that breaks down THC in our liver so when CBD connects with that enzyme it changes its shape and so THC doesn't fit in it very well anymore and can't be broken down and so it recirculates and we experience it for a longer period of time CBD also reduces the feelings of intoxication from THC so when I tell people that CBD is gonna make their THC last longer they're alright I'm gonna get high for longer well it's a little bit different than that you'll probably be less high but your therapeutic benefits will last for longer so it's a point at which we have to kind of separate those two ideas the expected CBD levels for flowers are a little bit different than for THC especially when we're looking at CBD flowers that have a one-to-one or a balanced ratio because think about it you couldn't have 20% THC and 20% CBD in the plant right no one to another they 40% cannabinoid and they just don't accumulate at that level no lab has shown that result yet so the only time that you really see CBD go above 20% or even in that range are in those 20 to 1 CBD to THC flowers oftentimes and say a one-to-one CBD flower you'll see something like 5% CBD and 5% THC or maybe 7% and 7% so the levels are a lot lower than you see in those THC flowers that we've really optimized for potency over so many different years how high the CBD level is again depends on ratio so if you're dealing with a twenty to one you can actually see CBD levels up as high as twenty but with balanced or with lower ratios you're going to see them more in the single-digit range so that doesn't mean that it's poor quality and I know we have this idea that cannabis at a certain percentage means that it's low quality so you kinda have to throw that out the door when it comes to CBD it's just an entirely different thing to consider let's talk about cbn a little bit you know it's gotten kind of a bad rap and you know there's a reason why it's a byproduct of THC degradation so when THC degrades it becomes CBN that usually happens in the presence of UV light and oxygen and I used to say to the growers that I would talk to you so don't put it in the turkey bag and throw it in the corner of your room and little light run across it and back and forth all day because that UV in addition the oxygen the bag is going to cause CBN conversion a lot of dispensaries and people in the kind of open market of cannabis view CBN is a negative indicator of either processing or age on cannabis that's true but it has to be taken with a grain of salt it really only applies to indoor grown cannabis outdoor grown cannabis is going to naturally have a small amount of CBN present due to the UV that's impinging on it from the Sun and the weathering that's happening as it grows in the outdoor environment during the entire grow season so not uncommon to find say 0.5% CBN in an outdoor grown flower that's been perfectly grown and perfectly processed and is very fresh so CBN is not always an indicator of negativity either in the growth conditions or in processing so good to understand that it also has some interesting therapeutic benefits one of the ones that's interesting to me especially is around cardiovascular effects it actually decreases heart rate without decreasing blood flow so can bring your heart rate down some animal model research has also said that CBN induces feelings of grogginess I actually did some consumer testing along the way in developing the humble products to look at CBN and I found very clearly that CBN is a very dose dependent substance and that at low doses can be effective as a sleep aid but as you go into moderate and high doses actually seems to be contraindicated for sleep and can be alerting to many people so there's a very interesting finding and in fact found throughout our work that LOC cbn dose and a dose of THC accompanied with Mersin are virtually equivalent so let's talk a little bit about some of the minor cannabinoids THC and CBD and CBN we hear about those a lot there's other ones that have started to percolate up you know we hear about them here and there but we don't know a lot about them part of its because not a lot of research has been done so there's more work to do but there's some interesting things to look at CBC is one of my favorite I think it has a lot of promise you know CBD has been shown to be a very powerful anti anxiety substance in the preliminary research that's been done CBC has been shown to have 10 times the anti-anxiety effects of CBD Wow interestingly CBC is present and elevated amounts in juvenile plants and then as the plant grows older and matures and flowers you have lower CBC levels there have been some plants that have been isolated that are CBC rich plants and they are actually mutant plants that can't produce THC and CBD very well and so because they can't produce THC and CBD very well the CBC is allowed to accumulate the reason why is that they all share the same starting material so this little pile of something called CBG acid inside the plant and the THC enzyme the CBD enzyme and the CBC enzyme all grab on to that CBG acid as their starting material to convert to become the cannabinoids that they eventually are THC CBD and CBC so when the THC enzyme and the CBD enzyme aren't grabbing any of that b:g acid it's just left there for the CBC in Xiamen it goes to town and starts to accumulate uns that's the only time you really see it at appreciable levels in a mature plant so there hasn't been very many of those identified so that's kind of that's the search right for the ambitious grower out there is that CBC mutant CBC's also been shown to have anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects as well cannabidiol or CBD is an interesting one as well it's non psychoactive or non intoxicating as a CBC by the way again anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects seems to be a theme right you hear from almost every cannabinoid THC CBD CBC now CBG we're hearing that pain relieving an anti-inflammatory effects so if you're dealing with pain cannabis is a great solution or a great thing to drive for people you know we often hear about cannabis and glaucoma and I don't know we've all probably heard Peter Tosh this song where he talks about it too right I always associated that especially with the way people express it and talked about it what it had to do with THC but if you look at the research you'll see that what was actually shown to be reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients in the research that's been performed with CBG in many of the cases that have been identified so it's also an interesting molecule to look at therapeutic li CBG acid as I said is the precursor to both THC and CBD in the growing plant but you always have a small amount of CBG that's left over and sometimes it's not a small amount it can actually help growers look at an indicator of whether or not they allowed their plant to mature longer so a mature plant that was harvested in an optimal time probably have 1% or less of CBG maybe up to one and a half percent but you can see plants with as much as five or six percent CBG present in them basically what you're looking at there if it's not a genetic mutant is a plant that was just harvested a little bit too early that balance and that varying balance between the different cannabinoids as well as the other substances of the plant at different points of maturity and harvests are some of the things that shape preferences that people have say for early mid to late harvest products THC v also has a lot of buzz about it tetrahydrocannabinol it's a mouthful there's been limited research on it it's a very rare cannabinoid in my laboratory we've isolated three different cultivars of THC cannabis over 5% by weight so those are very interesting all in one small community in Mendocino so they've been kind of collecting genetics it's sifting through to them to see if they can find th DV and a few of them have the animal model research assist some interesting things about THC v relative to THC and that is is that the presence of THC v is thought to bring on the feelings of THC stronger and quicker so it quicker hi that's more intense but also has a shorter duration I said call it the quickie right if you can actually find the THC v cannabis there's also been research people say hey Samantha where do I get some of that diet weed and I say diet weed well what's the diet weed the diet weed it turns out is th T V cannabis so there's been some animal model research that suggested that it actually prevents the munchies which if you struggle with your weight and you smoke cannabis may be a significant issue for you not being proven out in humans yet so as soon as we get more THC th T V cannabis for everybody to try we'll have to run that one to ground and see if it really is the diet weed but there's a lot of people excited about the prospect of that right now there's also a related compound on the CBD side called CBD V Orkin a bit of Eron CBD v and THC v are both what we call propyl cannabinoids they have a three carbon ring on them that what makes them a little bit different CBD v is also a non intoxicating cannabinoid and it's thought to perhaps be one of the differentiators in CBD dominant cannabis that has greater or lesser efficacy for epilepsy treatment so interestingly in in groups of epilepsy patients who have been trying lots of different CBD strains we find that they don't all work the same some work better than others they maybe have the same CBD to THC ratio so you can tell it's not about that it's not just about the CBD and THC well one of the other things it's present can be CBD v and some preliminary animal model research has shown that CBD v has significant anti spasticity properties so it may be that the anti spasticity properties of CB DV when coupled with CB d really create the best solution for a lot of people when treating epilepsy and spasticity but more to learn on that as well there's a lot of exciting research happening right now and it's an exciting time in that our government here in the u.s. even is allowing more research up to this time a lot of it has had to happen in more international places in Spain and Italy and Israel and Canada who have had a Amsterdam who've had a greater level of permissions than we have there's been a few pioneers here in the u.s. dr. Sean McAllister is one of them he's out of California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco and Sean is a true pioneer you can you two of him and watch him all day if you'd like to what Sean did was he induced tumors into animals into rats so you can actually buy cancer many people don't know that but you can buy cancer and you can give it to things as in a clinical setting so these rats were given cancer and they were allowed to grow tumors in this case breast tumors were the specific case study that I saw from from Sean so he showed a picture of this ugly tumor on this poor rats chest and then he made CBD THC injections into that tumor and after 30 days of the injections at the right ratio of CBD to THC that tumor completely disappeared and the next thing that Sean shows is a picture of a rat with nothing but beautiful pink skin on its belly and if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I probably wouldn't believe it because it's such an amazing transformation so Sean's work is really exciting he's really diving down into whether the specific cannabinoid ratios that are needed to treat a specific type of cancer Sean was a rebel he got his first research grant under the auspices of actually demonstrating that cannabis wasn't good for you and and bless Sean for that because that was how he got the funding to make these findings now the NIH is willing to fund his research at face value as a benefit for finding cures for cancer so that's an exciting shift as well there's been a lot of research on PTSD we have a lot of people in our society these days suffering from it from all of the wars that we've had recently addition to just the stress and pain of this fast-paced culture that we're all living in right now so there's been a lot of looking at how can cannabis help these people recover and come back to normalcy and enjoy a greater quality of life well we've shown that THC when it stimulates the cb1 receptor can interrupt memories and we all know that cannabis affects our memory wearing work and if personally in anecdotally but it can on a on a more clinical level so when your memories are disrupted that way when you have PTSD it can actually let you have that break where you can get control and get control of your thoughts and control that looping and that focusing on that negative experience you had which is the root of that PTSD so again through animal model research and showing that stimulation of the cb1 receptor eliminates these long term negative memories there's a real prospect of hope for people who are suffering from PTSD using cannabinoid therapy instead of other pharmaceutical alternatives there was some great research at Temple University on chemotherapy induced neuropathy as well neuropathy is the degeneration of the nervous system and there's a lot of pain associated with it the study found that when CBD was administered before the chemotherapy that could actually completely prevent the onset of chemotherapy induced neuropathy so for those people that was you know an amazing amazing shift they in a 2010 FDA clinical trial they actually concluded that inhaled cannabis significantly reduced neuropathy as compared to placebo in human studies so fascinating to see the FDA and 2010 was actually doing this research which is not well known so some great things on cancer PTSD and neuropathy and one that's really been in the press a lot lately has been treatment of epilepsy that's happening through the activated CBD being administered to patients often in tincture form or orally ingestible and it's causing incredible shifts and changes in people who suffer from frequent seizures I had a story from a fellow who called me and he went to tell me about his four-year-old daughter and you could hear the sounds of him making dinner in the background all of San sounds the family I liked him from kind of the first few words he said to me was hearing and he said you know my daughter has 800 seizures a day and basically that means she's in an intractable seizures all of the time I'm really desperate to find something to help her they've got her on all of these drugs or causing all these side-effects and she has no quality of life and no interaction with the family it was a very sad story and he didn't live anywhere near me in my state so I was able to help him with was information about CBD and strain names that he could look for to try and find something to help her he called me back about a month later he said Samantha I want to tell you about what's happening I said you know she was at eight hundred seizures a day and we've had her on a CBD tincture now for a month or so and she's down to one seizure a week and later on that young lady was down to one a month it gives you chills when you think about I mean can you imagine eight hundred seizures a day was no that's one every you know every if you figure out how many minutes there on the day and that's pretty much a constant seizure so the fact that CBD can bring this kinds of relief to people is something that's opening doors and opening minds about cannabis as a therapeutic alternative sir so many of these complicated drugs that are currently being used to treat these very serious conditions so it's I'm excited to be a part of and share with you this current research and maybe help open your mind and your landscape of permissions for trying cannabis and for supporting it in the use of your families", "4GvVqB0_OAE": "so the biggest difference between the two plants obviously they look very similar the leaf structure is basically the same the biggest difference is going to be the amount of THC that's going to be in the plant basically that's the regulated the regulated chemical and these plants are going to be producing under 0.3% which is negligible in terms of how it affects your body so that's gonna be the biggest difference this is gonna grow typically about you know five to ten feet depending on when planting time is this variety here is going to produce more of a big flower variety it's gonna produce more oil typically you're gonna have two different varieties one is gonna be producing more more fiber fibrous hemp one's gonna be producing more oil typically the the fibrous plants will be growing tall skinny plants more of an industrial look whereas these will grow more bushy style and you'll see that the big flowers that you're typically used to seeing as the plant matures it starts to produce more and more cannabinoids as it gets older and older as it flowers so it'll start to raise all the percentages of all the camera' noids in the plant so you really want to keep an eye on those cannabinoid percentages so that you don't go over that point three that's regulated by the state and it can happen pretty quick you know you want to be testing at least weekly to make sure that you're not going to be going over those levels because it can happen in a matter of a few days once harvested basically we're gonna treat this plant like like medicine it'll be it'll be harvested with extreme care by hand it'll be maintained in a drying facility it'll be processed down into an oil that can be used in products lotions you can eat it you'll be able to put it in many different products so you'll be able to see the oil all over the place", "Ut5IPhBbxL0": "45 degree

What is the best method of delivery for the majority of your patients? So just like with regular medications, we have different forms and modalities of administration. So we have Albuterol, which is an inhaler, which is quick-acting. We have steroids which are pills, which are long-acting. We also have steroid inhalers, which are short acting. So it's the same idea with cannabis. So in terms of inhaled, if you're gonna use a flower to inhale and preferably vape the flower. Which is non oil-based, that's for a quick method of delivery. So if you have acute pain, for cancer and chemo patients, you wanna address nausea and vomiting quickly. And that will address quickly. In terms of oils and sublingual tinctures, that takes about 45 minutes to an hour, to start being effective and lasts about four hours. In edibles, it can take up to two hours to take effect. So oftentimes people feel like it didn't work and so they take more and that's where we get into accidental overdoses that are non-lethal. People took a bite of a brownie or bite of chocolate. \"Didn't work so I'm gonna take more.\" That's the most common issue that we see. And that lasts anywhere from six hours to up to 48 hours, depending on how big a dose you took. So it's really what do you wanna get across? Or what do you wanna treat? I think that's really important information because when you do walk into a legal dispensary. As of now even in the legal states, I believe the bud tenders, in those dispensaries, aren't required to have a medical background or any sort of pharmaceutical background. So it's really kind of roulette in that respect to, as to what kind of advice you're going to get. That's absolutely right. So we need to start pushing both California and every state as they legalize, we need to start encouraging and demanding, that they require bud tender required education. Because those are our current interface right now with patients and consumers. And they are not required to have a high school education, they're not required to have a college education, they're not required to have any education right now. So, yes, I would encourage every single person here, to write to their Bureau of Cannabis Control, and tell them that, you know, \"We do need these types of bud tender level education.\" \"We do need this education in pharmacy schools.\" \"We do need this education in medical schools.\" And to close this out because we are out of time. I think there's a tendency in the country, the minute we legalize something, we assume that all methods of delivery are safe. Look, alcohol is legal in this country, but alcohol could be incredibly unsafe. Cannabis, we now know has so many potential benefits when used in the right population as a medicine. But it also can be either abused or as we've seen with this THC vaping crisis. It can, if taken inappropriately from the wrong source, it can kill you. And I think these are all topics to consider. I really appreciate the work that all three of you are doing to educate. Because it's all about education. So if you're gonna use, know why you're using it, know the best method of delivery and ask questions to the right people. And if you're not certain, this is where I actually applaud you Doctor Yafai, There are doctors out there now, who specialize in how to use cannabis appropriately and safely. Inquire, go talk to someone like a Doctor Yafai, who can give you unbiased advice so that you can do it safely and appropriately for your condition.", "ytbIuZLNjD4": "one topic of controversy is medical marijuana 12 News Gary Burton spoke with a local doctor on the matter and he has more a hot topic this election year and whether it should be on the ballot is medical marijuana the Mississippi State Board of Health has opposed this proposed ballot amendment I spoke to a local physician dr. timothy quinn and he says that some of his colleagues from other states where medical marijuana is allowed says that a lot of people are being helped by us having the ability to use that alternative medication it just gives us more ammunition to better help our patients Quinn tells me that medical marijuana has helped people with epilepsy bipolar anxiety and depression I've even learned that they've used it for a lot of our war veterans that have post-traumatic stress disorder so this has been very beneficial in these states one of the reasonings for the opposition of this proposal was that the mississippi state constitution amendment would allow the use of marijuana for a broad number of medical indications including such vague reasons as pain management which would possibly lead to addiction and abuse it is true that there is potential for the medical marijuana to be abused at the law passed but the deal is many medications are abused every day another reason stated is that routine marijuana consumption has numerous harms but dr.

everybody and we're going to be reviewing napalm cannabis company the grenade check that out man absolutely incredible um one of the most premium luxurious over the top above and beyond items in the entire cannabis industry this is the flex piece of all flex pieces in the pre-roll category can you guys can you guys zoom in on this real quick i want them i want them to see can you guys zoom in on this real quick check this out oh my gosh so today's item that we have is the blue tommies from uh the grenade xxl infused pre-roll seven grand premium indoor flower one gram live resin lift tickets rolling lift tickets infused rolling paper which is a live resin rolling paper have you ever tried that before it's incredible and then a ceramic tip it says the backpack boys times five points los angeles it's that elite [ __ ] man are you ready you put this in your hand feel the grenade in your hand feel that i've seen these for a while and i i did not think that i was going to smoke one so this is a this is a fun surprise and it's it's been quite a minute since i was actually intimidated by uh getting ready to consume intimidated is the word i do here it's intimidating i hear that from the bud tenders people are a little bit intimidated by the price point but when you talk about luxury items the best of the best the best some of the best flour exotic collaborations look at this grenade it's quite literally a grenade there's a pin there's this handle super cool i don't know if you guys can see this but they're the the uh the little fire emoji emblem that they have is right there on the glass it's it's insane so we're gonna jump right in we're going to keep it keep it consistent with the west coast we tour we're going to hit it once talk about it we're going to hit it twice we're going to give it a 4 out of 10. um you're supposed to smoke this all the way through we are going to put this out after a couple hits after we talk about it uh and then i'll dive in because no most people are gonna put this out unless they are fully prepared to smoke 200 which we might have to do it are you ready yeah all right let's let me let's let's let's get it rolling three and a half grams of flour how do i see you pull the pin you pull this out i don't i didn't pull if you have to pull yeah yeah very easily without the engineering packaging i'd be impressed oh yeah you just twisted them out that's pretty cool okay so we've got this eight gram monster here check this out you guys oh wait lift ticket paper that's it lift it we'll have to look that up wow it's gonna be dope it's gonna be dope i'm pretty excited all right you guys we got the torch i'm gonna massage it out just a little bit i do hear the general feedback is that these canoes so we will have to find out let's dry hit figure out dry head is smooth and creamy uh was there a strain oh the blue tummies all right here we go [Music] we got too much all right here we go nothing yet let's try to just try it with a little bit of a lighter all right so i can tell you right off the bat it's tough to hit the airflow is really good on it though it's not like it's too tight it's nothing to do with that i definitely rips through super nice that ceramic tip that's the nicest mouthpiece on anything i've ever smoked without a doubt it's very easy to rip the flavor is super creamy tiny little bit of gas and i'm getting a tiny little bit of berry like tiny little bits of like blueberry or maybe blackberry or whatever it is i don't know just berries so [ __ ] curious right it's pretty heavy it's large a lot of flavor to it when it comes to the flour again it's the blue tommies you got one gram of live resin the lift ticket infused rolling paper and the ceramic tip super delicious product i'm not sure as to the genetics of the blue tommies i'm not sure on the tripping profile on that i do wish that was included on here um the lift ticket information would love would love to know the stream for the live resin on that but we could probably look this up on their instagram or something um overall i think it's a delicious experience super heavy definitely like you mentioned the weight it's a solid super solid the the branding and the product appeal off the charts um this group napalm with exhibit you know they just really went above and beyond to deliver truly a premium experience kind of redefining the pre-roll category it is a pre-roll joint rolling papers infused rolling papers live resin seven grand premium indoor flower and it rips we did hear rumors of it kind of canoeing on some people at least i've heard that from multiple sources uh but this is honestly smoking pretty much perfectly yeah i'm um i'm actually impressed by how it smokes because that's how you light it though well definitely how you light it's going to control a lot of it but in terms of i thought it would be like an overpowering smoke yeah that it would really hit not harsh no not at all no like it actually i guess delicious the amount of wheat in there does a nice job of filtering the smoke as it comes down yeah absolutely um yeah i think that ceramic tip too super smooth just to just like i wonder what else could you re-roll with the ceramic tip though i think i'm definitely going to keep this running tip i'm going to see if we're able to kind of clean it and reuse it i don't know about my rolling abilities to roll another one i don't think i have it in me to roll any grammar that's for sure that's the i mean for for me with the the packaging i love this because it's that this is the child resistance resistant piece um i'd be curious as to how airtight it is i'm sure it's pretty airtight but you could put weed in here oh yeah definitely reuse it here just to show the people to reuse this as as the stash jar for your weed uh a great grenade glass and you guys can see the flame right there on the front and that's not just like a random jar that they got repurposed they had to get this jar custom-made that's dope that i i'm usually gonna look for for reasons to to dislike packaging for for waste related reasons but this is cool enough to keep so it goes into that category you can do a lot with this not just put weed in it like it's a do you have a tournament or some [ __ ] do you have a score in mind out of 10 for this review because i am extremely impressed with this the price obviously you know it's a product in its own category on the on the category i'm gonna from for my sport it's gonna be relative to other pre-rolls uh and i'm not gonna consider cost because you know when you're when you're getting a piece like that that's getting that [ __ ] piece yeah yeah um and for that reason i'm going to give that a eight eight five eight point five eight point five on it okay i'm surprised myself that i would give it that type of score with again this is without knowing much about the flower but in terms of the harshness of the smoke blue tommy's flower seven grand premium indoor from the backpack boys is that bay area hype [ __ ] right is [Music] i think i think backpack boys are la boys is is bae oh so i'm confusing the two i i might be confusing the two this is let us know we don't know this is that but like no i think i think that that's an la outfit i [ __ ] i'll [ __ ] with it man i think this is some of the best the best i've smoked the lyric hannah gars i've smoked i've smoked 10 of those zero cannagars the biggest of the biggest the ounces the small 12 grammers the small ones the the the seven grammars i believe is what uh the smallest one i think some something like that this is incredible here's here's what i'll say about this so she's probably my my highest cost on a quarterly to perhaps buy monthly occasion i would pay retail for this that's impressive that that's uh for the writing for the right occasion for the right group for the right reason to to celebrate this is a nice piece for that my score out of 10 out of 100 i'll respect my recent website i'm coming in at 9.2 and it's the same issues that i typically have would love to know more about the genetics we'd love to have a terpene profile on there it just really helps to cement the the experience you're about to have as a consumer as a customer we're paying good money for for just weed in general at this point and the consumer we want to know what we're about to experience flavor wise taste wise high wise and i know that can sometimes be a lot to ask for but there's so much going on on this product and there's a nice beautiful empty space in the back of the tag that it would have been huge maybe that's where they put like the sticker in the testing results well but there's two spots one one we could go qr code on there yeah i'm always with a qr code i'm looking at this and you could have they could put a nice insert in here yeah yeah because all that's sitting in there is the is the piece which you don't need to see anyway i mean i couldn't really tell what it looked like until i took it out anyway and i couldn't even add to the allure perhaps this is a free game for dave paul and for any packaging people or branding people creating a surprise when the product comes out that's a nice little uh endorphin rush for the consumer it's going to be memorable for that experience but also to so fill this with information about perhaps the farmer or the medium that it's grown in or the history of the company the people that are involved anything that you can associate to the story yeah yeah yeah i think that's fair too so like i said you know 9.25 for me more information on the story more information on the terpenes and the genetics and to them to me it's a perfect product regardless of the price point i think this is something that i would pay the money that for a couple times a year you know either as gifts or for myself uh i thoroughly enjoy it experience in itself the overall potency of this [ __ ] it's all fire it all tastes really good yeah i would uh i would love to find reasons to to hate on it but as it goes well we'll let you guys do the hating make sure you all type in respectmyregion.com let's go

is David Moadel thank you looking at welcome to looking at the markets with David Moadel there's one mistake that a lot of marijuana traders and investors are making or might make and I want to try to prevent you from doing that the mistake really is treating marijuana stocks as a very long-term buy-and-hold investment especially if you're thinking about putting a lot or a large percentage of your trading or investing account into marijuana stocks and just leaving it there for years or decades or something like that that's not I I cannot make recommendations and I cannot tell you what to do but that's not something that I personally would do and let's take a look at a few of the charts here to give you some examples this is a TMP and you'll notice that all the stocks i'm going to show you today are in the marijuana industry and they all peeked in 2014 because it was a very exciting year for the marijuana industry in 2014 HD MP as you can see peaked in 2014 at let's say a dollar according to google finance here it peaked at a dollar 83 share and if you had bought here or anywhere close to that price and held on you wouldn't be doing too well it's now about 44 cents per share used to be a dollar 83 share so that's a pretty devastating loss couldn't go back up sure but if you bought it near the top or anywhere even if you had bought it at any of these Peaks if you bought it this peak or this peak or or anywhere around here even it's so much lower now it would need to come up quite a bit like a miracle would have to happen practically for it to come back to a dollar 83 share so as a buy-and-hold investment if you had bought it anywhere around here and held on you wouldn't be doing too well here's VA PE another marijuana stock and again peaked in 2014 at according to google finance peaked at 2994 share almost thirty dollars a share now it's about 2 cents a share so if you bought it anywhere around here or even around here you wouldn't be doing too well at all that's pretty devastating loss could come back up to this level again it could or might not and how long would it take to get there if it even does this is CNN general cannabis Corp and again peak in 2014 according to google finance peaked in 2014 at thirty-five dollars and seventy-five cents a share now it's trading at a little bit above three dollars a share three dollars 33 cents a share pretty devastating loss if you had bought and held and here's another one MJ md meta-gene holdings inc and peaked again 2014 according to google finance I don't know how accurate this is but here it says it peaked at 14,300 dollars a share if that's accurate I don't know but if it's even close to that and now it's two dollars twenty-five cents a share if you had bought anywhere in this area then that would be devastating to your trading or trading or investing account that would be terrible so that this is why and again it could come up but do you really think it's going to come up back to here anytime soon i can count on that that's not something that I'm counting on so i recommend being nimble may you know marijuana stocks treat them as short or possibly medium term term traits be nimble

billion five people on the planet have Langerhans cell sarcoma what's that there's not a lot of research into it so I'm not too sure on what it is it's it's very confusing yeah so that should treatment you were facing that the doctors recommended was a bone-marrow transplant yeah it was extensive chemo radiotherapy and then yeah and then bone marrow transplant and you didn't have just one transplant this was three that you had to have and and how did you get on with that well they failed until the first free yeah they were not - it's not too trouble so it's not it's not a big problem to have and then after that this isn't as a mum because he then really began to suffer ya have to watch himself and how bad was it um well after the fourth transplant they told us that you know the first three had failed and and literally all they had was one more chance for him they had one more bag of his own cells no more they were there you know they'd stress the the the thing to us that there was no more chances after this and and unfortunately three days after he had his final transplant he tracked his fingers down side of the bed and then picked up some infections now obviously infections with no immune system whatsoever and no way for an immune system to even even start to build within his body he was literally being kept alive by antibiotics that's what they told us he did get incredibly ill throughout his whole treatment he'd been very happy and smiley and he'd always been tried to be quite jovial but actually those last those last couple of months are very very difficult he was in a lot of pain you would given I think three days three days a week at most is what they told me when I asked him the the timescale you planned your funeral haven't you yeah to what extent all of it we're gonna do it was gonna be fancy dress and I'd chosen all the costumes for people and it was gonna be quite embarrassing for some of the people though yeah who actually said you want you wanted to go yeah I did he was looking forward to it after four years of treatment it's enough enough was enough so this story then takes at him yeah entirely different turn how did that happen through lots of research I've done lots of research on to see when his secondary cancer arrived and it was so unknown I then said I turned to the internet inside looking and and over the over the following months and couple of years afterwards cannabis just kept popping up people kept emailing me you need to try this you need to nice if he hasn't got cancer you know the cancers have gone this is now a completely different issue it won't work for him is no but I would dismiss it and dismiss it and actually came to the point where I was in hospital with Darren and he was so incredibly ill and really on a high dose of morphine he was actually now on fentanyl which they can't go any further than that and it wasn't working against his hand and and the other issues he had with his stomach and I asked the doctor for bedrock on which is a cannabis based pain relief so it's available in Europe and because I've done I didn't you know I don't know I wanted to go through the proper measures and she actually told me we can't because it hasn't been licensed for children so you know and and more of it came out but people just kept saying and I thought you know what what to lose and you've got nothing nothing nothing to lose it that's dying anyway you know so they just rejoin your antibiotics at this point there was no other treatment so you took this yeah and you asked him and you said yeah yeah I was happy to what did you notice how quickly to think oh my god I mean I honestly do the effect of it blew my mind it wasn't what I expected all I expected too it's done live a research and some people use cannabis to kind of alleviate their anxiety and and some pain and that's what Devin was really experiencing on day 17 when they said there's definitely nothing in his bone marrow there's nothing there you've now just got to wait seven got very anxious and said well how much longer do I have to wait they started to trying up the morphine introduced sleeping tablets and so that's when I actually gave it and within half an hour's hours it administered under the tongue sublingually it's just a tincture it's it's it's not the oil that people talk about it was just a teenager then what we know it's within half an hour to an hour but he was just chilled out he just relaxed the anxiety stopped he no longer was panicking and he was able to just he was able to be compas mentis which he wasn't able to be on the belly always the health-wise I mean actually things being tested against you your white blood cells began to go up yeah after five days or C they told us nothing in his bone marrow so gave it to him five days later when the bandages came off his hand and we saw a healthy fingers which we were told there was no way they were under there when we saw a healthy finger see the doctor started panicking this was now based 75 after the transplant and he was then Tony be there for three three days yeah and nobody has ever engrafted after fifty days so day 75 and all of a sudden his white count has appeared the doctors start running around frantically doctors from Bristol Children's Hospital were called in to do some more blood tests which I said well there's no point you told me on your week ago there's nothing there and obviously in the blood count it was there it's very small but it was there and to test the theory you actually withdrew the cannabis after a little while and the blood count started to go down okay so where are you now how are you now perfectly healthy I'm glad you're normal you stress this is this is this doesn't work for everybody this is not a cure no this is something that worked for you and you could be prosecuted let's be honest well the under current laws in England the world's cannabis is not registered as having any therapeutic value anyone using the drug if medical reasons could be charged for possession possession carrying a maximum sentence of five years in jail or an unlimited fine fascinating story it was so happy that you're here and healthy good luck with the diner he wants to he wants to open his own vegan American an apprenticeship as a chef then you know please who would not want to

risks is overdue that's the topic of this week's healthcare triage [Music] last year the National Academies of Sciences medicine and engineering released a comprehensive report on cannabis use at almost 400 pages long it reviewed both potential benefits and harms we've talked about benefits before let's focus on the harms cancer the greatest concern with tobacco smoking is cancer so it's reasonable to start there with pot smoking a 2005 systematic review in the International Journal of cancer pooled the results of six case control studies no association was found between smoking marijuana and lung cancer another 2015 systematic review pooled nine case control studies and could find no link to header neck cancers another meta-analysis of three case control studies of testicular cancer found a statistically significant link between heavier pot smoking and one type of testicular cancer but this evidence was judged to be limited because of limitations and the research all of which was from the 1990s there's no evidence or not enough to say of the link between pot use and esophageal cancer prostate cancer cervical cancer non-hodgkins lymphoma penile cancer or bladder cancer there's almost no evidence or not enough to say that pot has any effect on sperm or eggs that could increase the risk of cancer and any children of pot smokers using marijuana while pregnant does pose other risks as we'll discuss in a few minutes heart disease another major risk with cigarettes heart disease isn't clearly seen with pot smoking only two studies quantified the risk between marijuana use and heart attacks one found no relationship at all and the other found that pot smoking may be a trigger for a heart attack in the hour after smoking but this finding was based on nine patients and may not be generalizable lung function it also makes sense to think about the risk of respiratory disease in the short-term after smoking pot a 2007 systematic review found lung function actually improved but these benefits were completely overtaken by evidence that lung function may degrade with chronic use lung function however is a laboratory measure and not necessarily a clinical outcome and what we really care about is lung disease once you control for tobacco use the links between marijuana and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease appear minimal almost no evidence is available to link pot used to asthma impaired driving driving while impaired is a major cause of injury and death in the United States six systematic reviews were considered a fair or good quality by the National Academies and the most recent one pulled three of the others it contained evidence from 21 studies in 13 countries representing almost 240,000 participants for people who reported marijuana use or had THC detected through testing the odds of being involved in a motor vehicle accident increased by twenty to thirty percent to study them this is of course a relative increase and shouldn't be confused with the overall percentage of getting in a car accident which is much smaller regardless driving while impaired is a terrible idea although we have good tests to determine two people are under the influence of alcohol no such tests are currently available for marijuana making enforcement more difficult we did a whole episode on pregnancy effects babies born to women who smoke pot during pregnancy are more likely to be underweight delivered premature and admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit according to a 2016 systematic review but there were no links seen for changes in birth lengths head circumference or congenital malformations there's limited evidence for pregnancy complications for mothers and there's not enough evidence to come in on much else about babies and their outcomes memory and concentration there's moderate evidence from many studies that learning memory and attention can be impaired in the 24 hours after marijuana use there's limited evidence however that this translates into worse outcomes in academic achievement employment income or social functioning or that these effects linger after the pots worn off mental health the possible relationship between marijuana use and mental health is complicated the most recent meta-analysis found that there's a significant connection between heavy marijuana use and a diagnosis of psychosis specifically schizophrenia this mirrored the findings of previous reviews that sought to cover only high quality studies another systematic review highlighted a potentially small but statistically significant link between marijuana use in the development of bipolar disorder heavy users of pot are also more likely to say they have suicidal thoughts what makes this complicated is that it's hard to establish the arrow of causality are people who smoke pot more likely to develop mental health problems or people with mental health problems more likely to smoke pot there's a similar issue when talking about the relationship between using pot and other substances so I'm able see marijuana as a gateway drug leading to other substance user abuse but others and a lot of research see this only as a correlation in which people who are likely to use or abuse substances are more likely to use pot as well secondhand smoke has states legalize the drug for general use more cannabis users feel freed from secrecy they smoke more in public raising worries about secondhand smoke a two-year old study made news recently by arguing that one minute of exposure to pot smoke impaired how vessels responded to blood flow for at least 90 minutes a greater impairment than seen from tobacco this was a study in rats though not of humans out in the world as for the risk of a contact eye the amount of THC detectable in secondhand smoke is negligible almost everyone agrees that children should not use pot but concerns are legitimately raised about whether children might have increased exposure or access after legalization although this issue has not been studied widely it's possible that pot the THC and the metabolites from smoke could have an effect in the developing brains of children these concerns are more applicable to adolescents who use pot regularly however not the accidental ingestion reported in the news once in a while new questions almost all the harms the medical literature focuses on involves smoked cannabis we know little to nothing about edibles and other means of administration nor do we have any consistent manner of measuring the level of exposure bottom line you gotta weigh the pros and cons many of the harms we've discussed are statistically significant and yet they're of questionable significance almost all the increased risks are relative risks the absolute or overall risks are often quite low we haven't focused on the potential benefits especially medical ones here but many people use pot even rationally for benefits they perceive to be greater than the harms we've listed we unquestionably need more research and more evidence of harms may emerge but it's important to note that the harms we know about now are practically nil compared to that of many other drugs and that marijuana's effects are clearly less harmful than those associated with tobacco or alcohol abuse people who choose to use marijuana now that it's easier to do so legally will need to weigh the pros and cons for themselves the electus show really helps if you subscribe or like us right down there well we've got you another good way

by their smell you can actually is what what is this right here right over here this is going to be the entrance part where customers can see some of the products before they come up to the registers it is going to have out the door pricing decide include tax corrects okay not just anybody can walk in you do have to be 21 and over with a valid ID it can be out of state but it has to be valid or government-issued I should say what do we see right here so right over here is going to be the vape section this is going to be the we have the pins that have the oil of THC in them these ones are meant to be more discreet while you're consuming a little bit more high potency as well in these now I don't see I don't see flour so yeah we do not display any flour out in the area out here it's all gonna be behind the counters with my bud tenders oh okay yeah what do we have here those look like Girl Scout cookies so these are gonna be our edibles these are the cookies it's gonna be a hundred milligrams max to where each cookie is ten milligrams of THC you could also find edibles that have CBD and THC nm it goes down to like the chocolate bars two gummies all the good stuff so a lot of the baked goods okay and what about what's in these down here so these are gonna be our flower so when a customer comes up and asks for in hate should we package everything in eighths so usually they'll come in and ask for an eighth so we'll get it pop it open let them smell it look at it we just ask no fingers I'm asking a really stupid question that smells like marijuana too I mean can you tell the strains apart by their smell you can actually yes so people will come in and ask for something that tastes like citrusy or sweet or like diesel or gas so we can definitely you know grab something and show it to them and it's to their liking so everything has a different scent to it what are these those are gonna be our pre-rolls those are going to be strains that we just got from our new outdoor grow called los sue\u00f1os farms so they send us tons of their pre-rolls from out there you see pre-rolls so these are gonna be some joints so it's already rolled up ready to go you just got to light it and enjoy it I'm just curious what was one of those peoples go through um so these are gonna be about 750 pre-tax but after-tax $10 okay now list people think oh Colorado's legal it's wide open it's crazy you guys are now really tightly controlled industry so you you a store like this has a lot of oh yes so just making sure to double check those IDs and make sure they're of H make sure they're not expired also to making sure that they only purchase their limit and make sure they don't like I said over purchase more than an ounce on the recreational side you can take debit cards correct so debit only no credit okay that's kind of a new revolutionary thing that you can actually take any kind of plastic right correct it is very new we started doing it here it's considered a cashless ATM is what it is so we've been doing it now for about a year so is that gonna really change things for you to no longer have to be a hundred percent cash yes it is everything in this building has to be produced in Colorado correct yeah nothing can leave the state borders nothing could come in so first it starts with the supply and then it goes through extraction unless it's sold as flour and then from the extraction they make products right those are your edibles your tinctures your gummies your chatter and Wow and then from there it gets transferred to dispensary when you make where you make the cell so that's important to note nothing can be produced outside the state of Colorado and cross the line into it correct nothing inside or outside and that's because of the federal law absolutely okay now cross the state borders [Music]", "YVAa20j5CRU": "ayyyy YouTube Alex here back again with another quick video had to hit a prize this morning Friday January 3rd I hit a prize Irie boom boom boom grab a few things today but only one that I'm doing a review of right now I grabbed sour banana sherbert cartridge at liquid live present cartridge sour banana sherbert right there I also grabbed brownie Scout this is called brownie Scout by rhythm 34 percent THC I'm not doing that either and I grabbed another blueberry headband and I also grabbed this is what I'm doing the review up by oh Jesus butter by Cresco right there it's the bio Jesus butter by Cresco you see those stats to kind of small right there yeah let me get you open this up here not let you get a look at the what the wax looks like and I'll do a dab of it to different lens if I seem like I'm a little bit further back it's because I have the 50 millimeter 1.8 lens on my camera I wanted to try it out see how it looked different perspective you know I like doing different perspectives and stuff so this is back in my original spot in my chair in the living room and let me do a dab of this buy of Jesus I paid it I paid 65 bucks for the gram of the spy oh jesus not too bad for the gram of the Bible Jesus for 65 paid 70 for that blueberry headband again that stuff was good for 70 it's worth it nice bye oh Jesus that's looking real nice that's the bye oh Jesus butter live butter by Cresco very nice-looking very nice smell it smells amazing this is the bye oh Jesus let me do a dab of this you know what you know what I think of the bio Jesus of butter by Cresco don't some in two puffs go to throw a little in the puffs go also the first I want to bang a dab at this with you guys let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section this bio Jesus is coming in at 81 percent THC eighty one point four five nine and then THC is like one point zero five three so it's like 82 percent probably right around there THC not bad for bio Jesus now I have had violent Jesus and a cartridge before co2 cartridge but I've never had bio Jesus and abs and I did have bio Jesus and flour before which was pretty good it was okay didn't have much of a taste to it dull and lack of terpene profile the reason I bought this one here was this was only 65 bucks and the but tender pointed it out that they just got it in last night he said hey man you know we got five of Jesus in for $65 a gram I say hey man let me get one I was gonna grab jet fuel by rhythm but that was 84 the gram so when I saw up ahead by of Jesus for 65 that just came in they just brought it out this morning I was like let me get one of those instead about jet fuel but then I grabbed another because this is only 70 for the cured resin 93.2% cured resin for the blueberry headband and this flower here which is going to be pretty good that brownie Scout in that cartridge that sour banana sherbert cartridge which I paid for yeah I dropped about he see it was 235 I think I had $10 worth of credits so spent 235 the eighth was 55 this grand was 70 the cartridge was 55 and that Graham was 65 for the buy of Jesus yeah 235 bucks hopefully I can make this last me for a couple couple weeks I'll try to ration it out but I be smoking some stuff up and to had to leave so I really gotta ration this out so it's not set my timer I'm probably gonna have to go in a little early cuz I just a couple seconds there because of that little delay I did I was reading a text message yeah let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section let me know what you think about this new 50 millimeter lens they said I am a little bit away from the camera now the camera is probably 2 or 3 feet from me normally the camera would be really close and I would have the wide-angle view but the cameras like real close to me with this way it's not so much of a wide angle but the picture quality should be a lot better on this video than the other ones alright Cheers bye oh Jesus that's nice it's got a nice um earthy floral kind of flavor with a little bit of a sweetness to it very pleasant very pleasant I like that a lot bye oh Jesus by Cresco yeah smells fantastic I am going to throw a little bit up in the puff go got to clean it out though darn it so I'm not gonna throw it in puff coat just yet I'll do another dab real quick oh yeah man that's nice this is an indica yeah I bought I bought hype this is a hybrid cartridge this is a hybrid this but a blueberry headband this is an indica to buy oh Jesus I know it's first thing in the morning it's uh what is it almost ten o'clock quarter to 10:00 and I'm doing dabs of buy of Jesus like I told you before if you're a veteran smoker and you've been smoking for a long time now you know it depends on what you want I want to relax so by Allah Jesus is good but if I wanted to be uplifted and uplifting then I would get a sativa like I said I was gonna grab the sativa the jet fuel the only reason I grabbed the bio Jesus is because it was $15 cheaper for the bio of Jesus and the THC content was exactly the same eighty one percent so 15 bucks is 15 bucks you know I mean this brownie scale was 55 cuz it's the rough cut they have rough cut and premium but the brownie Scout this was thirty four point eight percent THC love you'll be able to see it on the box this is real small 34 point zero seven nine yeah powerful stuff I don't know if I'm gonna do a review on that now I got all this stuff but the blueberry headband I'm not has already did a review I might do a review on that cartridge yeah very tasty Jesus mm-hmm mr. bio Jesus the box there's the stats see the stats there there we go I had a touch on it to focus right there yeah Cresco live butter by oh Jesus oh you guys have a great day peace I'm out", "NLRgAVod3kQ": "well it's about that time again time for another spin of the bangle of buds here we got two delta nines on here we got the palmetto under the other shred the tropic thunder shuffling up here here we go come on headband give me that headband [Music] oh apple fritter delta nine that's a nice exciting one i'll try that here it is delta nine fresher new on ocs apple fritter it's a hybrid and we got what's the percent ooh 21.46 percent that's nice it's a package to eat on here looks like november the 23rd so about a month ago that's all right that sounds like there's a big butt in there and maybe some small ones anyways though i'm very excited i've been waiting for this delta 9 to show up for a while because they have a bunch of strains that are really cool sounding and they're new on ocs so that's really cool anyways first thing though we gotta check out is the scale make sure it's all calibrated perfectly so you can check it with a 50.00 gram weight and we got perfect there 50.00 so yeah all ready for this apple fritter so on ocs this stuff here is pretty good price for something so new 3.5 of this is only 24. so it's freaking awesome anyway so we're all ready to check it out here so uh let me just zero this and now it's time for apple fritter from delta nine and apple fritter's actually one of my favorite kind of donuts so i'm really hoping it tastes like a donut apple fritter holy fuck this thing is hard to open wow these are really weird containers if you push it down too much you can't open it if you don't push it enough you can't open it you gotta push it the right amount anyway oh yeah hey [Music] oh wow that is a nice smell that's very nice hmm that's awesome what a nice smell this kind of have a little bit of an apple to it maybe here we go let's see come on delta nine impress me so close delta nine is there any more in there fuck it's just underweight by 0.01 wait a minute did it get over no it didn't i thought it did but that was just the air no so it's just under it's as small of just under as you can possibly be there we go look there's a couple little scraps in there little bits and we got these four tiny ones this small one that's medium one and this other medium one wow does it ever look nice though look at that look at the cool purples and all that stuff and i can't wait to check this out with a microscope very cool anyways let's check it out with a microscope so this is the outside of the apple fritter and it is nice looking very nice looking it's almost got a nice glaze on it like an actual apple fritter a donut which i love um [Music] [Laughter] it looks really awesome i love the purple man that looks so cool that almost looks like a black leaf right there might be like black mamba or something that's one another one of my favorite strains black mamba i was had that long time ago so good yes here we go some more close-ups here of uh these things see there's like they kind of look kind of old all crinkly and stuff but you know whatever it smells nice this stuff so um delta nine's been around for a long time it just recently showed up in ontario so the weed here is probably not super new it's probably just packaged recently who knows though it looks decent looks good yeah so maybe i'll break open this one here and uh we'll we'll see what it looks like and um we'll see what it looks like when i break it open here we go wow nice hard hard nuggets so here's a look inside these things looking pretty good look at that look at all the tricoms they're clear mostly on the inside some more looks so cool looks so cool look at that wow there we go got some nice close-ups here on these guys oh my god look at these guys look at that that's so cool looking yeah the inside mostly clear the outside mostly cloudy very nice looking very nice smelling so awesome anyways i'm gonna go and try this out now i can't wait i love apple fritters and i've been waiting so long for this delta nine stuff to show up so i'm gonna go check this out and i'll be right back so i just got in from this delta nine apple fritter at 20 what was it 21.46 percent and um i can't believe it but this stuff actually does taste like apples or have like an apple sort of taste to it um it's kind of like i couldn't figure out what type of apple it was either i was like i was kind of leaning towards granny smith but at the same time it's a little different it doesn't have that same little sourness to it or whatever but um it kind of reminds me of like apples but also at the same time apple trees it's kind of like the smell that you have uh when you're uh in an apple orchard picking apples so i'm just freaking crazy that it tastes like apples i can't believe it i didn't quite get the fritter but i got the apple part yeah anyways wow impressive taste as for the high on here though it says 21.46 but it sure doesn't feel like it's quite a low sort of between low and medium the high on here it's a little disappointing in that area so the buds are real nice they're like really super hard see [Laughter] and they uh they sure look nice this one here in that one breaks up decent and uh yeah it's not overly dry it's not wet it's not super dry it's good but at the same time high is just a little disappointing so i don't know i think i might if would i buy this again probably not but um i'm not saying it's bad because i i've i'm really impressed by the taste uh it's just that it doesn't quite get where i want to go it's not powerful enough for what i want which is unfortunate because i wish it was if it was i would buy this a lot because the taste is so cool and it looks so nice it's just too light for me anyways what is there like three more things on the uh the bangle of buds so come check it out there if you want uh hit the subscribe button and the notification bell and they'll send you a message when the next

market is a government controlled market so governments get a say too and Scott's been here with us this morning taking a look at how the government is setting the price and this is really important Scott because we've been talking about a nips us Reed poll that found for 40% of Canadians whether they buy legal pot or black-market pot it's determined by price it's so interesting and let's not forget this is a market that already exists out there and the government is coming in to want to take over that and get rid of the black market and it comes down to price for many people as you mentioned so how does Bill Morneau he's our finance minister he set the prices so-called sweet price we are the sweet spot we've been talking about it anywhere between 10 and 12 dollars a gram for pot so how does he arrive at that and how is that gonna compete with about black market that's what we're looking at this morning but here's some some numbers behind how we arrived at that sweet spot or at least how Ottawa does this is based on eight dollars a gram what Ottawa is expected to pay to suppliers canopy growth for example saying they can supply any round that's seven dollars and 50 cents a gram there's a dollar exercise tax on that similar to an alcohol taxes syntax if you will federally they plan to keep about a quarter of the revenue that's capped at a hundred million dollars with the rest three quarters of the expected four hundred million dollars in revenue to go to the provinces so the if in provinces you pay sales tax it gst/hst if you pay it into promises that works out to $1.29 now again that's an average and if we look at the provincial breakdown a lot of the provinces have not announced what the pricing structure will be Nova Scotia has and they have three different brands to offer and we're expecting that to be a bit of a template across the country they have value brand a core brand and a premium brand priced between 633 gram and 15 dollars depending on the quality that people want and the THC levels they're anywhere between two and twenty four percent so lots of interesting depending on that or that's one of the factors that determines the price I guess so that's what the government is pricing in order to attract people away from black market dealers but the black market deal we're learning this morning they're adjusting they're entrenched they have a supply chain already they know what the production costs are they have customers there and they're not going to want to give them up and we're seeing overnight in Quebec from price of weed calm that dealers charging their in between three and five dollars a gram and so that is plummeting we're also looking at stats Canada as far as them taking an inventory of Canadians across the country what the average price per gram what Canadians are self reporting and that it works out to six dollars and 79 cents a gram on average now the big players as well I've been looking at the markets and some of the I don't want to mention them by name but they are in the neighborhood and we're lots of there's lots of economists coming in now MBA types and they're looking at if you cannot produce pot for less of one dollar a gram as a company you could be dead in the water or you could be amalgamated so if that's a potential of $28 for an ounce of pot from the corporation's going forward what is that going to do to that $10 sweet spot is it going to come down to compete even more dramatically with the black markets so that'll be an interesting I want absolutely will we were learning this morning more than 135 publicly traded pot companies in Canada but the projection is as you said there may be only a half a dozen or so a handful left in time if they're if they fail if they're bought up yeah and that's good good for their pricing as well I think of it now is the Wild West and that's you we're gonna see some paring down they can't compete or they get taken over by the others", "PWRlTdwZbFY":

at a few of its seeds after all you only look at the seeds don't you that's what you bought them for so we did some research as to why you may have found the seeds of each strain so enticing and decided that it must have been on their potential potential that is if you accidentally happen to drop one of the seeds into a pot of nutrient rich and moist soil that is located in a warm place under a light bulb and that was also located in a well ventilated place so where shall we begin at number 10 on the list you voted for train wreck though starting out with a train wreck may not seem such a smart move especially if you enjoy travel this one's popular because of the powerful high and few negative side effects it seems to have a reputation for generating creativity and many comment that it has helped migraines general pain and arthritis gelato comes in at number nine with a word of caution for the uninitiated as this has a powerful hit physical relaxation seems to be the overarching theme while the ability to still function normally is a definite upside sitting at number eight on the list star dog is a winner with those of you who are looking for a good thc level at around 20 percent you guys seem to feel that this is a good choice for those of you suffering from fatigue stress or anxiety at number seven future one seems to hit the mark with those of you who are looking for something that leaves you feeling seriously relaxed apparently also helping to reduce feelings of depression a few of you mentioned the word chocolate and not just because of an attack of the munchies on to number six we have amnesia haze so how did it get its name maybe because it's high in thc and low in cpd levels the citrusy notes seem to go down well with you as does the boost of energy that gets delivered northern lights seems to be another popular choice with you and enters the list at number five perhaps because of its potential to reduce stress and counteract sleeplessness the slightly lower thc level makes this one more sophorific and more likely to create a feeling of blissfulness we're beginning to detect a theme here as this is another great strain that apparently induces a great feeling of being relaxed and happy rumor has it that this plant will also flower after just 45 days which is pretty quick in our opinion so maybe a good variety for those of you who are impatient girl scout cookies makes it comfortably onto the list at number four thanks to its ability to help users deal with pain while providing a full bodied hit of relaxation and mind-bending euphoria at number three we have gorilla glue also known as gg4 which has won many awards across the globe and has clearly been a big hit with you as well this is one of those highly potent strains that helps to deliver a thumping dose of euphoria and relaxation which will leave you feeling glued to whatever you are sitting or lying on bruce banner is near the top of our list at number two and works quickly with a heavy hit and then settles down into a euphoric and creative buzz it also seems to be popular with daytime users before we move on to the coveted top spot voted for by you it would only be right to mention a few honorable entries sour diesel didn't quite make it on the list but deserves a mention through its ability to make users feel uplifted euphoric and generally happy while still feeling full of energy your comments also indicated potential for helping with stress and depression we also couldn't completely leave out ghost train haze primarily because of the reports of its inducing a strong sense of creativity and ability to still concentrate heavily some of you also mentioned about its possible help with pain and depression but those prone to anxiety should give this one a pass so back to it and the clear winner is wait for it wedding cake an unforgettable journey into the land of delight begins with a single taste of this indica dominant super potent fiend of a strain its family line oozes sweet and sour earthy scents with unmistakable vanilla aromas and old skunky undertones it would seem that this one delivers the strongest high followed by a deep and overwhelming sense of relaxation now isn't that what many of us are looking for apart from loose change down the back of the sofa and there you have it and we do hope you've enjoyed this video and

are here with another video today we are talking about TAC capsules I want to talk about one set of capsules here I tried first which is by a company called one origin and these capsules as I showed you in a previous video those that saw it are green these are ten milligrams each there's no CBD you get ten pills in a bottle now there are these 1:1 capsules they look like this you get seven in the bottle and you know each one is gonna have CBD and THC in it and it says right on here the serving size is fifteen point three nine milligrams so these are completely two separate companies one origin and Wellsprings fields which was originally known for making the first concentrates wife's concentrates in Ohio but now is making capsules as well they also make caramels I haven't tried those but definitely a good company comparisons well with the THC only capsules I did notice two onset within about 30 to 40 minutes of taking it and it did help me with my voice I was able to talk a lot even though I'm still dealing with the healing of my tumor being removed it did help me with talking I had some pain relief but it wasn't you know overwhelming pain relief experience even after taking two pills in one day in about eight hour period now as far as the Wellsprings one one product i started today will just take one and I'm still feeling the effects of it I took it at 11:08 ATM and that is now 1:00 p.m. and so I still have felt the effects of this product and I haven't needed to take any other medical marijuana products at this time so right now if I had him you know comparing them I would say that obviously the one-to-one is gonna be stronger in CBD since the other product had no CBD and to go over that again to see medium amount in this product is eighty nine point one one milligrams the total THC in this product is 107 milligrams and this product the total TAC reach pill was ten point five two milligrams so like I said for me I think it's important to add CBD into our medication routine so I'm gonna probably be more into these than I am to these although idea like the effect of these so like I say if you are already used to medicating with CBD an tac I would recommend this one if you like that but also I'm not gonna exclude you from trying this one if you just want to try pure THC so I'm kind of on the fence I think this one's a little bit better because he dose is stronger and you have the CBD with it but like I said you could always take two of these and that would be 20 milligrams of THC and that's pretty good amount to medicate with for first time if you if you've already been used to doing edibles and everything else pills work a little bit differently because you're swallowing it and then it goes down into your digestive tract and it solves down inside your body where it edible is you're needing them and chewing them first and some of that's get into your saliva and everything else so for me comparison wise compared to eating gummies I would say that I definitely got a more even stronger effect than I normally get when just taking and a de Bourgh got me or something like that so I recommend both products but I more strongly recommend this one if you want to add CBD if you're looking for CBD you're gonna want this one but you only get seven if you get this one you're getting no CBD and you're getting 10 of these price-wise this is $50 this is $40 I think this is a little might be a little bit more than 50 like 55 so it might have a tax so these were cheaper but the ones without TAC were cheaper if you wanted to take away so with that I'll go ahead and go [ __ ] boy anthing Mohawk campus live make sure your life subscribe you can also donate to my GoFundMe if they hit link in the description thank you for your support please [Music]", "p62i-lwAn8o": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4/20 here today I'm going to be opening my latest haul from true leaf Panama City Beach dispensary location let's see what we got we've got some 9 pound hammer Rosen man 83.5% TCA and 3.1 percent of THC for a grand total of eighty eight point six and we've got some co2 oil this one we have a Skywalker og and this one gorillas grapes will see the Skywalker og eighty point three percent THC an eighty percent THC on a gorilla grapes last but definitely also least is the I got a little syringe warmer because you know I've been using hot water and all kinds of stuff like that for a long time and I just figured I'd give it a try seems like it might be more convenient let's take a look at the total here they actually forgot to put the warmer on the first time I use my trigger points they let me stack it for twenty percent this time that's the first time I've ever had them do that I don't know if that's a new thing or what but I was allowed to get twenty percent discount from my true liver points and so instead of being two twenty five that came out to 180 so that makes each one of these sixty bucks apiece 60 bucks for the co2 and sixty bucks for the rosin I think that's a pretty decent deal you make rosin at home you're gonna be paying probably forty to fifty bucks or so to make it grandma rosin maybe a little bit more depending on the strain and you know $60.00 co2 oil is just a great deal because usually it's their regular distill it that's at $60 price point and I don't really like the regular distill it that much I mean it's just not the same level as the co2 this syringe warmer right here is $20 normally with the 20% off that 16 bucks total and here it is so this thing right here what you will do is take your battery mod that fits a 5-10 cartridge on it and hopefully you can unscrew it I guess mine's a little bit leaky we have to well there we go whoo yeah that'll loosen it up just enough darn I can't get it here we go finally how'd you get a glove alright so yeah that's the problem is I've got a bunch of leakage right here so I need to get a q-tip with some alcohol on it and cleaning that thing out that can also cause your your mod to stop working I actually found this on the ground somebody just threw it out and this thing was all gunked up and so there you go now it works let's see if this works even though it's still all gunky you just screw in the syringe warmer on your battery mod see if I can feel it it doesn't really have any structions with it smells like it's heating up in there yeah you just take this sucker look how pretty it is I love how pretty the co2 oil is just take this and stick it in there I guess maybe you take off this cap I'm not really totally sure what you do I've never used it and there's no instructions but see if this does anything hmm wonder how long this thing takes there we go it's certainly heat up right here I don't know it might be easier just to do a lighter guys seriously like what in the heck maybe I gotta try it like this take this thing off it doesn't seem to make much sense to me but I'll try it when the heck was that oh there's a spring I don't know the here is like a spring weird okay let's see this is holder for ten seconds to see if that doesn't so the video cut out there right after I held it down for ten seconds but yeah it does it does heat it up you know it's not as fast as a lighter and you have to sit here and hold it so mmm if you don't want to mess with a lighter I guess it could be worth it but yes here we go there it's all it's all melted now it really doesn't take that long you don't get sick all over it you don't have to worry about using all your butane there you go you can just keep this thing plugged in if you want really so it looks like that works pretty well I didn't get any flour because I'm all out of my flour recommendation you know I got caught up in the one plant slash three boys farm ordeal and so I spent my recommendation on that now I mean I'm not regretting it you know it's like it was a really good deal hundred twenty-five dollars for an ounce so 250 for two ounces that's pretty awesome I mean a quarter pound for 500 bucks you know medical grade pretty awesome but you know I I do miss the variety I wish I had I definitely wish I had my recommendation open when I went to the grand opening of this truly Panama City Beach because they had a nice selection of strains they had like four or five strains that day and they also had all the cups I'd use all the cups I got I went back and I only had there yesterday it was just cups of what is it wine wine dream Dutch wine yeah Dutch wine and I just I've already got cups of that so I don't really care about it yeah you know it's good stuff but I like a variety so I should my recommendation should be coming up here and about a week or so so I'll be getting a bunch more reviews on actual flour in here soon hopefully maybe I'll take a couple deliveries from other dispensaries to and branch out with what I'm reviewing instead of just doing and all the stuff that's closed or that I've gotten from before but like fluent I know I can get deliveries from them and possibly vitae can and med men I'm not really sure but yeah I'm ready to taste some variety I've been stuck on the same strains for a while now and that'll teach me something in the future too you know don't get stuck on the big old hype trap if if you might have some new openings coming in your area but it's all good I just got to say that that the employees at the Panama City Beach location seem pretty cool they're all very friendly and polite so far the atmosphere in general up there is really nice you know it's not there's not a bunch of grumpy people I mean it's not a bunch of people arguing or whatever perhaps the limit on minis help that I don't know but they said that the minis I talked to I guess my team in a shift manager I'm not sure but he said that the minis are still selling out and they'll be you know usually they'll be gone by early afternoon even with the two person or two per person limit so it's just a really popular item and you can't blame them when they're you know giving out really fat jars of minis they just baton for social media with those things you know they want to get on in line they want to get their message out they want people who don't have a card and who are getting from a dealer to say hey wait whoa whoa you can get four grams for the price of 3.5 and it looks good you know like that I mean so you know it's a work in progress this is like the Wild West phase that we're in right now once everything gets sorted out you know once the competition gets more firmly rooted wants some acquisitions take place then we're gonna start to see a more stable environment with better prices and better customer or care I think right now they're just you know that some of these people are some of these dispensaries are gonna get snapped up some of them are gonna get bought out some of them are gonna you know have really bad financial problems I mean just depends you know you got to see how it plays out and in the next two years I think we'll see the market stabilize a lot we'll see a bunch of acquisitions and stuff like that and it'll be a lot better for us at that point you know we just got a grin and bear it for now it is a kind of a [ __ ] show you know trying to get flour in this state hang in there and we can do it and you know another thing I just wanted to say I think I'm gonna start adding this as much as I can to everything I say because I just noticed that online we've got so much negativity not just in our forum not just in the medical marijuana community but in America we just in our whole country everyone is so negative everyone is always wants to be right everyone always wants to prove someone wrong everyone always wants to knock somebody down a peg and I'm guilty I'm just as guilty as anybody else or more so and you know we got to just start being kind man just please please please be kind", "zNT8Zo_sfwo": "hey you feeling rough week really and the best way to take it is to put it under your tongue and rub it in you cheat don't do too much even the asleep on all that then you know you should do no don't try to communicate just relax see what happens we know from animal experiments that the endogenous cannabinoid system is very important in regulating motor activity that very type of activity that is impaired in Parkinson's disease from animal experiments we also know that boosting certain branches of the endocannabinoid system is helpful in relieving symptoms of Parkinson's finally from anecdotal information we know that certain patients who smoke marijuana experience relief of their symptoms I think you're calm down amazing he used just a single drop and his hands afterwards were rock steady and the dyskinesia left I bet it works most of the time oh did you guys see much oh yeah like we could really easy I wanna yeah please pretty angry that thank you my home state the number one frustration that I have is knowing that there is this untapped potential comes from what marijuana state is teaching us to generate new medicines and being stuck because of financial issues or politically issues that is extremely frustrating we now know that medical marijuana controls dyskinesia and yet it's not it's not available to us", "hyugaUQM4ZE": "JORG THE SIGNS ARE FAIRLY\nOBVIOUS IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO LOOK\nFOR.

it however you must have a certificate", "surc7tlcLW0": "[Music] hey everyone and welcome back to another video in this video i'm going to be discussing the cura leaf nano drops my top two favorite flavors are the unflavored and the lime so i'm gonna be talking about those today and telling you about the taste of the product how it works what do we do with it etc so let's keep watching if you want to and let's get into it so the nano drops are meant to be mixed into a beverage so that you can drink your thc one milliliter and the dropper does show you on it how much one milliliter is you can see right there one milliliter contains five milligrams of thc the retail price for one 150 milliliter bottle is 30 so first off i want to tell you something interesting about the nano aspect of these drops i read the blog from kira leaf about these drops and it told me this about nanotechnology the way that this works is with nanomolecular technology which means the cannabinoids are so small that your body doesn't need to digest them in order for you to feel the effects they're water soluble because they're so tiny so you're able to mix this into a drink that's how you're supposed to use it and you can drink the cannabinoids and you can feel the effects much faster than with something like an edible or another type of oral consumption product i thought that was interesting about these products because i kind of just thought okay it's i didn't really know what nano meant i thought that was pretty cool so it's basically really tiny tiny molecules of cannabinoids and that's why they're able to be water-soluble and that's also why the nanotechnology makes them faster and more readily bioavailable now let's talk about the product a little bit more what does it taste like how do we use it and all of that good stuff so you want to use this in a drink i prefer sparkling water but basically you're just going to want to mix this into a drink it comes in a bottle like this so you've got your box then you've got your bottle the bottle is 150 milligrams of thc in the entire bottle and that is 30 milliliters of product in total i would say this is going to be a good product for somebody who likes to micro dose or use smaller amounts of cannabis in their daily life you probably don't want to add too much of this to your drink or you are going to start to taste more of this flavor than you might want to and what this flavor tastes like it depends on whether you get the unflavored or the flavored with a taste in it but all of them even the unflavored one are kind of sweet so when you put them into your drink they have a little bit of a sweetness kind of like the sweetness of like a diet coke it's more of like a sucralose so like a artificial sweetener type of taste all of them have that flavor all of them are even the unflavored is on the sweet side so just keep that in mind when you're mixing this the way that i usually like to use it is i will pour about an eight ounce cup of beverage so basically just a cup of my beverage and i usually use sparkling water so i'll usually add like half the can into a cup all right so we've got our cup of beverage and then i just take two droppers full or i actually do more like 2.75 droppers full so not all the way up to one milliliter but just up to that 0.75 mark and i just do two of those into my drink so that equals out to a little less than 10 milligrams of thc i just mix it together now let's try it yeah definitely tasting that sweetness from the drops i'm also tasting some of the flavor of the sparkling water and also the flavor of the lime that i just put in there and i'll just sip it until it's gone just like i would with like any other kind of drink i just sip this guy whenever i feel like it and that can be during the day it can be at night time and i do feel like the effects are pretty strong and pretty fast like i feel like once i finish drinking the drink i can already feel the effects that's how fast it kicks in for me and what i usually look for with my effects is just am i feeling an overall sense of calm am i feeling good and am i feeling overall positive and feeling good i usually just try to use as much cannabis as i need in that moment and then stop when i'm feeling like i got my my amount that i need like there's no need to add more on top of that but this is a great product i think for people who are going to use more like a 10 milligram dose in each drink um and you can always you know drink a couple of drinks back to back if you need to but i just wouldn't recommend putting a lot of the liquid in a drink and drinking it because it's just going to taste really sweet and not very good so i mean you could probably you can but just i would just advise against using like don't use like the whole bottle at once or something like i just don't think that's a good idea that's just my take though i don't know um so anyway have you tried these products what have you what do you think of them if you've tried them let me know in the comments i'm really curious to know i've been using these now for a few weeks and i just love them i love the effects i love how easy it is to use them i like the taste i don't think it's too bad um yeah i'm overall a big fan of this product so i could definitely see myself buying it again in the future i think i prefer these drops in a liquid form as opposed to like there's a powder out there from another dispensary that i tried and it was okay but it didn't dissolve as well as this does this dissolves really well in your drink and you just you don't feel like you're not getting it mixed in it's definitely getting mixed in pretty well when you use this product with a drink so anyway thanks for watching and i'll catch you in the next video and i hope you liked this and i'll see you next time also i am going to be getting back to weekly videos um at least i'd like to do more than a weekly like i'd like to do more than one per week so we will see how that goes i don't want to get ahead of myself but keep on coming back because i'm going to be trying to make new videos every week all right i'll see you next time bye hey there just a quick editor's note i wanted to give a big shout out and a thank you to vectrix1 who did a great job on these portraits of me he makes awesome vector portraits if you are looking for something like that then i recommend that you hit up vectrex1 because he did a great job on my artwork so thank you for that vectrix1 and i hope you guys enjoy it so yeah i'll see you next time thanks for watching [Music] bye [Music] you", "lLDzIwTZ0XA": "this is the part of the program where we ask about pot etfs those of you don't know tim is our maven on on pot uh he's long a number of names uh he's the portfolio manager of a cannabis etf and he sits on advisory boards for a cannabis company so the full disclosure on all of this uh tim they've been all over the place uh although cnbs is uh is is okay tell us a little bit about what's going on bob you're you're the one with the the psychedelic posters behind you so um but uh now let's talk about cannabis the dynamics in the cannabis sector are are uh really extraordinary and the top down and through the election cycle we saw five new states uh vote through uh either adult or or medical markets the top line growth story is 30 to 40 percent you know i don't need to get too deep into uh the top-down consumption story this is cpg this is very sophisticated and the country's in favor um so it's really going to be about finding the right exposure so in etf land look we're we're the only uh you know cannabis you know derivative free cannabis etf that's that's up here to date if i look at my screens coming in i think you know we're up about 10 and a half percent if i'm looking at my reuters screens this morning um the largest cannabis etf is down 23 so this is all about active management this is all about being someone that's investing in a sector and in the middle of the sector talking to companies and and watching the allocations because it's moving very quickly um but it's notable how profitability in the sector which was once thought of hey growth at any cost and a lot of the big canadian names frankly um were were spending money not only that they didn't have but uh to build capacity to nowhere and i think part of the trade um has been first of all as you would do in any active portfolio on the way down and it was a vicious bear market it was about being defensive it was about finding the best balance sheets it was about finding the companies that actually hadn't levered their balance sheet or or put a bunch of dilutive equity warrants in their in their structure so that's that's really what we're doing at cmbs and i think the sector you know people may or may not believe in what's going on in the cannabis story but again this is a a national issue and and the macro on it which continues to be one where states are plugging uh holes in budgets and fiscal through cannabis legalization and and the country the country doesn't care more importantly it's a very sophisticated consumer product story and and active management and being thematic in the space is is what we do and it's and it's working i love that line it's a very sophisticated story i don't hear that a lot about cut etfs but i appreciate that um this is for intelligent people bob this is not for you bob well i'll explain it to other people later on but thank you for clearing that up for us i love the led zeppelin poster by the way don't think i didn't notice that all right i got my eyes open doing what i can bob yeah doing what i can fellow old you're just an old hippie like me there you go there thank you gentlemen i very much appreciate it [Music] [Music] you", "5ndyQLqo3Y4": "what's happening party people we're here and I want to beep so odd as it sounds sounds weird coming out of my mouth usually it's I want to dad I want a bong hit one babe all of our faith cartridges are like dunzo check this out they're like it looks like there's something inside but there's nothing inside these I mean I could probably get like little baby hits but they're done I've been sucking on them dry bro like all of them we are out so the revival vape actually comes with empty hive cartridges you guys can see here and you just pop it open take this little thingy off and you can just pour your concentrates in there man simple as that so we're gonna take this syringe of beta my cream and we're gonna make a little vape syringe or vape cartridge with the syringe this is from nectar stick interesting people we see them at all the events they're always there pitching their stuff they sell these full grams in this container for $40 at the events it's probably gonna run you 50 or 60 out of dispensary but this one specifically normally they have like kind of ap flavors like strawberry cough and mango passion this and whatever I asked the guy what do you have for pain and it gave me this it's a ante what does it say pain relief sedative now actually that's upside down sorry guys now I actually hit these people up on Instagram because I was at the event you know I didn't necessarily get the proper explanation of the product you know it wasn't really the kind of place that you sit and you [ __ ] talk science and chemistry about cannabis and [ __ ] but I instagrammed them when I was like hey man I bought your Batum mersin I did I call it Mike Green earlier sorry mersin I bought your beta Mersin and I was curious I mean is this made with cannabis does this contain THC or CBD you know give me some give me some info about this all I have is the package and the package isn't too descriptive either zero PPM's solvent free ultra refined nothing doesn't tell you like percentages doesn't tell you anything so I'm curious like is this a pure I guess I should have explained it if you guys don't know with what beta mercian is I check it out on wiki because that's basically how I learned what it is it beta mercian is basically a component in cannabis it's like a terpenoid it's one of the things that are a part of the we'd like THC CBD CBN THC a all of those get you high and then there are actually compounds that give you flavor like limonene citrus scene or something lemons this is the citrus one hash machine there are a couple of different flavor compounds and these compounds are found in everything I could find citrus or limonene in limes I can find that in oranges I can extract it from those you know and it's also found in cannabis that's why some weed smells like oranges some weed smells like smoke it's are like smoke because you've spoken it some weed smells like like dirt and like earth you know like it literally has the same chemicals they're in those other things so this is one of those chemicals and if you smoke this chemical by itself or not smoke it but you know consume it it's supposed to make you feel relaxed sedative it's supposed to make you sleepy it's supposed to be a good anti and Kalama tori it's it's got a bunch of qualities you can read them all on the on the wiki so I got this and I was like man this should be excellent for medicating and then I had a realization where I was like isn't this the same [ __ ] that they have in mangoes that everybody says gets you higher if you smoke it or if you consume it so if I'm smoking like a really low grade weed or even if I just want to get higher supposedly if I eat a mango it's high in the Mersin and that is what gives me like a bigger high so I was like man this would be excellent for a cush Buster's or something where I'm like [ __ ] eating mangoes I'm literally gonna go to a scientist have him extract the Mersin give it to me straight up and I'll test it for you guys and I'll be like I'm gonna smoke a gram of this shitty weed and then take a hit of the mercy and and see if it helps then I'm gonna take a hit of the top shelf with the Mersin and see if that improves the hit as well and then do like control test like this is awesome so we're just gonna stick this in here like a mad scientist and just fill it up I want to I use it up I use half of this I want to leave some for dabbing but or just see if it even works let's just use less let's see if it even works you don't want to put all of your nugs in one basket you know what I'm saying I lost a little stopper there's like a little shirt oh there it is it's so tiny put the stopper in I guess I think I went the other way whoops got it all weedy so cool we do that and we're good to go let's try it out I've been smoking it I took it home you guys and I was like let's get [ __ ] up like we went to the event and it was like a marijuana edible sesh and if you guys watched the the podcast if you guys haven't seen it it's the podcast from the weekend of like May 14th May 15th like that and we talked about how we got trapped in the elevator we almost died going to like a weed event and if I get to the weed event and I don't even get to smoke that much or like get that high so I came home and I was like man I'm gonna take a huge hit and I literally smoked like a fifth of it at once and it was a immense hit it was super clean super flavorful particularly for the size usually you take a huge dab of something and it's really rough like it just it kills your lungs it's like it leaves you wheezing but it was super clean and a him Ian waves bro it was like at first like you kind of you feel a little bit after the initial hit but it doesn't like hit you and then like a couple minutes later you start you feel like almost like a wave hit you and like you feel like more buzzing more like higher and more relaxed and then like five minutes later boom like another wave a couple minutes later like another wave and eventually like after 15-20 minutes I was like oh gone I was just like laying in the couch like dunzo really nice I mean I smoked the point point to grammar but let's try it out I'll see how if it works cross your fingers for me I hate wasting weed drum roll please nothing I have to take the thingy out these thingies have the thingy the cartridges have the little stopper so I don't necessarily have to take the stopper out and it's hot I can feel it at the base it's just not it's not doing anything I'm glad I didn't put more one more time get in there get in there I think it's just so thick that it's having a hard time vaping it we're getting there we're getting there has a really good flavor to it it tastes it tastes very similar to the pickled monkey cartridges that we received I think they're using like a similar solvent free filler pretty sure now it's ripping brah brah it's ripping oh yeah it's pretty good it's pretty good I cannot tell you guys if it has THC or not in it I I can't offer the life let me tell you I would like to tell you that it doesn't and that I am smoking a pure beta Mersin and that this is simply the the effect of that because it almost feels a little different from a high when I take a big hit of this and I take a big hit of weed the high sit separately from each other if you know what I'm saying like one of them I like I know is like weed and on the other once it's like distantly in the back affectingly me very differently I don't know I wish they would get back to me on Instagram yo I hate when companies are like secretive about their process and like the products that they're giving you I'm literally [ __ ] smoking this and putting it in my lungs how about you [ __ ] tell me what's in this bro like people who make food have to literally list ingredients legally and that people who have these [ __ ] smokeable products don't even have to [ __ ] lab test it or anything it's crazy it was like a graphic the other day going around a mean and it was a I don't know the character name he's like a famous like character actor he has a curly hair he's like blonde and it's like um you have you notice you ever noticed how there's no more powdery mildew anymore ever since everybody to learn how to make concentrates and it was like like that [ __ ] like man you never know what you're putting into your lungs anymore you know like they could just take any weed they want run it and it just looks golden and good you know and unless it actually gets tested by a lab or something I'm not gonna know if it's safe or not to smoke so I hate when companies are like [ __ ] shady about [ __ ] like [ __ ] tell me bro like what the [ __ ] like I'm gonna go steal your process and whatever like as if there are like 10 other companies do right now how about you just be honest with your consumer base and let them know what they're literally smoking bro what strain is in this what am i even smoking is this even weed these are my questions I think they're fair I don't know but it's pretty far I ask these questions I semi complain but also smoke it also smoking I purposely did this one just so that I know I knew that I wouldn't necessarily waste the weed as much because I feel like big cartridges are more efficient than like dabbing like when you dab you just some of it burns away maybe it's too high temp of a dab like you're literally electronically controlling the temperature with the vaporizer so I feel like it's more efficient and what was my point with that right I wanted a lot of smoke because I'm actually doing a product shoot over there and I'm actually doing shots where like there's products all laid out and then I blow smoke and like smoke comes into the frame and like you know [ __ ] high production [ __ ] and it's actually been really hard to make like volumous smoke I literally that's why I have the illa Delft over here I was gonna pack a bomb hit for the shoot because I've tried vaping I've tried using is it here I tried using the dryer vape and I even tried taking a DAB and unless I took like a huge dab I couldn't get a significant volume of smoke so like look impressive enough on the screen so I have to pack some flowers bro into the old illy and start ripping I thought this would be it but it makes clouds but now I mean look at the size difference I mean if this made clouds this big I'd be scared like what is in this what witchcraft did they like make this with some make it do that but still pretty fire I'm gonna go get the weed pack up a bowl and I'll see you guys next time on the daily grind thank you guys for joining me and let me know what you guys are smoking on in the comments man you guys rocking a vape pen vape cartridge have you ever refilled one of these before do you make your own eliquid I think a couple of followers have mentioned in the past that they do their own like pg/vg mix or some [ __ ] like let me know in the comments I am really new to the whole vaping world so I am very curious to hear what people's personal preferences are particularly after they've had a consistent career token it up contouring on the vape level you know what I'm saying I'll see you guys next time stay regularly", "w73rM949ZbE": "hi there i'm a florida medical marijuana patient and i'm going to show you some buds that we get this isn't technically an opening this is already open so i'm just gonna show you what it looks like this is la woman 17% hybrid between LA Confidential and something else I can't remember thankfully this is not too hard to open this time ago a little moisture pack in there now look at this this this is the best that I've gotten from pure leaf la woman this stuff is delicious and it has first of all it's a fantastic grape like aroma I mean you know I wouldn't exactly say great but you know that's the kind of aroma it has and it's a cross that has a lot of indica qualities to it um this bud right here this 8 has lasted me a while because I only smoked it right before bed it's just really really good for that I mean you can have a joint of this stuff and and just relax and get to sleep but look at all that 17 percent THC it smells delicious you see what we got so that's all that's left of this eight right there these are not dense they're big and fluffy they're not Airy but they're fluffier then you know the taffy you can look at my other video where I have some of the tapping in there it's definitely a bigger man it smells so freakin good and it's definitely a bigger less dense bud but as you can see it's got plenty of trichomes on it and this is may be stronger than 17% I don't know maybe I just got a good batch of it but it is very potent this weed is super potent and it will make you tired and sleepy and that's why I like it so much that's efficient it tastes great it smells great so here we have it L a woman 17% from Cara leaf Florida", "olTKsWF2c38": "[Applause] [Music] since it's six nine four give us a worksheet here you want it in here evenly so that is the house pockets that's a

kind of pushed us all helped us get to where we're at way back last year so he has a technique that eases a higher temperature a little faster press other all this do lower temperatures and longer times with with higher pressures they like to get in there and get it done quick and and get out of there and so there's different techniques one tastes better it's just like Davin you dab low temperature you get more terms you jump with a high temperature it burns the turf up it's harsh e it makes you pop all the above 205 206 on the top tool oven on the bottom there we go so we've got the package all wind up look down in here here's your can you see in there and see the package and everything so we're warming her up first we got no pressure on it the game is sitting at 0 still or it is

wine that it's Payton because we created those two channels for it to flow so that's our directional flow picking them right now so we know that we got it warmed up we know we got it isn't so now we come with the pressure so now I'm going to start creeping up and just press at all see this welcome all waterfall try to keep my hand out humming gun and rubs about 8 tons now and we're still gushing and we're still running feel you know do it a hundred and two hundred times a day and this is what happened [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "IKEkDUaphN4": "are you doing today that's bad am I gonna be in the in a picture somewhere yeah no accent you know put over there for me please sure you're doing a right check anything alcoholic to drink today sir nope why is it videotaping because we make videos of what YouTube to do what with I need you I need you to shut that off for a second place no we want to do the drop I need you to a driver's license your registration any insurance is there anything in the vehicle that I should be aware of right now oh there may be some roaches but I have my medical marijuana license do you have okay this is do you have any documents other than a mess this is my original paperwork from the government but see it's expired before March 2014 so it just got renewed this for January last month so it's good for a year a lot six grams a day my girlfriend has a prescription - so this is her vehicle are you carrying anything right now I know we think it eligible to smoke it I know you're all out the Rope here's the Tim that I keep it in it's got the same information on it right okay I have one joint and how much I allowed to carry I'm allowed to wall I'm allowed six grams of day it says right on this takes six grams of dried marijuana daily it says the same thing on this green card and that and that's you know but I'm allowed to carry up to 150 grams at any given time with this green card but this a licence allows me to carry a lot more than that but you know I mean all I have is the one joint right I put this apart - yeah so I got a video on YouTube with 3 million views it's what to do when the cops know weed so I'm doing the same thing they did it for the last bit hopefully this one gets three million views - okay and are you not supposed to renew this this one okay I know your last one everybody who got this this pink card right it's expired if as long as it's been expired before March of 2014 this is like because some people got these after that right but this grandfather's me into the old system okay but this is like I had to give Metron my original copies of this was that I have this card because if I give you an expired piece of paper you say okay we're going to go to court and you can figure it out there but this has a date on it that shows you that I'm allowed six grams a day my doctor's name you know all the information there's a phone number on it you can call if that's you know the you know is your valid insurance other than this this is expired 2014 take that take that out for me what's your present address now a 3195 in Wood Road where Zen what exactly you know our Patrol your elven students right in between there I'm going to just book your last thing earlier today this morning water don't let some thing too is I eat or eat it mostly and it's CBD like there's THC and there's CVD so THC gets you high the weed that I buy from from you know this dispensary is mostly you know there is THC in it but it's mostly CBD because I broke my back I have medical reasons for smoking it's not just like we're smoking joints all day you know to get high we're smoking joints or you know I mean I stai do smoke joints and and hash and all that but that's how night and stuff in the morning I'll have like a muffin with some edibles into it you know what I mean like my old lady makes you like to take the weed and you mix it in with coconut oil so while you heat it up and then it makes it so that you can eat it and it you know because we just eat a bud it's not gonna do anything because you need to heat it up and you know so my concern is that is yeah it's not is that you're not impaired by drugs you know right that's for the last the last time you smoked the area you smoked their joint was went yesterday but I've ate it today we spawned and smoked in the van because we just went to my girlfriend's parents we can't smoke in their house so that's why the van smells like we and how long ago was that we smoked in the van yes yesterday you know III can't tell with the you know how you know how level sobriety is murder law you seem to be sober enough mana grams is up in the air I'll give you that I give you the benefit without drive safe go home don't do it in the talk

the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws thanks for coming on jax how are you thank you so much for having me it's great to be with you this morning definitely thanks for doing it so talk about this session where does texas stand with marijuana right now and what is normal hoping lawmakers will will change this session sure quick overview of where we stand in texas right now currently we have a robust temp program where people are growing hemp plants which have to have less than 0.3 percent thc we have a medical program in texas with a limited amount of conditions and also a restriction on how doctors can dose their patients and also we have basically possession of cannabis is still completely illegal and highly criminalized though there are some patchworks of deprioritization policies first chance programs so that's where we stand right now so you can see that we have a lot of work to do to improve our laws here in texas gotcha what are what are some of the main things that y'all are fighting for this time you know really what is very important important and a core goal for us is to make sure that patient access is improved we want to see people that have conditions like any type of cancer not just terminal cancer ptsd chronic pain included in the program and we also want to restore the ability for doctors to decide dosing and give them that medical freedom to converse on that with their patients additionally we want to remove the collateral consequences that come if you are caught in possession with the cannabis flower currently you can get 180 days in jail a 2 000 fine and then you lose your driver's license and have um you know a record for life that can affect your rental ability your grants through school and then also we want to make sure that we're having a really robust conversation about where do we go in the future with cannabis on a broader retail type of market so i think the main goal is to make sure patients have access and people aren't being arrested and then we also need to have those conversations moving forward speaking of the retail i know governor abbott has said before you know things like we will never become a colorado as long as i'm governor i mean are we are we a long way from seeing dispensaries and things in texas like in colorado you know i think that there is going to take some time to have that conversation and we're going to have to figure out what's right for texas you know we don't have to be colorado we need to do what's right for texas look at the other states around us look at arkansas oklahoma new mexico all of these different places that are instituting different types of programs medical and otherwise and we need to make sure that we are making wise decisions for us so i agree with him that we're not colorado and hopefully we can have a conversation about what is the right path for texas last question here we've got a little bit of time explain what's going on federally is there a chance that something could could completely usurp everything that happens in texas well movement at the federal level is happening as i'm sure you know schumer and harris both promised to make sure that this was a priority for them so if changes are happening at a federal level of course that will affect what happens in texas the safe banking act could be addressed in the next covid legislation and we could see the more act being discussed sometime this year perhaps in the fall so i am hopeful that on all fronts we can have a very fact-based discourse and move forward with some common sense legislation jax finkel with texas normal thank you so much always a pleasure", "XTVqby5haz0": "MONDAY MONDAY AND MONDAY AND TUESDAY.

could imagine it had hey you know whatever it was you know Hershey Kisses or who knows what to the right you have the grow rooms to the left of them we have a mother room this is where the the mother plants lived which plants that we keep that up the best genetics and from when we were looking to harvest new plants will essentially take cuttings off of off of these we plant them and and grow from those from those cuttings and then you take them and put them in a different room when you want to tell them it's time to flower and the flower is the is the medicinal part with the with the active components there's a whole set of procedures in place so we have these these standard operating procedures that are hundreds of pages long or Tom who you met is the is they sort of overseer and he makes sure they're all you know specifically followed we keep samples from each lot I mean as we do our own testing but that we store samples so if there's ever product when you call or and they glad if we got a complaint just within Canada there is the regulations do envision the existence of imports or exports so there is there's a there's a section there where we can apply for an export permit office we'd have to find a country that you know has the right laws and system in place that we could export to but so that's a whole whole different step but generally speaking for customers who are

today's news with a look at the growing pile of rumors over the financial ruin that multi-state cannabis operator med men seems to currently be in with the california-based company said to be behind on making payments to vendors as Deborah astutely points out this is generally the time of year when a company with retail operations is flushed with cash so the fact that med men is behind on paying out to vendors is a troubling sign with a number of other financial red flags that include layoffs at the end of last year and a sell-off of real estate assets in the last financial report issued by med men for the quarter ending in September it had 671 million dollars in liabilities against just under 44 million dollars in revenue this exact topic was covered in our weekly podcasts marijuana

adult use marijuana to be made legal this year following earlier action this month where she included the issue in her 2020 legislative agenda that's notable because New Mexico has a short 30-day legislative session this year that is currently underway so if state lawmakers take up the governor's call and it appears that they will we could have our newest legal adult you state in less than a month open up marijuana moment for the full read here and to watch the part of governor Grisham speech where if she talks about the need to legalize cannabis for our final top story today we pick up on a newer story line that we've been covering lately here on the daily that's the 41% of all industrial hemp crops that have tested as having too much THC in Arizona that have to be destroyed per federal law hemp industry daily is reporting that the hot weather that is typical of Arizona is thought to be the cause of the high number of plants testing over the federal limit of 0.3% THC I'm no cultivation expert but if that's the case then Arizona farmers are going to have to do a better job of selecting Hemme strains that can stand hotter weather this is a story line that will continue to evolve and grow in other states those are our top stories for today aside from marijuana today daily headlines blitz before we blitz out in headlines let's quickly thank our exclusive multi-state

moves towards pushing adult use policy reform with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo releasing his 2020 budget proposal yesterday that assumes that state lawmakers will pass legalization legislation there was a lot of work on this issue last year in New York but ultimately the idea of legalizing was kicked down the road to this year as a consensus plan was not able to be put together Governor Cuomo's newest released bill has the state pulling in twenty million dollars in legal marijuana taxes in fees in 2021 rising to 63 million the following year and to 188 million by 2025 that's a decent chunk of change that comes on top of the savings from not busting and jailing people for marijuana crimes another good one to pop over to marijuana moments to read more Bloomberg government takes a good look at the new model now legal in Colorado of certain commercial establishments being allowed to set up space where customers can consume cannabis a new bill in Colorado went into effect on January 1st that allows for some businesses like cannabis lounges cafes and tasting rooms to open up even though a marijuana has been legal in the US for adult use consumer since 2014 we still have yet to see a fully developed commercial system for consumption to start up so it'll be interesting to watch things grow in the Centennial state give this one a read today Chris Moore / Mary Jane nestle outlines the current state of Oklahoma's medical marijuana industry which is just a year and a half old but already one of the more active medical state markets with 220,000 people or one in 13 adults of age registered as a medical patient Edmond Oklahoma population 91 thousand now has more medical marijuana dispensaries per capita than Denver Colorado that's pretty incredible making Oklahoma a general storyline that you need to be following of all legal cannabis states in the US Oklahoma's built their program with the lowest barriers to entry for all participants marijuana

topics of drug policy social justice and equity and how mayor Pete actually ran South Bend Indiana while in office in short mayor Pete talks a good game on the campaign trail but came up fairly short in his history as mayor of South Bend in one particular case firing the city's first black police chief under pressure from white racist cops with the stakes as high as they are for this year's elections this is one you need to read our final story on the day is a chart by marijuana business daily showing the growth in the amount of marijuana flour sold by medical cannabis dispensaries in Florida in the six months following the new policy change allowing for flour to be consumed Florida law has long banned marijuana flour despite the modality generally being the cheapest one for

morning we're going to talk about something that's highly controversial because here's what we know people who choose to use cannabis right are advocates of it anytime there's anything negative about it they slam it they attack it they you know they have their point of view and and i understand that right because for so long they've been ridiculed attacked and the research just is in its orphan stages right it's just sort of beginning infant stages and so there's not a lot of research to back up what it is you're doing then there's the people that believe there's no purpose to it right it's illegal it should be high classified drug there should be nothing about it right and then there's this middle group that tries to say what's the research right what can we prove what do we know so i kind of fall in the middle right i'm not an advocate and i'm not an opponent i'm somebody that wants to know look if there is research that can help somebody then we should be helping somebody so there is research right whether it's about cannabis or cbd oil right there are some uses for it right and you know i've done a couple of videos on that but today we're going to talk about one of the dangers you know back you know i'm 55 right so when i was in high school and people used cannabis right there was no way you could get addicted to it it the the thc levels were so low right that there wouldn't be a lot of permanent potential damage but through time right people have learned to raise the level of the thc and the thc levels now are you know through the roof it's much more potent as a result in the state of colorado there's people who have od'd on marijuana right on cannabis and people would say that's impossible but they did it primarily by using edibles they ate too much because with an edible right there's a delay before it gets kicked in and then it kicked in and it kind of slowed them down and they just died right and that's documented so it is possible right that that is there well that alone right says okay something has changed about cannabis right but as bad as that is and that could be bad right there's another thing that's starting to show its ugly head so a few years ago right i had this client come into my office and they were basically hallucinating all the time right everything was fine except everywhere they looked they would see spiders and they would feel spiders and see them on themself when they did the research and tried tracing back all the stuff that had happened they realized that she had used cannabis and for whatever reason it had created this psychotic break in her mind and now she was dealing with the psychosis and it was ongoing right it wouldn't end right and so we had to help her kind of process through that i had a 13 year old right who had an episode like that he had been smoking and then all of a sudden had the psychotic break right and now he had the psychosis and he was doing things seeing things that weren't there there was a guy that was walking down the highway right and he was naked and he was out of his mind and he had been smoking and he had been smoking for a long time but this particular day it kicked in and now he was in this psychotic episode so i see quite a few people right who used cannabis and some of them will swear like i've always used cannabis never had a problem then all of a sudden one day they do and so there's a diagnosis that they received called cannabis induced psychosis cannabis induced psychosis and what cannabis induced psychosis is is that because cannabis is in a hallucinogen right a lot of people when they use it will say they're more creative and all kinds of stuff because it does kind of open up that weird kind of part of your brain it can also kick into gear to things that we don't really want it can kick in psychosis and we don't know why we don't know who we just know some people will use it and experience the psychosis and it's not because of hey it's been watered down or there's another drug in it yeah that can be terrible but the thc itself can cause psychosis in some people we just don't know who we just know that some people will have it and then they have to deal with it if you've had the thc psychosis right that means you can't use thc at all ever again because now your brain is going to be going in that psychotic way right and some people don't like that fact but that's a reality so that's one aspect there's another aspect that within all of us are some aspect of the schizophrenia gene and for some people using thc will activate that gene and really move us from having a normal thinking pattern into schizophrenia and once you move into schizophrenia there is no moving back now your brain has permanently changed right so this cannabis induced psychosis can lead even worse right to schizophrenia so you have to be aware that this is a possibility and so you have to be extremely careful and if you tip into that psychosis you have to understand you're done no more use that's just the way it is you can get online google read the research on it right it's becoming a bigger and bigger issue for a lot of people thc is a very potent drug right just like every drug even though it's natural right it's not natural in its state that it intentionally was right normally when in its natural state the thc levels weren't that high so we took a natural substance right and amped it up that's what we do right we destroy the goodness of a lot of things by creating um like lab versions right and so the lab version isn't it affects what the real product was so if you could go back in time right there would be no psychosis but now there is and you have to understand that is a real disorder so if you know somebody struggling with it right pass this video on to them educate them help them to understand there is a real disorder that's connected with cannabis you have to be careful so look if you have any questions put them in the comments we'll do our best to talk about it um if you think this video has helped you like it subscribe to the channel if you want to learn more we really talk about all kinds of issues affecting the brain some issues of faith even some issues of just like how do we get through life right and hopefully a little humor thrown in from time to time just as a break because sometimes that's just too heavy also you can check out our tick tock channel the tick tock is i don't know how many people viewers on it you know some it's just different short consents but it's there right it's also dr patrick live so and instagram as well so anyhow um more than anything remember that you have the power right to encourage another person so whatever you do right when you come in contact with another person seek to encourage and uplift them because together we truly can change the world so hey peace duck out", "DI_N28S8gzs": "[Music] [Music] good morning it's Saturday morning welcome to the urban garden what I wanted to talk to you guys about this morning was what I plan to do today so I'm just here a whiff compost in the playpen hanging out having a little bit of coffee and preparing for the day so what I'm gonna be doing today is the first thing I'm gonna be doing as you can see right up there is I have that spray can and I have the thorough side as southern add cause it basically what that is is bacillus thuringiensis it is a bacteria for killing caterpillars it rots them out from the inside and we say bye-bye so long and no more caterpillars the other thing that I'm gonna be doing today is I got that home depot bucket there so I got in that bucket I have some alfalfa cubes that I've been brewing up since Thursday so it's a day of Saturday that lets you guys know how long I let them sit brewing and I'll be feeding the ladies in the garden some alfalfa tea and then the other thing that I'm gonna be today what you doing compost come over here bud the other thing that I'm gonna be doing today is I you guys see that I got some chicken wire there and some posts I'm gonna be putting up some chicken wire around a couple of my beds because one of the stray cats in the neighborhood remember I'm urban gardening here so we got all kinds of things that happen out in the urban garden and one of the things that we have that happened is cats stray cats you guys wherever you may be probably have stray cats in your neighborhood too and I know that some of you guys are first-time growers or you could even be a first-time grower outside and this is a new challenge that you have to deal with well one of the stray cats came and took a [ __ ] in one of my beds not in any of my cannabis because those are all kind of sealed up what I'm gonna do is I'm going to put some chicken wire around the beds that the cat [ __ ] in and that way he won't [ __ ] in my vegetables because you do not want toxoplasmosis so you got to do something to keep the cats out of your garden and the best bet for keeping the cats out is just put some chicken wire we compost day zeros mom we don't want to eat cat [ __ ] collards so we're gonna take care of that coffee gardening weed I wanted to show you guys me applying some Vasilis thuringiensis I know some have never applied it before I think I have shown you guys yeah I did I showed you guys how to apply it earlier in another video but you know people are hopping on so I got to keep making videos and keep showing people the same stuff but in different ways and more interesting ways sometimes so what I'm gonna do is for the caterpillars that might still be in this hoop house remember I already had this stuff in here when I started so I did find a couple of caterpillars in here but I believe that they were laid the eggs were laid before I constructed this hoop house so now I just got to spray some BT in here bacillus thuringiensis there's several different companies that make it I'm using southern eggs I know bonide and Monterey both make it so what I'm gonna do is spray this BT all over and it will destroy those caterpillars by rotting their guts when they ingest the bacteria which that is what bacillus thuringiensis is is a bacteria when that bacteria gets into their stomachs then it rots them from the inside out all right so I got my two liter bottle here with the BT so I'm just gonna pump it up and then give stuff a spray you can spray it on fruits and vegetables up until the day before harvest when you're using it on your cannabis you're gonna make sure that you stop spraying that flower time so once your cannabis flowers you can no longer spray with the BT got to get on top of everything you proactive not reactive oil neem oil is a good one to put on proactively it doesn't harm anything you can spray it all the way up to flower you want it actually puts a waxy coat on the leaves which is good for them because it keeps him hydrated neem oil is actually good for you it's been used in ancient medicinal practices it comes from the neem tree it's the oil of the neem tree alright so that's pretty much it for the BT is I'll continue to spray it on the rest of the garden and I'm going to spray it on the outer urban garden as well I want to spray this you're gonna want to spray this over your entire garden do it do it do it even if you don't think you have caterpillar there's another proactive thing you want to do you want it on there when that caterpillar hatches if that egg hatches you wanted to eat it immediately so I'm gonna go ahead and do the whole garden inside outside around the house everywhere and get rid of those caterpillars welcome guys to the garden so I'm wrapping up our Saturday afternoon and I wanted to show you how much of the things I got done in the intro if you guys remember I was sitting here with little compost over here hanging out having a cup of coffee take a look at the chicken wired off beds and yes I did find another damn cat [ __ ] this morning so I'm so glad that I'm here doing this so that no more cats can [ __ ] in this bed very upset about that luckily it was only over in a corner I cleaned the whole corner out I just wants you guys to know that I was safe here made sure that I decontaminated that whole corner there that's why that corner looks the way it does just covered in straw because I dug that whole area out there was no way I was gonna deal with any kind of cat [ __ ] within my vegetables because that's just unbelievably unhealthy guys remember that there is no [ __ ] that belongs in your compost except for vegetable eating animals such as horses cows bunnies chickens come on over let's check out the ladies on this fine Saturday looking very pretty looking very pretty today look at that that diatomaceous did what it was supposed to they don't look like anything's chewing on them right now so we're happy okay guys news to me hey Timmy what's happening buddy what's happening is you're getting bigger all right take a look at last week guys remember what Timmy look like look there you go that's Timmy's chewed leave right there on that was just eaten to bits and pieces but diatomaceous there you go person guys diatomaceous works and look at those nice leaves coming out Timmy stretching Timmy's a sativa so Timmy will get big all right guys welcome in to the hoop house still haven't finished the new screen door but I got all the materials we're ready to go it's a Pazos doing great zapping Cheetos cutter crops looking excellent Master of Puppets is looking excellent and for those of you who appreciate a good top there you go we topped the MLP we're gonna make the MLP bushy bushy bushy bushy cush doing her thing this is the one that is not going to be topped oh I got to take you guys back to the Afghan I'm gonna take you guys back to the Afghan in a minute but there you go that's the naan top and then over here we've got the topped Master Kush take you over here to the top Master Kush there you go got it two little Tufts going there okay so there's the Master Kush guys sprayed all these guys with beauties today you guys saw that earlier in this video so there's the topped one you can see I'm training as well gonna train around these hoops these hoops guys for you guys that don't grow tomatoes don't ever use these hoops for tomatoes they suck they just really royally suck for tomatoes they work for cannabis cuz cannabis has a stronger stalk and basically it's like the branches of the cannabis we're holding up and say they work okay for there but I'm probably gonna put a stronger cage around here too with some in that welded cage but you know this is just it works for training and stuff so they do have their purposes here we go blue dream so this is the deal this is why I'm gonna take you guys back to the Afghan is I've decided I'm gonna do this test on the three strains that I have doubles of then if you remember from last week the topping test so this blue dream I'm not gonna top I'm gonna let her do her thing and I'm just gonna train her around the cage then this blue dream those blue dream is doing great guys there's the one with the split stop too so this blue dream is topped and same thing we're gonna train her around the cage so one's gonna be a top to train around the cage the other one's gonna be a non topped training around the game and there you guys go that's the Girl Scouts she has been topped this is part of the reason why I was telling you guys last week I don't care if she's stretching cuz you know I got my plans for so she's topped top and her was really important too because she was stretching so that'll get her to throw out some branches it'll stimulate her to put out branches same going with the gorilla glue over here we're stimulating her to put out some branches she's topped this particular strain of gorilla glue last year the phenom that it is I shouldn't say this particular strain this phenom of it it stretches a little bit and it doesn't get super bushy if you don't top it I did let it go last year I put it in late so I just let it go and to see what it would do and I really should have topped it and helped

"although we're only what six weeks into 2021 we've seen plenty of volatility uh including stock markets and in particular areas of the market this is the the cannabis u.s cannabis stock market index came into 2021 around uh 550 level and you can see uh just in the last few days uh traded as high as above 1650 so trebled in less than what six weeks or so so given the mania that we're seeing uh around some of these cannabis stocks in february are there still opportunities out there or actually uh has the price been pumped up and we're going to see it just dump further from here in this video we'll take a look at a couple of cannabis stocks the index that we're looking at here that you can trade with us uh and also an etf that tracks uh some of the companies some of the bigger companies in this sector but i thought just to set the scene first of all yeah we'll take a look at the cannabis index we've only got we've got data going back here back to about may of last year and you can see fairly flat for much of it uh came into 2021 um really strong breaking out through the these old highs from the last six months of last year then it really has had a rocket put under it in february we've seen um fairly massive inflows into cannabis stocks just in the first week of february compared to where it was in january we saw the price pushed as high as what 1661 the 10th of february and it's lost um what not far off 60 in a couple of days massively volatile market very difficult to trade but are there still opportunities out there so i'll talk now about some of these different companies and the etf and we'll come back and look at things in a bit more detail hello i'm david jones from capital.com and um i thought we'd do something different uh this time around i thought we would uh dip our toes into listed marijuana stocks and because we've seen a lot of volatility as you saw there uh from the index uh in recent weeks so let's take a look at this in a bit more detail see where the opportunities might be so we'll have a look at a couple of stocks and also an etf an exchange traded fund designed to um track the performance of the industry as a whole so as usual in this video i'll talk a bit about the markets we're going to look at then we'll jump back onto the platform look at things in more detail and see where the opportunities are if you're watching this and you haven't subscribed if you could click on subscribe it does help support the channel it means we can continue pushing out hopefully lots of interesting videos uh throughout the week right um let's get into things let's take a look at the first of these stocks let me just talk about the backdrop first of all so in the us the legalized marijuana industry in 2019 was worth around 13 billion dollars but it's forecast to reach a value of about 30 billion dollars by 2025. of course it used to be illegal but as of the end of 2020 um marijuana was legal in 35 states in the u.s for medical use and legal in 15 of those states for recreational use and one of the reasons why people expect the industry to grow further is the the change in government uh in the us with the democrats in power many people are expecting perhaps a more liberal approach even more liberal going forward and seeing further legalization across the u.s but it's a bit of an odd setup when it comes to the individual stocks for example canadian cannabis companies are allowed to list on u.s exchanges because it is legal uh in canada but because at a federal level so at a national level it's still illegal in the u.s u.s companies can't list usually on u.s exchanges so we see lots of u.s companies listing on canadian exchanges so there's quite a bit of back and forth going on here we've seen plenty of volatility uh over recent weeks again that the finger is being pointed at reddit and uh the sub forum uh wall street bets of course we had all that excitement with gamestop stocks uh gamestop stock uh back in in january and into february and uh at the moment uh it does appear that it's attracting a lot of interest amongst the community there and we've seen a sharp run up and as usual as we're getting used to now quite a sharp fall-off in some of these uh these legalized uh cannabis stocks and you can see this just from the figures according to vanda research in the first week of february uh retail investors put something like 400 million dollars uh into into cannabis stocks um which was more than double the amount invested throughout uh all of january so it did attract some hot retail money and we saw the price run up and since then we've seen some of these stocks come back down quite heavily but not to where they were before uh the main year really started anyway let's take a look at the first of these companies and see if there's an opportunity so the first of these is a name familiar uh perhaps to many people who look at the sector and it's tilray it's a global leader in cannabis research cultivation production and distribution we're not going to have to wait too long to find out how it's been doing recently its next results are due out on the 17th of february so the time recording that's tomorrow it's the fourth quarter results uh and also of course the results for the for the previous year as a whole so they will make an interesting read last time around we had a 2.3 million dollar loss it would be interesting to see how they've reduced that if they have have they turned it round into a profit plenty of volatility for the stock in recent weeks just last week it had increased more than threefold for february so again we've seen a massive move although the stock has dropped back by about fifty percent from that recent height so let's put some color on with this let's jump on the chart take a look at tilray in a bit more detail so here's tillery and if we if we go back to to march last year we saw tilray uh dropped to about two and a half dollars and i think looking at this sort of period it does put the volatility this year in perspective came into this year trading around eight dollars and then last week touched 66 uh dollars a share before crashing back down i think it's really hard to trade markets when they're moving like this because it's difficult to practice sensible risk management all of that sort of stuff but let's take a look on the hourly charts and see if there are still short-term opportunities let's flip it over to an hourly for 2021 so far i mean we do have a trend line in place that's been there uh for much of this year and it did did a good job right into february uh and then of course the market or the share price um really took off uh from then so i suppose if you were wanted to buy into the trend for this year we're edging back to those sort of levels now so i think one one potential idea on till rate um is to be a buyer is to perhaps watch it in the days ahead at the time we're recording it was still pretty weak at the end of last week ending up around what 29 you can see it fairly clearly there on the chart we do have this old support coming in it's not that old it's only from the 4th of february coming in just below 24. so i think for till right this 20 to 24 area is going to be an interesting one as we have seen perhaps some of the mania died down i'll be watching it over the next few days do we see some stability coming in in this 2024 area i think if we did get a bit of strength uh after some of the madder moves in february there's an argument to to be a buyer in line with this trend so um so whilst you may feel you've missed a lot of the excitement and that is true i think perhaps we'd have to wait some time for it to go back up to those those highs from earlier in february i still think looking at the trend this year there could still be an opportunity until right uh in the days ahead the next one we're going to look at is uh canopy growth they are the first or they were the first uh company first cannabis company in north america to be publicly listed back in 2014 and to sum up what they do i can't do any better than reuters who describe them as the world's largest pot producing company they've got a variety of different products whether it's supplying the plant itself or drinks edibles and vapes as well we've recently had results from this one they expect to be profitable they're not yet but they say the second half of 2022 is when the company will start turning a profit let's take a look at things in a bit more detail so here's our chart of canopy growth i've gone back a bit longer on this um back to the second half of 2018 we can see the shares peaked back then up around the 72 70 72 mark up there had another go once again in in april may 2019 and it's quite interesting that again that's where we've seen it run out of steam in the latest search but perhaps what we want to pick up on here is this recovery that started uh from october uh 2020. let's let's just zoom in on that so here's here's the move really or the trend i should say from october uh 2020. i put an rsi on here 10-day rsi um when we when we see i think mad moves like this like i say for some of the other markets we cover i think the rsi has as perhaps questionable use you know when the market was moving strongly higher uh late jan into feb the rsi was overbought so if you're following that you might have got out a little bit uh a little bit too early but but saying all that again i think as with tilray we've got a good trend here in canopy growth yeah that trend line is coming in uh around what's 37 36 37 a share we've got good support i think from back here uh jan lowe's uh jan the eighth lows around 37 at the time of recording it had closed the previous day uh or the end of last week at 51.20 uh still looks a bit weak so perhaps there is scope for a bit more of a sell-off but again i think like as with tilray we have had this burst of volatility if we see a bit more weakness from here we're returning back to a more short to medium term trend so again i think for me it's one i'd be interested in continuing to watch this week see if we see some stability come in and then think about being a buyer you know possible places for stops depending on when we see this weakness end the lows the jan 19 lows around 41 dollars after that like i say these lows around 37 january 8 and the trend line currently coming in around 37 as well so i think if we saw it perhaps under a bit more pressure to the low 40s um it looks interesting again but that trend from october is still up just a question of how far this correction is going to go from here but down in there sort of mid to low 40s it certainly looks interesting of course if you don't want to invest in individual companies exchange traded funds etfs have always been and continues to be a really popular way of gaining exposure to an area of the market the etfmg alternative harvest etf not the snappiest of names it's an etf that tracks the global cannabis industry top holdings at the end of 2020 by the etf include till rate and canopy growth and also gw pharma and aurora cannabis not surprisingly given the interest and uh the moves in these stocks this year it's having a great 2021. so far it's up about 70 for the year to date there's been plenty of volatility again on the top of that so um let's take a look at the etf and see if there's an opportunity here here's the etfmg alternative harvest etf and you can see how it has clearly you know carved out the fortunes the ups and downs of the cannabis industry over recent years traded as high as 45 in 2018 september 2018. uh then um a couple of years later september 2020 it was as low as as ten dollars again we have seen this recovery since then so let's zoom in on what's been going on since october november as with all these other stocks that we've looked at uh today we had this this burst of volatility this surge higher in february a bit of a reality perhaps coming back in since then but once again we've got a good trend uh in this etf for off the late october lows good support at the moment coming in on the trend line around 17 good support from late jan around 18 25. so once again if we did drift a bit lower perhaps closer towards 20 and we saw some strength come in i think there's another opportunity there so it's the same theme for all of these different markets this burst of volatility in late late january early february um returning more back to normality but it hasn't changed the overall recent trend over the last three months so i still think there are opportunities out there that's it for this update on some of the cannabis stocks uh and an etfs plenty of volatility in this area but for now from me david jones and capital.com we'll leave things there good luck with your trading for more trading videos just like this please subscribe to our channel", "-ew1rRGANZ8": "this episode

municipal prosecutors to stop charging people with crimes involving the possession of small amounts of marijuana effectively decriminalizing cannabis statewide the letter issued by AG grewal instructs prosecutors to quote seek an adjournment until September 4th 2018 or later of any matter involving a marijuana related offense pending in Municipal Court unquote saying that his office would work to develop more information for prosecutors in the meantime this follows news the last week where attorney general Gro wall smacked down an announcement from Jersey City that it wouldn't stop arresting people for cannabis crimes so the change in direction was a little surprising though certainly not unwelcome there's a lot to unpack on in this one so I direct you over to nj.com where NJ advanced

moves us out to New Mexico where we have some numbers out of the state's medical marijuana industry that shows strong growth across the board for a license dispensaries and by extension these states tax receipts in the first six months of 2018 New Mexico's 35 licensed medical marijuana companies made just over fifty million dollars in sales with the state's top firm Ultra health capturing seven point seven million of that total which was a 78 percent jump for how the company did in the same time period in the previous year the state's industry as a whole saw 2018 sales jump 27 percent from

ease for the support of today's headlines alright time for the Blitz mass live is a good piece up looking at the current state of Massachusetts adult use marijuana licensing as the state's cannabis Control Commission will next meet tomorrow to among other things consider the application for seven new adult use businesses to cultivators three dispensaries and two processing facilities another big item for discussion is so-called host community agreements which are deals signed between towns and the cannabis companies that require their blessing to open many of which carve out significant percentages of to be given over to the town government the Commission is expected to issue guidance on the practice which some Massachusetts lawmakers and tons of industry people have said is one of the reasons for how slowly the adult news industry has been rolled out so far some sad news out of California is a raging fire has destroyed a large cannabis cultivation farm known as turf town the fire hit the cultivation facility on Monday and quickly ripped through five of the company's eight greenhouses leave leaves David Downs is reporting that nearly 300 people work at the facility though thankfully none were injured in Monday's fire kicking off a Marijuana moment three-peat is Kyle Yaeger who picked up on a recent study that could shed some light on why cannabis consumers are more likely to fall on the thinner side of the wait scale even as one of the best-known side effects from consuming cannabis is a heightened appetite according to researchers at Indiana University cannabis appears to improve how the body handles a certain kind of fatty acid that could lead non consumers to put on more weight there's still a lot that we don't know about how our body handles cannabis and its components compounds so I'd add this one to your list to click through in full it's way too easy to draw incorrect conclusions from scientific studies after they get passed through the news echo chamber always a good idea to get in the habit of clicking through to read the original studies yourself Tom angel takes the middle spot in this three headline marijuana moments run with a story about a new bill introduced yesterday by congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii that would if passed call on the Department of Health and Human Services to study the effects of state legal marijuana the measure has bipartisan support with Florida Republican Carlos corbello signing on as a sponsor marijuana moments news writer chris Roberts fittingly grabs this last marijuana moments headline as a Democrat running in West Virginia just saw his posted chances of winning a seat in Congress upgraded in a list of political predictions issued out of the University of Virginia Center for political analysis West Virginia State Senator Richard a Jada is running for a seat in Congress and has been considered something of a long shot given how conservative West Virginia voters leaned but in a list of predictions issued yesterday out of the University of Virginia the outcome of the state senators house race was upgraded from leans Republican to toss-up this is significant for us because state senator Jada is a prominent supporter of marijuana legalization and introduced the medical marijuana bill that successfully passed into West Virginia law last year we have news of embattled Denver marijuana dispensary chains sweet leaf which was thrown into the headlines last fall when Denver Police arrested a large number of its workers for engaging in the process of looping where customers would come in and make purchase after purchase of the maximum amount of cannabis allowed per transaction in a bid to accumulate large stocks of cannabis on Monday the company was able to win a stay against an order from Denver city officials to destroy their remaining stock of cannabis product the company is appealing a decision that stripped them of all of their Denver operating licenses and the stay to destroy their cannabis stock will remain in effect until that process is allowed to play out and filed for today we end the show on a bit of a lighter note as to Boston public radio hosts

"YkJbSZotFnQ": "[Music] good afternoon and congratulations you did on October 17th cannabis will be recreationally legal in Canada way to go it's already legal in some American states nine of them including California Colorado and Nevada and in one country Uruguay but if you're one of those people who has a naysayer if you are opposed to legalization or if you're still opposed relax because guess what cannabis can make you healthier sexier and richer we are learning how cannabis can be used as a medicine treating all kinds of ailments from epilepsy to the nausea caused by chemotherapy seniors are using it to improve their quality of life we are becoming friendlier more creative and more relaxed cannabis affects how we interact with one another because it can create a greater sense of empathy it can provide us with a higher level of sensitivity so that the food we eat is tastier and the sex is better cannabis cultivation dates back 12,000 years making it one of humanity's oldest crops and the business of cannabis brings with it so many opportunities cannabis is a disrupter it's going to change the entire wellness industry it has a history of medical use exceeding 5,000 years and now it's finally legal again there are many ways in which we are discovering how cannabis can make us healthier but we don't need to smoke cannabis or even get high to enjoy its benefits CBD is a cannabinoid which does not make you high and it can be taken in so many ways through supplements such as CBD oil tinctures and edibles or it can be applied and absorbed on the skin we are putting CBD in everything these days creams in our makeup in shampoo in teas and other drinks even in pet food and for good reason every part of your body has CBD receptors just waiting to come in contact with CBD and when they do cannabis stimulates your body to produce more of its own endocannabinoids which help your body's cells regulate themselves improving your sleep your appetite coordination and boosting your immune system it balances and aligns your body's metabolic processes cannabis is an effective painkiller it's an alternative treatment to opiates the active ingredients in marijuana calm the secretion of pain signaling chemicals in your body when you're experiencing pain cannabis signals your body to stop hurting and topical creams are being used now to treat pain to treat soreness and to treat inflammation even chronic pain such as fibromyalgia athletes use CBD to ease inflammation cannabis especially CBD oil can treat anxiety in people and believe it or not in pets cannabis is being used now to treat autism ADHD schizophrenia epilepsy social phobia and PTSD we know there is so much potential in what CBD and THC can do and cannabis can make you smarter THC and CBD are antioxidants that help prevent damage and degeneration of brain cells cabin noise protect an aging brain so cannabis can help in treating diseases like Alzheimer's multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's but cannabis doesn't just make you healthier it can make you richer here are some interesting statistics on why you should invest in cannabis right now US legal cannabis sales is expected to rise by fifty percent this year to ten billion dollars but the actual estimated US market including the black market as it's not currently legal everywhere in the u.s. is fifty two billion dollars a year and there is some that say if the entire US was legalized that sales of marijuana would top cigarette sales which are currently at ninety three billion dollars a year cannabis is big business so the hype around cannabis stocks is not surprising it's definitely warranted as the industry really is just getting started there are already six multi-billion dollar cannabis companies but there's still plenty of room to grow in August 2018 Constellation Brands one of the world's largest alcohol brands owning Corona beer made a five billion dollar investment into one of the world's largest cannabis companies canopy growth bringing that company's market capitalization to over thirteen billion dollars and it's not even recreationally legal yet I get asked all the time where should I be putting my money in cannabis is it too late to invest or how do I invest in a cannabis stock before it reaches a billion dollar valuation I'm gonna share a secret with you it's called the Canadian securities exchange on that exchange sir over 80 cannabis companies listed many of which are at the very early stages and any of which could be the next billion dollar enterprise every once in a while we find ourselves in the right place at the right time now is the time to buy cannabis stocks in Canada although there are several billion-dollar companies out there you want to look for the companies that could be targets and could be acquired so buy into those CSC listed companies this is what you need to look for look for companies that are pursuing an international strategy with assets in other countries as recreational cannabis becomes legal as it will hopefully all over the world and look for companies that are growing CBD are conducting research and development to find out how cannabis can heal us and look for companies developing strong brands whether it's in flower edibles or topicals an example of a strong brand that I like is a company I found it called the yield growth Corp and we're launching a cannabis line called urban juice if you want to look at a company that's entering new territories around the world take a look at crop infrastructure it's a public company listed on the CSC under the symbol crop and they've actually bought the Italian rights to urban juice there are so many cannabis companies poised to grow as legal cannabis changes the way we heal the way we play and the way we interact it's a gold rush only this time the gold rush is a green rush but more importantly let's talk about how cannabis can improve your sex life cannabis can intensify feelings and connection with a partner and it can yield better orgasms some people smoked it as an aphrodisiac there are so many strains I need to experiment to determine what works for you experts recommend that adults experiment with smoking or vaping to find out your perfect strain one toke at a time it can be very strong cannabis infused lubricants may well change women's sex lives forever a company that I found in urban truth has filed a patent for a female sexual lubricant that includes ashwagandha oil which is an exotic Indian oil that relaxes combined it with THC and hamper oil and we theorize that that will increase orgasmic activity in women how can that be wrong people have been arguing for 50 years to legalize cannabis the public pressure in the last 15 years has been particularly strong the media has been a big supporter to legalize cannabis and there are still many media companies working hard to educate the world about it such as the Canadian cannabis media if you were one of those people who was opposed to legalization I encourage you to open your mind to it anyway and try to get on board with this you're gonna find that this natural plant is going to be responsible for an economic resurgence and social change when you come to realize that cannabis can make you richer healthier and smarter you may thank me consider educating yourself about how cannabis can heal you cannabis comes in mainly two strains sativa which generally stimulates an indica which often relaxes most strains are a genetic combination of both you can think of it kind of like white wine and red wine on steroids we each have an endocannabinoid system that is naturally set up to receive cannabis you need to find out which strains are right for you sort of like a wine tasting personally I love a good Sauvignon but I won't touch Chardonnay if you're living somewhere that has legalized cannabis like we will be here shortly if you're of legal age and if you find yourself on a Friday night going out for a glass of wine don't be afraid to visit your local dispensary these are the new wine stores check out the various cannabis strains inhaled aromas like you would a good wine consult with your bud tenders they're the somalis of the future for those of you that have already tried cannabis Bravo keep it up responsibly for the rest of you adults please consider giving it a try it's a new world good luck and have fun [Applause]", "0JjHvCxQCQ4": "what's going on everybody endo grows here help everybody's having a wonderful wonderful day today's video was submitted a video idea for reviewer like you so thank you so much to everybody and thank you you know who you are so it's gonna be all some tips and tricks on how to grow like a pro some things I do and some things I use if you're new to the channel this is what we do we grow we do rosin press reviews we do rather than squishing you can see all this on my page go check it out I have all these grows everything you see here go check it out give me a subscribe you know hit the little subscription button down below thank you so much if you want to support the channel watch the video all the way through give me a like and thumbs up I can't fit all the tips and tricks in the one video so that's how I'm gonna engage on whether or not I want to keep doing this one or not so if you really want to see some more of this give me some likes give me some comments down below thank you I'll get right into we're gonna go start out in veg and work our way through flour so a first tip I'm going to use is get some make host microbes definitely check them out I have a few videos highlighting them really really beneficial stuff for your root system and bigger roots bigger fruits right that's what I always like to say a lot of people you know so definitely do that badge and flour super crazy important have really good airflow and I mean just in general about temps you want to mimic outside like their plants that came from outside so mimic outside you want to have my go-to temps for my veg tank it is like 70 to 85 degrees 70 is my low 85 is my high you don't have to worry about it as much and badge because they like to be warm don't overwater how I gauge how I need the water is I'll pretty much like put my plants my soil water and I'll let him dry out to the point that they start to droop and that's when I start to get my idea of how light my buckets are and I hold my buckets up and if I remember that day you know and like oh my [ __ ] it's pretty light like that day then that's when I water so that's how I decide on how I'm gonna water training there's all sorts of different ways to do it low stress trainings my go-to method but you can do a bunch of different ways by five by five as you can see I don't need to know trellis Nets I still have a great canopy everything's pretty even everything's only been talked to one time and they're so uh just do training and I train my plants in a funny way I like had him every single day I go in there and I just pet him trying to be rough with them been immune to the ways that I want them direction I want them to start growing and it's really beneficial for a lot of reasons you can get more tops that way as you can see I have crazy tops all over my tent but I've only topped those plants one time and it's just because of training you can also decide how a higher canopy is with that and the reason I don't really use nets and stuff because I can get really nice canopy without it and I can still move my fence around when I go to defoliate and everything I don't have that big a problem so you know definitely important to train the plants the way you want them it helps you also see things that might be going on I started really small plant pots and I worked my way up and every time I change my pots like when I go to transplant I give a good flush every single time get all that old nutrients out start with a nice new base I run sixty forty sixty percent Coco forty percent like Fox Farm soil and that's just for you know my personal preference and then so every time you also transplant throw something that make us him they're super good stuff can't stress it enough do your research on it I keep my lights in bed anywhere between 12 and 14 inches away side run cobs and LEDs so if you're running HPS you know you want to be definitely a lot further away so that's my go-to for my light setup you want to see like what stuff I have in my real room go check out my channel and I highlight everything I'm running in my 5 by 5 on one of those videos so we'll go into flour times now super-important again good airflow definitely you need good airflow I can't stress it enough through your whole canopy top and bottom and then I also start dropping my temps back when I'm in flower I like to drop them back you know just like outside so like just not quite as cool as outside but I usually like to go back my preferred range is 65 to 75 that's another huge thing is a tip make sure that try as closer you as hard as you can to keep your temperature within 10 degrees like so you don't want your temperature to much more than 10 degrees off from your high and your low so I usually like to do 65 to 75 ID foliate week 1 week 3 so right when I throw them in there I'll give them week D fully at once and that's just take all your big families and all that stuff off it's good for different like reasons like light penetration and get more light down to those smaller bud sides it also helps with the air flow back again so I'll do that week 1 week 3 there pretty much most strains are done stretching by that time almost done stretching by the time so I'll go through and the more you do fully there's a big reason why you do it it's innocent instead of the plant using all the energy for that to keep those leaves alive and keep growing new leaves those ones it takes all that energy that you take all those leaves off and it just puts all of the butts all that extra energy that would have been used to grow those leaves is now all gonna go to blood production which is what we're all looking for anyways right so that's my tips on that I didn't defoliate this time as good as I really wanted to as you can see but it's still getting the job done my lights in this setup I like to you run 14 to 16 inches away from the top of my canopy in those terms nutrients you don't want to over water your or over water or over feed the plants either because if you're starting to get like you know follow your feed schedule if you want to know what I use go ahead and reach out let me know I will tell you everybody runs different stuff so so follow your feed schedule but if you're noticing when you burn tips and stuff late kind of take it back and not flush your plants like so that's a good tip there and you don't know everything is different so do that flush your plants lay back on your nutrients a little bit if you're noticing burn tips and stuff because you don't want to get it build up in there and stop production pretty much no go I don't like my relative humidity going and you we're past 55 when I'm in flower just you start buying more risks of bud rot and all that stuff so really nice another important thing is that is your air flow I run my fan at nighttime to a little heater and humidifier in my room so do that and then flushing super important at the end especially if you're in soil and another tip about like in terms of like seeing burn tips and stuff like that is when you're in the soil and stuff like that here's a really good pro tip that a lot of people don't know starting out is when you're in soil like what you're noticing now happened days ago like a week ago it's not like hydro where it's like super noticeable right away and you can fix it right away so it's also gonna take that week to fix it and see corrections so don't go crazy and cause another problem trying to fix one problem but that's a good tip there flushing I usually start like three weeks before I know I'm gonna take them down I'm checking my trichomes and it's gonna help you through flavors and everything like that and your spoke quality I wanted to get my video done to show my cure tips and stuff but that'll come next weekend so if you're looking for that that's when that's going to be coming out I had to do this whole video on my phone because my Wi-Fi is out at home right now so I can't upload that video so that's why I'm doing this one today instead but yeah I hope this really helps somebody and when I'm flushing you know I'm starting three weeks before I'm flushing down to like 200 ppm is 100 ppm is because also if you ever test or notice like after you flush you'll be getting that reading but if you wait a couple days and try test your run off again you'll notice that your ppm rose again because your soils coming coming back to life so I like take a real low three weeks before 100 ppm is as close as I possibly can to my tap water and then I just give nothing but water after that Mike and I went doing that flush I use pH water after that I don't use anything so I hope that really really helps everybody have a wonderful wonderful day any more questions you know go ahead and reach out to me if you knew please subscribe I hope you enjoyed the video go check out my page I have all sorts of things you can find me on Instagram as well I'm pretty active there so I hope you all have a wonderful day I hope this helps somebody if it did give me a

advantage man take it down i'm in love with mary jane she's my main thing yo what's good guys g c d weed reviews uh medical marijuana purposes only i'm a licensed cardolo if you're not gotta go all right guys finally got a new strain from another producer all right baby agl all day all right let's do this [ __ ] got sativa on la or noah cg run lm i think it is yeah um or something like that anyways it's the love affair what the [ __ ] is the love affair never that it's hard to find bro it really is actually love affair is the [ __ ] gorilla glue crossed with the alien rock candy gorilla glue across the alien rock candy listen i got eight of this [ __ ] in this bag and my windows down on the highway and this [ __ ] was stinking my whole [ __ ] house reeks my kitchen was weakened this [ __ ] this [ __ ] [ __ ] stinks through the bag that's all i know is it sticks oh my god [ __ ] christ yeah it's a t-run lm and this isn't even like some [ __ ] crazy number she's collecting 24 thc um but again it [ __ ] reeks oh my god i didn't have to describe the smell but it's just so [ __ ] potent it's like it's like peppery it's like you know the gorilla glue smell like picture that time's like a thousand because that's the alien smell get this real deep foresty [ __ ] crazy like you're gonna [ __ ] just get stuck when you smoke your [ __ ] kind of smell oh yeah i'm excited this eighth looks big too wow see it looks really nice it's [ __ ] dude yeah yeah i'm [ __ ] really happy right now all right so let's check this [ __ ] out all right so there's a [ __ ] straight monster right there in the beginning middle elevator this is a big [ __ ] being [ __ ] look at this [ __ ] is crazy looking look at that it's just mean aggressive all right we'll get back to him but yeah the whole eighth itself all these buds [ __ ] mean and just nice looking hair look this [ __ ] nice look at that frosty ass [ __ ] it's been been a minute since we've had an agl straight over here there's that monster it's just the typical boom mean looking right oh man if you already got this you know the smell i'm talking about this [ __ ] just [ __ ] stinks it's so crusty the agl's got some [ __ ] fire they always did they got their gelato on the menu too kind of like fire strain don't sleep on the lotto it's still there okay so i gotta figure out exceptions i'm gonna go with this piece right here and uh this piece right here there's only two little med pieces that's them i'm good that's real good all right that [ __ ] okay and i'm pretty sure this shit's just 35 bucks for the eighth which is nice too so sideways that's all right nice now i know it's late as [ __ ] and not necessarily doing a sativa it's the best thing for bedtime situations but one we just came through today this is even fire and two um there's pretty much bit number one all all right [Music] so so that's nice and smooth but i mean they called really glue an indica but never look at it like that just makes me not want to move he knew he was going to do that oh that's nice yep it locks you right up the alien part of it obviously that's the glue i'm talking about the alien part of it really makes you feel kind of just sounds stupid but kind of spacey um she kind of stuck there kind of just really medicated all right all right we're gonna do ball number two i was gonna sit there while i upload this video again and just stare at the wall i'm sure good strain i mean steve with the squeaky strangers you really want to relax like it feels good daytime strain like this be kind of a uh do this in the morning make your day kind of just melt away and find it but it'd be nice but i often been taking it since i'm doing an agree i got the agl thca no hybrid all a oral solution i've been taking that [ __ ] by the syringe full this is fire i think it's the girl scout cookies you have to syringe the eyedropper thing yeah where you put your mouth that's good super pawn just like you'd expect any angels training to be five fire fire alright guys i'm out gcd reviews peace", "hwyhxIThFmg": "hey guys Nick with precision here and today we're gonna be talking about terpenes so we want to understand these compounds what they are how they occur in nature how we're extracting and isolating them so the first thing that I'd like to bring up is terpenes are actually a variety of organic compounds and these organic compounds are naturally occurring in all sorts of areas of nature the main things that you will find terpenes are in is cannabis conifer plants like pine trees spruce things like that are one of the most abundant sources as well as a variety of insects and even some mammals now it's it's interesting these compounds because they serve a variety of different purposes so in plants they're mainly signaling it's signaling for a predator to stay away or for a sweet you know delicious smell to be eaten by a certain mammal and there's kind of this underlying communication standard with these terpenes amongst everything in nature and in the universe and if you start looking at these compounds and where they're placed and what they do it's it's quite amazing the the matrix of what's there with that all being said you have other terpenes that are produced by insects that are produced by by mammals and these are actually produced in some cases biosynthetic aliso in many cases humans produce terpenes biosynthetic Lee meaning within our own body they come endogenously produced and our signaling receptors not only are they signaling mechanisms but they're also biosynthetic building blocks so a good example of this would be squalene and the steroids that are derived from that and things like that you can look into that but it's very very interesting so understanding these molecules and what they do is very very important to understanding why they're valuable to an extraction process and why they're valuable to the cannabis plant and with understanding all of this it's really important to know that they are anti microbials they're anti virals to help keep your body into a homeostasis into that balanced state that we've spoken about before so in many many cases there actually have a lot of similar properties that they exhibit on humans the same way cannabinoids do and the key to all this is that you get this entourage type effect and it's almost like nature's produced and packaged to this perfect little plant and this perfect little combination of terpenes and cannabinoids in order to aid a variety of medical conditions and bring your body back into balance now what we do at precision is we're highly focused around the extraction and isolation of these terpenes the extraction of isolation of these terpenes is a very special process because the molecules in and of themselves whether they're monoterpenes or sesqui terpenes or triterpene there's a bunch of different types of these terpenes but in general they're all very delicate when I say they're very delicate they're very prone to degradation they're very prone to really being diminished or their molecular structure being changed with any sort of heat any sort of excessive stress will say to that molecule without getting into overly technical terms so what we're trying to do from an extraction process is extract these very very gently extract them in a very low temperature and and do that in a manner that is going to actually render that molecule unadulterated in that extract well we commonly end up with as a process for extracting cannabis and extracting these terpenes that uses a very light hydrocarbon mainly butane or propane but most cases moving more towards a propane dominant blend not only we do do we do do that but we also actually take the plant and harvest the plant when it has peak terpene content and the peak terpene content ultimately is extracted with these very light hydrocarbons and we get this soupy sort of saucy type mixture and the key to this is being able to remove that solvent because that solvent is a very light hydrocarbon for example propane can boil off at negative 41 degrees and what we'll actually do is we'll just apply a very light heat so it'll be enough heat to remove the solvent but not enough heat to disturb or degrade any of those terpenes ultimately we can centrifuge those terpenes and separate them from the cannabinoids because the the two layers obviously separate able by the centrifugal force and we have a purified terpene compound and there can obviously be further from chromatography purification steps and things like that but isolating and extracting these cannabis-based terpenes are a key value stream and it's interesting to know that you can isolate these terpenes from many different types of plants now one of the things I said when we when we started out was conifer trees were one of the most abundant sources of terpenoids or terpenes in the in the world right now that that we know of and basically you get very high levels of Alpha and Beta Pi Neen that's why a pine tree alpha and beta piney and you can obviously put that one together but they also have things in there like limonene and lena law and these other different terpenes that kind of make this perfect package and turpentine ironically is mainly alpha and beta pining and it's used as an in cleaning a cleaning agent antiviral antibacterial and insecticide and for a variety of other uses works really well as a solvent in addition so the question is why can't we just isolate these terpenes from these high concentrated areas like say conifer trees and combine them back into cannabis well the answer is is that many state laws actually restrict the use of outside terpenes or non cannabis derived terpenes to be entered back into a cannabis based product so for example in states where we have like a metric system that has a traceability throughout the entire we'll call it seed to sale of the of the cannabis value stream they want those terpenes to be extracted isolated from the original cannabis crop and them to be re-used and re-entered into ultimately that suite of products that's going to be sold so understanding terpenes what they are what they do this level of science how to extract them isolate them refine them very very important to an extraction business it's very very relevant particularly in the cannabis space because most states don't allow for the use of outside terpenes to be reconstituted into a cannabis based product for traceability purposes so with that all being said I really hope you enjoyed our short talk today on terpenes hope you have a better understanding of what they are how they're relevant how they can aid in human health and conditions and how they are specifically relevant to the cannabis industry and how we use them within canvas thanks so much for watching we'll see you on the next video", "ZkztZdffAiQ": ">>JOY PURDY: NOW TO THE PUSH TO >>JOY PURDY: NOW TO

__ ] they're saying oh my people don't get depressing it actually I'm saying psychosis is a different thing okay okay I think we are discussing overall mental health yes I mean look I'm saying this because I really think that this is something that I've made a big turn over the last few years with myself that I don't quit bathroom break yes please go I don't think marijuana is as safe as I used to think it is I used to think it was benign I really used to think there was no big deal but I have a friend that I discussed the other day who was a really confident [ __ ] muscular a handsome man that never did anything and he took a marijuana edible to go to sleep and for two weeks this guy was like this is a different guy not that I was taught it's not Rafi no a different guy he took it and he experienced suicidal thoughts and and all these he had like severe consequences I think that the human beings we vary so much biologically that to just make this overall blanket statement of what's good for you is good for me is irresponsible and I've been irresponsible as saying that well one reason it's interesting what out reason I think that alcohol is so widely accepted despite all the problems it causes and again alcohol can certainly cause problems yeah is that alcohol affects most people pretty much the same way you know if and you sort of know if what somebody looks like when they have one drink when they have five drinks got some dress I've got some friends that get those gerbil eyes you ever see when they start talking crazy but you sort of know that and you sort of know how long it's gonna take to clear your body and you yes cannabis is so different it's a really complicated drug and it does affect different people in different yes and also the tolerance has changed yes so you know people say well two and a half milligrams of THC you vape it that's like one drink for somebody who you know who doesn't use but then if you if you're a tolerant user you can use 200 milligrams in a day that's 80 drinks it's a weird drug and then there's the issue of eating it yes when you eat it your body produces something called eleven hydrogen's on a tab alight it's a far more psycho action you were all along for the ride when that happens yes you are yes and it can take days for it to get out of your system I know many people have eaten marijuana edibles and then they call me up the next day like dude I'm still hot yeah yeah so so so I think I think the legalization community has sort of said for years like oh there's basically no downsides to this there's only upsides the cops will bus smokers they'll be tax revenue all these people have a way to get high that's clearly safer than alcohol and unfortunately that's just not true I think you're right and I think the the issue that people from what I've read are having with your book or people that are marijuana advocates that think that your position is unbalanced and that you've ignored the positive aspects of THC in terms of like what he was talking about cognitive benefits for people with psychotic episodes and that you were only focusing on the negative plead guilty today yeah because I think that for 20 years people have only heard the positive right eye I think that's I think that's also I'll plead guilty that myself because I think that I've only been discussing the positives and one of the things that I've tried very hard to do and one of the things I've learned how to do from doing this podcast and experiencing criticism and communicating with a bunch of different people with a lot of different viewpoints is examine my own positions and try to figure out am i coming at this from a truly balanced position or am i trying to support a conclusion that I started out with and I'm trying to you know somehow or another back up my own work or back up my own just my own statements and and and sort of prop them up instead of being really honest and objective right it's very difficult to do listen I wrote a book called tell your children that yeah about marijuana mental illness and violence you're I don't think you can you can think that that book is gonna be a compendium of the pros and cons above if you want to tell your children the truth though you really do want to tell them the pros and cons right and you did indicate Alex you said you know we should tell people the truth yeah in the book right so you know I think that when you're telling and you're saying that that you're telling the truth and Alex I'm agreeing with you that you're telling part of the truth right but part of the truth is you know a little bit deceiving and deceptive it in some ways right you want to tell the whole truth when you tell the whole truth then you give the whole story and then people can actually make you know a good informed decision based upon that like if people are going to just read one part of the story then of course they're going to make a decision just based upon that one part they're not going to make you know an informed decision based upon all of the price and because of that people are going to make you know some very poor choices I completely agree with that but to me the last 20 years have been an exercise in the other side in the legalization side doing a very very good job talking up its arguments and essentially there's there's almost nobody on the other side there's this one I bet what's got Jeff Sessions you had the [ __ ] goddamn attorney general that's telling people that good people don't smoke marijuana that's literally a quote yeah God that little morons not an office anymore but that's that's a terrible thing to say people don't smoke marijuana there's a lot of wonderful people who smoke - is not true and and and by the way I think this is a personal choice okay especially for adults yeah okay and and you can make bad personal choices you go look I play cards I'd love to play poker I'm said that on this trip to LA I didn't get to go to a poker room but you can go a new casino and you can see people of Los Angeles but you can go to a casino and see people who've lost their houses it doesn't mean that gambling should be illegal it also means that there's less and more dangerous forms that device in your hand where you can bet on what the next pitch is gonna be gonna be a ball or a strike yeah that's more dangerous than my having to drive to the commerce and play there and one hundred percent or 98 percent THC that an 18 year old vapes is a lot more dangerous than a 5 percent you know CBD 15 percent THC product the doctor heart might suggest his patient uses once a night to go to sleep but that that's the message that you know we should be putting out there right we shouldn't just be you know focusing on one side of the story like that part you know should also be you know and in the book and like you know your book you know in some ways has made me rethink the way that I write you know because my first book was co-authored with Jeremy cost and called friendly fire you know my second book that I'm writing now is called cannabis for PT G so it's how to transform post-traumatic stress into post-traumatic growth right because I feel that and you know we all know examples of people that have you encountered really difficult obstacles in their life and some people have you know succumb to that stress and they've gone down you know the wrong path kind of thing and then other people have used that stress to their advantage and they've actually become you know better because of it and you know CBD and THC can both help facilitate that process you know when you're looking at someone like like a veteran for example you know the hallmark of someone with PTSD is someone who doesn't leave their home and they can't sleep at night so like when I see a debt in my office a lot of the times they'll be leaving their home like five to ten days a month right so when you give them CBD and this is really important for people understand CBD has been shown to decrease learned fear that's incredible right so if you can get people outside of their home because I'm not talking about again you know someone who's you know too nervous to like go to a you know at the bar with like the friends or some like that I'm talking to people who like you know it's difficult for them to go to the grocery store just like pick up a few things so you know those are the type of people that I see in my practice with CBD is really excellent for that then when you look at you know the the nighttime component you know THC again is excellent for reducing nightmares that's been shown in studies and it was even shown with one pharmaceutical drug now blown again I don't really use now blown very much because it's only one cannabinoid and I do believe in the entourage effect and using all of the cannabinoids so I don't use that that much but that shows that she she can reduce nightmares and you know if you have you have you have PTSD I mean if you talk to someone who has PTSD and again this is this comes from a clinician support of you they will tell you I will try anything and that's the same way when you get with like you know the parents of kids who have see shoes all day nobody wants to see that yeah and like Alex you know if your kids you know ever started getting getting seizures which you know I hope I hope they don't because it's it's terrible you know what it can do to people but your when if that ever happened you know I would hope that you would consider you know CBD as a potential treatment I think she's not against that I think we have to be really clear as tension like CBD you know again CBD at all I don't know I don't think anybody is I think no one really is arguing except maybe the federal government in certain levels is arguing against CBD that's probably some pushback from the pharmaceutical industry the reality is CBD has proven to be at least as far as I've read very safe and very effective for a bunch of different disorders especially those that are about reducing and have it something do with inflammation or seizures yeah one of my good friends his son has developed seizures and CBD knocked it out just killed it this is very recently you know you're somebody who's you know who's a cannabis user you obviously know a lot of users why do you think it is that people you know in legal states where they can really express a preference they can go into a dispensary know exactly what they're buying why is it that they want such high potency THC product because they get used to it your tolerance develops it builds up you know every year we do this thing called sober October well we don't do any no drinking no no pot and then we do some sort of crazy challenge me and three of my buddies and when we do it what it's it's very interesting how your tolerance is radically reduced like I'll smoke pot at the end of that month and I'm like holy [ __ ] like I don't even know what I'm talking about in the mid-sentence and I'm just bullets creaked whereas you know now like I smoked a little weed last night did some stand-up had a great old time there's no issues with it at all but I'm used to it and if the weed that I smoked last I assume you don't smoke right I do not okay if you and me were together last night and I gave you a hit of my joint you'd be still there in the corner in the fetal position gone what and the [ __ ] is going on because the marijuana is ridiculously powerful but once you're accustomed to it once your body acclimates it's really not that big of a deal the problem is you you're dealing with a lot of habitual daily users and for those people like my friend Joey Diaz there's a video of him giving this other comedian how many milligrams of those stars of death Oh Tilly like when we give Owen what did he give oh I think just one he ruined his life and about 200 to 250 oh I made a video but the day changed Owens life like literally [ __ ] the guy's head up like he went outside he vanished he's gone yeah well I think I think there's a real argument to be made it's particularly with him well I was gonna make two points on that so you definitely can develop a tolerance yeah and I tell people all the time trying to take at least one three-week break but the evidence does show that if you stop for four weeks generally all your receptors return and it'll be like you've never used cannabis before yeah and that's even with people who are really really heavy users I can go back and get the study but I mean these people are you using I'm pretty sure it was like close like seven joints a day well really heavy users and noop dogs a good example of that you know my friend Tony Hinchcliffe his good buddies with Snoop Dogg and he said Snoop Dogg just smokes all day and he just like is always high and you know you're like well what do you do when you're not high he's like what I'm never not high so everything he does he is high as [ __ ] everything he does look for that guy it's not that big of a deal and for the way he lives his life like he's just a relaxed easygoing guy it's no problem you could be high all day and live his life and he's obviously wildly successful with this strategy yeah loudly second point I was gonna I was gonna make on that too though was there does not appear to be any tolerance at the cb2 receptor so she she attaches to the cb1 receptor and that's and that's where we know we can get tolerance you know some people you know they they have some pain they use some THC and sometimes they need a little bit more same sometimes asleep you know they use THC it'll work and then we'll stop working with CBD - we haven't seen that meaning like the people who you know get get seizure control generally they don't need to increase of dose like the girl I was talking about earlier you know I first subscriber I think when she was 20 and she was by him 20 she's 25 now she's never increased her dose and she's just used the same amount to CBD for the last think we should really stop talking about CBD I just wanted to make a note on the on the Italian someone I just want to make a note that CB to the doesn't appear to be tolerance it's all yeah it's just there's just such a significant impact when when it comes to especially edible THC it's a there's a significant impact on people's state of mind and it's not always good no that's just a fact we", "zkw7LmfNJ6o": "oh yeah mothers are always stigmatized mothers who their formula instead of breastfeeding stigmatize mothers who choose to send their kid back to daycare at six months and go back to work are stigmatized moms will always be harshly judged more harshly judged than anybody else but as soon as I became a mom I hit it it was a secret even though I have a prescription and I use it for medicinal purposes Vickey below lows is a month the growing number of women who use marijuana while breastfeeding and while pregnant even as medical experts warn against doing just that in fact a recent national survey Fallot there's been a two-fold increase in women using cannabis during pregnancy many of them do so to find relief from things like morning sickness chronic pain and depression among other ailments [Music] Vicki had suffered from debilitating migraines foreigners at age 18 she found what she says was the best remedy in the form of a joint the first thing everybody told me as soon as I got pregnant is you're gonna stop consuming cannabis right you're not gonna use kind of this while pregnant right and she did it during her first trimester she also stopped taking migraine pills it's been three days I'm in bed with a migraine I can't go to work I'm throwing up I can't eat like my body's in a state of distress like that can't be good for my pregnancy that can't be good for the baby that can't be good for me Vicky's doctor prescribed a morphine drip to ease the migraines but for her that didn't seem like the best option I decided to consume cannabis and within 30 minutes I did feel better and I did have relief why did you feel more comfortable using marijuana instead of using the morphine your doctor prescribed because it's an opioid and it's a proven addictive substance but if I continuously took and put it into my body not only would I be addicted but my baby would be addicted by drinking my breast fill I'm back I knew in my heart of hearts that there was other women and mothers out there like me that we're using cannabis for medicinal purposes instead of pharmaceuticals because they didn't want to use pharmaceuticals and I knew they existed I just never knew how to find them recreational cannabis has been legal in Canada since October 2018 and it's been possible to get a prescription for medical cannabis for almost ten years but a shift in the law doesn't always mean a shift in attitude in Quebec doctors are reluctant to prescribe I think there's a lot of a lot of fear a lot of worry when it comes to kids anything involving kids in cannabis and whether it's pregnant women with a fetus hysteria around that cannabis use is still stigmatized Jordana's of its key looks marijuana every single day before she was a mom she used cannabis to get a handle on her anxiety and depression and when she found out she was expecting so pregnancy for me was a nightmare I jumped to being pregnant my entire adult life and when it finally happened I was bedridden with symphysis pubis dysfunction and that's all so it's when you were and your pelvis basically separates from a hormone called relaxin in your body and it happened too early on at 18 weeks I was throwing up until I was 22 weeks pregnant it's up to three times a day if I hadn't used cannabis I'm a prenatal depression and anxiety was so severe that I was not able to get off my couch even in the severe pain that I was dealing with physically it was really bad for me mentally and cannabis was the only release that I got from pain and from the anxiety that Jordanna was reluctant to use cannabis at first but changed her mind after coming across studies conducted in Jamaica back in the 90s that research found that babies born to mothers who consumed marijuana heavily during pregnancy didn't suffer any psychological or neurological setbacks after birth that was enough for Jordanna to take the plunge well I knew that it was working for me and I continued to advocate for myself with my doctors Jordanna was desperate for support and someone to talk to about her marijuana use that need led her to start a cyber support group for other moms in a similar situation that's how she met Annie clawed Bertrand another young mom who turned to cannabis during a difficult pregnancy the two teamed up to create Mother's marry mother's Mary is a not-for-profit organization that empowers and supports moms to live their most authentic lives using cannabis consciously through introspection and attempt right now we are an online peer support group and essentially everyone can utilize the group every day and you know be supported and empowered in that in that space they come to us with questions we accordi three new members today I feel like our Facebook group is growing at a rapid pace today with the exposure in our local community it's proving that like there's you think there's a stigma that comes with being a mom there's a ginormous stigma that's why we're moving our movement for us it's really important to not say terms like stoned or high now or baked like that's not that's not where what's going qualify though I'm Olivier listed faded and yes medicated you guys have a whole slew of synonyms yeah for marijuana and for the feeling of vampire on it yeah [Music] [Music] Annie has two kids and didn't touch marijuana during her first pregnancy but her symptoms both physical and emotional became unbearable with baby number two I vomit up to three or four times a day like being in meetings that were having fun run out and just being like I cannot wait to go home and just have it blend a little puffs like have dinner and try to keep it down you know it's really people I think people underestimate morning sickness like it's really debilitating postpartum depression just took me to the very deepest darkest depths of my life and I didn't know how I was gonna come out felt very suicidal and if it wasn't for cannabis thing I would be I would be divorced or I wouldn't be here we want to give women the pros and the cons and then you make your own decision based on what's right for you what's best for you like your own risk benefit ratio and analysis you know as well yes you advocate for themselves to go to their doctors and other doctors their family members their spouses whoever and are you showing the research article oh yeah oh yeah what do you say to the medical evidence that suggests we're not entirely sure if or how harmful this could be to kids mm-hmm I think that what we have to remember is that no mother is taking this lightly it's definitely not moms who don't need medication who are doing this recreationally that's not what we're talking about but what exactly does the medical evidence suggest we know that marijuana exposure during pregnancy affects the brain of the developing baby dr. katrina mark is an ob/gyn who has closely studied marijuana use during pregnancy the effects of marijuana on the developing fetus are much more long-term than immediate and so you may not be able to see them directly after birth but long-term the effects could range from no discernible difference to difficulties with learning learning disabilities attention disorders and even mental health disorders the response when I tell people that it can be harmful is often but it's not really proven right which I disagree with it is proven that it crosses the placenta and it has effects on the baby's brain and so although I can't show you a picture of exactly what your baby's going to look what like the way I can with something like fetal alcohol syndrome the changes with marijuana exposure are much more nuanced they're not seen five minutes or five days or even five months after birth typically they're not seen for five ten fifteen years and so they're much harder to study and much harder to characterize although pregnant women may experience relief from morning sickness after smoking a joint dr. mark doesn't want women to turn to marijuana as a first resort marijuana use during pregnancy has risks to both mom and baby and I would encourage any women who is using they're considering using it to talk to her doctor about the risks of use and about the potential safer alternatives in the same breath I think that we all need to distinct Nancy and outside of pregnancy because the stigma that surrounds marijuana use some pregnancy makes women feel uncomfortable disclosing their use and if they don't disclose their use to their doctors they can't make an informed decision because they're not receiving the information about the risks Viki never told her doctor that she smoked marijuana while pregnant as with any medication just like morphine or anything else they ask you if the risks outweigh the benefits and for me they did I don't think I would have made it through my pregnancy I don't think I would have been okay to make it through if I wasn't able to medicate when my migraines were that bad I would have ended up in the hospital and I would have ended up on a morphine drip and those have known and proven side effects they're known and proven but th is unknown and unproven that you were using marijuana while you were pregnant my parents my sisters my husband would we eat after Bach you need a diaper were you ever worried about people knowing only in the sense that the fear that maybe they would call child services on me that my child would get taken away from me was that a real concern were you afraid yeah it wasn't actually very afraid I was actually very afraid that I would have been seeing like a drug addict when I clearly wasn't how did you get over that fear I guess I didn't I really I guess I didn't I live without fear my whole pregnancy Oh mommy's here you're so sneaky Spears and sense of isolation went away when she discovered mothers marry online after her son was already born hey Vicki we're so excited today to officially be offering you at your role and we also are gifting you of course you're very excited she even ended up joining the team I put myself out there and um I feel like just so blessed that I was so well received and everybody was so kind to me and so supportive of me and I instantly found the community that you know I loved and here was a bunch of women that I never met I didn't know them personally but I loved them and that when they would write something in the group or comment something I worried about them and I cared about them and that was something I had never found before and as a mom for me it was just life-changing I don't know how else to describe it here we so emotional I know [Music] is it worth the risk um yeah it is worth the risk I know that it made me better I've seen my children from having them in my bellies to the age that they are now and they've hit every milestone they're developing beautiful ease [Music] I don't think cannabis is for everybody especially if you don't suffer from anxiety mental health or fibromyalgia or epilepsy or multiple sclerosis there's a bunch of the elements that cannabis does has been proven to help with so if you don't suffer from one of those things and I don't think you know you really need to consider it but I definitely think you need to consider it if you aren't being prescribed morphine or effects or or serafall and you're pregnant I think that it's a much better medical benefit for yourself and for your child I do stand by that and as opposed to poo as opposed to pills as opposed to pharmaceuticals with with proven by effects with proven site like birth defects in children kind of a saved my life so I don't think I would be here without it being a mom and suffering from severe postpartum depression the cannabis is really the only thing that kept me feeling like I had hope and if I haven't gotten my medical cannabis good morning I'm a new member from Quebec I felt very alone in my universe of a mother smoker they also feel better when he smoked when I'm under the effect of marijuana you

for the national marijuana news now this may not feel like much of a culture story but I would argue that it is see the prohibition of marijuana has played a very large role in shaping the culture of marijuana prohibition turned cannabis use into this underground thing that involved dark alleys and basements and toweling doors but now that there are 33 states that have legal medical marijuana markets and ten states that permit recreational use stories like the one out of Tampa recently where three officers were fired for confiscating weed and never reporting it well that's like a flash back to the 90s Florida even has a fairly relaxed medical marijuana program with over 200,000 patients now these officers shut off their body cameras confiscated wheat from the people they pulled over and never filed reports it's hypocrisy like this that molded the culture of cannabis it's also why the fight to end prohibition carries on despite how far it has come now you tell me how was the war on drugs ever going to work if our own authorities cannot restrain from partaking themselves it's this sort of stuff that proves the prohibition nurtures crime and is the real corrupting power behind even the most noble of professions but hey without stories like this would we be who we are today you know smoking out of apples and learning the metric system let us know what you think in the

[Music] [Applause] hi i'm matthew carr chief trend strategist for the oxford club and thank you for watching this episode of market trends so there have been a lot of fantastic performances from cannabis plays over the past nine months or so in fact some have soared so much that many investors feel they may have missed the boat but don't worry there are a lot of great companies in the cannabis space and today i'm going to share my favorite undervalued pot stock so last year cannabis enjoyed this epic rebound after two brutal years of the longest bear market in the nascent industry's history shares of many american cannabis companies surged to new all-time highs we saw the u.s marijuana index outpace the broader markets by a significant margin gaining more than 61 percent last year but i want to stress that out performance fails to truly capture just how massive the turnaround was for for for the industry from its march lows the u.s marijuana index rocketed more than 313 percent higher to close out 2020. now all in all it was an historic year for american cannabis but i believe this is only the first step of the next leg higher i've long forecast that the american cannabis industry would be worth approximately 80 billion dollars by the end of the decade by 2030 and from where we stand now that estimate might be a little conservative after a clean sweep on election day one of the only undisputed victories of this past election the u.s now has 15 states that allow for adult use and 36 that allow for medical use here i expect that pace to pick up speed in fact i believe as many as a half dozen states could debate expanded legalization this year the coasts are filling in with recreational markets and even though the east coast has largely legalized medical use with that recent recreational approval in new jersey i expect this situation to change quite rapidly so i believe my home state of maryland will likely debate adult use as will connecticut new mexico new york pennsylvania rhode island and virginia there's this tremendous pressure to recoup you know all the tax revenue as well as provide more jobs due to the economic devastation triggered by the pandemic that alone will foster an accelerated pace of legalization cannabis strolled into 2021 on this high but the results of the recent two georgia senate seat uh runoff elections will now have profound impacts on the industry remember the house controlled by democrats passed the safe banking act in 2019 but this bill was basically set in the corner to rot in the senate you know the republican trolled uh legislator just refused to vote on it in 2020 the house passed the moore act again the senate refused to even vote on this bill these are two uh pro-marijuana measures that would completely change the industry now for the past several years i've argued that the senate is where cannabis legislation goes to die and that's because cannabis has you know unfortunately become this partisan issue democrats are in favor of legalization republicans tend to not be so for example on the house vote of the moore act of all the nays almost all of them were republican but now the situation has completely changed now the floodgates are poised to open because of those uh results of those georgia elections so for investors the big question is what are my favorite ways to play this well my top plays haven't changed from what i've talked about over the past year grow generation the largest hydroponics retailer in the us is still a fantastic option to me shares are up almost a thousand percent over the past year but as the market expands you know this will continue to be a big winner cura leaf the largest multi-state operator or mso in the u.s is my top plant touching plate you know shares have more than doubled over the past year the company is also reporting record-breaking revenue numbers not just for itself but the entire cannabis industry no one else is reporting uh revenue numbers anywhere near as high as cure leaf is and i still like the msos green thumb industries and true leaf both of which are reporting more than 100 million dollars in quarterly revenue but with all that being said there is a company i believe that is about to play ketchup and that's cresco labs the mso is headquartered in chicago and it's a company i've followed for many years it currently operates 19 dispensaries and 15 production facilities in nine states and six of those nine states are billion dollar plus markets but cresco is taking a kind of a different route it's taken the consumer packaged goods approach to the industry for example several years ago it teamed up with james beard award-winning chef mindy siegel to produce mindy's a line of edibles and it's this cpg approach that is the key to cresco's success because its products are now found in more than 830 dispensaries across the u.s and it has more than 5 000 skus in production right so this is all paying off for cresco as it's recently joined the 100 million dollar plus quarterly revenue club in the third quarter the mso reported 153.3 million dollars in revenue that was a 63 sequential increase sequential from the second quarter even better adjusted ebata soared 182 percent to 46.4 million dollars but on the horizon things are still looking exceptionally strong for the fourth quarter we're looking for a 292.7 increase year-over-year in sales to 162.5 million dollars and for 2021 revenue is projected to top 806 million dollars as it reports profits of 21 cents per share all right so those are a lot of numbers but that is a lot of upside now here's the deal while shares of cure relief at green thumb even planet 13 true leave and others have more than doubled over the past year shares of cresco have gained about 78 still beats the market uh still a fantastic gain but that is trailing uh those leading peers but i think with the growth cresco has ahead as well as the prospects for the entire cannabis industry not just this year but for several years to come i think cresco's shares are really about to pick up speed in 2021 and so this is a company that i think you're looking for an undervalued kind of forgotten in the shuffle play in cannabis this is a perfect opportunity well i'm matthew carr chief trend strategist for the oxford club thank you for watching this episode of market trends for more information like this be sure to go down to the description and sign up for my free e-letter until next time here's to how returns", "TvB7hAZkRig": "it's a really beautiful day isn't it the sun is shining and the weather is just perfect you know what else is perfect the date April 20th or in this case 420 now what some of you may not realize is that 420 is the most famous staple in the marijuana industry however some of you may not actually know the true story behind 4/20 you see one day a group of high school students known as the Waldos had secretly hidden a stash of marijuana somewhere around their campus and they would always have the time when they would go out and begin their weed smoking adventures can you guess what time it was exactly 4/20 so yeah so this sort of became the code phrase for when these Waldo's would go out and start smoking this marijuana and pretty soon the whole town was aware of their actions and there was even an article about them for the high times now looking out into the crowd right now I see some faces of shock or disbelief from some of you well why though just because I'm talking about marijuana just because I speak about it with such ease you know I've noticed how our country has become so conservative and afraid about this one topic that they considered talking about it a giant taboo however marijuana is not something that we should fear if we were to look past all the bad rep and controversy that marijuana has received in the past we would Seeley we would truly see the truth the truth of how marijuana is not a menace at all and that is what I'm here to talk to you about today the real truth behind marijuana see now if I'm going to explain the truth you all I'm going to start from the beginning the earliest traces of marijuana can be found in 8000 BC Taiwan and it was used as courts for pottery and other local artistry it was so old in fact that some scientists have even speculated that marijuana has had a tenth in development of modern-day society from Taiwan it diffused all around in the world from South Asia to South Africa to South America and even a Middle East finally arrived in America around the nineteen hundreds it was brought to America and mostly diffuse around the southwestern regions of the United States from Mexico you see marijuana has been was brought to Mexico from Mexican immigrants who were fleeing from the Mexican Revolution of 1910 to 1930 R of merit the true American fear of marijuana had began you see Americans at the time were so afraid of the minority race which was the Mexicans that they associated everything and anything that was related to them evil or hazardous and this included marijuana and because of this by 1931 marijuana has been banned over twenty-nine states across the country but I believe it was banned wrongfully yes sir ladies and gentlemen because what people during the nineteen hundreds filled to realize is that marijuana can be very beneficial and helpful to our society and health and medical benefits allow me to elaborate you see over the past few decades marijuana has been found to be the key to many disease to the cure of many diseases and illnesses take for instance glaucoma you see glaucoma is a condition for the eye that consists of pressure that causes a reduction in the peripheral vision and even blindness the only way to lessen the effects of glaucoma is to lessen the inter ocular pressures with him to eye and wouldn't you know what marijuana does just that you see marijuana contains an active compound known as THC and THC is a type of cannabinoid which you didn't if you didn't know how would have sort of psychoactive effects in the body in the mind and this is sort of where the hi comes from that everybody's this associates marijuana with so the conducted a study conducted by the National Eye Institute revealed that marijuana has been found to be the key to the reduction of the internal air pressures with the eye furthermore marijuana has been found to be the key to the stop of cancer sells because you see cancer cells contain a certain gene known as ID one and ID one is responsible for the replication and multiplication of marijuana across the body and throughout your cells now if this cell were if this gene were to be turned off then the spread of cancer cells would solely dissipate and even kill them as a result and again marijuana does just that you see a study conducted by the California Pacific Medical Center in 2007 showed that when breast cancer cells were exposed to marijuana their id-1 expression had lowered and had overall killed the cells now as you can see marijuana has been found to be very beneficial and could really save a lot of lives if it was more accepted by society however I'm not gonna be I'm not gonna stand up here and defend marijuana marijuana's negative actions in society from gangs to crimes to many negative factors in our society I know in times such as these high school students such as myself have not been able to achieve their full potential because of marijuana however we as a society can change that if we were to band together and put the positive side of marijuana first and push out the negative side then we would truly have a better future and a way to do this is if we were to restrict the use of miracle of medical marijuana to just medical uses and to put a more strict hold on the recreational side if we were to do this then basically all the crime and negative factors of marijuana would slowly dissipate and our society can started anew by then we would be able to start and better and brand new society by then we would further our society to new levels and I'm not afraid to say it I believe that marijuana can take our society to a new high sorry bad plan backfired anyways my name is sa Parkman runnin and thank you for letting me speak to you today [Applause]", "Jjz_wX3PQkM": "all right so I got this one here called Afghan Kush by pure Sun farms and it's coming in at eighteen point seven percent THC or if you want to save milligrams at one hundred and eighty seven milligrams I got this like a couple weeks ago I've just man I'm still going through my OS 220 there it's like endless the 28th thing anyways when was this packaged Oh 8 19 August 19th so maybe a little dry I don't know well I assume so actually because because I know these guys they like to have their stuff all dry day what it seems but anyways let's just take a look here first I'm gonna first I'm gonna check this though we got a make sure 100 point zero because that's how you do it let's say you gotta make sure it's accurate right so here we go 100 point 0 gram weight look at that that's accurate that's what that little triangle means so we're gonna take that off put this on and hit the tare so if we set this to 0 so this container counts as nothing right now thinks there's nothing Casey didn't ever know what that means that's what that means ok so as usual it's in these shitty bags I hate but I hate all the things that they that this stuff comes in so this is no preference really I hate all of the methods they use [Music] he's got these weird slidewalks they're gonna slide it there we go okay so I'll trade this kind once before the last time I tried it was alright well there's some nice big buds in there it's kind of hard to see it's so dark in this bag there you can see a little bit a little bit see a little bit okay let's pour it on here here we go is the big test pure Sun firms here we go oh shit a little pee oh my god there's stuff flying all over the place that and this maybe they did it they did it normally I wouldn't like to have stuff go flying out of the the screen like that but they can't really help but plus it ended up being a being the right weight anyway so you know whatever can't complain there but I can't complain about these fucking stems though look at this shit look at this fucking thing they could have easily broken those off instead they decided to send their garbage to me so these are the biggest buds I've ever gotten from pure Sun farms I can't believe that these three and this is the 3.5 but it is we just check that right so let's have a close look at the here alright so I actually looked at all the trichomes on these and already opened up but it turns out I forgot to press record on the camera fired so I didn't get any of the trichome video so let's redo that whole part right now I will check out the outside and when I checked it last time actually having the outside was okay but the inside was really nice and look right there what are those big blobs that trichomes they look a little bigger than normal but they're nice and kind of maybe they combine and meet super ones they very amber sort of a look to it here see the outsides this is the outside again here they look okay but I mean stuff got knocked off in the bag and you know they look a little old some of the some of them they're they have a sort of a little old look a bit but not not nearly as bad as the the glow buds look where do they all go they're all missing where'd they go [Laughter] anyways yeah I'm not super impressed by the outside well I'm also not unimpressed I'm kind of in the middle it looks like right here is a nice patch look at this this is the outside on this one so this one's nice I didn't see this part earlier that's kind of nice to get a little bit of a sort of an amber nest it it's C it's like Tianjin some of them not as much that it's just cloudy but break down here some more cloudy ones yeah it's sort of a mix of cloudy and amber anyways any questions I'm open to take a look at sine is so dry but since I missed all that let's just break over another one here that my guess why not this one oh my goodness [Music] it's just dust everywhere okay well let's check it out oh now that looks nice doesn't it it's a lot in there there's a bunch more yeah there's quite a bit inside it's just the microscope there we go Howie I see that looks okay nothing super crazy but it looks decent look down there you can see they're all sort of an amber color to them maybe I can super zoom on that let me see if I can get super zoom on that yeah I got a bit of a super zoom on some of these guys let's see it's a mix of cloudy and amber colored that's nice and anyway so look at this mess we go try the soup alright so I just got back inside from testing this and the stuffs not very impressive you know the first time I had it it was okay and this time it's just kind of you know yeah it's not so good but you know it's not the worst but it's definitely I think the thing that really kills it is the yeah how old it is it's four months old or so I don't know it's just so dry it's like really dry and I don't know I think that really needs to be at best before date on these or something because this does not it feels like it should have been better than this but I don't know I I guess I would buy it again but only if there was no other options you know cuz there's other good ones out there like good supply yeah has jean-guy and royal highness and they're usually better than this and they're slightly cheaper than this too so it's hard to hard to go with this when there's that and they're readily available you know but anyways it's not the worst subscribe if you want see more videos I got more stuff to open here soon already so yeah anyways we'll see you later have a going happy new years and all that see ya [Music] you", "9ioJbVyNg08": "[Music] when I talk with people about cannabis they think they know everything about it everyone is familiar with the use of cannabis in medicine and I guess part of you are familiar with the use for other purposes in the last three years I'm managing one of the biggest and most advanced laboratory in the world for cannabis research if there is something I learned in these three years is that I don't know anything and that we are just starting to scratch the beginning of understanding this complex plant people are saying cannabis can kill cancer cells what's the meaning of it does it kill all types of cancers which cannabis in my lab alone I have more than 550 different strains of cannabis which one of them affect which types of cancer the truth we don't know that cannabis can really treat cancer or other diseases yes I assume it can a good friend of mine the head of the pain department in one of the biggest hospitals in Israel told me that when he started to treat with cannabis one of his first patient was an old lady they suffer from pain from chronic pain and nothing else helped her so he started to treat with cannabis and after a few weeks he called her and asked her how she was feeling Oh doctor it's great it's amazing it's totally changes my life he was surprised or weenie that it really eliminates the pain oh no doc for the painting didn't help but now my grandson coming to visit me every evening so how cannabis is affecting us so powerfully on the cannabis flowers there are cells that produce unique compounds these compounds called cannabinoids and these compounds are unique since our body can produce similar compounds actually in our body we have a special and important system called the endocannabinoid system this system regulate relax eat sleep forget and protect all these important processes and cannabis compounds affect our body through this machinery I will give you one example there is two ways to feel hunger one it through our stomach and one through our head when we are not eating for a long time our stomach shrink and we feeling hungry but how many times do we eat even when we are not hungry we're finishing a huge meal we cannot breathe with totally full and then come the dessert it is not your blame it's all the endocannabinoid system believe me using cannabis in medicine it's not something we invent in the last year's did you know that cannabis is one of the ancient plant human being used as a medicine the Chinese use it thousands of years ago as a major medicine the Egyptian use it to treat glaucoma on information till 1937 more than 100 illnesses were treated with cannabis if you will open a medicine book from 1920 and they did it important half year ago you will find out that the whole chapter is dealing with cannabis and illnesses so think about it it's crazy for 5,000 years it was the major medicine for mankind and in the last 80 years it just disappeared so how cannabis came back to the medical arena Charlotte Figi was born in 2006 in Colorado when she was three years old sorry when she was three months old she started to suffer from seizures she had more than 50 seizures a day till she was five years old she already tried every medicine on earth and nothing helped her by then she already lost her ability to walk talk and eat she was about to die when she started to use cannabis it's totally stopped her seizures from fifty seizures a day to one or two seizures a week and then totally eliminated shall not use cannabis with very low amount of THC the only compound that have psychoactive activity in the in the cannabis so actually he didn't made her to feel to be high or stoned but it still eliminate the seizures two months ago a guy came in my lab with a small bottle in his in his hand and asked for my help this guy Daniel told me that his wife had a small car accident four years ago and since then she started to suffer from seizures for a whole year she was in and out the hospital tried to find a medicine to help her to reduce the seizures after one year a friend of Daniel came with an extract that he did from cannabis and when Dania suave started to use it it stopped totally her seizures after 14 months this extract start to run down so Daniel came back to his friend to made a new one unfortunately the new one didn't work at all Daniel's wife used cannabis with low TT in high CBD like shallow but we have hundreds of strange like that every one of them contain different combinations of cannabinoids so actually it's a different medicine how can repeat how can we repeat the treatment for two years Daniel did hundreds of extract and did three months ago bingo he succeed to find the one that reduces wife seizures again when we started in my lab to work with cannabis and to check how its affect cancer we find out that there is a specificity between the types of the cannabis and its ability to attack cancer cells cannabis number one will kill colon cancer but will do no harm to prostate cancer but cannabis number two will do no harm to the colon cancer but will kill the prostate cancer but what are the differences between cannabis number one to cannabis number two what are the differences between the cannabis the Daniels wife is using now to the hundred she tried in the last two years you will be surprised to learn that nobody in the world can give you this answer even though there are over than 100 cannabinoids and a total of over than 500 active compounds in the cannabis we are we are able to identify just fuse them physician prescribed cannabis all over the world but on this prescription there is no specificity to the types of the cannabis not dosage or where was where of administration how can we repeat a success treatment if we don't know what are the compound the active compounds that affect the patient in order to answer part of this question we develop in my lab a unique method to under fight all the active compounds of cannabis today we are not blind anymore on top our basic research in cancer and in in oral disease we are doing we are running the database project in this project today in Israel every cannabis that the patient can get in Israel every time that a girl pick a batch or make an extract it's coming through my lab first and we're doing full identification on the other hand we are following up on the patient and trying to understand which type of cannabis effect which types of disease the idea is to merge these two arms and to say in these 30 strains these 30 strains elevate appetite in 80% of the patient what are the common compounds in these strains that are not existing the strength and not elevate appetite and to this to take to animal model clinical trial to make it evidence base two years ago we started to treat autistic kid very severe autistic kids in Israel with cannabis these kids most of them didn't communicate at all most of them not even in I contact this kid are very violent for themselves and the surroundings sometimes walking with their hand tied some time walking with the helmet on the head because they can knock the head to the wall and team they're fighting these kids getting cannabis with very no amount of THC the only psychoactive compound so they are not stoned or high but still we see a phenomenal result most 78% success with these kids on many parameters the cannabis reduce anxiety in these kids it reduced violence it's improved their sleep think about the child 17 years old they still seven times a night waking up every night with shouting and now he's sleeping all night but even the most incredible thing it's improved in the communication a mother called me and told me that her her son 19 years old kid was hospitalized for four years because his was very violent but two months just two months after he started to get cannabis he was released home because there was nothing to do with him in the hospital anymore when he came home it was an evening so his mother asked him what he wants for dinner and for the first time the first time in his life he looked in her eyes and said in egg this mother told me that you don't understand it's not that my child is normal now he didn't ask scrambled egg with onion but when from the moment he was born I'm reading stories to these kids I'm talking with him I'm asking questions he know what it is an egg he knows what he wants to eat I didn't waste all my life these things changed this family's life two months ago the companies that supply the extract the cannabis extract to these families had the problem with the crop it's a plant it didn't grow well so they had to create to produce an extract with similar strain again high CBD low THC ratio 20 to 1 so similar that this company so that they can say that it's actually as the original one but after few days the dream crashed these kids become violent again one kid went through went through the window when the window was closed and cut his body all over one kid jump on his mother 17 years old kid jump on his mother and beat her in a way that she had to get medical care and father called me less than two weeks ago and told me that his son had such a burst of violence that in order to control him by accident his broke his both hands since we have in our database exactly what these kids got before we were able immediately to identify the changes between the original strain to the strain they are getting now and to direct them to a different company that has similar cannabis to the original one for the first time we were able to help these kids to get the right treatment for the first time we are able to help Daniel's wife to understand what she is getting and to repeat the success treatment I am a scientist I have a laboratory for cancer research in the Technion the Technology Institute of Israel I am NOT a big fan of cannabis and if it was a spinach of petunias was better for me it was much easier but it is cannabis and what I did learn in the last three years that this plant have an enormous potential to treat many illnesses whether we like it or not it is here and it's not going we cannot take it away any more from the kids that have 200 seizures a day and now there are seizure free we cannot take it away anymore the autistic kids that it changed their life and their family's life we cannot take it away anymore from the PTSD patient that for years didn't sleep a whole night and now we can came back to normal life we need to understand that cannabis won't go anywhere it's give hope to many people today it should be another option in the toolbox of the physician to treat the patient it is our responsibility to learn how to use it better and how to precise it it's our responsibility to take it to the next level we the scientist the physician the community oh it to our patients thank you very much [Applause] [Music]", "YtZIItDKzEg": "banning then wrong smoking weed

everybody welcome back to chef Judy's TV on today's episode of in the kitchen we're gonna be cooking cannabis infused cooking oil so what I have right here I have about 34 grams of shake I have about two cups of cooking oil and have about two cups of butter this video is sponsored this video sponsored by blessings on blessings dispensary in LA there are just 2157 west century Boulevard on the corner of Van Essen century so if you guys are ever in LA go ahead and check them out I'll leave all their informations in the description box down below but yeah they actually provided me with the shake for you guys that don't know what shake is shake is basically the leaves that fall out put a flower and settle at the bottom of the container this is some really high-grade shake it came from a high-grade plant if you guys get if you guys that's not as very much like you're just filling up my whole house my neighbors won't be big on big beech over here some but yeah so blessing a blessing dispensary supplied me with the shake shout out to my homie swag City over there he didn't want to subscribe me with the shake thank you guys for sponsoring this video but without further ado we gonna jump into it alright so the first thing we want to do is we want to decarboxylate the weeds basically we want to activate that Tec so the way we do that is we throw it in the oven a 250 degree oven for about 25 minutes and it activates that THC that way we can put it into oil and do a further second step to activate the marijuana into the oil so I'm gonna go ahead and throw this in the oven and I'll see you on about 25 minutes alright peace so it's been about 25 minutes we just got the weed out of the oven as you can see I got separated to two piles 17 grams each like I said if you guys can see that color it got a little bit darker so now all that has to do is add the week to the jars and put the jars in a double boiler not really a double boiler I'm gonna do is put the jar and in a pot in the water that's slightly boiling like a like a mouth simmer you want the water to be about maybe 200 degrees and you want to put that in the water for about an hour and a half - two hours all right so now we're just going to transfer the weed to the jar I like to use the napkins cause as you can see it transfers very easy yeah I can see downtown let's begin for a same thing with your butter sack just to the butter so once again that's 17 grams of shake and about 2 cups of oil 2 cups of fat if you want to use the flour you can use a flower but cut that use about maybe a 8 3.5 grams of flour because the flour has more THC to the shanks so we're gonna have to go ahead and throw this into our boiler that got fitted over here slightly balding and we're gonna leave that in there for about an hour and a half to two hours we go come back and start pretty ugly I'll see y'all when it's finished all right peace alright everybody so a bit about an hour and a half we can go ahead and take these off now this one was my butter so we're going to do the butter first we got our storage containers right here this was restored in we got our strainer we also use coffee filters excreted and also this would be a double strain on there right oh so we don't do that like that big I like that hopefully I won't make a mess I'm kind of rushing because I got a I got a flank that I'm leaving for in an hour so kind of rushing but we still gonna do this the right way alright so this been in the pot boiling for about an hour and a half now we're just gonna strain it out and store it and that's all there is to it and that's how you make the butter and the oil alright so go ahead goodies over here at that point we make a mess kind of hot really I really wanted to use cheesecloth but I don't useful it's gonna take forever I'm just using the gate to squeeze not everything all - next one medicated [Music] [Music] sorry about the TV in the background I forgot to take that TV off okay it's not good like I said I'm Russian so I'm gonna do a better video I'm doing better videos to show y'all how it's really done but coming with a rush but like I said I'm leaving in an hour to go to Atlanta once again a shout-out to my sponsors blessings on blessings dispensary on the corner of venice and century in los angeles if you guys are in the area please check them out tell them chef doing since you get some good herbs all right [Music] got all that that's real strongly medicated so here we have our butter and here we have our olive oil there we have people Canada's tenderloin like I said you can use this in all kind of applications you could just do it on your bread you could put it on steak chicken fish whatever you wanted to use it for we have our butter and we have our olive oil or I was a lot of butter butter olive oil I don't know I got confused I'm confused right now I've got a flavor in our anyway as always if you don't like what y'all saw here hit that like

them independently you'd say that they were both sugar but when you look at them side by side you'd honestly say that they're kind of different looking concentrates [Music] today i'm dabbing on one of my personal favorite consistencies this is called sugar starting to sesh off with this live sugar from grassroots oh god that looks beautiful that sugar is such a pretty bright yellow color all right i'm just gonna dunk it right in there oh ah delicious man holy crap [ __ ] yeah that treyo g is a really dank earthy flavor that's [ __ ] fire got a little bit of sweetness on the back end too it's pretty nice there's a lot of different words that people use to describe cannabis concentrates some of the most popular are ones like shatter sugar butter wax sauce diamonds the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of a concentrate not the actual quality so one isn't necessarily better than the other just based off of its consistency but today we're going to take a deeper look into sugar wax it's a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a dispensary before you've probably seen it on the shelf at least it's created through a solvent extraction process just like shatter or wax but it's not necessarily better or worse than any other consistency it's just different everyone has their preference but personally i think this is one of the better consistencies all around i just think it usually has a nice terpene profile and it's easy to work on a dabber but i don't want to put too much emphasis on the importance of a consistency honestly i've had consistencies change on me before i finish smoking the concentrate honestly if you leave shatter sitting out in the open on a warm day it's not too rare to see it sugar up there's actually a lot of science that's involved when it comes to making concentrates it's a little overwhelming when you just look at it but sugar is really just a term used to describe any sort of cannabis consistency that kind of resembles like a wet sugar there's not just one way to get to the finish line here but no matter how you make it sugar typically has great effects a great smell and a great flavor but it's very sticky and crumbly i don't recommend using your hands on this concentrate i recommend getting a dab tool and scooping it up the stickiness really helps to stick to the tool usually let's just get a nice little chunk on here and get a little bit more than that oh yeah now we're talking i really like this little scooper dabbers i feel like you can get a decent amount of concentrate on them when i'm dabbing on a cloud banger with a turf pearl in it i usually wait about 90 95 seconds before i take my dab we're at 90 seconds right now so let's go for it oh yeah it's gonna be a good tent oh yeah it's perfect god damn i just love weed man it's the best i'm assuming that's something we can all agree on here dude just smoking and dabbing it's just incredible but anyway sugar wax is often found as either a cured or a live resin and the only real difference between live resin and cured resin sugar is that live resin sugar was made with fresh frozen material while cured sugar was made with fully cured cannabis but the main difference between the two is typically with live resin you're going to have a more noticeable terpene profile but it's usually around the same thc sugars usually tend to be around 70 to 90 percent thc sometimes with live resin sugars companies will just get little thc diamonds and sprinkle live resin terpenes on top of that until it's like a little sugary consistency and then they call that sugar there will be a saucy coating over the diamonds it'll look just like sauce just a little more dry it's called sugar as well but it's really not the same thing as sugar wax but sometimes these concentrate consistency names just cover up a couple different consistencies under one name i actually have two perfect examples here as you can see both of these are called live sugar you can see live sugar right there and live sugar right there however this is what was inside of each container as you can see this one on the left is what i was talking about where there's little thc diamonds just coated in a live resin sauce where this one over here is actually more of a waxy consistency but it still is a sugar when you look at them independently you'd say that they were both sugar but when you look at them side by side you'd honestly say that they're kind of different looking concentrates they're not even the same color the saucy consistency is much more of an amber color while this sugar is much more of a yellow color some might even consider this more of a sauce consistency but to me that's sugar you can leave it on one side for a little bit without any of the stuff pouring out of there and live resin sugar and live resin sauce often look very similar to each other the main difference between the two is the thc percentage and the terpene percentage sauce typically has a lower thc percentage and a higher terpene percentage than sugar while sugar typically has the higher thc percentage and the lower terpene percentage but still has a great flavor so that's why i typically like to go with sugar so i feel like you get that nice thc punch while still getting a nice flavor and like a delicious overall experience when it comes to the smell and the flavor but i'm about to take a dab of this saucy sugar now and see which one i like more this drain portlandia is absolutely fire it was actually recommended to me by one of you guys it has a super high mercy level this one it's actually only testing at 2.8 which is still pretty high but i've seen it testing it upwards of seven here's the stats for the portlandia sauce for anyone that wants to see it pretty high amount thc and thca while still having a great terpene profile and i'm actually impressed that the sugar wax had good flavor now that i'm looking at the stats it's over 90 thca but it's still a great terpene profile let me know in the comments whether you guys prefer when it's more of a sugar wax consistency or went into the little thc diamonds with the live resin sauce on top i don't really mind either way i like it both ways again it's hard for me to pick a consistency because really i don't look at the consistency i'm looking at the strain and the thc and the terpene percentages when i'm buying weed and the consistency of sugar is just not uniform in nature it even ranges from like a light yellow to a ambery color like this let's scoop out our dab i think it's almost time to dab too god [ __ ] not dabbing all that i'll drop that though all right wish me luck on this one [Music] huh oh my god [Music] oh yeah killed it oh my god that was a good hit oh my god holy [ __ ] that portlandia is [ __ ] amazing i'm not kidding i'm really glad that whoever recommended that recommended it shout out to you but honestly i just love sugar because of how easy it is to get on a dab tool and honestly i think that it has the dopest melt shots when i'm filming my snapchats however i do feel like it is much harder to do than other concentrates sometimes i think i'm just taking a normal sized dab and then once you drop it in there it just turns into this giant puddle and you're like holy [ __ ] i was not intending all this i feel like when i'm dabbing butter or shatter it's so much easier for me to have an idea for how much i'm taking but when it's those little diamonds and all of a sudden there's just a giant thca rock in there you don't really know how much that weighs and you're like all right well let's find out how high i'm gonna get but i still think that sugar has a pretty nice well-rounded high and flavor no matter what form you have it in and i love flavorful concentrates and sugar is not the terpest there is but i still think that it has a great flavor profile and i think the butter and sauce are probably the most terpy for those who are wondering and if you're new to dabbing do not get overwhelmed if you see all these different consistencies at the dispensary and don't know which one to pick honestly don't even look at the consistency if you ask me just look at the strain and like the thc and the terpenes whatever you're looking for if you're a thc shopper look for the thing that's the highest thc if you like a certain terpene look for the terpenes like when i'm looking for a concentrate i'm looking at the terpene percentages i want something that has a really nice terpene profile most of the time concentrate consistencies are all basically the same thing they're all just different concentrated forms of cannabis it's really the cannabis you want to focus on and depending on the concentrate sometimes it'll change consistencies by the time the company packages it up and it actually gets to you bho does not have the longest shelf life and especially if you're talking about something like shatter or butter they can change consistencies pretty quick so honestly i wouldn't even say that labeling at the dispensary is 100 accurate you really don't know until you see it but that's the video you guys let me know what consistency of concentrates you want me to do next i did this before on sauce and you guys seem to really like it so

using marijuana during pregnancy were more than one and a half times more likely to have autism than children who were not exposed researchers looked at 2200 ontario women who gave birth between 2007 and 2012 and said that they used cannabis while pregnant the research was done by the ottawa hospital chill born ontario and the university of ottawa joining me now with more is dr doreen alchar co-author of the study good morning thank you so much doctor for being with us good morning first of all give us your thoughts on what the research found sure so you summaried summarize it nicely but our research was really looking at maternal cannabis and neurodevelopmental outcomes after having looked at it previously in obstetrical outcomes last year and we noted the increase in the diagnosis of autism that was made in children born to mothers who had consumed cannabis during the time of our study period which is about 10 years when you look at the follow-up period of when they were born and then to how long we followed them so were the researchers more interested in looking at why autism occurs or what happens if mothers use cannabis during pregnancy what was your starting point yeah so for this study in particular it was around neurodevelopmental outcome we've previously looked at what happens to pregnancies and we found an increased rate of preterm birth and some other obstacle outcomes which were affected like birth weight and other placental issues um so we we generated more work from that existing uh interest uh to now look at the feed the the babies and the infant outcomes so this is focused on the neural development and brain so autism was one but we also looked at other intellectual learning disabilities and found less of a significant association so there are health warnings out there about using cannabis during pregnancy is your feeling that those warnings are not being followed it's hard to know right now and as you mentioned yes health canada society of obstetrician gynecologist we still recommend against use because we don't have enough evidence to talk to our mothers about what it could mean i think that we probably are seeing similar rates and maybe a little bit more upfront patients telling us about the use because of legalization so that we may be seeing however we haven't looked at the numbers yet but we plan on doing that now to see what the numbers are post-legalization in 2017. right i guess i'm wondering why people why pregnant women would use cannabis is it because it is legal now people think that it may not be um harmful during pregnancy to their baby so certainly that's one there's always the impression that if something is legal it may be okay but we know that that's certainly not the problem the issue with other substances like alcohol and smoking so i use the same analogy um as in terms of why they use it certain moms do need to use it because they've used it for other medical issues for pain management or uh dealing with other symptoms so certainly we have to be aware of and helping those uh patients with other uh uh you know other medications that they will need to have to deal with their uh medical issues as well as there's some people who use it recreationally still as well as for potential help with nausea so this was a big study what do you hope to do with the results uh yeah so this is one of the largest studies and more recent times published we hope that this will help sensitize you know and help our care providers counsel their patients about some of the risks and certainly we know we need to do more studies and continue looking at the cohorts of patients as this was from 20 2007 to 2012 so we need to look at more recent data and continue doing linkage and we also need to look at whether timing of use and other substances affect the outcomes as well as different types of cannabis as you know there's many different forms that can be used doctor thank you so much really appreciate you being with us this morning on this study very important", "LAcQ35kqJIg": "[Music] yes it's time once again for cannabis news I'm here show Clara it's October 14th 2019 the show has always presented to you by the marijuana times you can find some marijuana times Dora click the video tab there to find the show a lot of great articles there as well a lot of great writers social media links everything you need to know about the cannabis world I'll check my marijuana x dot orga for your answers today talking about the increasing and narrative that there's somehow a definitive link between marijuana use and mental illness also a quartz takes a look at some cannabis CEOs and how they use cannabis and a halt to texas medical marijuana licensing what's up with that talk about all that coming up but first of course yes trying to tarnish the youths with the show that's our it's our target demographic you this is you know the millennial generation the people in their 20s so that's why i say things like what's up with that and other various slang terms shows brought to you by nature side natured side calm and they're organic all-natural pesticides man she grows safe and poison free don't use harmful chemicals don't use this is awful awful things people put on plants that others are gonna be ingesting that's dumb don't be dumb be smart weak dumb like everybody says be smart with nature side nature - side Calm prot sponsor of cannabis news now for well over 500 episodes thank you nature side it's four stories by yours truly marijuana times and dot org a definitive link between marijuana and mental illness question mark basically I used a op IDI from Australia and that kind of did a little rebuttal a little breakdown of it as I pointed on the article there's it's pretty even-handed when it comes to legalization obviously remember we talked about on the show and you've probably read about it as well the Australian Capital Territory is legalized adult use marijuana federal officials and Australia Capital Territory it's kind of analogous to you know Washington DC area here it's the area where the Capitol is they have their own laws or whatever they're not federal laws are more kind of like you know quote unquote state laws with around States anyway they legalize recreational marijuana the prime minister of the Health Minister everybody's up in arms they don't like it there's talk been talk of maybe superseding it with federal law or doing something else to halt its inaction in any case this op-ed was on a new site in Australia and as I said it's it's tries to be as fair as it can be when it comes to the notion of cannabis legalization but there is a one problem that I had this specific paragraph well later in the article he quotes Alec's parents and which is quite embarrassing but the specifics for paragraph I had a problem with is this well it's been argued that those predisposed to psychotic mental illnesses are more likely to use cannabis it's becoming increasingly accepted in the scientific community that there is a direct link between cannabis and these illnesses then is something not true first of all there is no proof that in the op-ed II cherry-picks a couple studies links to him out of hundreds of studies on this issue he links to a few that's the basis of his conjecture that it's becoming increasingly accepted in the scientific community that there was a direct link between cannabis and these illnesses that is not a thing I don't know as I point out in an article I don't know how you would quantify something like that it's just a statement it has nothing to back it up and it furthers this narrative which is increasing in other quarters and prohibitionists are starting to latch on to this especially since Alex Barron Alex Berenson's book that somehow marijuana use has been directly linked to things like violence psychosis mental illness that sort of thing and there simply is no definitive link as I pointed out before we talked about Alex Berenson even people who did the research that he cites have come out and said that he has misconstrued what they've said there's associations there may be a link things of this nature and a lot more research needs to be done especially when it comes to adolescent marijuana use and psychosis but the notion that there's some definitive link and that the scientific community is increasingly accepting this as a whole is simply not true and it's not backed up by any proof whatsoever in the op-ed and as I said later on the towards the end of the op-ed the quotes from Alex Berenson they're just embarrassing and prove that you're not serious about cannabis journalism or a pundit tree or whatever it is you're trying to do next up from QZ dot-com quartz if you will sis cannabis CEOs talk to us about how they use weed obviously all articles I talked about are linked in the description of the video in which they are talked about but this one's pretty interesting sick CEOs book two courts at work they will gladly tell you how and why they consume cannabis products sometimes at the office perhaps multiple times per day they're not being reckless with their corporate reputations they run a small to medium sized companies in one of the eleven US states or in the Capital District where recreational marijuana is legal and cannabis is routinely compared to everyday drugs like caffeine and alcohol as representatives of the modern cannabis sector Italian health and wellness the rigor to cast cannabis as a normal aid and daily life including life at work some of the CEOs include max Simon CEO of green flower california-based cannabis education and training the platform says he's a daily consumer of the plants extract every morning before working again right after lunch he takes 3 or 5 milligrams of pure THC tincture it also contains MCT medium chain triglycerides oil any micro doses would think sugars do out the day most the other CEOs say they either use after they get home from work you know Kylie you know a glass of wine with dinner a glass so you know to unwind after working a couple beers whatever and those who use it during the day most of the Missis in you know obviously the first one uses THC miss time during the day tend to use CBD they were worried about the tea CEO interfering with other ability to do their the specific type of work they need to do as CEOs Cantor provisions CEO Meg Sanders is a pot of standard during the work day she that needs to maintain my wits about me but you know later on she may unwind with some marijuana Ricardo Baca who may be a recognizable name to many of you he was the first US journalists to cover marijuana full-time he took on that beat for the Denver Post in 2013 three years later after 20 years as reporter he switched sides and launching grasslands was a PR agency of 11 full-time workers he said canvas now helps them deal with things they had to worry about when he was a writer things like budgets and profit and loss sheets things that give him anxiety he said every morning I start with a couple of different multi cannabinoid complexes I think of them as vitamins one is a straightforward derived CBD capsule takes a lot of th a lot of CBD rather a Whitney BD founder CEO of apothecary in Los Angeles I was a television executive before she launched her business selling an attractive cannabis containers as home decor in 2015 she mostly uses CBD Allison Gordon is a CEO of 48 north cannabis corporation and producer and distributor of cannabis products and in Toronto she'd been used in marijuana since she was 15 years old she hasn't built up a tolerance so with more than hundred people relying hard to keep the lights on even indulging even in the slightest puff on the job is totally out of the question for her but not consuming after hours would be absurd she says indeed it would be and I work and lead a company and very much has to be something that I understand at every level she said they also talked to the co-founder of cocoa Amanda Jones a Canada ki cocoa is a cannabis infused tea company so go check that out pretty interesting story about CEOs really it's a new a new day I mean I know that's a cliche but you know as people point out things are cliched and become clich\u00e9s a for a reason the notion even five years ago they would be talking to CEOs of any company even a cannabis company about them getting high before work or during work or you know going home to get high or you see CBD or any of this stuff we've been very odd but in just a short amount of time this is something that a lot of people love to do are going to be surprised love or buy and they should I mean if you run the canvass company you should be no surprise to no one that you use cannabis it's it's not necessary you can learn about cannabis without using it obviously but if you never learn more about its effects first hand well obviously use is necessary its last story is Texas Tribune dot-org Texas abruptly halts permitting process for new medical cannabis dispensaries weekend opening the application process for medical cannabis dispensaries to apply for permits in Texas the de Texas Department of Public Safety without warning suspended that the process here to the department's website and I did just before we started this show it still says this quote the department's compassion use program is not accepting applications at this time the sudden announcement comes nearly a month after the state said it would keep the application process open for a month from October 1st to November 1st government agency does not follow through on their promise that is as very very unique and odd and sense my sarcasm if not out pointed out it was sarcasm move by the state agency came as a shock to ever see groups who were eager for the state to move forward on medical cannabis expansion months after the legislature expanded the list of conditions they qualify for the medicine under the compassionate use program includes seizure disorders ALS terminal cancer in autism previously the medicine was only available to people with intractable epilepsy who met certain requirements DPS did not explain why the agency stopped accepting applications and a spokesperson wrote an email the Department will continue to assess dispensing capacity requirements along with the need for any additional licenses as we work through the recent legislative changes to the program a total of 43 applicants apply to receive preliminary licenses and dispensed in organizations in 2017 the only three were accepted to Terra Texas consortium Texas and compassionate cultivation so in other words they've taken the they've stopped the process and they will get it back going when they feel like it and they may or may not let you know when that is if you're trying to apply for a medical marijuana license in Texas change disappointing because many patients were looking forward to price shopping once the additional licenses were approved as said Jax Finkel who's the executive director of Texas normal patients pay thousands of dollars in apopka says marijuana was not covered by insurance or Medicare or Finkel said additional licenses we create a better market for competition she said which we as a theme we talk about a lot especially her in the last couple months on the show more choice for consumers more competition more supply equals lower prices which is government's consumers which is who we should be focused on I know we're worried about equity for business owners and all these other things but when you talk about the largest group out of all of these groups we talked about the largest group is cannabis consumers we're talking tens of millions of people we need to worry about them and what they have access to because they make the whole engine run without that demand there is no cannabis industry there's no point making illegal if nobody uses it who would care this if you made something no one ever uses illegal no about an eye but it's a big deal because a lot of people use it and a lot of people are criminalized for it we're trying to get past that we need to focus on canvas consumers and what's best for them yeah expunging you know records and then allowing you know people with records to be business owners and and equity and and reparations for the war on drugs however you want to put it well that's great we'll talk about all that stuff and that's you know yes yes all that more and more more more people more access more more entrepreneurs all of it but the reason for that is do you want more choice for consumers because that's the largest group come by tens of millions of people versus what thousands of canvas owners hundreds of thousands of cannabis owners even them and all their employees is never going to be anywhere near as large as the group of cannabis consumers as a whole and things are going well for cannabis consumers and they're buying legal marijuana well it's better for everybody everybody's doing well everybody can make money everybody can have a successful cannabis business who wants one and is capable of running one there's a lot of demand for cannabis it's very popular right here there's something someone told me that the canvas is very popular I don't know I guess so this shows very popular that's because of you all sharing liking commenting all that stuff thinking to nature side nature decide calm and there organic all-natural pesticides thank you to all of you for liking and sharing and commenting and all this stuff find us on YouTube and Vimeo if you want the video apple podcasts source the marijuana

sallallaahu alayhi assalam he wasn't he wasn't mentioned in the Quran he assumed people basically say that in the Quran we'll have lost a lot of sword hammer yeah in toxicants then everything comes you know under the purview of humble that's fine but if we look at the humbler that was there during the time of the prophet sallallaahu islam that it was basically alcohol made from dates alcohol made from alcohol made from grapes alcohol made from barley alcohol made from honey and so bitter and misery and so on so forth so so the when the Quran is discussing hammer in his context and it was actually just talking about alcohol he later on you can extrapolate that to mean kind of all forms of intoxicants even coffee was it was at a time seen as a form of intoxication yes okay we'll come to that so so there is nothing in the Quran specifically talking about cannabis there is mine you should keep in mind the fatwa okay yes yes there is there isn't anything in the Hadees specifically so what that basically means is that these things were not a social problem during the time of the prophets Islam and during the time when the Quran was revealed had it been a a problem during the time of the prophets Allah was on that he would have addressed it if not in the Quran did not at least in his hadith what happens is that when cannabis and these things started becoming social problems and then people started seeing the kind of social ill the mental health illness coming and you know the financial implications all of that then they started to kind of give fatwa that is Haram so it may say me I was seven century scholar was one of the first ones to write about this and everything mia basically says that cannabis is a is one of the wrath of God right for people leaving the way of Islam and allah subhanaw taala subjugated them by by bringing the tatars he was living through the whole kind of mongol evasion yeah about that through through the tarted the Mongol invasion and that's one of the things that they brought with them to the Muslim world is a wrath of God he basically says that cannabis has two effects okay number one is it makes a person more hardeneth right which is effeminate right right so maybe kind of it makes him lose his sexual potency right and number two is it makes him at the youth which is a cult which means that he doesn't care if he's in believeth well we call it doesn't care if his wife goes away and the thing is maybe that's true where somebody's kind of high in you in your own world you don't care what's happening here talks about this the point I'm here making is that there is nothing clear in the scripture which says that cannabis is haram it's only when the social kind of problems you know started then the Lama they basically gave fatwa that is Haram the issue is is is about the social implications of that not whether it is inherently Haram or not", "1Luw2tiMuLk": "you've probably heard that marijuana isn't good for kids but what does that actually mean to answer that question let's take a closer look at the endocannabinoid system to see exactly what it does what marijuana does to it and what that does to you spread throughout the brain the endocannabinoid system is a biological system made up of chemical messengers called endocannabinoids cellular receptors that communicate with endocannabinoids and enzymes that break down endocannabinoids after they've delivered their messages as endocannabinoids communicate with receptors throughout your body they create balance and help regulate many body and brain functions such as helping with memory coping with stress pain and anxiety and keeping hunger body temperature motor coordination and alertness in balance now let's see what happens when marijuana is introduced into this balancing system made from a plant called cannabis marijuana can be smoked vaporized or ingested through food or drink marijuana contains a chemical called tetrahydrocannabinol also known as thc since thc's chemical structure is similar to naturally occurring endocannabinoids the body allows thc to attach to endocannabinoid receptors in the brain when thc enters the body it overwhelms the endocannabinoid system attaching to cannabinoid receptors and throwing the body and brain off balance preventing endocannabinoids in your brain from doing their jobs endocannabinoids work like a well-conducted and highly synchronized orchestra with each one playing at a particular time and place in harmony when thc is introduced the precise coordination is lost and thrown off the endocannabinoids can no longer do their special job this means your brain will have a harder time regulating all of those functions like memory coping with stress and anxiety and motor coordination plus when using marijuana some people may experience fear anxiety paranoia or memory loss while allowing medical and recreational use of marijuana for adults are becoming more common in some states though not in others but as a young person with a still developing brain marijuana can have a stronger more harmful effect on you than adults in fact research has shown that young people who chronically use marijuana especially highly potent marijuana increase their risk of cognitive and memory damage serious mental illnesses like depression and psychosis and addiction to alcohol or other drugs in adulthood learning the facts can help you make healthy decisions so say yes to a healthy lifestyle and no to underage marijuana use to learn more visit asklistlearn.org", "SR4L--AQmYE": "[Music] yes welcome everyone once again the cannabis news I'm here is Joe Claire is January 18th 2019 Jenna's always the show that is by the marijuana times check us out at marijuana times dot or click the video tab to find the show also a bunch of great articles there as well today talking about Michigan and medical marijuana and a bit of a shortage going on in that state also the possibility of federal marijuana law reform this year and a new book and a couple of op eds are making the rounds in the cannabis community for various reasons talk about all of that coming up at first of course cannabis news is brought to you by nature side nature - side comm and their organic all-natural pesticides go check them out grow safe and poison free don't use harmful chemicals on what you were growing don't use banned pesticides what you want to do is use nature sign nature - side comm sinus about C IDE a proud sponsor of cannabis news go check them out that we lost my view because they are awesome first story by Julia grana whit's marijuana times dot org Michigan sees a shortage of medical cannabis so unlicensed facilities are reopened at the beginning of the year the Michigan Legislature required that all non licensed medical marijuana dispensaries shut down until proper licensing has obtained unfortunately the closing of over seventy dispensaries left very few with their doors open to the patients this in turn abruptly left many patients without access to their medicine this is a story I've been covering well last year when as the transition and as the the deadlines kept coming up and being pushed back and and you know various medical marijuana dispensaries in Michigan going through various stages of the application process and well are they allowed to stay open and yes they are then well this judge says no they say that closed down then this judge says no they can stay open and now they're closed down but now the reopening would maybe be a stretch to say the things that I've been smooth the transition obviously Michigan new regulations enacted in 2016 before that it was a lot of tension between law enforcement and caregivers and patients a lot of problems they said well we'll make some regulations and have some regulate dispensaries and that'll solve the problem but that transition has not been smooth so last Wednesday the Medical Marijuana Licensing Board agreed and the unanimous four to zero vote to allow dispensaries that are in the process of applying for license and have a local buy-in to reopen their doors at least until March 31st or there's another yet another deadline for where medical marijuana spent dispensaries in Michigan donar Gretchen Whitmer sent a news release quote we have heard from Michiganders closely affected by the ongoing transition to licensed marijuana facilities is important that we ensure that patients have access to their medicine well the medical marijuana industry continues to develop and while that continues to develop they also have the recreational industry now to start getting the rules together for licensing and such it's a little hot for the people who oversee medical and recreational marijuana in Michigan a lot of work ahead of them of course we'll continue to cover it right here on campus name of this next story from rolling stone cannabis in Congress why federally legal weed could soon be a reality I mean I don't know I wouldn't go that far obviously this article and all the other girls we talk about on this show or link in the description of the video I will say one thing that is that it looks good for marijuana law reform and a lot of different aspects of marijuana law reform legislation to come to the floor for a vote in the House of Representatives it goes beyond that that remains to be seen but we should think should be sent it to at least have a full floor House vote on all of these things whether it's protecting medical marijuana patients and states where it's legal banking access tax issues veterans issues even a blooming hour of course he named dropped the regulate marijuana like alcohol act the proposal basically represents a wholesale reimagining of how marijuana is treated nation wide open marijuana under the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives and not the DEA it would also allow marijuana businesses to access the banking system and allow long delayed research on the plan to go forward without constraints currently imposed on cannabis by the federal prohibition currently have used marijuana the same as heroin of course as the aforementioned at least on this show has been mentioned before HR 420 they said a lot of these things whether or not that passes on the House floor remains to be seen but a lot of other issues very well could pass the house then they go the republican-controlled Senate what happens there who knows I mean there are some states rights Republicans if they would join with Democrats that maybe some marijuana law reform would get passed through the Senate and then Trump has expressed support at some points especially for Republican senator Cory Gardner in the Senate from Colorado he's expressed support for his efforts to bring marijuana reform through the Senate so I mean if it something hits Trump's desk there's a chance they could get signed but whether or not things will get that far of course it remains to be seen as the year goes on but there's a lot of stuff at least gonna happen in the next few months in theory and the Democratic controlled House of Representatives routine to cover those stories as well slash story it's from Seattle Times yes that's correct New Yorker article about marijuana strikes nerve with pot researchers now this this article references to op eds and a new book a lot of people haven't seen this book by a New York Times reporter Alex and Berenson called tell your children the truth about marijuana mental health and violence I've yet to talk about this book or the op-ed that it's spawned or the op-ed that this article I'm about to talk about now is referencing for a few reasons first of all I've not read Barron's book I don't plan to read it I'm not you know do a book review or anything like that a lot of marijuana law reform organizations a lot of advocates in the cannabis community have reviewed this book they've put our rebuttal to this book there's plenty of that if you want to go look for it places like Marijuana Policy Project and others every but a lot of the claims in the book apparently the main study referenced in the book supposedly that links marijuana use to schizophrenia one of the researchers on that study has there's a big long Twitter thread about how Berenson mischaracterized the study it's not the study says at all and they left out other parts of the studies the site so this book and these are peds have been is assailed from all quarters which you know is as it is I haven't felt the need to add my voice to that we cover a lot of things here on the show but did thing would be remiss of me if I didn't mention it at all and bring it to the attention of those who didn't hear of it and direct you to places to where you can find more on it if you are so inclined this article starts off the joint you smoked last night isn't going to give you schizophrenia it also isn't going to make you go out and assault your neighbor you might not know that after reading a recent New Yorker article drawing a connection between marijuana use schizophrenia and violent crimes in Washington the article titled is marijuana as safe as we think sparked many an email thread and social media critiqued by researchers of cannabis and cannabinoids author Malcolm Gladwell focused on a 2017 report by the National Academy of Medicine the exam of the scientific evidence of the health effects and therapeutic purposes of cannabis and cannabinoids Gladwell's piece also draws on a new book by former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson the book I just told you about Gladwell's piece subsequent New York Times op-ed by Berenson drew quick rebukes for marijuana researchers and legalization advocates who took issue with Gladwell selective use of data at Berenson's linking marijuana use to schizophrenia b-trees carlini a senior research scientist at the university of washington's alcohol and drug abuse institute since she was disheartened by the article with she and her colleagues have been discussing and emailing each other a bow since it was published earlier this month glad they go on to talk about it again this is another article you can read it's linked in the description of this video that Gladwell a drawing links between increased crime in Washington State and marijuana legalization you show further down and Ziva Cooper well scroll down to far Ziva Cooper one of the authors of the National Academy of Medicine report took to Twitter to air her concerns with Berenson's op-ed confusing correlation and causation Cooper there was the research director of UCLA's cannabis research initiative explained to the threat of tweets that the Academy found an association between cannabis use and schizophrenia researchers also found an association between using cannabis and improved cognitive outcomes for people with psychotic disorders which he points out wasn't mentioned in Berenson's piece of course it's not there's some of her tweets from January 9th response to the recent New York Times editorial on cannabis and his committee member of the NA SEM cannabis of cannabinoids report we did not conclude that cannabis causes gets off Renia and that she Langston New York Times article we found one an association between cannabis users hits friendly and - an association between cannabis use and improved cognitive outcomes for individuals with psychotic disorders which I just mentioned since report we now know that genetic risk for schizophrenia predicts cannabis use shedding some light on the potential direction of the association between cannabis use and schizophrenia we also now know that under placebo control conditions CBD improves outcomes of patients with schizophrenia we give it an adjunct a junk Med showing the cannabinoids not necessarily cannabis improve symptoms in other words the schizophrenia linked with marijuana has been made much of basically what they found is the people who have schizophrenia are more predisposed to seek out ways to alleviate those problems and one of the things they seek out to leave e8 those problems in is marijuana again because people who have schizophrenia tend to smoke marijuana doesn't mean their marijuana caused this gets friendly in many cases there are self-medicating as millions do every day with cannabis so there I've talked about the Berenson piece in the book and no I'm just I'm not gonna read it I just like I said plenty people out there have done book reviews rebuttals and all that go seek them out for everything else and uh continuing updates all these stories and more keen to watch cannabis news thank you all who all the people who watch and listen and share and comment

wednesday afternoon thanks for tuning into the cannabis legalization news where we explain marijuana laws so you can change them today we're going to be talking about cura leaf's entrance into the european market we're also going to be talking about several bills that are making their way around i mean there's bills popping up all over the country but one in florida is not very cool so we're going to be talking about that and we're going to answer a question from uh dm we received from windy city growers about lobbying so let's just get right into it hey tom hey mickey happy birthday i tell you though that florida it's terrible when it comes to their laws about limiting the thc concentration but the florida crosses uh the florida orange crosses from revolution just smells so nice hey guess what we got on the show next week everybody oh my god i can't wait yeah highness himself the highness smash the likes and hit subscribe and then you'll get noticed next week when we uh go live with tommy trump and i got my first sponsor my first weed sponsor which just means free weed what what's your first weed sponsor dude washington butco is gonna so i hit up three uh my favorite we grows because you know doing this thing the the influencer slash whatever you know people are gonna question like sponsors and and promotions and whatnot but honestly dude you can do a win-win you can you can promote a product and not sell your soul like the product i.e being cannabis but uh you know i got the washington budco is going to be hooking me up and i can't wait to share their product on the on the show yeah washington budco is is nice i'm sure uh i i'm not going to be able to play smell-o-vision with washington bud co next week but just fred and then we'll also have to see what tommy's smoking on uh he'll probably be joining us from la hopefully he's got some wonderful and why wouldn't he why wouldn't he have good wi-fi i mean it's a pretty pretty good show tune in we have a lot of news that came up and uh we passed 20 subscribers on this uh on this little ship of the channel that's so funny dude i mean just this little you and me i still wanted to call it two guys in one mic but it's all right that's fun you know what we're getting so old now that that uh two girls one cup or two guys you know one cup one mic uh those types of references are going to get less and less obvious to people which are fine with me i do not need people to know what that reference means but let's get back to it though i mean curly's entrance into europe european cannabis markets it's kind of a big deal right 280 million dollars oh my god this is one of the reasons why oh let's let's get to the stock news we have a we have a cut that we can do on this let's uh let's do our little bumper with the stocks uh moving into the stock news yeah currently enters the european cannabis market in a 285 million dollar deal uh curl leaf holdings which is of course the largest market cap of all the cannabis stocks that you can buy right now over the counter uh and currently market valuation is i believe 11 billion in change and so yesterday it was up like 17 percent uh and then today it's down about five percent and all the pot stocks have just started to dump off a cliff since it became obvious that they are not going to be legalizing at a federal level anytime soon and that's one of the problems with these types of weed stocks is it's just so speculative you know this this thing comes up is this going to have any real value because like the the the european cannabis market's really not that big no but i think the potential for what they have it's going to be greater than the united states because they can travel so uh kira lee's holdings agreed to buy a mac life sciences ltd for 285 which i think is kind of a low entry bar to this industry when it's already been producing billions of dollars in tax revenue right like like currently if only like i clipped i think like 184 million dollars worth of medical say or cannabis sales last year so we pull up the curl leaf chart and see what their quarterly results are to determine whether or not they have acne like year-over-year growth to be able to um account for like a 17 pop in the stock in one day uh however it probably isn't going to be much of anything um we'll see you know curly can immediately start selling his cbd products in europe's and plans to bring thc products and its select brand oh yeah the curry leaf select brand never heard of it but markets through the deal yeah but you know unlike in the u.s where the company can't move federally illegal cannabis across the state lines kiriley's products can be shipped anywhere in the euroboc through the emac their their network so uh appropriate licensing i thought they could only move their cbd products not their uh thc products well i imagine uh this was in bloomberg so i'd imagine there's there's they're working on it you know because in spain uh they have uh like what spannabis it's a huge you know canvassing new out there it's i mean as much as the ignorance still prevails you know you still have gw pharmaceuticals and all these other people you know making a [ __ ] ton of money out there and they're not so ignorant or stupid i guess over there oh we'll see you know it's one of those things where these licenses they tend to become uh less expensive over time and so it implies which you know this isn't necessarily the best implication ever that there would be fewer licenses and limited markets in the future but they just raised all this money and then they spent all that money to acquire this and then it makes the stock go up because why oh they have the right to buy stuff in europe now yeah i mean that's all that is that look at that so that's your home group that's uh oh that's yeah that's some homegrown that's some florida purple homegirl right there medically cannabis right medically hungry yeah that's right medical homegirl it's the way to do it in illinois then uh so we also got a biden's usda secretary gives final approval to hemp rules despite ongoing industry concerns yep the emp rules have been finalized and so we saw those final rules come out there's actually some really nice uh some really nice changes that happened to the final rule from the interim rule and therefore it could be worse it could be worse by a few leaps and bounds because the final rule allows for a difference in the um level of negligence and so the level of negligence has been moved from point five uh percent thc to one percent thc which should provide for like the vast majority of the genetics that are out there as uh as hemp cultivars and then of course the disposal and remediation and so now let's say your hemp comes in a little hot and by that i mean like you're you're over the point five percent total uh you know just throw some more um stalks in and chip it all up and put in some more fan leaves and then test it so that it's it goes back down like your total cbd count might go from like 20 down to 15 or something but then your thc count might go from like 0.5 down to 0.1 which is nice and so now they are allowing uh the hemp farmers to be able to recapture uh and remediate their non-compliant plants with that remediation they're gonna also be able to you can do an extract right and then and create that limit of whatever potency you think it should be uh i don't think they allow you to do the extract i think just allow you to mix stuff back in and then retest it and then once you have then you have to do the extract yeah well still what a painting has though it's like you fill a test like at school they give you a second chance you're like come on i got i know all the answers were right there but it's just it's just the regulations it's just the regulations that's really the problem yeah yeah not exactly and then yeah that's what we call nice things man yeah yeah that's one of the problems all right we have it's agriculture secretary tom vilsack so we're actually going back to the future he was um barack obama's agricultural secretary as well and he's an ally of the hemp industry and so this this new reg takes effect on march 22 as originally planned so this crop year it appears that we're going to be under the new usda regs and so they released these rules yeah so they released them back when did they release that rule i want to say it was august of last year or something like that because they had public comment periods and all sorts of things and they came up the final rule uh the final rule was released back in january so yeah you see like even if we had um federal reform for cannabis it would be like this it would take years after the law has changed because then they have to come out with all the regulations because marijuana is not him marijuana is not him that's right sthcn wait wait wait yeah they are both yeah in the end though you know the process is long and so here in washington the homegirl lost again it's gonna get wide it's just got buried again never made it out of the committee so yeah it takes a long time to shape things up to have that infrastructure it'll be a bit so we also have chicago or do you want to go stay on the uh on the uh the hemp topic no we'll go to chicago all right let's go chicago weed giant illegally took pot to arkansas in whole food salad containers federal suit claims ronald holding okay uh well i just think it's hilarious that verano and verano are they're probably getting torched right now i mean all the the cannabis companies are getting torched right now on the uh the trading floor for the stocks today but yeah chicago company worth roughly 3 billion with sued monday in federal court as part of a sweeping racketeering complaint that accuses the company of illegally trafficking marijuana from illinois to arkansas well how so they're sued but no one like raided what what what what what is this how civil but like isn't there a person behind verano like let's this was my thing about legalization and recreation was huh sammy dwarf is his name i'm just saying rich people don't want to go to jail so if they fix the freaking law go to jail this is freaking ridiculous well actually tom and john could talk about that rich people still go to jail oh yeah he wasn't the biggest fan of it you know he wasn't the biggest fan of jail i don't think anybody goes yeah granted jail like but he had some great stories about him and jordan belfort and you know him riding in wall street in jail while he was serving with tommy chon but uh anyway the lawsuit tireds dozens of cannabis executives and companies including our verano ceo george archus and harvest health and recreation and eris an arizona firm uh harvest is like one of the largest operators out of arizona that attempted to acquire verano for 850 million in march of 2019. uh i do not have a copy of the complaint if anybody wants to get me a copy of the complaint i can read it and be like this is what the state is asking for in their prayer for relief uh i'm not currently involved in litigation and i'm fine with that but i spent about a decade in litigation i'd be interested though but like like again back to why are they being like you know a business should be rated it just it just hurts my brain that you have a federal state to state case here that should involve verona being shut down period not not not being litigated over court or like you know they could lose their license you know if this is a federal crime uh and then again like in the future when these types of things break make sure that we get a copy of the complaint for them so that i can read that and be like this is what they're asking for that's one of the problems with like newspapers is that they're not staffed by lawyers uh and and so then you can't you know necessarily get the the kind of analysis you get from like actually reading complaint and so there's actually a plaintiff so nicholas nielsen worked for the cultivation center in newport arkansas which was managed by harvest as the company worked in lopstep with verano as the acquisition was pending this sounds like a butt hurt investor that's trying to take action to squeeze or exert some type of influence from the actual license holders but uh we'd have to see and so like you know from the way that i was reading it i'm like all right first is this a federal suit and by a federal student is this prosecution right here that is prosecution it just seems like it's a contractual b for some type of beef between these two people it's another reasons why i'd like to read the complaint you know before i well the accusation there is is of course that they're they're also uh diversion right like like this person's saying i'm i'm growing a bunch of plants for this big company worth a billion dollars like it does seem like a petty employee really it's not not a a federal case that's being uh you know government coming after them it's not a federal case the government's not coming after him it's this nicholas nielsen guy and so he worked for the cultivation center like where does he fit in how much stock did he open or own and then it says the 2020 police rate of nielsen's home uncovered 28 harvested pot plants in his garbage can all right cool and so now did he like bring them in he's like hey police this wasn't me it was these guys but you know i have no idea and so like neil nielsen was then arrested and charged after the cops found two more plants inside his home oh that's terrible two whole plants humanly christmas call the dogs uh this claims that those plants were actually being cultivated for harvest greenhouse while awaiting approval from state officials that's very convenient the stude claims that the nielsen's home was allegedly grown from clippings brought to arkansas by michael frontier a verano employee who was allegedly instructed by his employer to take young cannabis plants from an unnamed verano facility in illinois and transport them to arkansas that's derelict in the sense that why aren't these uh genetics like at least stabilized in some forms of seeds uh why are you gonna be flying clones you know coach that doesn't make any sense but why arkansas too i'm just trying to write a highly limited market and so verano probably used its um money to get a license in in arkansas i mean a lot of the illinois operators use their money to get licenses in arkansas cresco gti revolution uh probably also verano and so that you know there's three million people that live in arkansas it is a limited market state for only medical really kind of sucks so if like arkansas ever goes wreck it will be dominated by those five companies well i got you but again it doesn't seem like a diversion issue or it could be a diversion issue if you think about it like but and all these recreational and all these markets recreational medical that that initiate right that they always have this grace period right where everything magically appears the seeds the the cannabis never existed before until you signed that law in place that's right until the uh the zoning commission and then the department of agriculture or the cannabis regulatory commission they give that stamp of approval and your license becomes operational magically cannabis just appears a stork brings it very often you know like just like babies you know they just happen and so the stork comes in that's what it looks like it looks like this is uh some guy named nielsen gets popped for multiple felony charges in arkansas and then for him to get leverage against that um prosecution against him brings in uh verano and harvest health as uh probably had to join them in a suit and then and then but then what he would have to remove to federal court to like get jurisdiction over these other um uh of operators that aren't native for or residents of arkansas again like well nilsson by reading complaint is one of the most important things that a lawyer can do when he's trying to explain to you what's going on yeah well it says here nielsen who's facing multiple felony charges in arkansas has told law enforcement officials that he would definitely testify against frontier verano so it seems like ron's been putting it on their employee as far as like a like a front right like a like you're you're going to help get our business started oh [ __ ] you got caught um i don't know you bro you know it's all good then uh oh here's that one though that we were talking about the uh the beard bros article uh about the al said mid-men zex the new gig represents everything wrong with corporate cannabis and this is about you know uh the beer bros had a great how before actual the structure of recreational um uh cannabis uh you know your reputation precedes you whether you grow good weed and your weed spoke for itself or if you had shitty weed or if you were a shitty uh business person uh you know there was a network and people talk and they still do technically but unfortunately like how do people like people part of men men that started out this this shitty company that had no success and yet still probably acquire another six-figure salary right how do you [ __ ] up and still get a job that bad well it depends on how well capitalized you are but why like what gets them the foot in the door was that you think they paid for the pay to play yeah that you raise money from investors right but so are they just dumb investors i mean what's going on here that these guys yes there are dumb investors out there and so like they you know probably raised some money from some less than smart people uh and uh there you go but you know it's just one of those things where uh you know it not every cannabis company is about operations a lot of them are about acquisitions and assets and so like you know um those types of companies that are about acquisitions and assets and the image and like appearance and it's all real estate play or or what have you uh then you get your amendments right and that's what i mean like the the industry that you think like as a um somebody coming from a traditional market legacy market uh that experience uh you know you have these like you know that cannabis is commodity i paid 25 to save for an eighth so then a quarter is going to be fifty dollars uh a half a hundred and a whole ounce two hundred now and then of course you negotiate with your salesman sometimes you're like hey the more i purchase can i get more of a a refund right this is like the learning basics of business without any uh taxes and all that stuff so i think most people have an idea that any cannabis company that starts is going gonna be a reputable grow slash someone that's there for the plant itself and it's unfortunate when you see these like i want to say shell companies because they're not there's no substance to this there's no actual culture there's no um it seems like it's like funnel money like like hey i'm a rich person i need to funnel some money i know you're gonna [ __ ] it up that's okay it's expected like this is what's wrong with the world man yeah there's a lot of these uh and they're quite great at raising money it's kind of like you know curl leaf what did they do well they raised a whole bunch of money and then they spent it buying all these licenses in europe and what's the value of those licenses yes yeah but don't don't people google we can google around people there's no it's it's just greed and so it's called accretion they use words like that value-add that's another big one or like you know accretion where they they say oh the the sum of these two parts it's not gonna be two plus two equals four it's gonna be like nine and then um you get you get that type of stuff but uh so what is this beard bros company i see that med men is a um a real estate company that dabbles in the cannabis markets but uh you know uh so beer burns got a great blog i think they they're actually a store in a garden down there the thing about the california culture is a lot of these guys have uh uh uh blogs like uh one time uh rest in peace mickey martin was a uh in the early days of medical had a blog called weed activists and uh guy was just savage and just call people out left and right and uh that was the essence of like because he was also in edibles and doing all sorts of things so beer bros are just another legacy um grow that i believe in the recreational market now so they're a good source for california culture and news oh okay so then um beard bros says it's hard to argue that there's a less popular cannabis brand these days than men men how much do you think med men paid for that for the publicity or that for that blurb no good these five bucks 20 000 it's hard to argue yeah i mean it's just they had such great promise right they got the the spike jones video that represented like the the new cannabis culture the new consumer they were trying to they had a lot of blah blah blah intentions but there was nothing of fruition that came out of them except for one little video like i just don't get how these people still succeed in the industry like like it's just it's it's sad and frustrating to see wealthy people where we're like they're saying here in the article a lot of your legacy people can't even afford half these license they can't even get their foot in the door i don't know i don't know tell you what why don't we take a 420 break and then let's look at that verano lawsuit there's actually a pretty interesting chart and graph that we can go over to like point fingers at people and then we can keep ripping on med men or we'll we'll move on to the mexico news probably move on to the mexico loot news but just a second here's the lawsuit um it's a civil action in the united states district court for the first district of colorado again doesn't make much sense uh because like then whoa why do they follow in there well this is kind of normal um and it's not necessarily the worst nose bleeding um uh chart that you'll ever see when you have an mso and so then you have you know marijuana profits marijuana profits going to and from uh the first circle right there is verano llc the the one to the far right is harvest health inc you can see one of them is not an llc and then at the below it's natural state wellness enterprises llc that's probably the um uh the arkansas uh company that was right there and then it's it's just where they they move all the monies and and so those monies kind of go around allegedly according to these um charts and graphs there and so like they siphon off profits they provide uh financial and operating capital uh for people off of them and then uh you know it's it's one of those deals where it'll be interesting to like actually read this whole thing to see exactly what he's alleging and why and then it's it's a rico action uh a private action in rico and so like this guy's getting prosecuted pretty heavily in um uh arkansas sort of like try to offset whatever type of risk he has there he's like all right well i'll bring these people in but now these guys get to like appear and then their lawyers will say oh this should be dismissed and so like this litigation will now get exceedingly expensive uh including for uh with the plaintiff here which is a nicholas nielsen who's also being prosecuted in uh arkansas which is gonna make like affording this a little bit difficult because lawsuits can go on for years if not decades and and be thoroughly briefed before you can actually get to questions of law to get you actually out of those but that's very interesting he's got uh some emails uh attached here and then you know uh some other allegations in the complaint about the transporting across the state lines frontier airlines i'm assuming huh or is frontier one of the the actual things that was defined earlier on if you like this sexy uh mso content you gotta like subscribe right that's right don't forget that where we get to go over um uh more more fun stuff about uh okay who's fighting for what and and how uh but you know that's some news that's going on and that's some litigation that'll probably continue to happen yes they try to enforce the laws in a particular state and somebody gets arrested and then these other msos were playing fast and loose uh well allegedly playing fast and loose uh and we'll see how the facts bear out on this yeah no kidding that'd be interesting to see that that's definitely going to be one of those ones that might uh set a precedent right for how to operate in a multi-state right i mean it could be it could be interesting in the sense that you know these uh operators are trying to get their genetics in various other locations from one state to another and so like how do you do that like if you're if you're an operator that's got a licensing agreement like you know if you're a cookies because cookies keeps opening new shops in new locations so how do those cookie strains get into that state you know we'll all be in california right and pixies fairies of course pixies ferries and also the stork brings all the genetics straight to the dispensary without any questions and uh and then there's these types of questions so it's kind of interesting i mean like this is one of the reasons why you're gonna eventually i don't know when it's gonna be but eventually you absolutely need uh federal legalization because you have this this dual nature of the plant and so like it's quasi-legal in these jurisdictions but it's still also criminalized i mean it's it's medical it's not full adult use well if you think about it too you're setting up in a monopoly for for these companies that have enough money to to litigate their way out like this is wrong on so many levels for the citizens period but meanwhile mexico is gonna might be getting ears right mexico's moving which uh is surprising for me i'm gonna have to issue a retraction from last week or i'm like yeah they're always calling wolf but no the full chamber of the mexican lower house is expected to discuss and vote on the bill this week that just criminalizes cannabis in a move that would make the country one of the largest the world's largest legal cannabis markets then they're going to build that wall so we can't go down that's right well i'm assuming then they're going to like start re-exporting all those wonderful mexican hazes from the 70s um however i don't know if that will happen uh how and then the other thing is they're gonna i think they would be the largest legal cannabis market because there's more mexico uh people than there are canadians like canada right now i think is the largest and there's only like 30 million or so 30 to 40 million canadians you know if you think about this too it doesn't have to be cannabis that once they legalize this in cannabis as a recreational use there's they're opening the the floodgates for hemp like for being a number one producer because since the united states is still behind the curve as we regulate our own stuff we're too busy saying the farmers are bad they're gonna they're gonna press on and create their own hemp and you know because that right now canada is our number one outsource for him and then south africa i think so there you go i mean they have some wonderful mexican hemp coming in but there's almost 128 million people that live in mexico and so there you go it'd be like the largest cannabis market by a mile if that happens and it's been it's been scheduled to happen for so long and it's been delayed for so long once they actually get there and i'm not sure if they're gonna get there this time or if they're gonna get there next time but it's it's moving that's like homegrown for washington you guys still have homegrown for medical it's just you want homegrown for adult use right america i want my rights freedom and so yeah that's we don't we also don't have home i mean like the home grow that we have is medical home grow and and i understand the argument for that when it comes to access to supply but then you know there's a profit mode of argument which i don't like it's like hey uh you shouldn't have access to supply if you just want to smoke weed you should have to pay yeah but that's still shitty argument because the you know home brews haven't put budweiser out of business you know hasn't put restaurants and everything out of business so it will only add to the variety of life god damn it i yes like you know you're not wrong you're not wrong it's just that the um the people don't care yeah well the ones in charge don't care that's that's what it is yes that's one of the bad news stories that continues to be on the radar too uh i'm not sure if that was the one that we had signed up next no that was the true leaf one let's talk about that well there is some more bad news eventually once we get to the florida news yeah yeah trinity team teams up with morehouse school of medicine though on medical cannabis research that's pretty neat that is yeah true leaf cannabis corp turned up with an hbc morehouse school of medicine on a medical cannabis research and education initiative about time that they're going to do some cannabis research dude i'm looking forward to the day i can actually go to the store cvs and buy uh you know a two to one ratio uh cannabis uh extract something you know uh pill anything to add my you know like anywhere i already kind of have it with the legal stores here because we watching is kind of ahead of the curve when it comes to products but still everybody should have this opportunity yep yep and so the florida cannabis company that's truly signed a research education and development agreement with morehouse school of medicine medicine under which true leaf georgia will assist with the school's cannabis related research operations and offer educational courses now this may also play into the lawsuit that truly filed against georgia to get its application in for its medical cannabis cultivation license and now it announces this new partnership with the morehouse school of medicine i wonder if that was an aspect of the cannabis application that they put in it had to be you know you know they're they're right now litigating going but we're gonna be in a medical study that's right you gotta let us in because we're right here all this jack going straight to your educational facility seriously we've got doctors yeah such [ __ ] i mean god damn it's brilliant [ __ ] strategic planning but [ __ ] you for [ __ ] having that kind of money hey gotta pay to play man so that's that's great and it provided if oh can you imagine if they don't get the license are they gonna come through then you know because they haven't announced who's won these because there's only two licenses up for grabs and then there was four licenses for the the tier two the fifty thousand square foot operating facility and then there's two licenses for the hundred thousand square foot operating facility and you know they want that they thirsty for oh god yeah yeah isn't the the requirement still says citizenship right in georgia you got to be resident oh sure there's all sorts of chicanery and relationships with um the residency requirements or like the doing business for the time requirements all those types of things um and then they they were nitpick the truly people were nitpicking regarding like how they uh implemented the application relative to the rules whether or not the administrative department overstepped its bounds when they were creating the the list of the uh the application which another fun thing you know that'll happen sometimes yeah you know the collaboration is considered as being one of the first steps in creation of a personalized medical cannabis treatments that would be a wonderful future yeah totally um there we go well yeah leading to the medical though colorado colorado bill requires schools to store cannabis-based medicines for student use so when the school board refused to let her daughter marley receive her cannabis derived medicine from willing teachers sarah and mark porter made the difficult decision to pull molly out of school on october 2019. in 18 months since marley has been able to take her prescribed medicine regularly while learning her at home keeping her crohn's disease more manageable than it's ever been her parents testified to colorado legislators crohn's is horrible man there's a lot of that so uh senate bill 21-56 aims to make life easier for kids like marley and their families it would require schools and school districts to have a policy allowing their employees to store and administer medical cannabis recommended for a student by a doctor thank god sb 56 yep but i mean this is a crohn's disease patient that's trying to access her medical cannabis and and it's been this is even in colorado and so like the one of the bastions one of the first states for this has still had these types of regulations in place to prevent cannabis medicine from being at schools well washington had the same way we just did it three years ago i believe just recently i know the gentleman that was behind that bill his daughter uh passed on a beautiful little girl she she had something way worse than crohn's and all that stuff but he pushed this bill through for all the other kids it was pretty awesome so yeah i know it's great that uh this so this can be called jack's law and i think i followed this guy's case for a little bit hey or no it builds off of jack's law which allows school districts to let parents or guardians administer medical cannabis to their children on campus in jack's law medicine must be administered in forms of oils nasal sprays or capsules no smoking can you imagine that but the light you're also certain nasal sprays and stuff so at least they have some type of aerosols so that it could actually be um you know so yeah you could get it titrated quicker and so you could get into the the the system faster that you know but the smoking aspect is just just us i mean like they're like oh my god there's a hint of smoke somewhere oh no any smoke at all don't even know what paper you know no it's ridiculous the the the the expectation that like you have to say the kids can't be smoking like no parents can rolling doobies for the kill i mean i mean mr older but you know if it's a medical issue a medical treatment god they're getting titrates they're getting tinctures getting oils they're doing all kinds of stuff they're not rolling up dubies for the [ __ ] kids they would probably prefer to not have to use the medicine to be honest it's one of those things you know usually when you have medicine very often you're like man i wish you didn't have to use this but i'm sick you know yeah there's a kid out there calling because you know colorado had a uh it was the mecca for a lot of the uh uh parents leaving their states uh you know uh charlotte's webb was the uh the initiator of all that right um and uh funny thing about this the because i i give the uh charlotte's web the brothers uh credit for creating that conversation you know keeping it going forward but looks like i gotta answer it text my bad all right well you do that you know colorado also has quentin's amendment which allows school nurses to administer medical cannabis at school for qualifying medical conditions and with a doctor's approval well that's that's a good amendment to have clinton but the left the law left out an opt-out clause for districts that didn't want their employees giving kids the medicine senate minority leader chris holbert a republican from douglas county said sb 2156 is more important to him than any other legislation he sponsored this session seven lawmakers in the education committee approved the bill unanimously on february 24th and now goes to the appropriations committee for review on a yet to be determined date and that is again how laws are made you start one committee hopefully you don't die there then you get out of another committee hopefully you don't die there you get some floor action hopefully you also don't die there and then there's a vote and then you pass if this is nebraska that's it now every other state besides nebraska then you have to go get passed in the other uh legislative body let's say you started in the senate you have to go to the house side of the house you have to go to the senate and it has to be the same one uh and then let's say you get all through all that and then they've been reconciled so it's the same bill and now it goes to the governor's desk and if that governor is mario cuomo yeah sure he might sign it but if that governor is uh gnome i believe is her name in south dakota oh she's vetoing the crap out of that bill and and that sucks and so that's one of the reasons why cannabis legalization news will be here for a bit because these things won't play out over the course of like a fortnight it's it's going to take years miggy is still on the phone so let's move on to the next thing no more urine tests no more urine tests proposed california law would end most workplace marijuana tests again i mean just so dumb just drug test right like yeah i mean the point they have to do random drug tests proves that you can't identify a a consumer of recreational drugs i mean as an employer unless that person's [ __ ] up and then if that person's [ __ ] up then you you take other precautions but writing rejections just don't find [ __ ] nope they you know i mean if they really want random drug tests i think that's fine let's start with the legislature see what they're on and then after that we'll see if we could do it to the people that aren't making any money or like getting a whole bunch of subsidies from the federal government in the terms of um pensions and other fringe benefits okay new legislative bill that's ending a common employment practice five years after californians voted to legalize recreational cannabis in which privacy companies can require workers to test for marijuana use it's assembly bill 1256 introduced by assemblyman bill quirk a democrat of hayward and he has intended to prevent employers from using past evidence of marijuana use such as hero or urine as justification for discrimination against an employee such as denying or terminating employment yeah zero tolerance is a shitty policy overall it's been a shitty policy you know since the reagan era like that it it's why what well a lot of the times it'll have to do with like where does the company get its money from if a lot of it is coming from the federal government they may still have to do the zero tolerance policy as conditions of getting uncle sugar's money and a result of that that's one of the reasons why those types of tests are still done prevalently a lot of people just don't like wheat no i get it it just it bothers me because like my son he asked me or he was saying you know i wanna because he wants to go in the military when he graduates high school and uh he's like i can't wait till i joined the military and hopefully by that time uh the perception of cannabis because of everything that he sees me talking about with morocco and everything he's like maybe it'll be legal then i was like you know i was like even if it's legal tomorrow still another five six years until attitudes and you know zero tolerance happen overnight it's it's [ __ ] up that it's harder to free a man than it is to create a law to put everybody behind bars yeah it's it's harder to get people to accept facts like there's no like this isn't this isn't something to debate and we need more research it's like no no uh we discovered a nandabide in in march 22 fourth of 1992 it's only 29 years old we figured out how this plant worked fairly recently and now we are dang sure this is how it works and look at all these recreational legal states right the zombie apocalypse hasn't happened planes aren't falling out crashes aren't happening everywhere i mean economies are actually thriving but i i i mean we live in the family including painkillers by the way uh you know pizza use is up yeah domino stock [ __ ] goes up [ __ ] i mean it's a win-win baby man people feel great people feel great but it's one of those deals where you're dealing with people that don't know the actual objective facts and and you're trying to just get people to understand facts that's it opinions you don't i don't care what your opinion is on marijuana do you know how it works let's have that conversation and so then once you get moved past that conversation they should be like oh well our laws are really [ __ ] stupid right but if they if they don't understand how cannabis works then it's really easy for these losses to continue yeah yeah and they don't understand also why can't prohibition exist like that you know we have to constantly educate like yes it's all based off it idiocy nothing scientific based it's all racial uh propaganda uh there's nothing legitimate about why prohibition exists like there's no saving the people it's about controlling the people you know it's about controlling the people and uh speaking of control though or no longer uh be a judge of your moral character when the administration marijuana would not count against immigrants good moral character under new congressional bill thank [ __ ] god i mean this is immigrant submission to prior marijuana use can no longer be used to deny them u.s citizenship under a new congressional bill representative brandon boyle a democrat from pennsylvania filed the legislation on monday it addresses a part of the federal immigration policy that's concerning concerns establishing good moral character because yeah everybody already hears good moral character as part of a national application yep they were using our cannabis laws in immigration for decades as something to justify uh you know revoking your uh your visa and deporting you yeah so i'm glad to see that they are introducing uh bills to try to change that this is one of the aspects of the more act that gets into it so like now it looks like they're you know breaking off that piece because the more act is a very large you know bill that they contemplated and and it was going to amend the immigration naturalization act to uh get rid of a lot of the references to marijuana which can prevent people from you know getting their visa or becoming naturalized and they said they're also going to have another the congressman's bill specifically cars out an exemption for applicants who admitted to have using possessed or distributed cannabis and then it would also remove another stigmatizing question that the united states citizenship and immigration services asked you on some of those forms when you're trying to get naturalized have you ever been a habitual drunkard which will no longer appear on uh the questions as well that's an old-timey [ __ ] holy crap have i been a habitual drunkard well yes but like my job was to be a drunk at uh disneyland and it's it's what they paid me for you know i'm the town trunk okay i gotta jump out for a second all right you do that and i'll say uh you know boyle the the rep that sponsored this he said these questions are wholly unrelated to citizenship and it's extremely troubling to see federal applications like this that continue to use a harsh and antiquated terms such as habitual drunken this careless language only serves to reinforce societal stigmas and misunderstandings about substance abuse and it's time that we matter modernize the process that is pretty darn awesome uh let's let's move on to the new vaporizer shipping band impacts the industry and high times is now reporting that the preventing of online sales of e-cigarettes the children act which approved by the congress last december states the ups can no longer handle vape product shipments check out the video that we've done on this it's called the delta 8 vape ban and so the delta 8 vape ban we're going to do some more content on in the next uh two three weeks because it goes into effect on the 26th of this month however it will not really really start catching up to the people that are probably going to continue to sell these things online for another 90 days or so it's not like you want to be on that list tune in for more on that and so yeah what they did was they defined this electronic nicotine delivery system in such a broad way that it would also encompass for no real good reason uh uh vapes and this is a delta eight vape find them at your local head shop that'll probably be where most of them are being sold in a month so they're saving the children that's awesome save those children no longer will anybody be buying e-cigarettes online especially children you know that's one of the reasons why i have not given my daughter a credit card yet because kids don't know how to get into the goddamn uh dark web which i know they know like this is a failed attempt again being another [ __ ] daddy state you know whatever you want to say and then like you see how it's defined and you're like ah crap this is gonna fall straight into what a vape cartridge is and did they intend to do it no they didn't but like it's one of those things where it's so overly broadly defined and says that this nicotine electronic nicotine delivery system is any product that delivers nicotine flavor or any other substance to a user inhaling from the device delta 8 or cbd um so does this mean so like the product itself like the empty cartridge the empty battery cartridge right empty no product in it can that not be shipped to you then as a company because really this doesn't really affect any recreational markets because they're not doing interstate commerce anyways right but no it's basically what it means it's not going to be able to be shipped to you uh using the post office there's maybe like one very small exception but that's kind of like if you're shipping in between friends uh and you're only going to do that like 10 times a year and it's like very small uh and even then they might give you [ __ ] if you try to like mail it but there's going to be uh mail regulations that are coming out about april 27th and then we'll see uh yeah i just anticipate a lot of the and you're seeing it right now like all the delta eight products are starting to evolve a little bit away from the vape carts for example now they're taking a lot of cbd flour and then they take the delta eight and they spray the cbd flour uh and so now you have this blended product where you have delta eight plus you also have cbd for the entourage effect and and what is it it's flour you can mail it but it also delta eight so it's in demand or you're seeing drizzlers uh you know which is essentially like the liquid stuff in here but then you're going to have to be like trying to refill your own vapes and that's going to get frustrating so you just go down the street to the vape shop and buy yourself a delta egg cart well i'm saying like well someone in the recreational market that i see you know they're i don't think there's any change to those guys like because they're not shipping their [ __ ] out there's we don't have any mailing options so you know washington's safe in that market yeah i think you know i mean it just seems like it does hurt all the cbd people who are trying to be on that gray market on the edge right it seems like you see it's either you're in the uh recreational market or you're traditional or you know that's it yeah the healthcare market is uh we'll see we'll see the next farm bill you know in 2022 farm bills coming out we'll see if that addresses delta yeah thousands of california marijuana convictions officially reduced others dismissed good stuff man last month with the stroke at penn san diego county superior court judge eugene a gonna kill it i hire a bead nearly 26 000 people with belly utility marijuana convictions on their records had them reduced to misdemeanor convictions i wonder if i'm one of them i wonder if i had to apply for that that's where most of my arrests were at night in addition to the thousand people rested i'm so proud of you for being arrested for weed well underannounced was a misdemeanor when i was younger so twice twice well you know that would make me a social equity applicant yeah in the first time uh i got pulled over and i've always been honest with cops like my activism comes down to like good policing and stuff like that like uh the first time uh actually three times i got pulled over the first time honest the cop cop lets us go takes our bag and dumps it out but gives me back my pipe it says don't smoke and drive uh second time uh i got pulled over for an out brake light and then i had five cop cars come up in my car after i was already honest with the cop with an eighth like hey this is what i got you didn't catch el chapo and then next thing i'm in the back of the car freaking out like what the [ __ ] i was honest with you and uh he's like i'm gonna kick you in if you keep it up then uh yeah i mean just these just petty stuff you know the third time again under an ounce so they're not gonna like take me in they're they're looking for the bigger boys and uh you always gotta like know your role right know your rights type [ __ ] yeah let's talk about your rights in florida you know where rights can very often go to die go florida not only not only can your rights go to die there but good luck trying to get unemployment in florida so let's let's talk about florida should marijuana legalization limit thc probably not but it's happening according to forbes uh thc of course is the most famous cannabinoid out there however a lot of these types of states are trying to cap thc they try to do it in washington state with extracts so state legislatures in florida have proposed a 10 thc limit on smokable flour and a 16 thc limit on edibles still sold in the state's medical marijuana marketplace let's talk about why that is ludicrous go for it oh governing nature i mean just the whole nature and so you're going to force people to pick it when it's not ripe which again that's not necessarily going to help the patient achieve the uh entourage effect of the whole plant that you're looking for moreover it it continues to like over emphasize the importance of thc you know that even a 30 thc plant is fine hash has been around for thousands of years and so has keith for thousands of years and been way way stronger than uh 10 or 30 percent flour we've been fine and then the 16 thc limit on edibles is that by weight because that's insane you know because if this thing weighs a gram does that mean that i can have 160 milligrams of thc in there that is like an elephant-sized dose of an edible right there and florida's had medical for how many years now uh florida's had medical for i have no idea i want to say it was about the same time that illinois maybe a little no 2016 i think they actually finally passed it because they had to pass it twice because they had to get over 60 percent so i think it was 2016 and like all the licenses are not that old like 2017 and stuff and then truly just access to capital and took over but why is florida so florida like i mean like what's the point like what happened who got hurt here that like now we gotta capture it like what is going on and you're gonna kill the genetics of florida like i think don't think people are understanding like your state is legalish you are you have a chance to be on the forefront of like genetics and appellations like we talked about like if people were to start like okay we can start having this florida sunshine or whatever you want to call it you know there's prime opportunities for your state to pull in a [ __ ] ton of money right you're not going to do that with limiting goddamn thc caps and [ __ ] [ __ ] regulations right i mean like the only thing that that thc cap would do is make the illicit market just fine they'd be like hey i'm going to go back out to the street to buy it why because that stuff will get you high this stuff gives me a headache because they're going to have to do something to that flower to get it down to there i mean like a one-to-one blend maybe that's all you would be able to get and then you have to be watching that ten percent um and so there's there's that aspect and then it's like some of these medical patients need higher thc concentrations i'm glad that they have it inedible but they probably want to also be able to inhale it yeah dabs i mean concentrates or anything uh straight back to the weed man you know yeah that's it i mean uh where's where's moral beach at myrtle beach i always thought was in south carolina but i have no idea okay because uh i don't know if uh because we're getting close to the end here but the horrible story you're talking about is the uh the war on weed leaves one myrtle beach man paralyzed cost 11 million in landmark civil rights case wow so home surveillance video showed in april 2015 a team of heavily armed officers used a battering ram to enter julian benton's myrtle beach home to execute a search warrant three officers fired 29 times [ __ ] kid johnny mccoy julian benton's attorney said they hit him nine times effectively crippling him paralyzing him he had multiple surgeries and still can't walk and then they lied to cover it up yep south carolina south carolina's finest demonstration of not understanding that weed is harmless now this is this is just horrible uh i don't know if you're familiar with j cole the the rapper uh he had a song called neighbors and uh he actually uses actual video footage from his house of officers raiding his house because they thought he was a grow operation opposed to a rap studio is what he had in his goddamn basement so they thought the power was going to growing weed as opposed to growing beets yeah yeah i can't wait to nicholas i'm looking forward to the high mighty i gotta get the puns out now i don't want to embarrass myself when he gets here i want to be all a fan boy some of the questions about 1985. you know uh let's go let's do chong's weed through the decades so we're going back to the 60s where were you smoking all right were we puffing on that i could imagine that you remember blueberry coming into the scene and then i wonder what his criteria though for having to grow now because you know part of what the circuit he's going on is he's got the uh the new chong line out and uh and then chicha says has a line too if we could cheat each other after chong and then we'll be like john was blaming you for everything is that true right and then we'd ask to teach the exact same goal that never mind we'll have fun but like hopefully enough hopefully enough yeah that's pretty fun man to it man it's going to be a lot of fun this is our first show we did over 20 000 subs you know yeah we can't we can't stop until we have more subscribers in peoria illinois hilarious and so we're talking i think 115 000. so like what in a year it depends like i uh i got sick there last week or last month and then um and now the website's down so don't visit us at campus legalization oh canvas industry lawyer cannabis legalization news is still online uh and so you know in a few more months hopefully we can start messing around with more um shows that are like directly related to trending national news uh yeah that's one of the ways that you get a lot of suggested videos and just a crapload of views and so you know if there's something that comes out that we think it'll actually break you do a quick video about it or or um other videos about how to get licenses those get smaller views and then they're more localized but it helps us like you know find visitors or viewers that are in those particular jurisdictions that want to get this game oh yeah and then you know uh yeah and then i can't wait for the site to find it up because i do like to do the word stuff right like for people who like to read you know the video thing was just kind of a happy stance of what i like to do like you pulled me into this and now i'm in this dark web of [ __ ] and you know but the words come come visit the website once it gets rocking it's not rocking right now it looks like it looks like it's not pretty right now that's all i can display into it it's not she's not she's under construction folks just just go to the canvas legalization news and be like in work you know but uh you know one step at a time and the the site was pretty big and so like it was going really really well and then i just tipped over and dived uh which is terrible you know but at the same time it's a lot of fun that we still gotta have the channel yeah no this is great i mean [ __ ] we got 90 people hanging out with us and i [ __ ] love it you know i look forward to our moments you know i mean there's gonna be lots more news coming and uh just take it one day at a time man that's it there's always something to talk about i told you man yeah like that was one of the things do we already talk about the bakery licenses no ah the bakery licenses i can't wait for these things to be a thing like you know everybody's like oh i want to open up a weed restaurant you know where you can make these types of infused dishes and i'm just held on there bro uh that's not how this works they all have to be pre-packed and like you know pre-dosed and all that and then there's really not a consumption lounge license type that's out there yet like where do you go in washington where do you go in seattle down the street to smoke a bowl with your boys or like your friends you know like where do you go yeah no there's no place uh you know and in uh the park right like i mean i'm endorsing public smoking but it's it's decrimed here at the point that's what i'm saying like that's why prohibition is so important ending prohibition is so important so law enforcement can worry about the [ __ ] that's important and not some guy smoking a joint with his friends in the corner of a park you know well and then the guys would have an opportunity to smoke their joints somewhere else yeah yeah if i had if we had well we used to have lounges during medical times but it'll happen again you know so but yeah that's the next step there's a lot of levels to this uh regulation that needs this infrastructure that needs to happen uh want to take the listener mill all right let's do one question if we have one question but then i got to have a call about the websites yep we got whitney city gardens on instagram ass i find myself in the new illinois speaker of the house's district do you think there's any value of lobbying him to fix her cannabis laws any strategic tips to change this [ __ ] because honestly the cannabis regulation feels like it's poorly written and being poorly rolled out um all right so the new speaker actually introduced a bill on this and uh well he introduced a bill that would have increased the ownership of amounts of craft grows from three to ten and so if anything it would have allowed fewer operators to own all of those licenses which are the most accessible cannabis cultivation license currently in the state of illinois uh that's not a good sign if anything it looked like that was an mso bill like you know multi-operators like hey one craft grow that's that's okay but that's only 14 000 square foot flowering i want um and so can i own ten of them is that okay if i can own ten uh and and that's the bill that that representative ford introduced i can't remember what h b it is off the top of my head but it was like ew ew did he introduce a bill that says hey 5 000 square feet is too much we need a micro cultivation license of only 500 plants no he did not he wanted to increase the amount of ownership to essentially allow for greater m a amongst the uh current caps of three licenses he wanted that raised to ten what's the small do you guys have small associations there like like they do like they did in rhode island where they fought that one no nobody has license just seems to me that you guys need more um uh we call it uh community gathering type things you know we do there's a lot of work to do in illinois but uh i know we gotta get out of here so thanks for tuning in everyone make sure you like and subscribe to keep up with all cannabis legalization news we'll see you on sunday you", "1g3FBta599s": "he throws Acapulco gold see welcome to juvenile stars Acapulco gold cannabis review enjoy the show hey you welcome to my quick review a juveniles does this is what I do smoke push past goal and shatter - go and check them out I try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news I was there to show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you wet kakapo canned gold live resin review so instead of doing a dab like we usually do I tried to do that and the texture of the shadow don't work the best for that so it didn't work out the best so what I'm going to do is just I just split a whole bunch into this joint and we're going to review it that way because the texture it's more like a powder and I can barely even get any clothes it's like powder it's falling out as a just ultimate down a little bit none of its sticky at all it's more just like a powder and I can't get any on the the dabber or whatever I can't get and I'm stuck to it the works right so I'm just I just dumped a little bit into this joint let's light it up and smoke it that way it still smells very good and looks very good so [Music] I'm sure it's very good texture itself just think the best for do it dad's adventure thing look see it's falling right help man it's not sticking whatsoever don't stick to my fingers at all I mean if you melted it it probably would but it's just like powder I've never had any I've had live resin before they had some of the like powdery texture to it but not to do the whole thing some of it was sticky and you could just mix it together that it's just straight powder you can't mix it put it together later said maybe if we took something to melt it down it'll just make a big mess instead of wasting at all I'm just gonna smoke it in joint so it has a very citrusy like this about egg taste to it I was too busy writing on about the texture to get into the taste and everything so the taste it is a very strong citrusy taste to it but it is a bit sweet but it is a really strong citrus taste if you don't really like citrus not really thing then you should go for something else but if you really like citrus I definitely give it a go and we'd rather smoke it in joints then and bombs or whatever doing dabs and I would say this is probably one of the best for you because it's so much easier to just dump a little bit into the wheel all right but if you like doing dabs I wouldn't refer this to you at all it does taste really good and it tastes like it's strong but I really don't care for the powder evenness to it especially if you're doing tabs but overall does seem pretty good nice it does seem to be a good account for life it seems to be a good amount in this little container so instead of just going on a boat how shady the texture is let's talk about the good parts about it it is made by memorial or Amodeo jungle however you say it primordial whatever jungle and what's made by sticky suit like this that's their saying again and you can like all their boxes they usually have a nice like little thing animal sometimes I have different animals on the little sticker on top the containers always have like either like animal paul friend or like the traffic LC on it and stuff they always had different things so i definitely give them a like a little point i guess for how they package the stuff they always go over the java packages it matches packaging it great and I are telling something maybe it is pretty good so I round up against the best making honking noises but it does have a really strong citrus taste it's pretty good it's not overwhelming it's strong though and tastes pretty good it does say it's pretty nice I seem to be starting to feel okay from it though I feel a lot more like awake and talkative I guess it is pretty good it's a sativa I'll give the taste that rating oh it definitely tastes really good it's really strong citrus flavor not really original cousin citrusy but it tastes really good so I'll give it give it up three-and-a-half four five not too bad at all the texture I don't like the texture I'm just yeah I guess but I do like the taste I do like how easy it is to smoke a joint so it's really good if that's what you prefer smoking joints and what your life isn't or whatever so I'll definitely give your dad I won't put it off the face definitely better drugs I don't know maybe there's a certain way to smoke the powdery stuff but I don't know I don't really do all that much dabs as I said before on the videos I do smoke a lot more drugs than I do bad so I guess in a way it's a little better for me but I do like doing the dad before at the start of the video I do like the winter so you can see me first open and if you stuff like well I guess I could go open it I'll give it an overall rating of 325 before because it is good especially for joy so let me know what you thought I want to say thank you now it's time to finish so I'll be back but I have to go now that we're all good is done but I got lots more videos so you can state with shows so bust up some more fish to roll and watch another show now I'm Glasson Oh you", "bw9UMJrlWXo": "what opened today is actually where that medical marijuana is grown produced and turned into products that people can then buy at that same location but the company says by next year they hope to have five other dispensaries around central virginia it's really something amazing it's been two and a half years in the making the thoughts from philip goldberg as his medical marijuana company gold leaf medical officially opened their south richmond doors to customers we just couldn't be more excited launched in virginia inside the product is both sold and grown with the latter taking up the majority of the space starting with about a five-month growing process then we take that raw material and we put it through our extraction goldberg says the oils believed to have therapeutic benefits are extracted tested by a third party then put back into different products vaporization cartridges the edible products and the solid concentrates now in order to buy these things patients must be registered with the state's board of pharmacy then have an on-site consultation with one of their pharmacists who will guide and track their use what's the effect that we're seeing is the pain reduced are you able to sleep through the night did your appetite increase you know whatever the desired outcome was we're measuring that goldberg says over 2 000 people have already registered seeking help for a variety of ailments so we expect to see a large number of patients with chronic pain anxiety disorders are also right at the top of the list and muscle spasticity seizure disorders my hope for medical cannabis is that he will be able to reduce his anxiety among those who came out was teresa champion who drove down from springfield she says her autistic 27 year old son has behavioral issues that make getting medical treatment a challenge i appreciate the opportunity to access alternative medical care after the in-person visit goldberg says clients can then order online for at home delivery yes to help with that service they're planning to have five more dispensary locations running in four to five months trying to get as far outside our our district is also important just as it's important to serve the people closer into the city and goldberg says they have looked at places like short pump and midlothian and when all five dispensaries are up and running they expect to be employing around 300 people in total one other thing of note is that this week has been a soft opening and some of their products are still waiting for state approval and when that's done they'll have their grand opening in about two weeks time", "fSihlJgUVEw": "welcome back to another video guys let's dive into one of the most highly requested asx stock sectors and look at the cannabis sector we know over the last few weeks there have been some announcements that have come out that have pushed the prices of these stocks and i believe that's why a lot of you have been requesting them in previous videos so like with all videos on the channel we're going to go and dive into the technical analysis so if you're new to the channel this is one of the first videos you're seeing you don't know what technical analysis is stick around subscribe to the channel hit the bell notification icon as well so you know when they come out basically we're going to figure out whether these are stocks at a good position to be buying or selling of course none of this is financial advice get that out of your head we're just looking at the charts to figure out whether these are at a good position or not the rest is up to you you need to do your own research to figure out whether it's a company that you like the look of so let's take a look at about 10 or 12 of these that i have on the watch list and determine what position they are in in their current cycle lastly if you find any value for them hit that like button down below because it goes a long way to helping out the channel get noticed and push through that damn youtube algorithm all right let's go and check out these stocks so you can see here is the list on the side what i'm using here is tradingview.com if you don't already have a an account for yourself i have a link in the description for trading view you get 30 bucks for free when you sign up otherwise you can use the free version just know that you'll get a lot of pop-up ads if you want to get rid of them just pay the damn 12 or 15 bucks a month it's really worth the investment if you're looking to trade or to invest long term very very helpful all right first stock i've got is a c 8 now most of these have been requested and i threw in another few which i found on stock head so you've got a few of them here these are pretty great articles if you just want to have a look at some ticker symbols to get started on i'm not going to go and dive into all these all it does is just tell you the sector and how much of the business is made up of cannabis all right so back to the chart ac8 i'm sure if you're a regular viewer of the channel you guys would know this pattern by now it's essentially a pump and dump all right so it's pretty much news announcements if you're new to this and these are the first times you've seen it and you're interested in cannabis stocks probably because you've heard of it you probably heard of it a week or two ago right around these peaks pretty much when that comes out it's usually the worst time to buy you have to make your own decision if you want to just buy it at the top here and just write it all the way down that's up to you but overall this is just crap i'm sorry to say if there's a lot of people who are wanting to get into this there will come a time there will come a time where these things are good but right now this is just bordering on the line of degeneracy it's absolute garbage now look i'm being a bit harsh because it is that stuff that's what we trade in crypto it's what we trade in these penny stocks there it's just a degeneracy we're just trying to make it a quick buck we're trying to make a flip and see this thing run up 5x or 10x or something like that and then hopefully get out at the top generally we're hearing about it when we're at these tops and we write it all the way down so don't be a degenerate do your research stick around with this sector if you are absolutely interested in it and you want to read about it on a daily basis to know what's going on or on a weekly basis gather all that news together and just form a picture of where the market's at and then learn technical analysis to understand accumulation and distribution if that sounds like too much work then definitely don't worry about these stocks i'm going to run through the others a little bit quicker i just thought i would bring that up at the beginning and not go through it on every single one i probably will bring up degeneracy a few more times with this video so ac8 it's on the way down in my opinion you guys have a look as well aeb was another now i can't say if this is the exact chart because sometimes the asx uses an old ticker symbol and this might be a different company back in 2011. but from what i can see here this is a clear clear downtrend just all the way down there's nothing holding it up at the moment there's no sign of a reversal pattern it's just down so aeb i'm not interested at the moment let's move on agh i know that's a pretty popular one because i've had it on the channel before that's why i've got some ta on here already looks like this the trades already been and gone and this is just topping out at a pretty much double top so that pattern is bearish and we can see it happening already volume is increasing i'm just going to get rid of this trade that we used last time there we go and fibonacci we've used that thing is said and done it's broken through its support level volume increased as it broke through so we're at the end of day close now at monday the 21st of december so markets are closed a gh another one down next level to hopefully hold up would be that 31 cents otherwise it's in trouble heading all the way back down so keep keep an eye on that bot botanics pharmaceuticals another one not in the worst position but again i don't like the look of this look of it especially as it tries to bridge this gap through here if this is the same stock like i talked about the ticker symbols then i think it's probably got a hard challenge a hard mountain to climb up through here so it's not one that i'm interested in i went through and looked at all of these stocks using tradingview.com just to figure out the market caps so this is another one coming up they're all basically 150 mil or under some of them even much lower like this at 40 mil keep that in mind so that is sometimes why people want to get them look at that from march to the top here 6x not bad but it's a huge gamble at that point in time to go from 2 cents to 12 cents maybe you got out at 14 but that's very rare anyone's actually going to to get that right from the bottom to the top so keep an eye on these things if it's something that you want to look at later on just don't leave them now and then pick them up again later when they come back into the news because no doubt when they come into the news it's going to be on one of these peaks can that one always comes up can group limited it's just on the way down every time i look at this it's it's down down down so it had a basically accumulation after the breakout and then shot up again to make what are we at 40 percent 45 at the absolute top if you're lucky probably got 36 35 30 percent very high risk for not much return in this one so can if you want to know about it that's the chart that's my answer to can and then just bring this up again unless we break out of any of these areas this high all these lows which if it breaks out of the low then forget about it but unless it goes above these highs then i think it's just it's in no man's land so refer back to this video cph same deal dumping dumping dumping maybe it'll hold up maybe you'll get a bounce from here to here high risk for an 80 up to you guys maybe it'll go to here 50 but that's the low remember so you're coming in this high it's just not worth the risk in my opinion you could see this thing just turn around gap down you're off 50 pretty easily because there's no other support here until we get back down to around that level of 5 cents so this is a solid 70 50 to 70 down it's just not worth the risk this is degeneracy at its finest unless you got in much earlier on back back through here so october-ish area and then you're held on but why would you even know about this stock back here that's just it's a hard one you don't don't be hard on yourself like to get in through through here who knows you had to have been following cannabis stocks from the beginning cresso farmer cph all right that's degenerate looking to me on the way down g sorry j h l there is just no data here it's just so sketchy so don't even look at this one in my opinion not financial advice do your own research here if you feel like it's an accumulation zone by all means that's that's up to you guys but if you really needed some sort of tea on here look at these peaks you need to get above these peaks and hold above them you need to get above this seven cents need to get above this 11 cents but do it on a gradual basis not on a spike needs to slowly climb and grind and grind its way up and get above these levels and then comfortably start to move up so that's looking a little better than shooting off to the moon and then back again see it comes all the way back in at two cents if you don't get out at 10 you're all the way back at two what's the point so keep an eye on that jhl it looks way too sketchy moving on little green farmer there's another one that was requested this just got dumped today 11 down i think it's just going to keep going look at that volume increase that was barely holding on to its high levels look at that volume just drop off no more interest in it dumps past the 61. it's definitely coming to the 50. let's see if it gets to the 38 and if it comes all the way back probably a nice 23 area here so essentially that's a 76 retracement from the top which is known to happen on penny stocks very easily it comes back into this zone and starts to accumulate again so keep an eye on that could be wrong this could be another setup it could start to form a base up here so that would be the reason why it would be a useful stock to look at again if it started to accumulate again in sort of this area here because it's sitting above these old highs that would discount this move all the way back into this area to re-accumulate so that would be a stronger fall and set up and hold at that position to re-accumulate than if it fell through here all the way back to this area and no doubt there will be chances to pick up this stock in that area there so lgp off the cards until i see some sort of support come through hopefully around that 40 cents zld zld zelera again looks like it's on its way down look at that huge spike high volume sellers just like buyers coming in then sellers just absolutely crapping all over them and like we know that close was lower there's the close right there there's the open the open is controlled by the amateurs the professionals control the clothes so they just crapped all over these buyers early on so these buyers came in crapped on them sold everything and now we're just down down down down down every day there's just down you had an inside a tiny up and then it just shot down so i can see this coming back again to that seven ish sense i don't think much is going to happen here i think that's i think that's going to get crushed yep all right that's at zld let's pick it up again if it happens to find support around this area here alright so that's where we can be wrong like that's where we want it to hold support in order for it to be a stock to consider as a re-accumulation zone before it moves up again all right so i'm always looking at both sides i hope you guys are doing that too you want to have a look at it because we're only playing on probabilities here mxc again you can see that these patterns it's all the same up and down i'm never going to say any more with this right now there's no sign of this stock starting to find a base so mxc we'll come back to it at some other point if anyone requests it otherwise it's going to sit there and no man's lane rno i know i've seen that come up a few times this one that's just it's just weird shut up nothing's happening i think it's going to bounce around very eliquid stock so keep that in mind and overall just a mega mega downtrend if this is still the same stock in the same symbol rno it's just mega down from 2014 and for it to have any sort of hope i think it needs to break above this long term downtrend needs to spike above and then hold above it even if it starts to drift it needs to hold above that line and form a base head up again all right we're coming to the end thc i couldn't leave cannabis dogs without doing a stock called thc all right so this one again long term downtrend you can see that it's almost identical to the last one except bigger spikes it's starting to slow down on the drops and you can see these lows now are getting a bit higher so i'm just going to use the top here if i can grip it there you go that's a pretty good downtrend through there which is starting to slow the lows are forming higher which is a good sign so what i would expect from here is maybe something that bases out hopefully breaks above and doesn't break the lows remember that and then starts to do its thing all right so that could be years from now we've already seen this go on a massive downtrend for a couple of years few years now so as long as we don't break that low there so we'll throw in a horizontal then it has a hope but i would not be trying to buy and hold this thing on the hope that it's going to bounce up anytime soon maybe it does all right so that's your call not me your call i just don't like the look of it because it's such a small market in such a small market overall in the aussie market compared to if you're going to buy in the us or uk or any other markets which are a hell of a lot bigger and it's just it's too risky in my opinion of course so yeah i don't see any base forming here just yet like something solid so thc i'm going to forget about that that's my wrap up of stocks on the cannabis sector 1 2 3 four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 12 cannabis stocks i'm obviously not that entertained by any of these you may be but looking at the charts they're all in this massive downtrend i think they're all going to move together they'll have pumps up on news and if you're not in early with them personally forget about them they're just pump and dumps for now because there's nothing concrete about them do your fundamental research on the individual companies if you really want to get into the space otherwise i'm staying clear of it and if anyone asks for cannabis stocks again i'm going to refer them back to this video until the overall patterns of all of these markets change you can see they're all very very similar so you don't want to be buying up 10 of them because that's bad money management they're all going to move the same you're better off just having one or two or three not even that i'm staying away from it i'm going to leave it there guys if you found some value from this video i'd appreciate a like down here if you're new and you stuck around to this last piece of the

for etf investors in cannabis and and reminding folks the same reasons why etfs are so popular for thematic and diversification investing across other sectors in cannabis the fast evolving nature of both the macro and the bottom up is why we believe active management in cannabis etfs is critical to get the right exposure last week chuck schumer making headlines in an interview with al harrington ex-nba great now cannabis operator where he put forward the concept of an omnibus type of a bill for legislation that would solve the capital markets issues possibly the listing issues for cannabis companies in addition to some of the complex issues on social and criminal justice what does this mean if any of this is is fast-tracked in in the way it was suggested this could mean re-rating for cannabis that would be much sooner than investors had expected the federal legalization even after all the bullishness of the georgia runoffs and the the understanding that cannabis legislation could move faster this would be a fast green light for cannabis and it was an important headline for the industry new york in a cannabis data mine according to governor cuomo setting budget parameters last week we've been waiting for these numbers and look after new jersey state ballot passed on the night of federal elections everyone's been expecting new york we've been expecting this for two years arguably new york is the most important market to go adult since california came online so we know the size of the population we know the size of the addressable market and the importance that new york has in terms of the entire east coast than flipping so connecticut and pennsylvania what does this mean for cannabis investors it means that the addressable market is growing that much more and it means for some of the us operators who are well positioned in new york accurately for gti at cresco labs this is another major market for investors to follow but it sends the message that at some point the states are going to lead the national focus and cannabis addressable markets continue to grow very exciting for cannabis investors [Music] was the redick rebellion an opportunity for reefer or were weed investors actually running in the opposite direction well some of the same dynamics that have played out in markets outside of the cannabis industry we saw high short interest companies being squeezed higher and some of the companies that maybe were the winners for investors with better long-term fundamentals actually sold off so we saw canadian lps high short interest names even a name like canopy growth which is near the top of our balance sheet in cnbs we love the fundamentals longer term was boosted by the activity last week because of its short interest whereas a gti or a cure leaf were u.s multi-state operators that got caught in some of this volatility remember cannabis very high volatility market to begin with when you see externalities or global market turmoil or dysfunction cannabis is going to trade with more volatility than developed markets will it's exactly what we saw last week keep your eye on long-term fundamentals that's how we're managing actively in

recipe today and i'll show you ways to utilize it to get full advantage out of everything so we're going to make some honey then we're going to take the excess and make some honey infused coconut oil and then after that we're left with like a little taffy-like substance that we're going to make some candy with this video is really in-depth i like to usually make my videos pretty quick so you can get the gist but i wanted to try this one just to break it down deep dive for you so you can learn from me as i'm learning throughout the process so come on with me this recipe is sure to get you buzzing so let's dive into the hive let's get infusing my friends we're going to be using an ounce and a half a shake one ounce of flour you could play with the ratios that you're feeling some organic unrefined coconut oil already infused for the extra kick some raw unrefined honey as well as some bee pollen there naturally occurring lecithin to act as an emulsifier and then we'll be using our liquid sunflower lecithin as well to emulsify you're going to need a cheesecloth a strainer a french press like we're going to be using today as well and i'll show you how we're going to use these later in the video the next step here is going to be the decarboxylation process we're going to break down our bud here the ounce at least that wasn't broken down cover it with some foil here and then we're going to go ahead and put it in the oven 240 degrees for 40 minutes you can play with it 220 for an hour you could do 250 for 35 now we're gonna add the honey i have the crock pot on high and i put the honey under some hot water to make it easier to scoop out we're just going to scoop out a good amount i'm not going to do the whole jar my goal here is to kind of use at least as possible to make the most potent product possible and you could also use a double broiler here might be even a little better because you're not going to get the heat directly on the honey so feel free to use that double broiler or you could use the levo too now i'm going to go ahead and add our pre-infused coconut oil it does not have to be infused the coconut oil is just another fat here to help the thc bind to so we can get that potent product and we can make sure we're sucking out all that goodness to make our edible hit hard did about a tablespoon and a half there and the cool thing about this is we know how strong it is because i actually infused this batch with the levo2 which is really convenient like i said you could use it for this recipe as well but then i checked it here with the t-check 2 potency tester that helps me know how strong my product is when i'm making it highly recommend i'll drop a link below if you want to check out the t-check too i'll also put a link for the levo as well links for other videos everything down below so 3.2 milligrams per milliliter we're looking at about 47.7 milligrams per tablespoon so yeah you can do the math we did about one and a half there we'll end up adding a little more here for about two tablespoons total maybe a little more let's go ahead and add a couple scoops of this bee pile in here the bee pollen like i said is just going to act as an emulsifier with that natural lecithin in it and it's not going to have that taste of like the sunflower even though we're still going to add it we're going to go double here to make sure that this hits right that it's available that it's just gonna be the best honey we can make let's go ahead and add a little nutmeg here we're gonna spice this up today make it like asian spice style honey i'm gonna do a little nutmeg here then we're gonna add a little cinnamon as well it's going to give it that good flavor kind of cover up the flavor of all this cannabis we're using because we're using so damn much two and a half ounces is a lot to infuse with just how much honey we are so this [ __ ] is going to be extra strong now let me show you what it's looking like this is looking tasty it makes me want to make this honey just without butt in it no i'm just kidding we're going to add the bud of course now we already added that um bee pollen let's just add about a teaspoon to a tablespoon of the liquid sunflower lecithin to cook up with the cannabis like i said this is important to have so everything blends together at the end you're going to see some stuff down later in this video i try to make full use of everything i hate any waste when it comes to infusion so i'll show you some tricks that i kind of learned or tried in this video and let me know what you think i'm just curious so we're just going to stir this up here nice and mixed together the crock pot is on low now i had it on high just to heat up quick but we're going to infuse everything on low there is one part where i turn it on warm about two and a half hours in i turn it down let it sit and um you'll see what that's looking like here in a second just added a little more bee pollen trying to get the mixture right and this video is just really in depth very thorough i do a lot of videos that are just a couple minutes but i wanted to bring you something that's more well-rounded something that can help us both learn more when we're making crazy good edibles add a little star knees in there give it that flavor next part let's go ahead and add that bud that we had decarb the two and a half ounces in our case play with it in your case maybe you could go a lot less if you just want something that's not as potent you could use a concentrate you could do whatever you're feeling here or you could just have an infused coconut oil mix it with the honey with an emulsifier and you'll be good to go but let's just go ahead and add this d carb bud here in our case the two and a half ounces like i said this is a lot so we're going to go ahead and stir it around and we're going to have to end up adding a little more coconut oil and we're going to add a little more honey just to make sure everything's looking good that you know there's a liquid layer over the bud we don't want to burn anything and that's why i was saying the double broiler could be a good method too because it's a lot harder to burn anything in a double broiler or with the levo but i love the crock pot i love the ease of it especially when i'm making such a big batch using two and a half ounces so that's about two tablespoons maybe two and a half we'll say total so that's an extra 100 milligram kick right there which will make this nice like i said it doesn't need to be infused this is just a little way to bring up that thc content a little more let's add some more honey we're gonna infuse this for about three hours total i probably could have gone two i might have gone a little long here to be straight up honest with you but that's what this is all about it's all a learning experience so let's mix it together i'm gonna come back in 30 minutes like i said the crock pot is on low i don't want anything to burn here today so 35 minutes in here you can see it's starting to melt we're getting that liquid there it's got that breaking down and we're just going to go ahead and put the top back on and let it sit i'ma pop back in a little while and uh keep giving it a stir you want to stir it you know as frequently as you like i would say you know every 20 30 an hour i ended up walking away and getting caught up in some editing for like an hour i probably should have stirred it just a little more i'm just trying to be open and honest just to help you make the best recipe possible and this is what it's looking like about two hours in i probably could have stopped it here strained it but what i decided to do at this about two hour mark was put the crock pot on warm i put the crock pot on warm for about 30 minutes just kind of let it sit then i put it back on the low to finish up so we're looking at about that three hours total for infusing and there it is the three hours in you can see it's darkened up it's all infused so i'd play with it you know you could do two hours to four hours i'd recommend i wouldn't go under two hours personally but let me know if you try if you do an hour and a half and you like it drop a comment let me know now the hard thing with honey is that it especially this unrefined honey first let's take everything out here you know the cinnamon the nutmeg etc but the thing with this honey is it's so thick once it needs to be hot to strain properly so we need to do this right away so grab your hot mitt whatever you're using and we're going to put it in the french press to just really press it out of there and get all the honey we can like i said it wants to cool down quickly so we need to make sure we're doing this at a good rate here just scoop it right in there this two and a half ounces here we're gonna press down and just press that honey out and this is like you know you could use whatever method you like you could put it in a cheesecloth and squeeze it with your hands and whatnot but like i said we gotta work here when this is hot so put some nice pressure on there and just push that honey out like i said there's a lot of flour as we know but look at that honey coming to the top strain it again get everything out of the crock pot push it down here in the french press we're just going to repeat this process and get as much honey out as possible like i said it wants to cool off pretty quick so now we're going to add just a little more bee pollen in there help the honey emulsify a little more and then we're just going to stir it up see how it is right there and if it does start cooling down a little bit you can throw it in the microwave just you know 20 seconds real quick help it be a little more liquid there and we're just going to keep stirring that up and there's our honey now you might be saying there's like a lot of other stuff there that's what i always think i'm like well i have all this butt i feel like there's so much probably honey even in there i feel like there's probably thc so now what we're gonna do after this honey here that we're gonna pour up that's just delicious by the way probably my favorite top three you know edibles infusions that i've ever made just put a little more lecithin in there make sure it's all good just a touch and we're gonna take that coconut oil and we're going to make a full batch of the coconut oil with the bud that was already in here i'll show you kind of how we're doing that here in just a second continue to stir up that honey make sure it's all mixed properly there it is our beautiful potent cannabis honey and i'll do a test later so you can see that it's potent i test it and it definitely is potent and i'll give you some good ideas that you can make with it now let's load up our bag here with the two and a half ounces of the flour that we already pushed all the honey out of but as you can see there still looks like there's liquid in there has like that molasses look we just need to heat it back up and then what we're going to do now is take this bag close it up and then we're going to infuse it with the coconut oil that we had see trying to twist it's like impossible and this is still really freaking hot and it's still hard to get the honey out so we're going to take full advantage of this by mixing it in with our coconut oil the coconut oil that we used previously that is already infused so this coconut oil should end up extra potent we're just simply going to add this bag to the crock pot and then add the rest of the coconut oil and we're going to let it infuse today for about two hours stirring every 30 minutes or so since both were already infused we could probably even do it last time we could probably do an hour and it would still be fine but i'm going to do it too just to be safe here and right after we're done infusing let's throw our nut milk or fine cheesecloth bag in the french press and press out all that green goodness right there and then we'll just go ahead and dump that jar back in the crock pot give it a stir get any of the sediment that's on the bottom and then we're going to fine strain it through our fine strainer here and after it goes through all the way here you'll see we're going to add a little bit of that liquid sunflower lecithin to help everything emulsify help that honey combine to the coconut oil and such and then we're going to pour this back into the coconut oil jar i stir it but then i'm going to give it a nice shake try to help everything mix up even better here but what we're going to find or what i found when doing this is that there's still going to be some separation i think it might be because the honey cooked too much or it's just too dense even with the emulsifiers it still wants to separate so we're going to go ahead and strain it through again here for the second time to separate that you can look even on the bottom of it right now it looks like a caramel like thicker caramelly candy substance that's left from the honey you can see the oil draining out right now which is cool but it's still mixed with the honey i'm going to grab a close-up here to show you just what i mean and it still looks like it's mixed together see how that's coming out right there that's the honey mixed with the coconut oil and i just thought this was a cool shot so i grabbed a close-up to kind of show you how the substance is looking and you might be able to see if you look in the fine strainer at the bottom there that's where like the caramel like build up is now we're going to strain it through here for the third and final time i mean you could probably do this to your heart's content but it's starting to get colder anyway when we don't want it to get too cold or it'll just be a pain like i said you can throw it in the microwave if need be but you can look with my fork how i'm moving that kind of caramel-like substance around and i'm really interested to see the potency on this see if it tastes good and see if we can make a good candy here next for this three-part recipe now if you look here at it it looks like see see how it's like caramelly right there really thick nice and i'm gonna i got some ideas here we're about to work on next before we test all three so you can see if you want to make it and we're left with a good amount of infused coconut oil looking a lot more potent but color doesn't tell all so we'll have to test this next here not a crazy amount but still pretty good amount right there start low and kind of see if i feel anything from this let's see what it does i'll come back to you all right so i'd say that amount i took was feeling about like 40 50 milligrams i'm an hour and 42 in i is usually feel most by now i have a feeling it's going to come on a little slower but it's hitting the spot it's nice and then i was asking my roommate he's like dude that shit's good he's like that honey is nice i'm like oh okay man well you tried it he's like yeah he's like uh we made a juice this is a good idea so they what they did is heat up a little water put some of that honey in there stir it up add it to the juice and then ice it and they said it hit the spot had them feeling good last night so i would say overall recipe is a success but we're still yet to try [Music] um this the uh what i did with the second recipe we're going to try this next and then i have this here the honey that kind of toffee like substance that i'm going to roll some stuff out and try to make like a candy with like a cow tail that candy is kind of my inspiration for the look and feel of that so overall honey is a success so far and uh hits the spot and hits good got me buzzing right all right now time for the candy experiment let's take out this honey caramel-like substance roll it out with the wax paper and then we're going to go ahead and just add our can of sugar that we have on the outside so it's not sticky and giving it a little extra potency let's slice it up these are looking like little sugary tootsie rolls now the question is how are they all right so they've been sitting for about a week so they flattened up but here are these little like honey candies let's give them a taste tastes like [ __ ] to be honest with you we'll see if one works i don't even want to eat another i'm honestly not going to eat these other ones unless it hits really hard but full transparency this is not legit the honey was delicious and hit hard the coconut oil hit hard this tastes really bad i usually don't care much about taste but this tastes pretty bad all right so it's about an hour or so later from that little honey candy that tasted like [ __ ] now i was talking trash on it but i am feeling it i'd say right now it feels like what i'd usually take maybe like a 20 milligrams it's not super heavy but it could still kick in a little more here but not taste good not taste good let's do a little recap though [ __ ] it so those were an experiment and still eat them but kind of failed because it tastes pretty damn bad the coconut oil was a success put this in a smoothie did like a t in between teaspoon tablespoonish hey good should have recorded that i think i said i was going to but i'm doing a video every day so i got to get more out this one's taking a while this is an in-depth video and then of course the honey come some recipes with this for you um do like a simple syrup that you can put in any drink really etc and yeah so recipe was worth it it's taken some time this video's taken a long time and i'm looking at this too this uh ghee butter double dose that i did in the brownies or double those brownies this is the butter here and now that i say that too there was something else that i wanted to mention in that video and that was that if you wanted to and what i would do next time i was just trying to do it quick once again is i would have put some water in there when i was cooking it you can do this in any butter recipe even if you're using a crock pot or whatever and it's going to help separate the chlorophyll and all that other plant material from there so you can have a more clean tasting product although the brownie still did taste really good i will say that for sure um yeah thanks for hanging out i hope you like this in-depth video um but like i said i'm trying to do something new here i've done a bunch of like shorter ones and stuff but never one quite like this that's this in depth so i hope it finds you well um and i hope you're having a good 2021 so far like i said i'm doing a video a day trying to go extra hard and uh just trying to bring you dope content if you want to make this recipe hopefully i can help you you know you can and if you make it you can help me drop a comment below let me know if you tried something maybe you did something different so you were left with something else like maybe you turned the honey into something really cool just let me know drop a comment below and uh oh winded walking up the stairs sitting down but thanks for chilling guys always good to have you here you", "H-6uPDbmPL0": "[Music] [Music] what's up having live family welcome to the channel today's topic is I'm gonna break down the difference between CBD hemp and weed alright so here's the difference we has a high THC Hill CBD has a low THC you probably want to know what THC main I'm have to put the word on the screen so that you can pronounce it but it's a pretty big word but here's the difference okay with the high THC from we you get what they call a stoner you get a high or whatever and so that way you know when you smoking that or you whichever way you do it it's going to put you to a point where you can't really function are you gonna be out for the day but if you're taking CBD and then you taking him guess what you get healing factors you can take that and you won't be out for today you can still function but your body will be well balanced and be balanced and appointment you feeling good the energy is right and it can also heal you so people don't you know government don't like you to say he'll so what we're gonna say is balance okay so that's what the whole term is it balance you out so that was are the two big differences of that so your body has this thing called the endocannabinoid system that endocannabinoids sensitive have to be balanced every day you know so listen to the work can never know it so cannabinoid comes from the word cannabis which is a plant that mother nature already put in the earth so that provided for the people which are us so that's what's happening the medical world to tell you go out and get pharmaceutical right that's still a drug put together in the lab but mother nature said hey I'm gonna grow a pair so anything that you need you just take that plant how have you consumed it and that plant will make you better so that's the difference between marijuana

Border Patrol shows that marijuana seizures have decreased by millions of pounds they believe that in 2020 ninety percent of the marijuana market in Colorado will be supplied by license and tax vendors the other side argues just the opposite they say that the black market and organized crime actually benefits from marijuana legalization by undercutting legal and state license sellers according to the Colorado attorney general's office the legalization of marijuana has inadvertently helped fuel the drug cartels by trading drugs like heroin for marijuana and that the cartels are growing marijuana under the cover of legal operations in Colorado to fill the black markets in other states from a medical standpoint the legalization of marijuana looks a bit different in 1970 the US Congress placed marijuana in schedule 1 which is the most restrictive category of drugs it is considered to have no acceptable medical use and a high potential for abuse however 33 of 50 US states and DC have legalized the medical use of marijuana proponents of medical marijuana argue that it can be safe and effective treatment for the symptoms of cancer AIDS multiple sclerosis pain go coma epilepsy and other conditions they cite dozens of peer-reviewed studies prominent medical organizations major government reports and the use of marijuana as medicine throughout world history opponents of medical marijuana argue that it is too dangerous to use lacks FDA approval and that various legal drugs make marijuana use unnecessary they say marijuana is addictive least a harder drug use impairs driving ability interferes with fertility and injures the lungs immune system and brain they say that medical marijuana is a front for drug legalization and recreational use hopefully this gave you a quick look at the two sides of this debate there's a lot of studies and research supporting each side which can make this a difficult topic to agree on go ahead and leave your comments

we're also have a podcast of course source the marijuana times on Apple podcast for the audio version of the show today are the only version the show I should say today we're talking about Oregon can have a backlog there when it comes to recreational marijuana applications also Colorado companies in Colorado cannabis companies in Colorado or finding a a novel way and a vironment a friendly way to advertise in Colorado and also when many people feared I went the Medical Marijuana Program in Ohio has come to pass we'll talk about all of that but first of course cannabis news is brought to you by nature - side dot-com check out nature side and their organic all-natural pesticides gonna be regulatory compliant you don't use harmful chemicals in whatever state you're growing in so you need nature side to side of El Cid nature - aside dot-com a proud sponsor of cannabis news with Joe Claire go check them out and then organic all-natural pesticides thank you Dan HS ID its first story is by yours truly over marijuana times dot org Oregon to stop processing new recreational marijuana licenses after June 15th basically according to the Oregon Liquor Control Commission any applications received after June 15 for recreational marijuana business licenses will not be looked at until 2019 meaning anybody they have a backlog of applications they've got a lot to get through a couple thousand to get through so the ones before June 15th are going to use the rest of the year to get through those and then after June 15th they'll start looking at thousand 2019 mark pending giorno LCC spokesman said we need to focus on what we have and maintain it and get caught up with the backlog we want people to be aware of it they've said some April 2016 the LCC has issued about 1,900 marijuana licenses well with 29,000 worker permits much like Colorado every worker has to have a permit to work somewhere in the marijuana supply chain so basically there they're way behind whether or not they'll put more money to it a bigger budget whatever if you were a marijuana business in Oregon you're trying to get an application in the for recreational whoops that was wrong jump the gun a little bit there you want to get a recreational marijuana license in Oregon you apply it for June 15th well hear me wait in awhile and it sucks because as I mentioned and the story that I I linked to you in my piece there's some people who are you know they've been paying rent on a place for a long time in anticipation of getting a license they got in before the June 15 deadline they're hoping that they don't get lost and you know the shuffle or whatever it's it's rough it's it's and is we're seeing these delays more and more in every state that has recreational or medical marijuana you'll probably continue to do so for the foreseeable future there's next stories from the rooster dot-com why so many Colorado cannabis companies adopt highway litter patrols and basically the gist is there's a lot of advertising restrictions in Colorado when it comes to marijuana billboards and such it turns out that they can sponsor those little passes a highway you know that patch a highway that you sponsor and keep clean or whatever about half of those at the exact number of 160 adopt-a-highway signs around the state about 80 are sponsored by cannabis companies in Colorado witches fans has it not only is it you know great PR you're keeping the highway clean a bunch of positives it's also as I said a way around the advertising bands and people see that and they say hey that's the weed the kids have been talking about they see a sign the highway is a is that that marijuana all those kids are raving about let's go check something out by the way I think is there you know I don't see the problem with a billboard for a marijuana company I know there's I know in Colorado I'm sure there's alcohol billboards I may be wrong about that there may be a ban I'm not sure I know how qahal there's big alcohol companies in Colorado the the fact that they wouldn't have billboards I don't know I don't buy that but I may be wrong you know I'm not a Colorado expert let me know in the comments on Vimeo go comment on Vimeo spread the word on Vimeo so good for them this company is getting around the the marrow of the the river Tyson restrictions and doing something good for the environment a win-win situation as they say in the business this last stories from Cincinnati com what many and feared as I said about the Ohio medical marijuana marijuana won't be available in Ohio on September 8 the state has delayed the rollout Ohio patients will not be able to buy marijuana on September 8th the anticipated start day for Ohio's medical cannabis program a lot of people been conjecturing and predicting this for several months now in fact it could take weeks more before medical weed is available for patients even that's likely to be available only in limited quantities Delana and ice delays in licensing 25 marijuana growers in Ohio of push back the program's launch according to the Ohio Department of Commerce before planting can began the growers must have their facilities inspected by the state and granted a certificate of operation we really shouldn't have any plants in the ground by this time said Mark Hamill Ohio Commerce the Department spokesman they're gonna talk about having robust when fraught with hiccups and delays we've chronicled here on the show a lot of delays a lot of problems with Ohio's medical marijuana program and as a result it will not be a September 8th start date was most people knew I mean it's you know there's just no way to do it you have to you have to grow it it's not it's not rocket science it's cannabis growing tents it's gardening it's you know agriculture whatever you want to call it cultivation it's got to be ground you can't design he's not been grown yet and they're not growing it yet they haven't started growing it yet and that presents a problem obviously a lot of people are you know ticked off I don't know state senator Kenny euchre said quote this is a miserable failure so the pages you were hoping to marijuana to use to cope hoping to use marijuana cope with pain seizures I just digestive problems and the like quote has so much hope and trust and that trust was taken away so bad news in Ohio not surprising news out of Ohio I don't you know I'm not gonna beat the issue three horse I've I said my piece about issue three and we see we got instead in Ohio I don't know theoretically some marijuana from could be available in October so best-case scenario a now month delay but probably more if you're waiting for medical marijuana in Ohio expect more delays and more problems there's tons of lawsuits just it's a cluster F as they say in Ohio thanks everybody for checking out cannabis news June 5th 2018 makes you check out marijuana times org makes you check nature day aside calm are

on it's Little Miss cannabis and this is my part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later", "ZZ6ptup5Jlk": "[Music] this paddock full of cannabis lies in the Hunter Valley north of Sydney at first glance it appears an odd place to spend time

never even seen cannabis a financing a medical revolution in Australia there's a little factory that makes your medicine they've invested in this commercial cannabis farm and donated thirty four million dollars to unlock the scientific secrets of the plant and it's not just helping Caitlyn is that this is potentially helping thousands oh absolutely not just for kindnesses for a whole range of various conditions where's it gone and that's what the research is about is to prove that medically said that the doctors will be convinced do you feel like trailblazers no we just do what's right yeah what do you think of your father's generosity well that's big bears it's Barry he doesn't drive fancy cars he just he does the right thing it's philanthropy born from pain Caitlin's pain from the age of six months this beautiful baby started having uncontrollable seizures her father Michael was powerless to stop them you know when it's happening you can hear it from the other side of the room here we go it's pretty hard to take harder for her because all that electricity racing through your brain if she does damage and how long has her longest seizure being doing her house now the longest one started in in the emergency department and the rainbow doctors couldn't stop it Oh Indian and she was still seizing but one of the nurses was crying so that really told me something because when children have long seizures there's a lot of damage Caitlin was eventually diagnosed with a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy called dravet syndrome each seizure causes brain damage and can be fatal under conventional treatment these kids don't have a long life expectancy because they often died during a seizure sometime one in six fearing time was running out for Caitlin they did their own online research and discovered cannabis was a potential treatment for epilepsy let's face it out and I usually just put her on a chip so Michael started importing this cannabis paste from Denmark and the impact was startling radical reduction in the number of seizures when we gave it to her I just said to my wife holy smokes it works you could just say instead of all this noise in her head it was just clear and instead of jerking it dribbling this she just walked out it was nothing wrong with her what game you playing there poppy is the stuff you're giving Katelyn making her high no it clears her might it's making her less drowsy less confused but it's cannabis it's marijuana and marijuana makes you high it doesn't roll cannabis is not psychoactive it doesn't make you high right knee down the street but there was one major problem giving this cannabis medicine to Caitlyn was illegal the Lambert's were forced to become law breakers in their bid to save her we couldn't wait every day we waited there were seizures and she'd have to be in hospital and then you come out and is that any way for a family to live just people live it every day so how disparate were you desperate enough to stick my neck out I taught at 67 which I was then they can't do anything to me what can they do to me they could put me in jail but that doesn't matter change me to truly understand the Lambert's resolve you have to appreciate where they have come from Barry grew up on a dairy farm in Terry on the mid-north coast of New South Wales mother diagnose tendon liver the old man one of how many kids one of the five boys I was saying younger so you had to be fairly tough with them playing a lot of sport and cricket and all that sort of stuff you wouldn't while still at school he made a feisty redhead joy Cole so what did you think when you first met Barry just a stunner I'm sorry I knew exactly what did you think well obviously I thought it was a very sexy man really sexy legs I used to write little notes and put him with his lunch Barry and joy married 50 years ago and children soon followed but then tragedy their second daughter Nadine died when she was two and a half from a rare brain swelling condition called hydrocephalus a long time ago but do those memories come flooding back they do all the time but it was 40 odd years ago so you sort of it's not as fast yesterday hmm they soften but they don't go away is the best way I can describe it dearly kills you but you don't die even if you feel you want to and having already lost a child we we know what's possible you try and save your children with something wrong but when you've got that thought in your head and I didn't want Mike to go through what our zeldo went through he's can be quite an emotional person which is good he'd have a cry and they'll say it's okay darlin it's good to cry I'm gonna have to go on the court but does that sound fun yeah she's a happy beautiful little girl but there are obviously problems there yes there's uh according to the doctor she she's definitely [ __ ] and a whole range of problems but as parents it's hard to accept we could see the damage but we also know that she's got a growing brain she's got a hope she's got a future and if we can stop the seizures we can give her that future a future to grow brain and and she'll never be the smartest kid in the class but if she can walk and talk she'll be doing well something positive had to come out of all this pain and we're very sold his business Network count financial to the Commonwealth Bank he became a very wealthy man but then the Lambert's did something truly remarkable donating 34 million dollars to cannabis research here at Sydney University it's one of the largest donations to medical science in Australia's history you didn't think twice about donating thirty four million dollars to medical cannabis research was only 33.7 by the way 33.7 oh just to be accurate yeah embarrassing really it's the recognition it's got I think really hmm yeah no it's it's you know if you can afford it why not like you can't take it with you people like Barry don't come along every day do they well no it's it's quite transformational in terms of my life I'm scientists in Australia we tend to scratch around from one grant to the next you know we managed to get research done somehow you're expected to win a Nobel Prize with you know a tin can in a matchbox [Music] Professor Ian McGregor runs the Lambert initiative so all the work that I'm seeing taking place here today is thanks to Barry it is yes I mean we and this is just a small amount of the work that's going on in the Lambert initiative this is our chemistry lab with this money some of the best young scientists are now studying the various molecules of cannabis called cannabinoids which could literally save young lives like Caitlin's and many others as well somewhere in there you may have a very important anti-cancer drug you may have something that's marvelous for dementia or schizophrenia or anxiety or Parkinson's disease we firmly believe that there's a great treasure trove of future therapeutics amongst the cannabinoids in this right here right here the well the scientists embarked on this groundbreaking cannabis research Michael Lambert can't wait he's convinced little Caitlyn is living proof of its medicinal value it's an amazing plant it's given us amazing hope that there is a future for Caitlyn and should we still take the other drugs and we're not going to throw away the medicine altogether we're gonna keep taking the other drugs and we're going to keep listening to the doctors and to ensure a steady supply of this medicine Michael started cultivating his own cannabis knowing he was breaking the law he informed doctors police and even sent a crop sample to New South Wales Parliament House but this transparency only landed him in hot water last year he was arrested and charged with cultivation and possession of the drug now I love my Caitlyn and any law that says that I have to watch her die and not look after her is a stupid law needs to be changed so what you're doing for Caitlyn it's worth having a criminal record for oh absolutely I'm not going to no record I'm gonna win come on chickens medical-necessity right you can't make a father watch his daughter die where's the chick inside morally yes got the high ground here but legally you're breaking the law I know he's an ass that sons breaking a little yeah we just give him support yeah how do you feel about that uh well you've always gotta rock the boat a little bit in life I think these charges are still before the courts but the Lambert family is confident of a legal victory and a medical one as well she doesn't know it yet but little Kaitlin may change the way Australia and the rest of the world looks at cannabis what do you think Barry's legacy will be I would like to think that at the end of this process we'll have two maybe three new cannabinoid drugs on the market I'd like to think that one of them will be for pediatric epilepsy we'll call it Caitlyn's drug but I'd really like to have one for pain and I'd really like to have one for dementia as well it's all working for you that planet and everybody else [Music] hello I'm Allison Langdon thanks for watching to keep up with the latest from 60 minutes Australia make sure you subscribe to our Channel you can also download the 9 now app for full episodes and other exclusive 60 minutes content", "b3vBzUMjg60": "good morning everybody or afternoon if it is afternoon for you there's big news out of the senate thank you so much for joining me my name is tom howard and this is another very special episode of once again my name is tom howard thank you so much for joining us on canvas legalization news we have some big news out of the senate there's a whole bunch of senators that are tweeting regarding their uh desires to legalize cannabis in 2021 is isn't gonna happen i'm not sure but that's what we're gonna be talking about today so give us a thumbs up and a like subscribe whatever if you enjoy canvas legalization news tune in tomorrow we'll give an update on west virginia because somebody asked for that so let's go ahead and dive into it we posted it on our linkedin page if you haven't gone over to our linkedin page you should uh you can it's canvas legalization news on linkedin we only have 670 odd people that like it and then you can click over to the the story that we have on marijuana moment big shout out to marijuana moment came out yesterday and so there are all these leading champions in the senate that say that they are going to advance cannabis legalization for example ron wyden tweeted we can't address our country's racial inequality crisis without ending the outdated dangerous war on drugs and its disproportionate impact on black and brown americans and then he starts tweeting at people ooh exciting at senator schumer and at senator booker and i are going to introduce legislation to do just that that's fantastic so uh do you think that there's actually going to be some type of vote anytime soon on the moore act well probably not because the more active 2019 is no more the more act of 2021 has perhaps already been introduced into the senate or into the house and then they are going to vote on it i perceive this to be a political issue in the sense that the last time it was voted on in the house of representatives not only did it pass but it passed essentially against party lines approximately 95 percent of the democrats voted in favor and approximately 95 of the republicans voted uh opposed if you want more than that uh go dig into our videos and you'll be able to see when miggy and i were live watching and counting the votes uh of the moore act when it was voted on in the house of congress so now that the senate is going to get involved do you really think that it's going to move quickly no i don't but senator schumer then goes ahead and tweets out the war on drugs has been a war on people in particular people of color ending the federal marijuana prohibition is necessary to right the wrongs of this failed war i want you to know the ironic thing is that he is the senator from new york which has no legal weed uh and then senator booker new jersey finally got legal weed kind of not still they voted on it but i don't think they've passed the bill yet they're getting closer i really thought that i would spit out my gum before i was able to get live on here just a small just a small moment you know i have not gotten a chance to smoke weed at all today i have just been slammed with these uh 10-day notices they're really starting to shape up nicely we have the transporter ones basically if you got your social equity points you did get your transporter application license uh there might have been some errors in your illinois residency points and or uh the not the types of proof that you put to the state i was not thrilled that the state used to say tax records which presumably could have meant real estate tax records that indicated that you know you own the real estate in the particular area and that perhaps you also live there as it's listed as your address but no they said only income tax records and only pages one and two of illinois form 1040. and so i've just been going gangbusters uh what do we think is actually going to happen here is senator booker he fight he tweets out the failed war on drugs has been a war on people particularly the people of color sounds a lot like senator schumer's tweet and that he's looking forward to joining ron wyden and senator schumer to announce reforms that will ensure restorative justice and protect public health that is fantastic now what's the likelihood that it's actually going to happen right now not very good you want to know why because there's budgets and there's coronavirus relief that's getting negotiated right now in the senate oh i think they were also going to impeach that one guy that used to be president when they already impeached him but i think he has to go to trial really really quickly just a second i know i'm not supposed to do this on camera so i'm gonna give myself a small bumper uh why don't we check the stocks i guess they're still doing fine okay well suddenly i feel a lot more refreshed but uh the senate will actually be moving on this in some way shape or form the senate will probably move on it after the house in my opinion simply because that the senate goes a lot slower and then i think they're going to try to politicize this i think they're going to try to politicize this because it was effective in georgia and they're going to be using it for the 2020 election for example going into the 2020 election what if the house does what the house did before and that passes the more act or the whatever version of the moore act will be introduced by uh senator booker senator wyden and senator schumer well after that happens uh if it's passed in the house and go over to the senate now if if just one democrat doesn't vote it for it or if yeah imagine if one democrat votes against it and one republican votes for it still passes right we have um president vice president kamala harris that could cast the deciding vote probably not i don't think it's going to be that close mostly because it's not a plurality even or a majority of the states that have legal cannabis legal adult use cannabis it's fantastic your state should try it sometime but uh it's only like 15 states right now and so that's just not a majority of the population however if they use it and they try and it's stymied let's say by republicans and the republicans vote 97 against the moore act leading into an election year of 2022 i think the democrats are going to try to politicize it so that they don't lose additional seats and perhaps make up some ground that way um i just think that the 50 50 senate especially with the political capital that joe biden and his administration wants to use right now principally on the coronavirus reform means that uh criminal justice reform while coming and and that's exactly what the the cannabis legalization bill is going to be it's it's a criminal justice reform bill more than it's about legalizing weed uh and so will that happen sure uh when yeah but i'll tell you one thing when it does happen you know what it's going to be somewhere [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's right it's going to be 420 somewhere and then earl blumenhauer even got into it and he said very exciting that our champions in the senate senator schumer senator booker and ron wyden are prepared to move forward together on comprehensive cannabis legislation the more act a product of years have worked with advocates cannabis industry leaders and states is a great foundation and so the more acts is a great reform to reform the 117th congress it looks like maybe senator wyden i'm sorry senator wyden uh earl blumenhauer republican representative blumenhower has maybe already introduced the more act to the 117th congress it's already been january so that makes a pretty darn good a sense and now let's read the full joint statement as opposed to just the tweets if you're here for the tweets give us a thumbs up washington united states senator cory booker ron wyden a democrat of oregon and chuck schumer democrat of new york issued the following joint statement regarding comprehensive cannabis reform legislations in the 117th congress the war on drugs has been a war on people particularly people of color ending the federal marijuana prohibition is necessary to right the wrongs of this failed war and end the decades of harms inflicted by the communities of color across the country but that alone is not enough as states continue to legalize marijuana we must also enact measures that will lift people up who are unfairly targeted by the war on drugs we are committed to working together to put forward and advance comprehensive cannabis reform isn't it interesting that now they refer to it as cannabis but in the previous paragraph they were referred to it as marijuana cannabis reformed legislation that will not only turn the page on the sad chapter in american history but also undo the devastating consequences of these discriminatory policies the senate will make consideration of these reforms a priority in the early part of this year we will release a unified discussion draft on comprehensive reform to ensure restorative justice protect public health and implement responsible taxes and regulations getting input from stakeholder groups will be an important part of developing this critical legislation so there you go that's the full statement that the senate puts out and it appears that yes they are starting to tee this up as making it a very political issue and it's not just about the cannabis unfortunately it's not it's not really unfortunately it's the right thing to do to right these wrongs and to create a larger coalition but i just want to make sure that the patients have access to home growth so here it is what are they going to release in the early part of this year they're going to release a unified discussion draft that's why i don't think there's going to be an eminent vote on the more act because the the senate's not ready for a vote on the moore act they're ready for a unified discussion draft on what comprehensive reform to restore restorative justice promote public health and implement responsible taxes and regulations getting input from stakeholders groups will be an important part of developing this critical legislation did you notice they did not mention the word cannabis or marijuana at all in that now i thought it was also interesting that the official sten statement said both of those things but if you haven't read the more act and you should uh you know subscribe to the channel we'll probably read it one day on the on the news probably already have but one of the aspects of the moore act is it changes the federal term from marijuana essentially kills the term marijuana at the federal level because it's just it's just one line in the controlled substances acts you know in in schedule one so it would delete that and then it would create this new thing called cannabis and so maybe that's what they were doing in that because in one paragraph they refer to it as marijuana but then in the next paragraph they refer to it as cannabis and the more act calls it cannabis but it appears that that might still take months let me think let me just think a little bit about how many months that might take [Applause] [Music] yeah man that's it's a lot of months well okay so they aren't ready for a vote but they are ready for a unified discussion draft and then they want to get input from stakeholder groups and so essentially it appears that the senate after the house has already passed the moore act in the last house they have to pass it again in this one uh the senate now is trying to like gauge the room so they're going to do some talking points to get some input from the stakeholders so tune in in the future episodes in the spring when we go over this particular policy statement the unified discussion draft of it and then there'll probably be some calls to action on the channel about where you can go as a stakeholder to voice your support or opposition to this developing critical legislation and if you think that cannabis legalization is critical pardon me is critical legislation give us a thumbs up click subscribe and then also click the bell some people do oh and by the way we got 15 000 subscribers awesome so why don't you join us tomorrow for the news i have taken i've taken my break that was about 12 hours two minutes and um yeah wouldn't you when you just hate to have a lawyer that writes down minutes as hours sounds like something rudy giuliani would do 20 grand a day he was charging donald trump who didn't pay him hilarious uh the last administration was funny but now we have to do other real things like legalize weed and we're going to be talking all about that tomorrow who is our guest join us tomorrow to find out our guest", "ZjUyD_uiwuo": "- In the United States in areas were marijuana has been legalized, there tends to be a bump in the amount of toxic cases in dogs. In Colorado where marijuana\nwas legalized in 2012, there was a four-fold increase\nin the amount of toxic cases that were reported between\nthe years of 2010 and 2015. On October 17th of this year in Canada recreational marijuana will be legalized, so I reached out to our\nfavorite YouTube veterinarian, Doctor Alex Avery from the Our\nPets Health YouTube channel. And he's gonna talk to us today\nabout marijuana poisoning. I'm Ken Steep and welcome\nback to McCann Dogs. (dog barking) - Thanks Ken and hi everyone, I'm excited to have been invited back to talk to you today about\nmarijuana effects on dogs. So for those of you who don't know me, I'm a veterinarian and I've\ngot my own YouTube channel, Our Pets Health and also the\nwebsite ourpetshealth.com where my aim is to help you and your pet to live a healthier, happier life. So let's jump in to\nmarijuana poisoning in dogs. It's actually something that's\nnot that rare in general and you won't be surprised to\nhear that marijuana poisoning, it becomes even more\ncommon in an area when marijuana goes from\nbeing illegal to legal. So CBD oil is all the rage at the moment and you might know that\nthat comes from marijuana, but is actually felt to be safe. So just how dangerous is marijuana? How poisonous is it? Do you need to be worried? Well marijuana contains a\nlot of different substances, with the most dangerous one\nbeing something called THC. And it's actually this THC which is toxic and has this psychotropic\neffects acting on the brain that we associate with marijuana. Thankfully even though it\ndoes have toxic effects, it actually does take quite a lot to cause a serious poisoning in dogs. And the risk of poisoning\ndue to smoke inhalation is really tiny and really\nall reports of poisoning are due to pets eating marijuana with 96% of cases being\ndogs and only 3% being cats. So it still does affect cats the same way but they just don't eat\nit as often as dogs do. The minimum lethal dose, which is the amount that can kill a dog is three grams of THC per\nkilogram of body weight. The average marijuana cigarettes\ncontains 150 milligrams and that means that a\nfive kilo or 10 pound dog would need to eat 100 cigarettes for a fatal poisoning to occur. So the situation is pretty\nunlikely to cause problems. Don't think though that marijuana can never cause problems though. If a dog gets into a large supply or it consumes something more like concentrated medical grade THC butter that might be used in baked products then there's definitely a\nrisk of serious poisoning and deaths have been\nreported and they do occur. As with a lot of poisons and toxins out there that our dogs come across, there is a variation as well\nin how each individual responds so a small amount of marijuana may affect one pet a lot more than another. So you really can't be too careful. The marijuana effects on\ndogs and signs of poisoning are numerous and come about\nthrough the drug's effects within the brain as well\nthe body as a whole. After eating marijuana\nthe signs of poisoning also can stop pretty quickly. So they develop within about 60 minutes. Mild cases of poisoning\nwill be seen as lethargy, a change in the way a dog responds to visual and noise stimulation, behavioral changes and their\ngums might become quite red. If a more toxic dose is eaten, then excess salivation might develop, the pupils will dilate and become large, vomiting may start along with diarrhea and your dog might also start\nto urinate uncontrollably. And muscle tremors will also develop. And in fact about 99% of\nmarijuana poisoning cases there are nervous or neurological signs. Whereas only about 30%\nwill develop intestinal, so vomiting or diarrhea. A higher dose again might\nthen result in your dog becoming unsteady on their feet, their blood pressure might drop, they might develop hypothermia. The heart can slow. And as with a lot of poisons, it will all eventually lead\nto seizures, coma, and death. The effects of marijuana\non dogs can last for hours and they can even last for days. And that's because the THC\nis actually partly stored in the body's fat and\nit's then released slowly over a number of days. So that being said, what's the treatment\nto marijuana poisoning? So while the likelihood of severe life-threatening poisoning is pretty low, as I've just discussed. You'll appreciate from some of the signs that in some cases\ntreatment will be needed to prevent any poisoning complications. Dogs that are severely\nagitated or hyperactive may need to be sedated. IV fluids may need to be given to help just control body temperature, to support blood pressure, and to prevent dehydration that results from vomiting and diarrhea\nand excessive salivation. Muscle relaxant or\nanti-seizure medication may be needed in the case of\nsevere tremors or seizures. And in rare life-threatening cases when large amounts have been eaten the stomach may even need to be emptied, enemas given and activated\ncharcoal administered. Just to try and remove and absorb as much of the toxin as possible. Now the big difficulty with\ntreatment of marijuana poisoning and marijuana poisoning in general, in dogs is knowing that this is actually the problem in the first place. So in many cases owners are\nreluctant to tell their vet that this is what the dog has\neaten or might have eaten. Now there are human urine\ntests for marijuana, but these are actually\nreally unreliable in dogs and so they'll often\ngive incorrect results. It's vital therefore that\nyou let your vet know if your dog has eaten marijuana. Without this information\nit really is impossible to differentiate the\nsigns the dog is showing from many other toxins. Poisoning with different\ntoxins or food items, it comes with different prognosis and different treatment options. And not knowing the cause of poisoning, it can just mean that a\ndog is given unnecessary treatment or it's actually\ntreated more aggressively than they would otherwise need to be in the case of marijuana poisoning. And that wastes both time and money. If your dog has eaten\nmarijuana in any form then just let your vet know. It's really important information and it should not be withheld. As with all poisonings\nprevention is better than cure and my tips for this is just\nto keep marijuana products and that includes edibles\nand baked goods in high pet-proof cupboards\nor in locked drawers. Make sure your pet is not\naround if marijuana is being smoked or consumed and only\nallow them back in the room once everything's been cleared\nup or all smoke has cleared. And finally just never give\nyour pet marijuana on purpose. It's really not funny although it's something some people do do. Now as I mentioned at the start, CBD oil is a different cannabis extract and that does not\nactually contain any THC. So CBD oil is considered non-toxic and it has several potentially valuable medical effects on the body. If you want to learn more about this then I've actually got a separate\nvideo over on my channel. For now though thanks again to Ken for inviting me back to talk to you all today. I hope that was interesting\nand until next time, take care. - A huge thank you to Doctor Alex from the Our Pets Health YouTube channel for joining us today and I hope this is the kind of information\nthat you never need, but I'm really glad that you have it.

(gentle music)", "qOoTMkZKlCI": "we'll get started my name is Johanna Harper and I'm a clinical pharmacist who specializes in pain management so I see patients pretty much all day long so what we're gonna talk about today is CBD medical cannabis and we'll just lightly put it as herb to make our lives a little bit easier right now to cover everybody in the room and their questions I I wanted to name this being blunt I was overruled and then my next option was up in smoke and that did not go over so well either so the cannabis conundrum it there you go so we're gonna go through today recognizing the difference between HAMP and marijuana looking at the differences between indica and sativa knowing the difference between CBD and THC looking at the endocannabinoid system and exactly where these things are working looking at different products dosing and especially side effects what we know and what we don't know looking at safety concerns and things that you need to look into before trying some of these medications we're gonna talk about kratom I don't know if anybody's heard of kratom but that was a hot trend last year and that's one I want to at least have the safety concerns out there discuss the legal and social concerns associated with cannabis and then talking about applying wellness and lifestyle techniques as far as looking at all conditions so scleroderma being one of them pain being another but looking at it from a lifestyle approach and not just a one drug as my answer because there is no easy button in life as much as I try to find that okay a little bit about me so I've been part of the foundation for the last 20 years through schools so on and so forth I'm a chronic pain pharmacist working with physicians and so I'd be seeing patients just like a physician does I just concentrate on the medications and the wellness approach versus Diagnostics and I've been a patient advocate for many years I my entire goal is to empower patients to become active members of their healthcare team and as you can see my daughter comes with me every year right now thank goodness paw Patrol run over so you do not hear her in the background and most importantly I am asked Larry Erma patient I've been diagnosed more than 25 years so I went through pharmacy school looking at all of this from the perspective of a patient first and what does that go in what how is that going to mean to us as patients individually so I'm in there with it y'all so when I talk about we it really is we and I'm also a chronic pain patient okay I have nothing to disclose except I cannot keep my mouth shut so I'm a little blunt I try to tell you exactly how it is I don't have any involvement in industry at this point everything I'm providing here is for educational purposes only please by no means take this as medical advice okay I always talk to your physicians and your providers your pharmacists at home and have an actual conversation about all of your medications I am available my information will be at the end to answer some basic questions and I will stay here for a little bit afterwards but I am NOT licensed to provide personal medical information or medical advice in every state I only have four States available so I apologize for that but I am available for any other basic questions the history so you know the history of cannabis has been around for a long time the first documented use was actually in 2737 BC for rheumatism being one of them on cave drawings actually I did not get a picture of the cave drawings if I do this one next year I will guaranteed get a picture of these cave drawings because I want to know what that is but even going so far as the Irish physician early in 1839 notice that were there some medical benefits associated with this in 1887 we saw some benefit with neuropathic pain and then in 1925 the United States decided to ban it for a lot of political reasons and even though I can't keep my mouth shut I am still going to try to maintain the property or the proper use here with the video um that being said I'll see what I can do so we did find the the cannabidiol cannabinol structure in 1940 we found the THC structure in 1964 and we discovered the euphoric effects in 1967 leading into the 70s and fun times right in 1978 or in 1978 we had looked at the controlled substance therapeutic research Act that allowed us to study THC and cannabis as a medicinal purpose so their concern with that is is yes we could study it but the strains that we were allowed to study Hornbeck from the 60s and so it wasn't until 2016 that researchers were allowed to use the more current strains that we have so the data that we have that says it's not efficacious it we're using strains that are the potency about 10% potency of what we use now so that's part of the problem in in this you know situation that we're in right now with the medical cannabis but in 1996 California was the first medical marijuana state and then in 2003 the World Health Organization recommended that THC be scheduled as a schedule 4 which is you know pretty low on the totem pole there oxycodone is a schedule 2 and that basically tells you how addictive it is as a property and what the concerns are for you know the society as a whole so as far as legality so federally it is still a control one meaning there is no medicinal purpose so that's right up there with cocaine and with the each state individually though they can determine what they want to do as far as making it legal and what levels of legal do they want to go so looking at we do have four state territories in thirty-four states that are legal for medical cannabis and for each state they could determine what that meant so for instance Minnesota where I'm currently residing there are two places that you can get it and they have very few products so they've regulated it to the point where you know that is that's the regulation that they wanted to have with it but there's also drawbacks such as cost and availability and then there were some states who decided to do a low THC so they wouldn't allow the the red products or the really high THC products and those are listed here so you can look for your state in the list and then the recreational marijuana states are starred so Nevada being one of those minnesota is definitely not one of those so when we look at the actual plant and getting to understand really what do all these terms mean so cannabis is is just the genus or the genus of the plant species so it's that one subset of plants so it kind of covers all of them and then when you go one step below that two specie species that's when you get into Hampton marijuana so there are over 70 species of cannabis at this point that we know of and the differences really are so the hemp products tend to have they're they were originally designed for industrial purposes so fibers clothing things like that and there is a CBD over the counter with hemp in it and we'll talk about that as well but that is generally a cannabis sativa so I will go through a little bit more of what sativa but it has to contain less than 1% THC to really be part of that category and then mayor itself again medet medical and recreational uses associated with this one it is the one that's more psychoactive and that's cannabis indica and that can have anywhere from one to thirty percent THC so a really big difference in the two products and if you look at the picture they look very very similar so when it comes to legalities and staying within the laws of your state they look awfully similar so I would know they know the concerns associated with that and that there can be confusion very easily so sativa is read on the left hand side generally tall and slimmer plants that's where you get that head high and then alertness and euphoria and then increased energy so that's usually daytime use preferably and then indica as the many of the shops I have visited in the couch is what they call that shorter plants but really it's a relaxation it's an appetite stimulant pain relief and really is it it really is that body high and and yes without the video running I can tell you no I have no experience with this stuff best for nighttime use for this one so the endocannabinoid system you know interestingly enough you know this has been around for a long time we didn't start thinking about this until the 90s which makes me a little nervous but cb1 so what we do know about the endocannabinoid system is there are a lot of functions that we just don't understand yet with a cannabinoid system there are cb1 receptors in the central nervous system the lining of blood vessels which is what we're looking at first Lera derma as one of those within the stomach and the skeletal system within the bones and the tendons and so we're looking at fibromyalgia with cb1 we're looking at multiple sclerosis and potentially bone growth so there's a lot of interest right now in whether this product would be viable for osteoporosis now I can't tell you with medical data it is or it isn't but we'll talk about the safeties and then we can weigh risks versus benefits at that point and then there's the cb2 receptors and that's really the immune system so the endocannabinoid system has a lot more to do in our body than what we even know about yet we're just at the tip of the iceberg right now and that is part of the central and peripheral nervous system we're talking about Crohn's and rheumatoid arthritis for that one and then we do talk about with CD 2 receptors the tachycardia and orthostatic hypotension that can occur so when you see in these slides cb2 activity those are the things that we're gonna watch out for is a rapid heartbeat and then you know feeling faint when you stand up so cannabinoids as a class so that's the actual molecule there's 568 unique molecules in cannabis so when we talk about we don't know a whole lot about this yet we're barely scratching the surface with how many molecules we know let alone what each one of those do so in the cannabinoids themselves there's 60 that work in the endocannabinoid system CBD being one of them so CBD has usually no euphoric effect associated with it and it's used for pain and inflammation I usually use this for patients who have more of an inflammatory response that I want to calm down that inflammation in various parts of their body and we will go into further details about the products as well and then the tetrahydrocannabinol cannabidiol is the THC and that is the most psychoactive and I will tell you for personal experience as well as a number of my patients it's best to start at the lowest possible THC product because it really is psychoactive some people tolerate a whole lot better than others but in the grand scheme of things I always want you to start slow or start low and go slow so but we do use THC for decreased nausea and to increase appetite so generally speaking the rule of thumb right now is that the CBD with the THC is actually better because it has a synergistic effect so some of those products that are in between that have a little bit activity of both tends to be more beneficial than one product or another but we'll talk about specific products so if you look at the structure of CBD versus THC here if you look on this left hand side here the only difference is that ring is broken so that's a my new difference in my world in the body it's actually a big difference and so like I talked about CBD alone reduces inflammation it has antioxidant properties it does has shown to decrease seizure activity so we'll talk about one of the medications that just came out recently antidepressant and an anti-psychotic it can decrease IBS symptoms there is some talk and some research being done right now about reducing tumor effects and 30 different med tab lights that we've found so when this when CBD breaks down it breaks down to 30 different chemicals I don't even know what those do so you know a lot of safety concerns that we'll talk about and then on the other side THC that is really more used for nerve pain so that tingling numbness especially with like diabetes or peripheral neuropathy juice for decreasing muscle spasms and relaxation used as a sleep aid and as well as glaucoma you know that I think puss-in-boots even had it in his you know it's for my glaucoma anyways but THC has cb1 and cb2 activity which will become important as they do more research on these and if I thought 30 min tablets was a problem THC is over a hundred and now the problem with that is summer actives some aren't so when you first take the medication you know you you get the first pass effect and then if there's an active metabolite you'll keep getting effects which that may be good or bad depending on if you like them okay so in Minnesota at least they are color coded and I'm hoping other states at least get into some type of consistently consistency with all of these but so black is the highest THC in Minnesota and then violet is more CBD but you know every time somebody one of my patients goes to the medical cannabis pharmacist they're given a yellow and a green and then a red so I'm not quite sure what education they're getting but we will just say I do a lot of talking about this with each individual patient because the higher THC products do tend to have more side effects and so some of my you know older patients that it is challenging and they don't like those effects so it is something we have to watch out for so some of the available products out so Marinol has been around for a very long time order Navin all sometimes your provider can get Marinol covered on your insurance for an appetite stimulant as a workaround to getting this covered on a traditional plan but it's usually for weight loss or nausea and vomiting and oftentimes it's used in HIV and other waisting type diseases it does work on cb1 and cb2 and we do know the metabolism of this one so we know what drug interactions are gonna happen a little bit more so and then sessom it I'll tell you I don't have any personal experience with that one but it is another available product but interestingly the only information I could find was metabolites are known right up there with CBD for me the newest one out is a pity ol X and that is actually a CBD product for it's a cannabidiol for to childhood seizure syndromes and that's what those are so we're getting there as far as the FDA and the approval but the problem is is they're picking more obscure conditions right now especially those that are targeting children but that one is mainly CBT cb2 associated with that one so here's some of the new promising medications that are coming out I know Corbis out there I think somebody from Corvis raise your hand right there any product questions or any other things I would go to her directly because I'm not privy to such information but they do have one out coming out I think it's phase three trials right now looking at the medicinal benefits for systemic sclerosis in particular as one of theirs so I think that that's very helpful that we do have the information out there for scleroderma and that we do have Corvis on our side on that one to be able to get the data and be able to really find and study the benefits of these and make it allow it to be more mainstream there are a bunch of other products in various stages as well my goal to show you this is just to let you know that there are options coming and as we know everything needs to go through checks and balances and really we're looking at safety and we're looking at efficacy and we want to make sure that this is the right thing for you before it goes to market okay so routes of administration important things here Aurel so there's a variety of different oral products there's oils that are actually the most potent but also the most expensive and and those are generally pure products and then you have tinctures tinctures are they usually have some type of alcohol in them and it does dilute them and oftentimes that dose is easier to give yourself and [Music] less 2-over less possibility of taking too much and we do have the edibles so I know California and Denver are great with their edibles and so that's mixing the cannabis whether it's CBD and or THC or a combination of the two into like little gummy bears or candies things like that there is oral sprays available as well as Lauzon jizz so just for instance it is very and I'll go through a little bit more of this too but it's very important in your state to know what your laws are I have a very good friend of mine his son has really bad anxiety and let's just say we are not a recreational state but his 18 year old is looking at a felony charge right now for carrying around on oil so definitely important for you to know you know what's going on and then the topicals so there's creams and suppositories so suppositories are still topical in the sense of the read the hale canal with any type of topical my biggest concern is where is the pain what is causing the pain it can this topical go deep enough these are very small molecules so the absorption I'm not worried about I know the absorption is there for most of these products the systemic side effects so what goes through your entire body is much less than any oral product which I appreciate I would rather you treat the spot more directly if that's what you're going for for pain relief or you just have one fussy joint I would rather you take care of that one joint rather than the whole body but with the creams if it's a deeper joint or a deeper pain it's going to be harder to get to that area with a topical product and that's just being real and inhaled so that's the smoking or the vape it is very very fast-acting so we're we're talking you know two to four minutes to start feeling effects and you know it really starts working well well it's five to ten minutes to start working and then two to four hours my patients tell me it's more like two hours depending on the product versus oral which is you know 60 to 180 minutes so you could wait one to three hours to start feeling the effect of the oral products so the disadvantages with the smoking as I hope we've learned here at these conferences is putting anything into your lungs that it's going to have a vehicle to get it into your lungs and it's that vehicle that I'm concerned about it's also our lungs are not that the tissue within our lungs is very very sensitive and so my concern would be what is the damage that we're doing later and what's going to happen from that as far as you just need to know the long-term effects as well as the short-term effects and then obviously the top goals depend on a variety of different things including skin thickness so it may take longer with our skin okay so dosing most importantly start low go slow and stay low better bigger is not better on this one okay I do recommend low THC products initially so the products that are more CBD dominant I prefer those a you get the anti-inflammatory properties number one but also less psychoactive effects so less side effects less fogginess less dizziness associated with it when you have the non-medicinal go to the Med the dispensaries that's what I'm talking about herbal here usually it's one to three grams per day is the usual dosing very rarely do we see more than five grams per day I don't know about somebody else but I do know there was a number of scleroderma patients in the past and that good friend of mine has was not able to be here this time I am sure he's in one of those higher groups but it's not generally recommended as far as we don't know the long-term effects with heavy use and we don't know exactly what it does but start with one inhalation every 15 to 30 minutes if you're more sensitive to medications I would wait more like 30 minutes to an hour to really see the effects so it really isn't the personal experience doing five before you get on a plane okay it was a very interesting plane ride but that was halfway through it so at least I made it to the airport CBD there are no established guidelines so we have very little information on the products that are available over-the-counter so the the farm bill passed last year that allowed CBD from hemp to be over-the-counter and so the problem with some of these over-the-counter products with CBD is we don't know the purity and we don't know the concentrations so from batch to batch is it the same product one - is it the same concentration and three what really is in that and so when I recommend products I recommend products that you they verify testing from a third party so each batch that they make has to be verified and they have it available they should have it available on their website you check the number on the bottle and that number on the bottle is what tells you your exact batch and you can look at exactly what was in there okay that's what I recommend when it comes to the CBD hemp products and I'll tell you for instance my state Minnesota does not recommend pharmacists be involved at all of course obviously I don't follow rules well so I will gladly give everybody the information but really generally speaking these are sold by people who have no medical information and if anybody's been to the medical dispensary I some of them I felt the same way and I can't say I've been to all of them but I will say that I've been to a few of them across the country and sometimes I feel like I'm on my own and I'm sure some of y'all feel that way too when it comes to the products that are out there so we'll talk about that a little bit more as well it may take months to find the right combination of product so the right amount of cvd versus the right amount of THC the right amount of dosing exactly how much do you need how often do you need it and you know what does that mean for you and then with medical cannabis the goal really is once we get a little more coordinated with our efforts is really having a pharmacist talk to you about it and having that ability to speak to a pharmacist about these medications and then also educate the medical field a little bit more about the pros and cons with these medications and really just because you know the time associated with FDA approval which we all know can be a very lengthy process you know what else is available in the meantime and what does that mean for you so education really is the key but being forceful about our recommendations to our providers can be difficult so titration here's just a few examples depending on your state this goes along that same you know start low go slow type idea really I would go with the smallest dose available that's measurable and then work your way up from there every couple of days so I would give yourself two days on each dose and then go on to another dose later down the road you know a couple of days later and then once you find the dose that works you may have to alter that depending on the situation depending on what other medications you're on if you're on an antibiotic so on and so forth so there's a lot of things to consider here and it also depends on food and bioavailability so so side effects CBD side effects as you can tell THC is a lot more side effects than the CBD CBD I you know there is there can be nausea associated with it and change in mood which I have seen actually in some of my patients and same with irritability which I find interesting especially with people over the age of 65 and then anxiety you'll see anxiety on both sides and same with nausea so although it's used to treat anxiety it can also trigger anxiety too so things to watch out for so that may not mean that you don't if your anxiety increases after you use it don't use more it can be a side effect and then THC so the big things that I'm concerned about I really have seen hyperemesis and yes it's used for vomiting but I've had some people who even with just one dose cannot stop vomiting for days and so and again I don't know exactly what product they have I don't know exactly how much THC they had all I know is they took the cannabis and they were vomiting for days so precautionary their dry mouth for those with Sjogren's dry mouth is real my friends with THC I think I will tell you that is probably the worst thing for me and that that's one of the reasons that I choose not to use the THC products personally there are a lot of conversation about confusion and decrease in IQ with the higher THC components because really the people back in the 70s who you know continued to use and that's perfectly fine a lot of times the products they're choosing are the low potency THC just because that's what they're used to and that's what they're growing but what's gonna happen when we have the higher THC products and we're using them regularly I don't I don't know the IQ effects I don't know the memory effects and I don't know if that's leaning us down a you know path of more Alzheimer's more dementia we don't know yet and so those are my concerns for for my patients my loved ones personally and then hallucinations those really are real and I have seen them I have not personally but my I have seen my patients have them euphoria is another one that actually can be a benefit depending on where you're trying to go for that moment but you know one thing that I'm really concerned about with THC is vasodilation so yes it does vasodilate your core the problem is is if it has to vasodilate your core it takes your blood from somewhere else and my friends that is your periphery those are your fingers and so we've had cases of Ray not spacious who have severe Raynaud's attack for a couple of days that didn't end because of the basal constriction associated with THC so again higher potency products avoid those until you you know know what they do for you there's a question about decreased sexual abilities and really what that's going to mean whether that's desire or actual function I have seen a decrease in both in some of my patients so it is going to be something that we need to research more and same with Acree acute pancreatitis so if that's something you're prone to you might want to stay away from THC altogether and then you know would THC in particular withdrawal symptoms are real and I don't know exactly to the extent that withdrawal symptoms can harm I know with alcohol it can kill with opioids it sucks but it's not going to kill you I don't know where THC stands so just cautionary so every state can determine what conditions that they want to approve it for this is Illinois and man they like the her medical cannabis it appears Minnesota has I think ten oftentimes physicians can find a way usually anxiety weight loss wasting any type of most of the things that we have or chronic pain oftentimes those are covered under medical cannabis so that is something to have that discussion with your your physician about so contraindicated so ones that I would not use it for pregnancy obviously I would I would hate to harm a child I know in the 70s has happened a lot but with a higher potencies I am concerned about that and same with breastfeeding we don't they are small molecules like I said so the amount of and breast milk can be pretty high if you already have schizophrenia or psychosis probably not beneficial to keep that up or to contribute to that at all if you have active addiction so if you're chronically using meth or cocaine this is probably not a good idea and for most states that is a contraindication to getting approved for medical cannabis metabolic syndrome so this is interesting I saw Studies on this and I've seen the papers as far as the concerns so if you have high triglycerides or diabetes or obesity there's a cautionary concern there it's not contraindicated I wouldn't say this paper called it contraindicated what I would say is monitor that very closely so if you have hypertension I would monitor your blood pressure after using some see what it does to you and use the same product each time and then for us in the room and Wisc Lera Durham a big caution with immune compromising drugs and so that's a lot of us so we don't know we do know that it does work on the immune system and it may compromise it so that's something that we don't have enough data yet to prove otherwise but it is something to watch out for it if you're worsening while using THC or CBD that's something that you're going to want to consider stopping that for a while to determine if it was that product and then serious heart or liver disease I will tell you liver disease that all those metabolites are broken down by the liver and so we kind of need that to break these down and if not you may just be high for the rest of your life after one puff for some that might be beneficial just kidding okay so question is cannabis addictive so there was a study done as far as where cannabis lies in the addiction category so on the bottom it's physical harm so and then on the top its dependence so are how dependent on this medication are you going to become so obviously heroin and cocaine highest a man of harm highest amount of dependence okay and you start coming further back down and interesting buprenorphine is in the middle which is what we use for addiction but we're moving on and then cannabis still has a good amount of dependence associated with it so whether that's addiction per se or dependence that could be a physiological dependence - so your body gets used to these chemicals so my concern as an individual and as a provider is is this dependence going to lead something lead down the same path as we had with the opioids meaning you know our bodies become dependent on them our bodies adapt they change based on the environment it's given and I know what happens with the body with opioids now because I have three million people to study I don't have that many people on high amounts of THC so ten years down the line is that going to be the same concern that the body has now adapted because we don't understand the endocannabinoid system well enough so is the body going to adapt and make new receptors and then give us bigger issues I don't know okay as far as dependence they talked about nineteen percent of the people became dependent on marijuana okay when you look at it you know tobacco is 32 percent so yes it's less than tobacco significantly less than tobacco and I would take marijuana over tobacco if I made a recommendation but again the smoking aspect I think is the one that I avoid but the most important thing here to consider for those less than 18 when the brain is not fully formed yet that risk increases by 17% so now we are getting closer to heroin when it comes to medical cannabis and so or THC and so that's where my concern lies is again we don't know enough to really know exactly what's gonna happen okay so the other concern is marijuana use disorder so anytime that we have any product we want to watch for any safety concerns any things that you know are gonna crop up to see if there's going to be a bigger problem so if you're using larger amounts over longer periods of time than you intended that's a warning sign that's something that we need to consider if if you are unsuccessful and you want to cut down or control your usage and you can't if you spend your entire day trying to figure out how to get it how to use it and how to feel better after using it okay we might be going down the wrong path if all you can think about is the cannabis if your Social Work recreational activities are decreasing because of it if it puts you in a dangerous situation or you continue use this despite medical or psychiatric harm okay classic signs of addiction there so things to watch out for with this type of product so drug interactions mmm this is one of the most important pieces for me as a pharmacist we don't have enough data and that's my concern I can tell you what I know right now and I can teach you about that but as far as what else we learn further down the road I'm hoping next year I will have a rule or more robust set of data to provide to you there are the CNS depressant effects so if you combine it with benzodiazepines like xanax or valium alcohol and opioids there can be significant sedation associated with that there's there can be mania if you take it with an SSRI and it's an antidepressant so--that's prozac lexapro any of those and potentially even duloxetine which i know a lot of people use for pain management there can be a fast heart rate or delirium if you take nortriptyline or amitriptyline so those are all considerations and then we talked about the you know immunosuppressant properties especially with corticosteroids so if you're on prednisone are we going to suppress your immune system even further in a negative way and if you're taking antipsychotics it may counteract the effect of those and it does have competitive metabolism so that means if you're having if you're on other medications that use these same enzymes which we'll talk about there's gonna there could potentially be drug interactions and so they're going to compete for the same enzymes and unfortunately sip three a four I believe covers eighty percent of the drugs that we have out there right now and that's a big list of drugs that can interact so the interactions I talked about today are only the most severe and the most inhibiting or inducing but there are a list of hundreds and hundreds of other drugs that are also going to compete for that same enzyme to break down so if you have two drugs that use that same enzyme to break down say maybe cell sept that needs to be broken down for your body to get rid of it and you have the THC that needs to be broken down as well the more THC you use the less enzyme this drug has to break down so potentially you could have a higher amount of cell set for instance so there's a lot of different things we don't have data on really what those numbers look like or even whether cell sept is a big issue or not because we don't have the exact percentages but it is a consideration so medications that can increase the CBD and THC so the ones that I want you to be concerned about here cimetidine or tagamet cyclosporine these can all if you're taking cyclosporine diltiazem urethral myosin fluconazole flu the flu oxy teen grapefruit is another one so it's the same interaction as grapefruit interestingly enough ketoconazole itraconazole those are the ones that I've seen most often or verapamil with scleroderma that could increase the amount of THC and CBD so even if you use a small THC product a product that has limited THC in it that could mean that this drug these drugs have made it toward that's a big amount of THC so again something to watch out for ones that can increase THC again the amount of THC you're gonna get is higher if you're on say metronidazole for an infection the other ones that I've seen clopidogrel as another concern and depakote and sulfamethoxazole so septum septum D s is another one so antibiotics things that we need to watch out for so if suddenly you're on this antibiotic you're you're doing fine on your THC and then you start your antibiotic and somehow that high now it just became ten times worse or now it's into mania it really probably is that that antibiotic that caused that but that does not mean not used your antibiotic for the record okay so meds that increase CBD so CBD is the one that's available over-the-counter from hemp platic s'n otherone tagamet another one nexium the as omeprazole that's a concern fluconazole for any type of yeast infection fluoxetine for mood modafinil or provigil I know some people take that here omeprazole is another one that that I would be concerned about so just know that the amount of CBD you're getting could be a lot more so the ones who don't get any effect from THC they could be on some of these drugs so basically these drugs are now making it to where your body is eating up the THC to where you don't really feel the effects and that's phenytoin st. John's wort or tegretol or boson tan so tre clear for PAH and imagines that decrease CBD so those patients her like CBD doesn't do anything for me would be concentration and all fairness but it could be some of these medications too so again st. John's wort and then phenytoin for any type of seizures or other conditions and then any type of barbituates so phenobarbital I've seen used sometimes okay so medications that decrease THC and CBD so there's different enzymes that break each one down and different enzymes have different drugs associated with them so the ones I'm worried about here is again the tre clear the provigil and phenytoin is another one and st. John's wort so I'm gonna keep going back to that one because that one interacts with almost everything I have and then medications so going through kratom has anybody heard of kratom okay has anybody used kratom okay it is a natural product I respect that I am a naturalist by heart I only went to pharmacy school because I didn't nobody could tell me as a kid what the scleroderma drugs would do to me so I had to figure it out myself unfortunately though this is a messy form of tramadol I don't know if anybody's tried tramadol but it works on serotonin norepinephrine and as an opioid and so this was kind of everybody's work around well you know if I can't get medical marijuana then I'm gonna get kratom the problem is is if I thought the products that are being used over-the-counter we're a little sketchy with what's in them kratom is even more sketchy and so it does block serotonin norepinephrine and dopamine even at very low doses those are neurotransmitters that you need for mood you need for functioning very important neurotransmitters so it can cause anxiety and agitation and increase blood pressure so things to consider it often includes an opioid compound so with the opioid epidemic again I would still rather have that real conversation with your provider then go down this route so there was a significantly increased risk of suicide with kratom and then serious death and adverse events have happened with kratom so I do not recommend create him for any reason okay important tips I actually feel like I'm somewhat on time okay there are concerns for the the our fellow scleroderma friends who are below 18 again the brain is not fully formed I don't know exactly what's going on but again it's a risks versus benefits having that conversation with your provider to really figure out what that means try CBD first just a CBD product from hemp is what I recommend first but I recommend one from a company that is independently tested that they can guarantee that they have tested each batch each batch is numbered and you can look at that testing and say there's no other impurities there you know it is the concentration that it says it is so there are two that I have vetted I have no financial obligation with either one of these but plus CBD is one that I have found to be reputable and that was available at one of my local fresh time market right down the street so that's what I found that's commercially available if there's one that you are interested in and you can't get that information email me I'll be glad to look it up for you okay but if you ask whoever selling it whether that's the coops whether that's you know the health food stores they should have that data for you because this is coming so for the state of Minnesota there or I think federally what they're trying to do is mandate it to where there has to be a barcode on every bottle that it has CBD in it to guarantee it so in order to for it to be over the counter it has to have less than 0.3 percent THC but of course the you know federal government can't regulate that as much as they would like to for the three million companies that have cropped up in the last year okay THC can be very difficult to tolerate initially so just caution start low go or yeah start low go slow and stay low THC can increase anxiety and nausea as we talked about please communicate with all your health care providers I can't stress this enough I understand that there are many health care providers who are not as open with this conversation and if they're not open and you know absolutely insist on no I would either a look into another provider that you can at least have that conversation with not every provider has to say yeah gun Co you know this is fantastic but at least finding one who will have that conversation with you as far as what are the risks where you independently especially psychiatry I can't stress this enough with how much depression is involved in scleroderma I don't want to trigger that any further if if we can avoid that okay and keeping your rheumatologist in the loop I know where you know everybody's becoming a little more open-minded I mean come on we're at 34 states now right so it's getting there but but we're not quite there yet but communicating is your best tool and talking about the pros and cons having that real conversation there there is drug so if you have a drug abuse history avoid it at all costs I would even avoid CBD personally if you have active meth addiction look at your state laws very very carefully I cannot express this enough Minnesota has a state law it's and with Wisconsin if you are cut if you are pulled over for driving and they don't even need a reason necessarily to pull you over they can take a urine drug screen and if you test positive for either opioids benzos or marijuana at all any metabolites then they can give you a DUI even if you were not driving erratically okay so most states have these types of laws and I will tell you opioids for instance say in your system usually three days so you can take one dose every three days and test positive every day okay depends on the sensitivity of their test but I don't know about you but I don't like personally sitting in the back of a car cop car personally so know what the laws are know what the laws are about traveling so even if you are a medical cannabis card holder you usually cannot go to another state even if they are a medical state because they are medical for their state now are they going to bust you for it I don't know but I don't know about you but I don't want to attempt that you cannot travel across state lines via air travel via you know your cruise lines things like that and definitely not overseas until you know exactly what their laws are I will say that TSA does not look too kindly on it and there were two grandmothers I don't know if you've heard but they were carrying CBD from hemp legal as of last year in Disneyworld and they were not so kindly escorted out of Disney World for having CBD from hemp okay so there's a lot of confusion about hemp versus marijuana okay don't share don't sell don't give away your medical cannabis it really is a drug it's it might be a natural drug and people tell me well I can't overdose on this and I will tell you the story I give as if any of you have seen the Vincent van Gogh and painting starry night right the lights have halos over everything because he was overdosing on a plant in that was eating on his salad okay that plant very well could have killed him by the way so you know it really there is an overdose possibility I mean you know there are still risks with heavy use the goal really is is if you're gonna do medical cannabis to wean off something else wean off a benzo we you know your opioids like xanax clonazepam oxycodone hydrocodone the goal is to find a product that's going to be used more effectively to treat whatever your condition is more effectively rather than masking it in benzos and opioids both mask vaping and smoking not recommended for long health I try to avoid that altogether for all my patients genetics do play a big role and we are finding with pharmacogenetics that there is a big concern when it comes to genetics and so you might not metabolize THC well and you could be one of those that is a slow metabolizer and one hit will last days you don't know many drug interactions and again back to the limited data so with pain management my biggest concerns and takeaways assess the source of the pain and same with scleroderma assess the source so for us it's an immune response right and it's an inflammatory response treat it as directly as possible use all available options even with medical cannabis or you know marijuana physical therapy occupational therapy mindfulness approaches I cannot express how powerful your mind really is and so usually what I recommend is using some of these products to get a little more stable start learning more tools that you can become empowered to do it without the need of a medication now I'm not saying stop your medications because I think they'd all hang me outside but what I'm saying is the ones that are using to treat symptoms how do we how do we decrease those so that we can decrease the possible side-effects and sometimes opioids are more appropriate than cannabis I have those times and I will tell you that I have those patients who where I say opioids are more important or more appropriate every patient should be treated individually so what you take may not be the same thing that your friend takes and what works for your friend may not work for you and that is okay because our bodies are completely different even though we have scleroderma we have a lot of other genetics that are playing in here and a lot of other medications that were on for other conditions hormones and metabolism errors can resemble pain and fatigue and anxiety so some people may not be able to break down folic acid as a genetic problem so there's a lot more to it so I look at it from addressing the root cause so looking at potentially a functional medicine provider and seeing if there is another reason for some of these symptoms including some of the scleroderma symptoms addressing an inflammatory diet and stress contributors so how do we decrease stress in a in an effective manner that may not have long-term effects the pain toolkit org has a bunch of videos and resources that you can use for pain and anxiety to help take control and to help ask questions to your providers about what you want to know more about YouTube really is our friend and I mean you know there are reputable sites that you can use to get good information on how to do mindfulness and how to do meditation to some degree even if it's just a minute a day and then the other options I don't want to forget the low dose naltrexone I actually use low dose naltrexone for my patients for pain and other rheumatologic conditions before I would use medical cannabis and if you want to know more about that I can give you all the information on that but it is it does use different mechanisms to decrease your body's inflammation and to increase your body's own endogenous opioids and potentially an immune modulator I use different combinations of drugs using gabapentin duloxetine and an anti-inflammatory don't underestimate the buprenorphine or Butte rands for pain management and then topical versus oral like I talked about earlier if you can treat one joint if you have one area of pain that you can point to I'd rather you treat that then treat it through the whole body and then overall focus on wellness so I really whole heartedly believe in the integrative approach to healthcare as minimum necessary requirements for long-term wellness so when I talk about that you know I'm talking about you know diet exercise sleep mental health it all plays in together all aspects of life contribute to your health so I really can't stress the the mindfulness approaches and if you want more information I'll be glad to give it to you and same with exercise and therapy so whether that's you know psychotherapy you know counseling or whether that's physical therapy and movement and exercise it's all very very important but I have no magic pill I have no magic wand I would love to give everybody a magic wand to make everything go away but I can't do that so finally start low go slow may take months to find your effective dose start with CBD from hemp first and then move on to cannabis depending on your state laws use products that have third-party testing and I gave you the two names there med Terra and Plus CBD but there are many others look at the benefits benefits pros and cons talk to your providers I have no minute I have no easy button minimal data so we don't know long-term risks so I would not say yeah medical cannabis for everybody just yet so what I'm saying is let's be cautious use this as one of our tools that we have in our toolbox and use it to to manage your life most effectively in the most integrative way possible and last but not least please please please be an active member of your healthcare team if you have issues with that or one other questions I will be more than happy to help with that so that being said thank you for attending my talk and let me know if you have any questions", "FSdjvEnyRzk": "what you're watching right now is mark zarlor committing a crime that helps his daughter who cannot help herself 17 years ago Christie's art ler gave birth to twin girls Keely her twin came home first and then three days later Cara followed her and they began the difficult years long task of learning how to treat Cara's cerebral palsy and severe autism this is an anti-psychotic there are antipsychotics and enzymes and sleep aids but few things helped fight off the worst of her symptoms that could sometimes go on for hours pretty much on a daily basis we have some sort of episode when it's heating up I turn off the fan I have a level eighth of a teaspoon when Mark found the one thing that could stop his daughter he made this video to show the world it takes six deep breaths and a father's dedication [Music] let me up okay [Music] are the videos the truth right that's typical of what we see a neighbor first suggested years ago that cannabis could ease Kara's symptoms mark then found that by grinding marijuana buds and heating them to 410 degrees Fahrenheit it created an immediate rescue response to his Donner's most violent behavior and by 10 she's usually back out here enjoying annoying life again for several years we were in fear of using it trying it giving it to her having it but now there is no fear for those artless who risked everything by posting the video of mark illegally treating Kara that more than 12,000 people have seen and by talking to us I just I got to the point where we looked at the law and said the law is not going to change unless somebody Gamble's in his post mark asks the Texans call their state senators demanding a public hearing on Senate bill 269 it would expand the access of patients with debilitating illnesses to use medical marijuana for Kara that law could make moments of calm come legally and if showing what works for her puts mark in jail so be it [Music] just saying if we want to make a difference for ourselves and for you know other kids like Cara we just hit somebody has to take the risk he's another father who'll do anything for his daughter [Music]", "3KRuhc9R5FI": "damn i really wish i had some weed is that really there it is hey you welcome to my course review a juvenile stuff this is what i do i smoke crush hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them all for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view yo what up world welcome to juvenile styles today i got mirage so i got a gram of it here i'm going to open it up right now in front of you to show you exactly what comes in a grim and then i'm going to roll up a nice joint pack a bomb take a nice hit of the bun and we'll give it a nice thorough review like we usually do so i want to pull it out take a nice look at it like usual roll it up get high that's what we do so it's not a bad grip i'll show you the close-up and then by the time i'm back after the close-up we'll have this joint rolled hundreds of different strands of smoke there's no joke breaking up the big puff and choke if you've never seen my show now you know we get so high that we fly the globe told you i'll be back in a jiffy with a spliffy but now i got it let's light it up and give the mirage plus a review so it didn't look like the biggest account for a grim but it's not that bad of a count it seems to be pretty sticky we'll take a look at it here in a second just trying to get a nice taste of the flavor before i rate it but i'm going to throw it in the bong too before i give it the rating so but the taste so far it has like a nice sweet taste to it but i kind of taste like maybe like a bit of vanilla it tastes nice and crystally though it does have a very nice taste it's not the strongest flavor i've had but it is nice and smooth so that is a nice smooth puff so let's take a look at the buds jesus christies must be child proof i'm just playing just playing so this one ain't a bad size one let's hold this one up as you see it's a nice color green it kind of got like a bit of like a darker like brownish kind of tent to it because it's got a lot of hair on it but it has a strong smell to it it has a stronger smell than it does a flavor but this smells really nice i can actually smell like the vanilla to it quite a bit more and the smell but the flavor is really nice i like that it is smooth you'll be able to smoke a nice big hit in the bun so we'll pack a nice bowl up here in one second we'll take another look at another one that's just another little bug it didn't come in that bigger bud but what do you expect it's only a gram you know so it's not bad the gram was 12.50 i think it wasn't at the nslc which it ain't too bad if you didn't notice check it out i hadn't worn in a while i decided to wear it for another video do you guys if anybody's around from back in them days when i first made this let me know in the comments here i'm going to show you a little side by side i got a little bit bigger since than a tune this is a gram of moon rock so came in two nice hard like pieces so what i'm gonna do is break some off and try it in the bond for you not trying to flex or nothing but when i first started i was just recently getting clean off of our drugs and alcohol so i am a little proud about how i look now because definitely a lot healthier looking now than i was then but yeah i made that i think it was my for 100 sub special i think it was and i don't know if i made this one for special but i had to go with it so i'll give this a rating for taste right after the bomb just one second my dumb ass forgot to grab it before we started so yeah let's pack a bowl up take a nice taupe we'll take this bud and throw it in got to get high so high we got to get high so high taking hits from the bomb you know save yourself back in the day you gotta love that song all right let's light this up and try it out in the bone pretty good pretty good so i can taste it a little bit more in the bone but it tastes pretty good either way so i'll give it i'll give it a nice i give it a 3.5 for flavor it's not that bad definitely had a lot worse so i have a 3.5 this is definitely not the one of the best i've smoked either but it is pretty good so for flavor i'll give it a 3.5 for a count i mean can't be too judgmental on a gram but for account i'll give it i'll give it the same and i didn't mention this is 24 thc and it has 0.79 milligrams of ocb or cbd my bad not the papers cbd but a total cbd is 1.35 milligrams so it is an indica and it's from skoshka it's from that one scotia scotia anyways it's from it's from that [Laughter] i'm going to give the mirage plus an overall 3.5 i think it's a pretty fair rating and i hope you all got some good [ __ ] to smoke i got some ak-47 white widow and cherry blast fast grow are supposed to be coming from bulk seeds i'll

WORKED THE STREETS, WAS WITH THE UNDERCOVER NARCOTICS TEAM. WORKED MY WAY FROM THE STREETS ALL THE WAY UP TO ASSISTANT CHIEF, AND IN 1984, I WAS IN A REALLY BAD CAR WRECK ON DUTY.

banner year for marijuana voters in the november elections overwhelmingly approved weed legalization in some form or another in states where it was on the ballot and more states including new york are hoping also to go green bloomberg quick take reporter jennifer zabasaja has been listening in on governor cuomo's announcement this morning and she joins me now to explain jen good afternoon um can you walk us through this latest proposal by governor cuomo yes jim i mean so this is the third year in a row that governor cuomo has actually tried to propose legalization of weed in some form in the state the last time he did it was in 2020 he says that time it got sidelined because of the pandemic but he really believes that this may be the year for new york to go green as you said so a bit about the proposal so it would allow new yorkers age 21 and up to buy marijuana to buy marijuana from a state approved dispensary but it would also the proposal would also create an office of cannabis management which he is hoping will oversee some of the cannabis legalization that happens in the state but also pretty particularly it would help communities of color also get some of the benefits of legalization so it would give communities of color access to capital as well and especially because black and brown people have been so disproportionately affected by arrests in the past and so cuomo really is hoping that now more than ever this could pass in the state he also introduced online sports betting he wants it to become legal in the state so he thinks that now could be the time that we could finally see this happen but again this is the third time he has proposed legalization of weed tim yeah i mean it raises the question about about this year jen um what is the likelihood that we'll actually see legalization in in 2021 in new york well so in in his address this morning cuomo really hit hard on something that you and i both know uh as new yorkers living here new york has been so hard hit from this pandemic you can just tell by walking around in the streets he said the budget deficit could be anywhere from 15 billion dollars and up and so he believes this could be key to how he believes weed legalization could really be key to helping the state bounce back he thinks some of the programs that he is proposing could help provide 300 million dollars in tax revenue to the state tim and it's not only that we heard we've heard cuomo over the past few days talk about now having a democratically controlled congress right and we've seen back in november we really saw sentiments around weed and around legalization shift across america there's now 36 states that allow it for medical use and 15 states plus d.c allow it for recreational use including our neighbors over in new jersey and so cuomo believes that these things could really put some pressure on lawmakers to finally take action on weed quick take reporter jennifer zabasaja jen good to see you thanks

[ __ ] had a long long long day yesterday [ __ ] I literally worked from [ __ ] like 8 o'clock Thursday more until like literally 3 o'clock this morning so [ __ ] spent I've lost it but that's not their concern of what it is now um basically what I'm at is a medium medicated Hey and then probably go to sleep but it's not realistic I'm watching TV in English sleep but my Friday night time to relax and uh I under strain here so I'm pretty psyched about that um it's not a healing corner the other day remember I got that big bag big big bag of marijuana and uh I picked up this it's a nice little black bottle right here I'm always excited I feel a little black piles because it means it's a Connecticut pharmaceutical solutions CPS um why do I like can I confirm some solutions because the strains they come out with are always usually pretty tough that's right they've really held it down with some really top top-shelf strains from the very beginning they've had to go strain haze they've had the started killer you have the geeze our team which is fire fire fire fire um so they really do call it that or they come on some really good I see meaty strains too which is nice they were one of the first producers and Connecticut have some good CB trades so when they caught with a new one I get really excited about it I have a feeling this is give you a pretty good strain itself I've never even heard this name before I didn't those existed and worrying about it and when I did some homework on it was actually hard to find out what early what it is um it's called the Burmese cush [ __ ] for as far as what I the Connecticut standards go by see Connecticut I'm a suitable solution they're calling the fiord in D Jordan D but this little number is clocking in it twenty nine percent THC liniment THC like 28% see you yeah so just give me some fire it's an indica you know what I got the lineage on it want to get for background information on the strange selfish really good service verify it as far as I know it's this is Lila Street and it come it's like a hybrid in Dakota in their indica dominant hybrid it's the OG Kush crossed with an unknown indica high unknown indica so would you coach Carson alone no and then cut for me cush um a little bit of a background story to it but I've read a couple different background stories to it that didn't make sense so they they might rub so well they're probably all hearsay so I'm like an empty anyway so let's just go with I open the bottle with the Fox inside all right cool okay nose all stuffy but straight pine smells like straight pinecones like wait like neither that way I met a meaty pine like a meaty behind this is nice um I have a good feeling about this and then also one thing I want also maintenance use the sea bass is one of us some really nice-looking but CPS is one of the growers actually this is all organically soil grown all organically soil ground and it's nice they like that piney minty smell and then a lot more painting maybe but a little mint but definitely lot of pine just nuts oh it's nice looking at what this is a pretty chicken healthy-looking nugget right here I got one here alright this is it this is a Burmese cush and this is definitely some nice quality bud structured English it's nice and I'm lucky there's some there's some [ __ ] going on check this out this is the Burmese collection move it over though kind of the viewing area here just cuz it a little bit better later he's looking nice refer well let's just kind of stir in the session the Burmese cush again this is from CBS maybe get pharmaceutical solutions yeah because there's like I mean trench G yellow trichomes see I'm saying like if they golden hue to it they look real like sticky and moist it looks like wet sugar and that's [ __ ] pretty damn beautiful there's definitely some freshness going on in there real pretty looking like a death Wow oz buds look at just gooey gooey gooey gooey with trichomes yeah frost yes but frosty ass but it's like Tammy a white Wow do you think it impressive looking this is a very schematic from leucism again she's an OG Kush crust that I've known indica it's not even Burmese maybe burrito who the [ __ ] knows unless she's fire yeah it's beautiful let's try them again no in-depth their dads and cost it up yeah Wow to trichome coverage huh leave that nice beautiful don't stop that there's a big guy that's just [ __ ] why see if rain cold wow that's beautiful alright so let's find the medication piece inside I don't know that looks nice where's that don't medicate on that it doesn't we get medicated on that way to find that found that but we Pat and Laurie that I stick with the two little owner dogs names we're gonna make yeah thanks so fluorescent green elf wants the white try some school anyway you medicated so that's basically what we're [ __ ] see what the [ __ ] happens now um I mean I don't really got much to tell you about the [ __ ] effects what the skin dukes have absolutely no idea so find out together I just know oops I just know what the the CPS is strains sometimes they don't look as appealing as like an Ag all strain or even some of the third plant strange law because those things are trying to get really frosty looking um not that this isn't but again that has to do with the fact that this is again organically soil grown I'm comparing the other producers so the bud structures here look a little bit different but this shit's fire fire fire Wow when you break it up you a ton of krishna super cushy like straight OG like that was crazy one from high knee straight wicked wicked coach like super OG ish oh my god this is gonna be some high power this is gonna be [ __ ] ridiculous hey no no I got okay so tell you two goals they're really cushy super cushy now if I can break it open break it down a little bit talk it up a little bit she's [ __ ] Wow okay I believe all those every nice they're bugging you three rolls off that so it breaks up good and I got this little ball piece here I have known as I use this little snapper bowl he's not only got and it really just gives you the perfect dosage of medication I found you don't have to use a lot get a good rip and totally enough medication so she can burn my [ __ ] house down sorry I'm very sad about the camp so Splashtop time [ __ ] beautiful supers going in but then you get this tone ecclesia expansion like oh she's just falling on my face super smooth that was great that was that that that was incredibly smooth okay so for all your patients out there to have like lung you cheese like I really need a strain that's gonna be you know easing my lungs this is fantastic and it's extremely [ __ ] potent Wow yeah like you can feel that twenty nine percent THC great yeah oh one thing I did notice yeah and this is my feel I'm at I just read out that this is hand like a creeper maybe kind of creep radiation you're thinking like I could feel like first it was like a super smooth but then it's just just like expand that you're gonna feel like overwhelm you taking over like well face again tingling my patties and tingly um yeah [ __ ] you guys some space and help for a second here that's nice that's really nice um now it's not really giving you that heavy indica like I think that Aldo molecular at all I actually feel like kind of like it's at even out of yeah see I think that's the cush part of the capacity cuz I feel a little too energetic and you forward from that for sure like water plant guaranteed alright so we got that I think there's another

look I can't even believe that you can't grow this like doesn't do anything to your consciousness zero it doesn't affect you at all because it's related to pot it's illegal the National hemp museum is in versailles kentucky isn't really where I graduated high school do because it's Woodford County Kentucky was at one point the largest him producing Counting the entire nation whoa it just I don't know something about the limestone is total conditions the humidity sunlight now shot in him it was really really well Wow the first legal 508 or acre hemp farm in Kentucky unveiled so now it's legal in October oh wow so now they can grow it excellent beautiful I don't live there anymore so I'm out of touch but hey that's great news that's fantastic news that's amazing well we're just talking about something that I was gonna bring up oh [ __ ] I can't remember something about something about new mr. Nelson something new stuff that had to do with with legalization marijuana in Kentucky we were just talking yeah yeah it's just it's just pretty crazy that you'd have a hemp museum and have it be illegal for so long with no argument there's like there's no science it doesn't pollute anything it doesn't do anything the environment the nation makes amazingly built on it yeah everything was made out of that [ __ ] do you ever see the first Henry Ford Model T where he made the fenders out of hemp and he's hitting it with a hammer not know though dude you had to watch this we'll play this for you it's the craziest [ __ ] ever Henry Ford's very first car that he made he made the fenders out of hemp and you're watching him hit this [ __ ] fender with a hammer and a hammer is just bouncing off the fender check this out and this is crazy I mean I don't know when was this what did it say Jamie was the time it said their 1941 1941 so in 1941 before it was illegal so it was made and it was made illegal right around the time where alcohol prohibition had ended and they needed something to go after so then they started using the same guys to go after weed and this was pre that look at this he's hitting this [ __ ] thing with a the back of an axe it's just bouncing off it was also a great way to discriminate against Mexican immigrants it was and black people to the whole name marijuana came from a Mexican slang for a wild tobacco didn't have anything to do with marijuana they just created this thing like when they made it illegal the the people that were they didn't even understand they're making hemp illegal they had all that explain it to everybody then they were they had like tax stamps that you had to but about DuPont understood that all the Institute's to the [ __ ] out of it so did William Randolph Hearst that guy was the craziest the guy whose Citizen Kane was based on rules that guy was the craziest so here is this guy's hitting this hemp fender with a [ __ ] hammer Henry Rollins testing it Henry Rollins goddamn it look you barely smudged the thing I mean they're so superior to metal and it's easy it's a renewable resource like we're we've [ __ ] this up so bad it's so obvious it's one of the biggest example said why are you drone on about pot all the time it's because these things like that are one of the biggest examples of just how egregious making it illegal is it is a it's one of the most amazing plants we've ever discovered you can make your house out of it you can [ __ ] eat at you can get high with it you can make your clothes with it it has all the amino acids you could use for heating oil you could what to treat cancer patients treat cancer patients with this here first I mean somebody put it here come on come on come on right it helps reduce tumor size it's crazy helps a host of different diseases I know a lot of people that have like serious inflammation problems they smoke some weed and they're alright just lightens everything up and it's illegal and you can grow it you grow your own you can grow a [ __ ] ton of it in your backyard anybody could do you have a sprinkler okay you got some good dirt alright you got some weed that weeds just good to go that's a [ __ ] hardy ass plant yeah my grandmother she just had some some health stuff and it's like you know how do I you know she's pretty old-school like well knowing there's this thing out there that that isn't anything that these doctors are gonna offer it's just gonna make her feel awful yeah and and you know ever have to go through all of that somebody just give you comfort and it ease nausea or make you want to eat food or those kind of things like why wouldn't you want someone you love and care about to have that but then at the same time you know you want to be the person trying to feed pot to your grandmother yeah it's a hard sell it's a hard sell yeah it's just stunning how well propaganda from 1933 carried all the way the [ __ ] to 2018 it's stunning is it I mean but it's almost a hundred years yeah with what we like the amount of information that you can get on a subject now like say if you're the bet the medical benefits of cannabis just google that and you'll just start reading all the [ __ ] like if it seems to me that enough people would go wait what are we doing like why is it illegal nobody's died from it like no one more people die of aspirin every year because zero die from pot so it's really the number zero it doesn't mean that people are going to get high and walking at traffic some some are gonna but I think part of that is because we're not too teaching people how to get high properly someone gets high for them but it's time you let a poner how many of those people that are getting hit by cars are actually looking at their phones it could be a lot they were high and looking at the phones you don't see that here like you're doing in Nashville I drove around and that's like if I can't hate that and you look every time was driving on a town everybody's texting everybody's looking down you can always spot on the interstate yeah we've been home but you don't see that in California guys you guys have like really heavy loss saw today yeah so today some lady had drifted completely in my lane and I looked over at her and I saw the back of her head like I was I was on the driver side I was on that side looking over at her and all I saw was the back of it she literally wasn't looking at my car and she was just looking her phone and working her thumb and occasionally like looking up at the screen or looking up at the wind chills like whoa you crazy lady you think just cuz you're going 40 miles an hour that's okay cuz you're on a side street like you're not even looking where you're going you driving a car what if you hit a kid Jesus Christ [ __ ] what if you slam into some old lady you know what if you rear-end a bike you're not even looking you didn't notice the bike was there boom you run over some guy's leg what in the [ __ ] lady or dude maybe I was misgendering I don't know I don't know what her statuses you gotta be real careful today Sturgill amazed it like that Nashville is ever like super I don't know bro I don't leave the house I really don't have any idea I just I think that's a good move yeah you know I like my kids I mean I'm somewhat aware of everything going on it's surprising that none of that's really hit the music business mmm as hard as it is but there's just yeah I try to just do my thing yeah there's a weird weird world were living in today I would like I would like us to figure this out better I would like us to do just a little bit better job being nice to each other getting our [ __ ] together you [Applause]", "wA5wg8JqoDw": "[Music] welcome back to torpy eyes in today's video i'm going to show you how i make skin cream that has thc and cbd in it this cream is amazing for sore muscles dry skin sunburns and any other type of skin irritation that you might have [Music] this mixture of products is pretty simple but does amazing job for the body all these items can be found at a store nearby you're going to need coconut oil aloe vera gel and skin cream i have a lot of muscle pain and dry skin so this mix of products is fast acting and doesn't leave my skin greasy the first step in this process is to infuse your coconut oil with the thc and cbd this can be done in a few different ways i found it to be easiest using a slow cooker you can do it on your stove top using a double boiler if you don't have access to a slow cooker i picked up this slow cooker at walmart for about 15 coconut oil is a great product to use because it's all natural and has little to no order it's one of the best binding agents for cannabis both cannabis and coconut oil are really good for treating inflammation to infuse the coconut oil with thc and cbd you measure out the amount of oil you want to make then measure out how strong you want your final product to be for my mix i want about a half milligram per one milliliter of final product i'll leave my mix amount in the description below simply put the coconut oil into the slow cooker then add one cup of water the water is added to create a volume for the slow cooker so you don't burn the product then add your thc or cbd you can use just thc or just cb or combine them both just like me it's all personal preference i grew the harley quinn vx4 strain a little while back it's a one-to-one ratio strain which gave me both thc and cbd [Music] i leave the coconut oil in the slow cooker on low for three to four hours then it's time to separate the oil from the canops and water i use multiple layers of chew cloth and a fine metal strainer be sure to use a heat resistant container because the oil is pretty hot i always go with a collab [Music] me once you have the oil in the glass bowl i put it into the fridge overnight this not only lets the coconut oil to get hard but it also separates the oil and water you can remove the hard coconut oil out of the bowl and then drain the water out since i use ice water hash instead of cannabis flour you see my coconut oil didn't get much color to it usually when you use bud you'll get a very green end result now that we have our coconut oil infused with the thc and cbd we can go ahead and mix everything else together for the cream i use a cream that i prefer any cream will do though this one also has vitamin e in it and doesn't leave my skin greasy so that's why i chose it [Music] as for the aloe vera gel this is great for reducing pain and soreness reducing the healing time of burns and it also contains vitamin a and c [Music] since our coconut oil is hard we're gonna have to warm it up a bit so it's easier to measure out i just put it into the microwave for a few seconds once i've measured it out to the proper amount i put it into the blender's container and place it back into the fridge for 15 minutes this is to thicken it up since our other two ingredients are a bit thicker than the oil for this mix i used 200 milliliters of the coconut oil and 300 milliliters of the aloe vera gel you can use all-natural rear from a plant but it may not last as long i've never used the plant form so i'm not 100 sure [Music] time to add the lotion this container of lotion is 220 milliliters so i use the entire thing [Music] i'm using a ninja blender i set it on low and let it mix for one minute i take it out of the blender shake it around by hand then put it on low again for another minute if you want you can add essential oils to the mix but i like mine as odorless as possible i like to reuse the lotion container that it came in and also any editor i put into a tupperware [Music]

everyone happy holidays thanks for watching Cheers you", "MWQLD5pq80k": "what cannabis stocks should i buy what cannabis stock should i invest my money in what are we instruction about what marijuana stock should i invest in those are all the questions that i'm getting especially since election day when we saw the big referendum on weed across the country across the united states you have my sister state right there to the east of me new jersey that made marijuana medically legal medicinally legal recreational illegal i'm messing up my words all right but you know what i mean they're making it legal they made it recreational illegal and there are a whole bunch of other states that have kind of done the same thing so i want to talk about that try to answer the question that i keep getting and hopefully give a little bit of guidance all right i'll see you on the other side [Music] hey everybody kamari ellis of the finance trouble the founder of the philly tax team just want to talk about something today like i said at the top of the video the top of the broadcast that people keep asking me about weed stocks what should i buy what should i invest what stocks are good what's the new hot wheat stock what's the new hot marijuana stock what's the new hot cannabis stock whatever way you want to word it right because you know everybody likes to call the flower a different name i know the proper name for it is cannabis though right that is the proper name but let's talk about this real quick people want to know what they want to invest in is it chronos is it tell ray is it i fear i always get the names wrong right is it aurora well guess what folks i don't know i don't know which one of these stocks are really going to blow being honest with you i don't know what stops really want to do good now if you've been rocking with me for a while you know that i invested until ray a couple years ago and actually full disclosure full transparency i actually still own some shares of till right however that doesn't color how i feel about the wheat market today or the marijuana market or the cannabis market whatever you want to call it but let's talk about it so like i said this is what i do know the global marijuana market cannabis market is estimated to be about 340 some odd billion dollars 340 billion dollars that's a lot of chatter that's a lot of claims it's a lot of money so we know we're going to see more legalization of marijuana in some way shape or form now the united states federal government might be a bit of a laggard it might be a little bit behind the curve it might be a little slow that's kind of the nature of the federal government though right if anybody understands what i'm saying again we can run down all those names you know the chronos the tailrace the outreach the affairs uh the med men's um the cure leafs uh any any of those names right and we don't really know who's going to win but again i see some more things happening to push the legalization the decriminalization of marijuana um and that's a good thing in my opinion because a lot of people suffer with chronic illnesses i know my uncle who suffered with cancer began to start to use the flower to help to help him get appetite actually to help him to even keep food down it worked for him a lot you know sadly you know he still has transitioned on but it worked and it's kind of made me a believer as well so i saw some updates on this right in the middle of everybody asked me these questions since the election but i wanted to talk about this real quick um the u.n is pushing for something so the u.n is pushing for marijuana stocks to get legal in particular they're actually pushing for cannabis stocks to not be classified in the same way that heroin is classified so if you didn't notice heroin and marijuana or cannabis are basically classified the same way in the drug tables they're both schedule one drugs it's crazy right you're probably asking yourself how can anyone anywhere somehow think that weed marijuana cannabis is the same exact thing as heroin but hey that's how they did it back in the 60s i don't know why they did it that way but this is good news so now we're getting some global pressure pushing it all right this all kind of turns into our overall investment thesis about why cannabis is a good investment no doubt cannabis as an industry is a good investment again the question is which company should we invest in which company can we kind of execute our investment thesis all right so let's just travel down the road a little bit more as i talk to you about this all right so on election day the country spoke out the country made their voices heard they sang the song of freedom for cannabis users and people heard them all right so new jersey arizona montana and south dakota all voted to legalize recreational use of cannabis there's one more though one more mississippi i'm not going to try to smell it because all i can think of is mi cuculetta coletta eye humpback humpback all right y'all get the point all right but that state of mississippi made medical marijuana legal so medical not recreational medical so recreational is when you can kind of smoke it freely or ingest the freely medical you tend to need or you absolutely have a need for a prescription from a doctor but either way that's progress it's progress it's progress that's progress and so you have this 340 billion dollar market globally we have more states coming online making it legal on the state level not the federal level it's still illegal on the federal level but on the state level these states are pushing through and they're saying they're going to make it legal they're going to have people selling it they're going to collect tax dollars from this which is what i really feel is pushing all of this but this is making for a better day for a lot of cannabis users whether it be medical or recreational nobody has ever really shown that cannabis has a real negative effect so it's it's getting pushed forward it's getting pushed forward again people always ask me what should they invest in and i say we don't really know which one of these stocks are going to win at the end of the day so why not buy them all all right and you can kind of buy them all two weeks all right and both of those waves are with etfs so one etf it's called mj just like barry j the other one is called yolo y-o-l-o all right and so one atf um is is bigger than the other uh so i'm going to pull those up real quick so you can look at those so we can all look at those and so mj etf and so before we get into this i just want to remind everybody this is not investment advice this is not investment recommendations before you buy or sell any recommendation please check in with your investment advisor and your tax advisor remember past performance of an investment does not indicate future reset future results of an investment all right so let's let's take a look at these two etfs real quick all right so the first one i'm going to show you is for mj okay so mj is the etf mg alternative harvest etf here's a little bit about mj mj tracks the prime alternative harvest index right so it's a harvest index because marijuana cannabis is usually considered an agricultural thing it's an agricultural part of the agricultural sector so you know there is no quote-unquote weed sector not yet it could come but for right now it's part of agriculture sometimes you might even see it in agriculture excuse me in pharmaceuticals as well all right so it tracks to the prime alter alternative harvest index designed to measure the performance of companies within this cannabis ecosystem benefiting from global medicinal and recreational cannabis legalize legalized incentives all right so the the first u.s and world's largest etf to target the global cannabis industry okay so it has a little under a billion dollars on assets so it has 962 million dollars in assets under management it's pretty big all right it's expense ratio it's 0.75 it's a little bit on a hefty side but i get it i get it i get it i get it all right and so here i mean when you look at the map of everything that's legalized everything is in green you know states like washington oregon california nevada all right those that have been decriminalized uh are places like pennsylvania and new jersey but now they're soon to turn new jersey at least as soon to turn um legalized as well so like i said 344 billion dollars global y'all so there is a lot of opportunity here and the market is just getting going just getting going now year to date this fund is down it's down three percent i'm sorry it's down 36 year to date um cannabis has gotten hit if anybody remembers again i invested until right remember until ray opened up at like 20 something run up to like 300 something and now i think it's trading at like nine bucks at the time of this recording so you know it's been on a bit of a roller coaster and it's only been out two years so all these stocks are kind of following along in the same price in the same trend all these stocks are kind of following along in the same trend and if you're really curious investor or soon-to-be investor or young learning investor look up correlation and you can see how each one of the marijuana stocks are highly correlated um with one another and so they kind of move in lockstep so it can be um a little dangerous right but with proper planning with proper strategy i think you can position yourself in one a day and that is part of the reason why i suggest investing in etfs instead of an individual stock when it comes to investing in cannabis all right so let's look at let's look at some of the holdings that they have all right so the top ten holdings in this fund is afria it's ten percent of the fund gw pharma is in the funds about eight point three percent canopy is eight point two percent aurora right is seven point three percent of this fund cronos is six point nine percent of the overall fund all right cell ray is about 5.9 percent of the fund growth generation corp is 5.64 of this fund hexo corp is 4.4 percent village farms is 4.16 and charlotte's web is 3.27 and so if you had 100 bucks right and you were going to invest in each one of these um the same way the company does so afria would you know get 10 and 10 cents of your money gdp farmer will get eight dollars and 30 cents of your money canopy growth we get eight dollars and twenty cents for your money aurora cannabis we'll get seven dollars and thirty two percent of your money chronos we get six dollars until right we get five ninety three five dollars and ninety three cents gross generation will get five dollars and sixty four cents xo is we get four dollars and 44 cents and village farms is three point excuse me he has four dollars and 16 cents and charlotte's web would get three dollars and 27 cents right so when you know a lot of us don't think in percentages so i like to kind of break it down in a number standpoint as well so those are the biggest those are the biggest movers and this a lot of people love it you see it almost has a billion dollars an asset assets under management all right so that's one option again this is not an investment recommendation this is just education and entertainment all right now there is another etf that is on the market that i feel that people should take a look at before trying to invest in individual stocks all right and so this ticker symbol is yolo um that is an advisor shares etf again it's getting some traction is getting some visibility a lot of people like it it's a little different than mj um and i'll show you that in just a second i'll show you that in just a second and so here we're looking at yolo advisor shares pure cannabis etf all right so right now it's trading at 16.58 all right so overall cannabis in this various applications have been used throughout human civilization all right so this is uh yolo and advisor shares spin or pitch to get people to start to buy into this all right all right so let's look at this as it's in the management they have about 128 million dollars give or take all right so it's definitely definitely not the same as um mj mj definitely has more money into it more investors have been flocking to it uh more people like it now year to date here this is what's interesting year to date this etf is only down 1.53 so you definitely want to look at that you definitely want to look at that now what kind of holdings does yolo have versus mj so yellow has vff which is village farms international coming in at his biggest holding 10 10.62 excuse me 11.13 um curl leaf is coming in at eight point one four percent green thromb is three excuse me green thumb is coming in at seven thirty seven percent of the overall front innovative industrial prosper executing innovative industrial property is coming in at 6.91 percent um growth generation is coming in at 6.81 percent gw pharmaceuticals is coming in at 5.62 percent is coming at coming in at 4.90 excuse me four point nine four percent not dollars yet we're not there yet tara send is coming in at 4 58. uh crisco i think it's called crisco or cresco i'm always unsure what it's called it's coming in at 4.43 of the fund and truly cannabis swap is coming in at 4.36 all right so that is the breakdown of yolo now i like both of these funds i like mj i like yolo um because they have different allocations they both have different allocations um the yolo is geared more towards i would say the less established cannabis companies the mj is kind of geared towards the more established um cannabis companies so you can make a difference there or you can make the difference between investing into into the two there but listen at the end of the day you can buy both so if you got a hundred bucks you can put fifty dollars on mj you can put fifty dollars on yolo and then if there's any particular company that you really like that stands out for you you can start to buy those as well all right but again my opinion is your best play to play uh marijuana the cannabis industry right now is one of these etfs either yolo or mj uh that's my opinion my opinions don't represent anybody else just minds all right listen again this is not investment advice everything i say here is for entertainment and educational purposes only again before you think about or go to buy any investment you want to talk to an investment and tax advisor remember that past performance of an investment is not a guarantee of future results all right so that just basically means that things have changed that's because a stock has done really really well in the past does not mean it will go forward and continue to do good in the future all right everybody so listen what do you think what is your favorite cannabis talk which one do you like drop me a comment below and i'll see you all the next time kamari ellis out have a great day", "27dIDqrHsFE": "[Music] hey everybody dr john here with uh extract lab i'm going to be talking today about what is delta eight delta eight is a form of thc that really is a little bit different from a delta nine thc delta nine thc everybody knows that's the thc that makes you guys has some psychoactive effects it's also the main psychoactive ingredient within the marijuana plant and what delta eight is is it's a form or an isomer of that delta nine thc the reason it's been talked about a lot is because a lot of people are using hemp and derivatives of him to create a delta eight thc and they're doing this with some organic synthesis jiu-jitsu really in the laboratory and they're taking cbd and converting it over to delta 8 on thc the reason they're doing that is because the delta atfc of course has some of the same psychoactive effects that delta 9 phc has albeit they can be quite attenuated from delta a lot of people would say it has like a mellow effect so they're using hemp derived materials um they're hooking it up and they're processing it to the point where it now is converting into a delta eight thc molecule that then they can formulate into vapors or gummies or whatever that is that they're looking to formulate for so that's really what delta eight thc is when you look at it just look at it just look at it it's actually an oil and it looks a lot like a cbd oil or it looks a lot like a thc oil you've seen some nice golden pictures of some of that oils as they're flowing out the oil itself is a little bit more biscuit so it's very very thick hard before you need to really heat it up in order to pour it if you want to make products associated with a delta eight a couple different things you need to be thinking about the first thing is you gotta make sure that there's no delta not in your product because the law says that you have to have less than 0.3 delta 9 thc if you have a delta h thc and you have too much delta 9 in it you're not going to be able to use that product for your vapor or you need to dilute it down so that it doesn't have too much delta line in it that really is delta eight how you can use it the oils they look beautiful for them and you can formulate them into different products like that so really guys that's what delta 8 is all about please subscribe to our channel on youtube like us on instagram we have all kinds of calculators for you guys to use on our website we have guides i don't know a lot of people don't know this but we have guide after

the drug and alcohol field sometimes i work with clients who are attempting to quit their cannabis use and when they stop their cannabis use they also experience withdrawal symptoms however sometimes they find those withdrawal syndromes are quite severe or uncomfortable and they may go back to cannabis use thinking that their withdrawal symptoms were related to their cannabis use however what we do know from many of our cannabis smokers is they often mix tobacco with their cannabis and so there's they're becoming dependent or their bodies getting used to both tobacco and cannabis so when they stop their cannabis they they forget that they might be also withdrawing from also from the tobacco and the nicotine within that tobacco so sometimes when we offer those people nicotine replacement therapy they find their withdrawal symptoms from the cannabis to be much more comfortable and it was actually probably some nicotine that was also showing itself in those severe withdrawal symptoms", "pbawJAp7Khk": "cannabis use has been on the rise but one area of cannabis that is not commonly discussed is its effects on mental health so in today's video we will be discussing the effects of cannabis and its association with various mental health disorders in the united states more than 11.8 million young adults reported using marijuana in 2018 and in 2011 there were nearly 456 000 drug-related emergency department visits in the united states where marijuana use was mentioned in their medical records well what is cannabis and what is it made out of cannabis is a well-known drug which is known to alter the mind and body it is also known as pot weed ganja marijuana and many other terms [Music] people either smoke cannabis through a hand-rolled cigarette or through vapors and edibles cannabis is derived from the plant cannabis sativa which contains high amounts of thc this stands for delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol this contains a psychoactive component that makes people feel high the other component of cannabis is cannabidiol which is used to reduce pain and inflammation [Music] now that we know the components of cannabis you must be wondering about its effects on the brain and body [Music] when a person smokes cannabis thc and cbd go into the lungs into the bloodstream once the chemicals are in the bloodstream it is transported throughout the body though the after effects of drugs are experienced at different intensities general effects include increased appetite for food laughter and joy and the ability to hear see smell taste and feel drastically increases [Music] focusing on the short-term effects of cannabis on the brain cannabis creates tiredness difficulty in remembering information concentrating and confusion it can also lead to anxiety fear and reduce the ability of a person to react quickly thus making it dangerous to drive or operate equipment short-term effects also include psychotic episodes including paranoia delusion or even hallucinations however the long-term effects of cannabis use are severe the ability for the brain to remember information concentrate make decisions can significantly decrease as well as the overall iq these effects can be permanent even after cannabis is stopped and can be experienced differently depending on the person especially on age now that we know about the effects of cannabis on the brain let's dive into its effects on the body in the short term cannabis damages blood vessels decreases blood pressure and increases heart rate these can further cause the person to faint become prone to heart conditions or get a heart attack if a person continues to smoke cannabis in the long term they can experience problems with their lungs this can increase their risk of bronchitis lung infections chronic cough or increased buildup of mucus in the throat cannabis can be used for both medicinal and recreational purposes and in canada 330 000 canadians are using marijuana for medical purposes [Music] some pros of medical marijuana is that it's safer to use in opiates it's less addictive it's a great muscle relaxant it's less in tremors and those with parkinson disease it's ease pain in people with multiple sclerosis it's managed nausea and weight loss in people of glaucoma and research has shown promising results for ptsd however you can build a tolerance to medical marijuana causing one to continuously increase their dosage to relieve pain in addition it's not readily available in all countries as every country has different laws regulating its use recreational marijuana usage is controversial in canada it is legal to use and has reduced the black market network of cannabis distribution increasing consumer safety and utilizing taxpayer money for other uses however recreational usage has negative impacts such as its long-lasting effects on the brain and increased risk for mental health issues now let's dive into the age demographics of cannabis usage as shown in this graph we can see that the majority of cannabis users are below the age of 44 with the highest rate of cannabis consumption being in the age group of 25 to 34 and the lowest rate of cannabis consumers above the age of 65. but what's really interesting is that a literature review conducted from the year 2000 to 2017 saw that the highest increase in cannabis use was observed in the older adult population 50 years or older and specifically though 65 years or older had the greatest increase in marijuana use some correlates of cannabis use in the older age group were listed in the study and included being male unmarried having various chronic diseases and psychological stress as well as the use of other substances such as alcohol tobacco and illicit drugs question that often comes to mind when thinking about cannabis usage is how does frequent marijuana use increase the development of mental disorders such as psychosis schizophrenia depression and bipolar disorder and is there even a link between cannabis and these mental health illnesses well for starters cannabis is prevalent in 50 of psychosis cases thc has been linked with causing positive psychosis symptoms and neurocognitive changes by altering the prefrontal cortex and reducing synaptic density in addition psychoactive effects in marijuana varies depending on the amount of thc consumed also it is suggested that endogenous cannabinoids the ones made by our own bodies have protective effects against the psychoactive impacts of thc a study looking at risk factors of psychosis development cannabis users suggest that adolescents between the ages of 15 to 18 had more psychosis episodes compared to control subjects maternal cannabis use or using cannabis while pregnant may also contribute to psychosis in the child during later stages of their life cannabis and schizophrenia a mental disorder where people receive reality through hallucinations delusions and disorganized thinking studies suggest that marijuana exposure might be one factor that interacts with many other factors to become a possible causative agent in schizophrenia however there is not causal relationship between the two similar to psychosis adolescent exposure to cannabis is associated with a higher risk of developing schizophrenia compared to adult cannabis usage overall more research needs to be conducted to examine the complex relationship between cognition cannabis and schizophrenia several longitudinal studies show that cannabis placed individuals at a moderate risk of developing depression unfortunately they were unable to determine if it caused depression also cannabis was associated with increased risk of school dropout and unemployment which may indirectly cause depression thc has psychoactive effects which regulate mood and has been associated with increased anxiety symptoms several studies concluded that cannabis placed individuals at a small risk of developing anxiety however similar to cannabis use and depression there's little evidence to suggest that cannabis causes anxiety several studies show high rates of co-occurrence of cannabis and bipolar disorders cannabis has shown to worsen manic symptoms in those with pre-existing bipolar disorder and might also contribute to the genesis of manic type symptoms in those with no pre-existing bipolar disorder if you or someone you know is addicted to marijuana there are many treatment options available first it's important to educate yourself on the risks and dangers of cannabis see a therapist or join community programs to meet people

"BauIG0oJCDo": "thc and drug testing here's what you need to know let's not pussyfoot around the elephant in the room and it's a pretty big elephant in many countries the smoking of cannabis is illegal but the state of play seems to be changing and in time the laws may well change however here we are talking about today beyond legality there is also the question of being fit and capable for work there are a good number of companies who require staff to take random drug tests what we wanted to do here is to simply inform you how long thc can linger in your system and how for some it can pass through more quickly than others we should also point out that thc can remain in your body for up to 30 days after you have ingested cannabis especially if eaten as opposed to smoked beyond this and this is where forensic science comes in your hair will contain traces of cannabis that will remain for at least 90 days if there is a possibility that a drug test will include hair follicles our advice is to keep away from cannabis for a long time thus unexpectedly shaving your head prior to a very critical and rigorous interview might just give the game away first thing to note is that because thc is a lipid soluble overweight individuals will retain thc in their system for longer than their thinner companions worse still if you smoke cannabis don't go for heavy exercise just prior to any urine test as when fat is broken down thc is released into your system and will come out in your urine however before you think that going for a run might also get you stoned on that thc the levels are detectable but minuscule and have no psychotropic effect tests for thc are actually for the metabolite thc cooh or tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid though that's a bit of a mouthful you should also be aware that thc can build up in your system over time so regular users are more likely to retain thc in their system for longer than newbies who have a relatively pristine metabolism light use would be up to three times a week medium use would be up to five times a week and heavy use would be seven times a week and chronic heavy use would be frequently every day for a urine test and as a rule of thumb light users should see traces of thc disappear after three days but heavy users will need up to 30 days plus if you have to undergo a saliva test then allow 3 days if you are a light user 7 days for a medium user and 15 days for a heavy user but again up to 30 days or even more if you are a chronic heavy user for a blood test the rule is up to two days for it to remain in the bloodstream but thc has been found in blood tests 25 days after smoking cannabis so unfortunately there is no definitive answer we'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter and of course if you

Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful crystals See you next time", "JcsxB2PMPsQ": "oh yeah how's the prose been asked about that sponsored what sponsor close that's all right whatever the Air Canada jazz flow yeah it's like doing sort of the boarding for here Canada hears something in jazz and they were doing jazz hands I was pretty funny enough you like people that money's going might just be visibility oh you know if they have to pay for it they might just have yeah that's true I guess yeah you would think and you know you have the choice of being in inclusive or not inclusive business so that mean yes yeah well I would like to see and sort of been here for a while Muslim guy like supporting and I would love to see the mosque come out and like get visible a little bit yeah for a group that is looking for acceptance in Halifax I would say first floor across Canada that's an opportunity to get everybody's yeah I think what place to see them I appreciate that the old men aren't coming out but there's probably a group of twenty year old who were raised here with a lot less box yeah it's true and that would be super cool for visibility and part of the community yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean there's from the theater to your left yeah that's that's for the people who you know make decisions and whatnot the lowly workers as I have been I mean I mean trades are different this is over like let's take st.

completely blown the market open I know there's a lot of people out there that are complaining about the prices and whatnot well no I just mean in the in the way of you know accessibility for different types of strains and yeah like people aren't just you know like you go you're dealer you always you know two or three strains and that's it right it's always different straight kept up with really added variety yeah as well as like strings the quality overalls come out for sure they gotta stay competitive yeah but you know pricing is never gonna be an option for competitiveness because the government's never gonna be able to compete against the black market that's because taxes go buy a bottle of Grey Goose 20 bucks so saying you don't want you eliminate the taxes yeah like I said before really what you're paying for that price it's just the variety that they have available in the testing yeah yeah you wanna make you know quality like no quality is a subjective term right now

time fighting it have you waited likes for his bike since I started watching UFC back in the early 2000s or late 90s where's that feet or oh I think that was beat or okay yeah but he was heavyweight champ like 10 or 15 years ago yeah he lost development in Sylvia there's a period where we really thought he wouldn't you know anymore win yeah happy weight it's like where do you see and Steve a have sort of cleared out the top you only need to win a couple of them all yeah yeah sure but not like 155 we have cowboy and Tony standing in front of you where he even get to go talk to could be yeah yeah there's some staff divisions right now but it's uh I don't know then 170 super interesting with master ball and komaru seem to be at the top right now yeah I haven't seen Woodley fight since well since he lost the belt the problem like is it kind of deserves a rematch we just so hasn't full-time I don't know if Dana wants to give them I've got immediate rematch but how long I don't know how long he held the belt for but uh George since George left 170 I just don't have that much interest in it yeah it's full of killers yeah like the fights are good I like Walter Wade not the same no no 205 oh well I mean John Jones will be the king there until he's not yeah yeah that's true you see retires well there's a couple fights left a light heavyweight in which case he's cleaned out the division like soundly in some cases he's beat the guys twice yeah I know second fights always a different fight Steve bass had a year to sort of figure it out it wasn't like DC was dominating Steve Bay through it yeah yeah you can tell this an indica they're not really that shiny today Wow it's yeah yes nice day out it's friggin hot out there yesterday hit 40 degrees apparently hit record temperatures across the planet that's not good you're right oh wow yeah well good news everybody there are fighters one last night they beat the dastardly BC Lions 3825 I don't know if there's any CFL pound and out there if there are feel free to leave some comments like who's your favorite CFL team I know there's only nine but you know if anybody wants to throw in the Atlantic schooners there even though they don't exist just feel free like to see how much support they're getting I like to see how much support this week that same works oh yeah yeah yeah already quite content with this and I sort of knew that going in something spoken at the last few days yeah like happy before bed it's a very nice flavor it's not like you couldn't you get it like it does have a better that catching your throat sore though when you smoke it as a you know a stronger I would say this would be more for experienced smokers as well definitely for someone once like sitting and played video games it's not good going to the beach we know or doing anything no pain relief or like the sleep there's lots of things that could be done with this weed that aren't leaving your house I'm very drew that's so far very happy with what it's supposed to be yeah absolutely an evening weed for sure give us five minutes and we'll tell you how feels here and before still hi welcome back I mean I'm welcoming us back you know obviously you didn't see any kind break yeah we kind of melted into the couch there for a little bit that may have been a bit longer than 20 minutes actually so good weed I would say you know for sleeping pain if you want to do anything you're gonna do much wall pretty much yeah so definitely an evening weed for sure you're clearing for videogames yeah yeah so you know like if you're gonna stay in all day playing video games I wouldn't recommend that you know where people who do and there's nothing wrong with that everybody doesn't have time to talk are we on twitch should be screwing us on Twitch weekend all right so we're gonna figure out how to stream ourselves like the video gamers and yeah easily oh for sure yeah like if you buy this assuming the effect you're looking for is kind of talk very well absolutely if you're looking to stay in and do nothing all day that's definitely what what this is gonna do for you know what are our last thoughts if you have any comments feel free to leave them like and subscribe and become a poufy today", "WHR600yzbmY": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're gonna be making cannabis lemonade using powder so let's get into

marijuana concentrates have become one of the most popular forms of ingesting cannabis at the clinic we primarily stock three forms of BHO or butane hash oil produced by our expert extraction team at the lab these include butter shatter and live resin batter let's take a closer look at these three forms of concentrated cannabis products butter is a form of BHO that has an opaque warm taffy light quality this concentrate is created by extracting the cannabinoids and terpenoids ride and cured it is an oleoresin which following extraction is agitated over low heat to allow the solvent to evaporate creating a wax like non transparent extract this agitation causes THC a which is solid at room temperature to precipitate from the rest of the oil and crystallize butter has a reasonably high terpene profile as it is processed using low temperatures to preserve these sensitive flavor compounds shatter is a clear glass light concentrate that contains no bubbles and snaps at room temperature it is difficult to make due to its low heat requirement and length of time required in a vacuum oven to purge it of its solvent in shatter the cannabinoids terpenes and waxes are all mixed together in one phase and in a way that allows light to pass through the molecular structure the terpene content is typically lower in shatter as heat and vacuum contribute to the evaporation of compounds however the visual appeal of the product tends to supersede its flavor life resin batter is a terpene rich concentrate created by freezing and extracting the whole cannabis flower immediately after harvest this process preserves all the cannabinoids and turpentine the plant because the cannabis has not been dried or cured prior to extraction fewer terpenes have a chance to evaporate or degrade as a result the end product has a much stronger flavor profile because live resin contains higher levels of these liquid terpenes the final extraction tends to be more viscous than butter or shatter if you're curious for more information on cannabis concentrates or which extraction might work well for your needs please talk to your friendly budtender at the clinic today",

people living with migraine and those that are trying to help each will share their unique shade of migraine tara is committed to the goal of transforming the lives of those suffering from migraine by creating solutions to reinvent the migraine paradigm by placing people at the center of everything they do you can visit www.imtcva.org Institute gives us scientific and practical information about the use of cannabis or marijuana for treating migraine originally geared towards physicians this 20-minute presentation is chock-full of information helpful for anyone using or contemplating using cannabinoids to treat their migraine disease or chronic pain Thank You Ric for inviting me here it's been a pleasure to be part of this organization it's my second time participating and you know today I'm gonna talk about a topic that's fun but yet it's also a little controversial I grew up in the 80s so it's thinking about you know giving the title hope with dope but then I thought about stigma and decided to keep it to keep it to just cannabinoids so today I'm going to talk about criminology I'm going to talk about pharmacology I'm gonna talk about fetish pathogenesis I'm going to talk about some clinical research and as well in particular Rick asked me to talk about physician or clinician expectations and also patient expectations and they're going to briefly mention some cutting-edge research that we're doing at dent which has a large - large practice to begin with but we also are involved in medical marijuana or cannabis so basic terminology marijuana is frequently you know thought of to be a synonym for cannabis but it's not the terms are different cannabis is the botanical term for the hemp plant that contains cannabis sativa cannabis sativa is different from cannabis indica so cannabis sativa is a tall lastly branched with long and narrow leaves there's a picture of it there on the bottom right corner this provides more of the high feeling the energetic buzz feeling it's up till uplifting feeling the ratio of THC to CBD is it has more of a THC component versus CBD I'm going to explain those molecules in a second and recreational users users typically seek this train to get more of the high feeling cannabis indica comes from India it was found there in the Hindu Kush mountain range as well these are short conical dense branches with broad leaves provides more of a stoned feeling and people also use it for sedation pain relief and anxiety benefits as well there's a slightly different THC to CBD ratio and typically medical users prefer this strained over the other one in terms of history it's been around for thousands of years it's actually even mentioned in the Ebers papyrus with some use for pain related disorders but one of the earliest known use has been found in China and plant stems were used for ropes and linen flower seeds especially the resin can be sort of extracted to give psychoactive chemical properties termed cannabinoids so the different types of cannabinoids endocannabinoids are endogenous these are lipid based neurotransmitters one of the first discovered was an and amide and I'm gonna mention that a little bit later and when we talk about pathogenesis phyto cannabinoids these are the ones listed here these are come from more of a natural base and then synthetic cannabinoids either FDA approves these two in particular are FDA approved for the treatment of nausea and and severe nausea shows associated with cancer related pains these synthetic cannabinoids that are FDA approved have more of a regulation in terms of the actual compound itself versus the synthetic that are out on the street these are manufactured by chemists chemists and their chemical structure has changed there have been some warnings associated with that which I'm going to touch on a little bit later on so there are synthetic cannabinoids that are approved by FDA and then there are other ones that people buy online and their structures actually modified they are not coming from natural plants so just to know some of that terminology in terms of the pharmacology tetrahydrocannabinol was first identified in 1964 by Mechelen and by smoking in one cigarette or joint you can contain about 0.5 to 1 gram of cannabis only about 20% is absorbed in the lungs it's rapidly metabolized in the liver you can also have because of its solubility you can have accumulation and fat taking place that's why you can even detect it in the urine two weeks down the line as well oral consumption can produce prolonged but poor absorption so some people who may try something orally and don't feel the effect will keep eating and then later on they just are completely wiped out because the delayed effect more on pharmacology so there's several primary cannabinoids from cannabis so there's cannabidiol cbn caneta i'm sorry a cannabinol cannabidiol which is CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol so THC has more of the psychoactive property CBN is about one tenth of the psychoactive property as THC and CBD has no real psychoactive property adverse effects of marijuana so on the left you can see some of the short-term effects which include memory impairment motor coordination altered judgment motor vehicle accidents sometimes even psychosis and paranoia on the right side it's somewhat controversial it's debatable so I'm not going to really delve in too much into that that area is still controversial in terms of long-term effects of heavy use who uses marijuana there are patients people who use it for recreational they also use it for medical reasons and some use it for both as well now what's in marijuana marijuana contains hundreds in and maybe more different cannabinoids so here's a breakdown of several different cannabinoids CBD focusing on that in particular has several different properties antibacterial inhibits cancer cell growth nor protective benefits both promotes bone growth reduces sugar levels all these other ones that are listed here that you can see where are the cb1 receptors there are several different parts of the brain so it's a medulla which is involved which has a chemoreceptor trigger zone the cerebellum the basal ganglia cerebral cortex the hypothalamus and the hippocampus as well as a spinal cord now I like this article is published in the green journal it's not that green journal it's a different green journal and I like this because it really talks about pathogenesis and right now we we know a lot about migraine pathogenesis and we know because of the newest you know information on neuro inflammation so it's really interesting is if you look at the research that's already existing out there wood cannabinoids and where it potentially affects the receptors there's a parallel between my grandpa thought physiology as well too for example systemic effects there are variants in the CNR one gene which encodes for a cannabinoid one receptor which results in decreased expression of cb1 associated with migraines and the trigeminal vascular activation we know that the trigeminal vascular system and the trigeminal cervical complex all play a big role in migraine pathogenesis we have peripheral and central activation of those too there's been some research on people who have deficiency endocannabinoids and particularly an and amide and possibly there's a relationship between that and the pathogenesis of migraines - that's still an area that needs further research as well if you take a look at the cortex you have sebum antagonists that suppress glutamate neurotransmission by inhibiting NMDA MDA receptors you also have cb1 receptors that suppress cortical spreading depression which is a precursor for migraines in the vasculature you can see that there's some effect on blood vessels and effect on blood vessel dilation induced by cg RP as well as capsaicin midnight ro coxide in addition you have Ananda mite that is an agonist or activates trip v1 which is involved in also trigeminal vascular activation trip v1 is another area of future study it's actually being currently study in a potential target for future migraine treatments so it's exciting to see that the cannabinoid research actually parallel some of this as well there's some effect on platelets as well and when in relation to platelets there is some research with 5-hydroxytryptamine or v HT receptor ends and migraines in the brain stem so we know that there's a peripheral activation there's also a central activation of migraines which involves a sending pathways that go through the pair Iraq or dr. gray the thalamus to cortex and there's descending pathways that go down as well too and persistent activation of these pathways lead to something called allodynia which was I think mentioned earlier in some of the rat models so what's been shown as a cb1 receptor actually is involved in it with activation of the periaqueductal gray area and also the rostral event remit uh medial medulla as well so here's a quick chart that looks at all this sort of combined together this concept of endocannabinoid deficiency which some people may have a genetic predisposition to or have genetically may have that results in increased glutamate signaling which may lead to cortical spreading depression as a potential oral migraine trigger and basically what I just said is summarized in this diagram here now why is it difficult to do research because it's still listed as a schedule 1 drug including some of those other agents I know dr. goshawk back there is doing some research and he might be able to provide some insight just one on with LSD I believe so he might be able to elaborate how difficult it is to do something like that so it's not an easy process so that's one of the challenges to doing research on cannabis or cannabinoids is because of the the scheduled nature of it other research includes the current research includes in most of the trials in the USSR retrospective studies so these are you know there are no prospective trials where we actually give patients medications and follow them through but there are some European ones which I'm gonna highlight just one quick abstract on the most of the ones that are existing right now are very short not enough patience and a lot of confounding factors in those studies which include tobacco use and comorbid illness as well so I practice in New York State so right now the approved uses for medical cannabis is cancer and all these other ones that are listed the newest one that was just added not too long ago is PTSD so I actually looked up word Island and Rhode Island has a very similar approve approval for these disorders as well recently Rhode Island had a Department of Health Center advisory and this was through other states as well and this had in particular due to the synthetic cannabinoid these are produced these are you can buy these online and what some of these people that manufacture them were changing the chemical structure so they actually added something that was making it cause increase bruising it was affecting vitamin K so just to be aware of issues with synthetic cannabinoids that you can buy online there are also legal issues in these vary by states that would encourage you to look up things in your own state you can't travel out of your state for the most part you can't drive with it there's risk of DUI laws allow federal employees to fire for positive drug tests whereas there may be some protection with state employees as well and it cannot be used in certain institutions such as group homes nursing homes or hospitals so what I mentioned before some of the limitations of retrospective clinical trials is that you know there's limited data from that that we can we can use so I found something you know a recent a meeting that took place in the Amsterdam and it was some German researcher which has a little bit more liberal rules in terms of research I was a prospective study at small study where they took some migraine patients and cluster patients and initially gave them THC one group and another group had cannot CBD only they found that adequate higher doses and result in about 50 55 percent improvement in overall frequency and severity the second phase they gave the migraine patients amitriptyline and also THC CBD combination and they found an improvement as well what's interesting about this is that in the cluster headache patients the only patients that improved were the ones that had some background history of migraines as a child as well so this is a very limited study and I only have this in abstract form it's just to highlight that a prospective trial is more you know it gives us more data than a retrospective trial so just to comment about what's going on at dent the cannabis clinic these are the number of patients that we've seen so far in a in a year or a year and a half period majority the patients are being treated for chronic pain 69% approximately about 30 to 40 percent of those about 30 percent of those are chronic migraine patients this data is from doctormick vague who's one of the leading researchers on concussion and she actually has one of the largest population of concussion patients about 800 in one particular study that she's undergoing right now so in a subset of one of her studies she's actually studying in about 149 individuals with chronic pain who were certified for medical cannabis and they were given concussion related diagnosis of post concussive syndrome she was using five sort of pillar pillars as a treatment modality so these were mood sleep headache dizziness and concentration issues and what she found was that there were three of these had had more significant improvement over a period of time with medical cannabis use versus not and these were there was an 80% improvement in mood and 78% would sleep and 76% with headache so the and that's one of the findings the second important finding in this particular study so this study is published in the abstract form and it's submitted for a publication as in a journal and further analysis of this of the study are being done right now as well - so 80% of the patients experience significant improvement activity limitations symptoms emotions and quality of life this is not showing as clearly but it's showing you that there was an improvement in quality of life pre medical cannabis use was 27% post medical cannabis use it was 43% so there's an improvement it was successfully significant there's further analyses being done with this particular study so stay tuned in fact she's actually presenting this at the American Academy neurology concussion meeting that's taking place later on another finding from this study was the optimal dosing was a byproduct a combination of THC to CBD a one-to-one ratio with a combination of a tincture those three times per day and the inhalation component was a 20 to 1 ratio as a vapor pen and this is more used as an immediate relief which which is not used all the time but just more of a breakthrough pain the cost was 269 per month which is a little bit high but cost of this varies from state to state as well - and hopefully this will decrease over time the the last finding of this particular study was 14% of patients reported side effects all were minimal and all were and 70% were related to administration route whether it was dry mouth or cough so this was fairly tolerated so how do you go about doing this I mean not too many places have a cannabis clinic first you have to contact your physician they have to be certified they have to certify you and then you get registered you apply for a card you get a registration then you go to a dispensary to purchase your product so what are some provider expectations so maintenance of CBD products takes about two weeks to of regular use before patients can start to notice any relief of symptoms the change in cannabis ratios should be done in two to three month and month intervals increments cannabis is dose dependent cost-prohibitive so it does cost more the more you use so you know patients are you know they they want to minimize use and at least and get the most bang for their buck as well too so they might adjust some of their dosing on their own taste of tinctures may restrict use as well to the vaporization is contraindicated for COPD and asthma some drug interactions to be concerned about so opioids you may need to decrease the opioid dose as well - one thing to know is that some of these patients that are coming in with you the you may not feel comfortable giving the medical cabinets if there aren't a high dose of opioids so you have to coordinate with pain management to help them titrate down their dose now if you feel comfortable doing that you can do that but I think most clinicians feel more comfortable with who I was originally prescribing them to lower their dose there's a lot of active research going on now with the use of medical cannabis and getting people off of opioids so that's another area of study and is a big need for that as well - so stay tuned for that research to come out as well you may need to decrease the anxiety dose as well too tricyclic antidepressants they have sedative effects monitor increased side-effects of SSRIs anti retrovirals they may be enzyme inhibition or inducing effects related to that and seizure meds as well may need to be adjusted due to the pharmaco dynamic related changes now establishment expectations so this Dement this depends on the amount of prophylactic products the patients are going to use and their ability to afford their products a lot of the patients that we're seeing are not able to afford some of the products at the dispensaries at the rate right now so that's one of the limitations so what some of them wind up doing is they get approved they wind up using their or smoking marijuana so that's something to be aware of as well - patients may have some reduction in migraine associated symptoms but this may take time CBD maintenance so it does reduce muscle pain anxiety improve sleep the increase in tincture dose must be done slowly to prevent any adverse effects such as dizziness and drowsiness it can take about two weeks to develop any kind of consistent use of CBD to notice any positive effects once again THC provides more immediate pain relief in this is more done in the form of a vape form as well too so this is going to be important they can't take this to work they can't drive within six hours after use it will create a high and it may worsen anxiety or paranoia just a few more slides I don't know how we are on time wait okay so alright so there there's improvement that takes over time you need to set these realistic expectations for these patients this I got from the the Rhode Island Department of Health just to show you what people are doing in Rhode Island so this is the data from two thousand sixteen to seventeen there's about 4500 patients that have been being treated for chronic pain and those are some of the other indications and who's writing this in Rhode Island majority are internal medicine family medicine and not so much neurology further research needs to be done i want to thank dr. laszlo Metzler who is leading the campaign at dent doctormick Vig who provided some of the research data on the concussion and Cheryl Lyon who is a nurse practitioner who's very much involved with patient

"W0sPCDGvBKk": "hello everyone and welcome to wustream bringing willamette to you for today's presentation dr daniel nicolai will discuss the effects of marijuana on the brain dr nikolai was born and raised in oregonian he completed his general psychiatry residency at oregon health and science university and then went on to become a child and adolescent psychiatry fellow at the university of colorado denver before returning home training in those two states we can only imagine how many of his patients used marijuana in fact seeing so much marijuana use in his clinical practice is what sparked his interest in the effect that this drug has on the brain he has given several talks on the subject at community health centers advocacy groups schools and he even testified before a colorado congressional committee on marijuana legislation he just completed his training in forensic psychiatry at ohsu last summer and has elected to continue working there as a member of the faculty thanks for joining us today dr nikolai i'll turn the presentation over to you hi thanks for that introduction and i'm very excited to be here with you all to talk about a subject that i find fascinating and that's you know cannabis and it's in fact its effect on the brain and i have a lot of material to get through so i'm going to dive right in to go yep there goes so i have no financial disclosures to make no conflicts of interest i would like to mention though i i do work at ohsu as a faculty member but i'm not here representing oregon health and science university i'm here talking about my own research my own interests and my own expertise not representing my institution so here's what we're going to talk about today i'm going to talk a little bit about how marijuana is researched or how it's not researched and how other drugs are researched we're going to talk about the epidemiology of marijuana mainly who's using it and how much we're going to explore how marijuana consumption has evolved it's changed a lot over the past few decades we're gonna look at of course the name of the talk how cannabis and marijuana affect the developing brain at key areas of development and then we'll talk about some of the evidence-based uses for medical cannabis what we do with it and what the research shows it can and cannot do so how is marijuana researched so this is not how marijuana is researched this is how a typical pharmaceutical drug is researched and brought to market there's four phases of clinical trials that a medication has to go through to become fda approved and stay fda approved so before a drug even enters these phases uh you have to do you know kind of design the drug test it on animals kind of get your best sense of if it's working if it's safe and then you move on to phase one and that's where you take a handful of volunteers that are young and healthy you give them small amounts of the drug and you watch them 24 hours a day and make sure that it's safe and you're only looking for safety at this point is the drug safe so most of the time in fact the drugs are safe 70 past this test then you go on to phase two and this is where we start kind of giving more doses of the medication of the drug to you know research subjects human research subjects volunteers and now we're looking you know is it efficacious does this drug work you know if it's supposed to lower the blood pressure does it actually lower the blood pressure and this is a tougher task to pass right only about one third make it through both phase um one and phase two so most drugs don't make it past phase two if you make it past phase two and do pretty well you go on to phase three and drug companies are reluctant to go to this phase because it costs a lot of money you know it costs about a billion dollars to bring a drug to market and a lot of it is in phase three this is where you do huge studies thousands of human subjects usually multiple sites all over the country often all over the world they take years to complete we when you hear you know that a drug works in 30 minutes or less or something like that that's based on this research once they pass phase three and show that it's effective and it's safe they can request approval approval from the fda and start you know prescribe doctors can start prescribing it to the masses and they can start advertising it and such however the drug companies aren't out of the woods yet there's phase four clinical trials where they have to um make sure it's safe for side effects sometimes they have to add additional warnings and investigate you know potential side effects that the medication is causing and then um sometimes a drug gets pulled from the market altogether because they find out it's not safe after the fact so drugs go through a lot of tests and a lot of research before they're brought to market now for marijuana we haven't done any of that and the reason for that is on this slide so medications if they have a potential for abuse or addiction they get classified by the drug enforcement agency so they get placed on a schedule so you see schedule one medications are illegal to prescribe right because they have no medicinal qualities and a lot of potential for abuse independence so drugs in this category heroin lsd this is acid ecstasy kod and you see marijuana right there you go down to schedule two and these are pretty tightly controlled um so these are like you know the big pain pills like oxycontin vicodin the stimulants like adderall and ritalin and i thought this was interesting methamphetamine is a schedule two medication so i cannot prescribe marijuana but i can prescribe methamphetamine and the first time i gave this talk i went ahead and looked this up like gosh is that on the formula can i prescribe methamphetamine that is so bizarre and here it is right now so kids six or older with adhd a very common diagnosis can't be prescribed methamphetamine legally i doubt any drug companies actually make this drug i've never seen it prescribed and even simple obesity if you're 12 years or older you can be prescribed methamphetamine can you imagine taking your maybe husky 12 year old into the doctor who's having trouble focusing and he's like oh he's overweight and has adhd let's get that kid some meth it's um a bizarre thing how some of these medications are scheduled through the dea all right on to epidemiology um and of course uh if you guys can guess who this is i played with the effects to make it a little bit tough but i think a lot of you can probably still see that this is barack obama allegedly it wasn't photoshopped so i'm going to talk about who uses marijuana and how much i'm going to start with some national data there's two kind of big national surveys they do this is from the 2018 national survey by samsa which is um the big government agency that funds substance abuse and mental health uh resources so i'm gonna go through a lot of charts a lot of figures i really just want to drive home the highlights and so this slide you know people aged 12 or older a lot of them use marijuana right 43.5 million people which is about 16 of the population and of course this is a national survey so it considers you know marijuana an illegal drug and marijuana dwarfs use of any other illegal drug by far as you can see all right and how many have used in the past year and what age grew so this is people aged uh 12 and older and you see they break it down the blue line here is 18 to 25 year olds and you will see that as a theme that 18 to 25 year olds are the most or the group that uses marijuana the most and if you look here kids age 12 to 17 is the gray line that is quite similar to just adults 26 and older the yellow line so kids and adults outside that 18 to 25 year old range are using marijuana at about the same rate so this is pastor marijuana initiates so who what age are people starting marijuana or trying it for the first time and this is probably one slide where it's not the 18 to 25 year olds it's the 12 17 year olds it's the teenagers and even kids are a little bit younger is when most people start marijuana it's kind of starting to collapse here a little but still it's mostly the 12 to 17 year olds so and now i'm going to talk about another trend which is that people aren't perceiving marijuana as um as dangerous so they kind of surveyed you know do you think this is you know a harmful thing to do smoke marijuana on a weekly basis that's the red line you can see most people said no and this is um for youth this is age 12 to 17 about 40 percent of people thought that marijuana uh smoking marijuana weekly was a bad thing to do um and you can see other drugs are higher cocaine heroin you know frequent alcohol and cigarette use you go to adults age 18 to 25 and you see this line gets cut in half so about half as many people age 18 to 25 see smoking marijuana as a problem compared to those that are younger i'll flip it back so 12 to 17 year olds about 40 that red line there and then about 20 or less for 18 to 25 year olds and this is people who have developed marijuana use disorder so that's you know there's 11 criteria to get diagnosed with the substance use disorder it's things like spending too much money on marijuana spending too much time trying to get it it causes you problems in your life but you still keep doing it etc etc you build up a tolerance you suffer withdrawal when you stop using it suddenly um and you can see again 18 to 25 year olds um about six percent of them marijuana use disorder all right it wouldn't be a bunch of charts and graphs without a good old venn diagram so you see the big blue circle here these are youths age 12 17 who had a major depressive episode so lots of youth have major depressive episodes for lots of reasons why the blue dot is the big one the yellow circle here is youths who had a substance use disorder and this isn't specific to marijuana um but this is kind of the data that was available and you can see a big chunk of this yellow circle has had a major depressive episode right 40 of it so if i have a kid comes in who you know uses marijuana heavy to the point where it's a problem that's a substance use disorder and he's at high risk he or she's at high risk of having a major depressive episode there's a big overlap there all right and these graphs kind of get confusing but so this is age 12-17 and you can see you know about 32 percent of youths had a major depressive episode and you know used illicit drugs about 14 of youths did not have a major depressive episode but use drugs and you can see kind of with all these substance use most of them have had major depressive episodes so people who use drugs tend to have major depressive episodes um you know in this age group and this trend is true also for adults age 18 or older right the red one here is no mental illness the dark blue one is any mental illness and then the biggest one in about every group is serious mental illness so adults with serious mental illnesses to use marijuana at higher rates and this is where i get in my soapbox and talk about the need for better substance use treatment right about 15 of 18 to 25 year olds need substance to use treatment again this is not specific to marijuana it's a substance use in general and here's the people who actually enroll in substance use treatment right 2 so we need 15 and we have two percent so people don't have access to treatment it's it's very unfortunate all right let's switch over to data from good old state of oregon so this is you know the olcc oregon liquor commission tracks how much revenue is brought in by um the cannabis dispensaries and um so you can see this is you know sold per month so about 60 million dollars we've grown um 60 million dollars per month of sales and you can see it's just skyrocketed over the years and even more so if you're looking at units sold this is the cost of marijuana over time so we're making more and more money and selling it cheaper in the industry um right the price is cut in half and this is for a usable marijuana which is kind of the dried flour that you smoke the bud essentially all right so daily marijuana use in teens and this is a dif this is national data again and this is from a different you know kind of survey they do every year called the monitoring the future survey so you can see eighth graders that went from point seven to one point three percent almost doubled in the course of one year and that's you know daily use not kids have used at all but eighth graders who are using marijuana on a daily basis tenth graders that also took a pretty significant jump to almost 5 in 2019 now if you look at daily use of marijuana people are using it more than they ever have before so back in the 1990s a typical kind of like pothead or stoner would smoke a joint on saturday and sunday and that was um you know what we'd consider a pothead back then and marijuana back then it's laughable now it was about four percent thc and that was pretty strong stuff back then it tend to average more around two or three percent um so you know you have a couple joints saturday and sunday that comes out to about 4.6 milligrams of thc consumed you know on a daily basis on you know up for a seven day week now this is data a few years old in the state of washington the typically daily user smokes are consumed marijuana multiple times per day and average thc is about 20 i imagine it's it's higher now especially for daily users i'll have some slides to show on that later and so that was about 1.3 grams per day of 20 thc was the statistic a few years ago so that comes out to about 260 milligrams of thc consumed each and every day so went from 4.6 daily back in the 90s to now or even a couple years ago 260 milligrams so i'll do the math for you that's an increase of about 60 fold so to put that in other terms if you think of caffeine you know caffeine is not harmful in small amounts you have a cup of coffee every day there's even some research that shows that people who do that live a little bit longer than people who don't drink coffee um right so that's about 150 milligrams of caffeine per day is a vendi cappuccino at starbucks you increase that by 60 fold that's 9 000 milligrams of caffeine if you just said hey i'm gonna alter concentrated stuff i'm gonna take this more right it's natural no harm um that's a lethal dose of caffeine that's enough drug to kill you so when people say marijuana it's been around for years it's natural that's not necessarily true right it's highly genetically modified it's way more potent than it's ever been it's not organic it's they use pesticides um which is you know the biggest infraction that companies get is for misuse of pesticides or not using them correctly um yeah and if you did the same thing with caffeine that would kill you so we don't really know what this high amount of frequent use of thc does to the brain and so this is kind of a confusing slide this is each line is a different study here so just look at the black one that's the average and this shows the trend that people who use more days per year so those that use every day use more each day right so if you just smoke every once in a while maybe just socially you might just take a couple puffs if you're smoking every day you're often smoking high potency stuff eating it dabbing it whatever doing a lot of it each day so these are the people where the research shows we have some reason for concern that if you're using a lot and you're consuming it every day um your brain can be in trouble and this is the trend that we're seeing more and more people do right marijuana is okay to use it's not harmful so i'm going to use it all day every day and here's kind of that same line they did some fancy math to make a nice smooth line based on their data and you see it's up to 1.75 grams per day the the statistic i gave you on the slide was 1.3 grams per day right and so many people use much much more than that right and then of course vaping is just exploding right this is monthly marijuana vaping you see that almost doubled among high school seniors um in the last year and of course the cigarette companies have not changed uh their ads right here's an old cigarette ad and here's a new um julian or vaping ad and just a little bit on my high horse about vaping that's really exploded we were kind of winning the war on tobacco for many years um teenagers were smoking less and less the rates were going down until vaping and flavor vaping came out and it's just exploded right so you know about 20 to 25 of high school students at various ages um had vaped in the last month according to this survey all right so really the main takeaways i want you guys to get from all those charts and graphs i spent all that time was is that people are using cannabis and marijuana more frequently than ever before they're using formulations that are more powerful and more potent than ever before and they're starting to use it at younger and younger ages right often 12 to 17 which is of concern for me right because i'm a child and analyst and psychiatrist so i talk to kids about this [Music] a lot so what exactly is marijuana so the marijuana plant is down here on the bottom left there are two species of the marijuana there's cannabis sativa and cannabis indica and so the indica is supposed to be the chill one that helps you stay calm they say indica keeps you in the couch and sativa is a more stimulating strain is what people report so the most common way to consume marijuana is to kind of take the leaves you dry them up roll them up and you put this and you smoke it with a flame and a joint this here is called hashish this comes from the middle of the plant and they used to throw this part away because you couldn't really dry it out and smoke it all that well and then they figured out hey there's tons of psychoactive compound in there let's kind of make it into clay make it into oil make it into all these other formulations of it so we're using the whole plant now this up here on the top left is a hemp plant so hemp it's a different species of plant it also contains cbd and thc and there is a law that you can sell hemp products uh as long as they have less than one percent thc in them so when you go to the grocery store and just see there's cbd or even a doggy daycare we used to take my dog sold cbd products those are hemp derived there is kind of a loophole on the law where they can sell cbd derived from hemp without any kind of restrictions like you'd see in the dispensary the cbdc dispensary comes from the marijuana plants all right so how can you do it well you can smoke it in a vape pen you can smoke it in a joint a bong this is what it looks like this was the strongest strain at the dispensary i went to a few years ago when i took pictures about two three years ago you can eat it right and these look delicious i took pictures of the ones that looked the most delicious to me especially the s'mores i'm a sucker for s'mores dark colored cherry always good throw some cbd in there and of course the peanut butter buddha with the fun little cartoon guy here and then something that really took me back to my childhood was the pop rocks right let's throw some marijuana in them and call them pop rocks it is interesting to note that there are a lot of laws that have been passed uh in states that have legalized cannabis that you can't have packaging that's appealing to children right so in my mind all this has to go even the pot rocks right pot roxy you know it's the rocks with an x there's an exclamation point it's brightly colored i mean how are you going to make and package candy that's not appealing to kids it's pretty much impossible and since marijuana has been legalized and edibles have been popular there are more and more reports of kids small kids like ages two three four coming to the emergency department um with cannabis intoxication um that require emergent treatment all right you go and eat it you can drink it put a little pep in your coffee this is a little five hour energy type drink the cocktails look great especially this bloody mary here with the bacon and everything you can put it topically directly on your skin here's tinctures here's kind of a coconut oil infused lotion type thing patches you can put on your skin and then of course there are the concentrated oils and this is a formulation i really want to spend some time talking about this is the most potent and the strongest way to consume cannabis this is called dabbing this is a dab rig and the bud tender told me when i went to visit the dispensary what you do is you take a grain of a drop of the concentrated oil this is about 100 this is pretty much pure thc you take a little drop of that oil or they happen in waxes and other formulations you put it here on the rig heat it up and you smoke it in out the other side i'll show you a little video and one little drop the grain of the rice is more powerful than a joint it it will get you very intoxicated so you can imagine people that haven't done it before or just pour a little bit too much maybe the size of two grains of rice maybe they don't know what kind of rice the butter was talking about and they can get you know very very intoxicated and even psychotic where they lose touch with reality they get paranoid there were some high-profile cases in colorado um when it first became legalized where people kind of consumed too much cannabis and a kid um became psychotic lost touch with reality thought that like aliens were out to get him or something and he jumped off a bridge and died so there is potential harm especially um when you're consuming or dabbing as they call it right so ask your kids indeed and i work with kids and i ask them kind of every time they come this is dad use marijuana if you use some marijuana how much do you use and do you dab do you eat you know and most kids or dabbing these days that i talked to that used marijuana or at least tried it and it it really messes it can really mess you up here's the advertisement for one of the ones at the dispensary i went to so concentrated one little jar can smell like you're in a whole room full of your favorite strain this is for everyone who can't get enough of their favorite strain a concentrate with all the aroma all the flavor and all the effects only far more powerful and they are not false advertising there this is powerful powerful stuff and of course it's getting more and more popular again we're back to data from our good old state of oregon this was somewhere in california are in colorado and washington data and i imagine california too so this again is revenue by thousands of dollars and the different types so the most popular is the usable marijuana flower which is kind of like the dried bud that people smoke that's where dispensaries get most of their money but again look at what has towered into second to clear second place is the concentrates the extracts the dabbing the oils the waxes that are you know oftentimes 100 um thc or close to that and then you can see the edible tinctures here not terribly picking up steam or making that much money and then this nice orange line which is other and i know you guys are wondering dr nikolai what what is other what does that other line mean well let's talk about that so if you're not into any of the other formulations that i've shown you so far they have suppositories these can be placed in the rectum or in the vagina and the blood tender told me that people use these maybe if they have rectal or vaginal cancer and they want to get some marijuana or cbd right to the site of injury and this is a marijuana-soaked tampon for anyone who might be interested in consuming thc that way so i was like man people really love marijuana especially in colorado when i did my training there this was a small mountain town right i had no idea where the next gas station was but i knew dang sure where the closest dispensary was and it was about 100 miles away from this one and also so when kovid uh the governor of colorado issued the shelter-in-place orders for covet a few months ago people flocked to the dispensaries um right big lines no one was wearing masks right you couldn't get them yet businesses weren't set up to socially distance and so they were really worried that people were gonna you know spread covid like this so of course the governor announced immediately okay dispensaries you're an essential business you can stay open people don't need to flock to them right away and then if that's not proof enough that people love cannabis here is a personal lubricant infused with thc so for people that love marijuana so much they want to have sex with it it turns out there's a way to do that and that people are doing it because this is a product for sale all right let's talk about what cannabis does to the brain so there's you know about 100 different cannabinoid compounds or chemicals in the marijuana plant and then hundreds of other chemicals that they've isolated you know around 400 or so it seems like more and more each year and so here's kind of a breakdown of some of the different ones and kind of what we think they do and what might be therapeutic and it is important to note that your brain does have natural endogenous cannabinoids so endogenous is just a fancy word for hormones so kind of as a hormone in your brain there are cannabinoids that bind to the same receptors as thc the plant form of thc and your brain has cannabinoid binding sites throughout it and it's interesting you know a few decades ago we didn't even know this existed in the brain so all the little yellow dots are where um binding sites where thc uh combined or the you know the natural hormone cannabinoids can bind and you can see it affects things like the pleasure reward pathway which is you know highly correlated with addiction it can affect memory coordination i mean pretty much everything in the brain except for vision right your vision kind of stays the same judgment right lots of stuff so your brain is made up of a bunch of neurons so this neurons is how your brain kind of sends signals from one area to the next and this is kind of what they look like obviously they're much smaller than this so signals come from over here i'm assuming you guys can see the mouse i'm hoping that they come from the yellow end they go down the sheath and it's kind of like traveling through a wire in your house so they're they're insulated right so if you had a wire in your house that wasn't insulated it was just a metal wire and you were trying to light a light bulb that wouldn't be very efficient you would lose a lot of energy in heat um and right you can even start a fire or something like that it's just not an efficient way so the neurons in your body need to be insulated they need this insulation to send signals and information um you know so you can move your arm and have a thought that sort of thing from one area of the brain to the next and so it sends it from one to the other neurons and you know the message you know gets propagated and expanded and right each of these neurons send it to 100 more and do 100 more etc so this is kind of what one zoomed in looks like it goes from this end sends the information along this long myelin sheath to the other end and these are kind of fat pads that insulated the schwann cells so um let's talk about thc and cbd so thc is the more psychoactive compound cbd is less psychoactive you will hear people most of the time including physicians say that cbd is not psychoactive that is a misnomer cbd it works on the brain right that's why people take it because they want an effect on the brain drugs and medications that work on the brain are psychoactive it is much less psychoactive than thc but it is still psychoactive thc binds directly to those cannabinoid receptors right little yellow dots on the brain that i showed you a few minutes ago cbd does not bind to those and that is very confusing right a compound called cannabidiol does not bind to the cannabinoid receptors i think sometimes they make this information so hard and confusing so they can charge a lot of money for medical school so cbd has several effects on the brain and there's lots of theories to how it works but it does work on the brain and here are kind of some of the things we're figuring out it does works on serotonin receptors in the brain glycine receptors um fatty acid receptors um it works as a potent antioxidant which i'll talk about a little bit later so we're kind of learning about cbd and figuring out how it works in the brain it's not a direct binder to the site but it works indirectly to increase how your brain uses the natural hormone cannabinoids that are there so when we research cbd in animals here's what we're finding some promise or what we kind of hope it will do so in mice you can order medical mice uh from the store you can call them say hey i want you know 100 mice with anxiety and 100 mice without they can send them to your lab they're all genetically identical and you can experiment on them give them cannabis or other drugs so in rats it seems in mice it seems to um reduce anxiety maybe it reduces some depression-like behaviors um enhances social behaviors which we're hoping to translate to autism and then you know reduce some addictive potential and again this is in mice and so there's a lot of research that we do in mice and then try to do it on humans and we don't get the same effects right only a third of drug trials make it past um one and two right phases one and two so this is a slide i always show and usually there's a doctor in the crowd or something like this but if you can think of a medication any medication that has a lot of uses you know kind of like the pepto-bismol commercial where it's like bobbing upset stomach diarrhea i'm right there's three indications right there um one i think about a lot of is prozac or fluoxetine which um you know depression obsessive compulsive disorder generalized anxiety disorder panic attacks aggression and autism um you know so you probably think about six seven eight uses for it and that's a lot for medication so you can do eight different things if we look at marijuana it has a vast number of indications that um states have legalized it for medically right so this is just a state of organ you can use medical marijuana for cancer glaucoma uh neurological conditions hiv um any condition that causes cachexia which is like wasting syndrome you're you're not eating you're losing weight that sort of thing wasting away severe pain severe nausea seizures and muscle spasms like those seen in multiple sclerosis and then also post-traumatic stress disorder which many states have legalized the use of cannabis for then if you look you know throughout the us i mean the indications are growing more and more and some of them i'm not even sure how they could have an effect right like pancreatitis parkinson's disease alzheimer's disease anorexia i mean it's really turning into a drug that can cure all our all ales even though there's not really research into most of these conditions certainly not the level of research that would be required for any other medication so if we look at you know where there is some research to treat um things from marijuana or marijuana derivatives um there is actually some good uses right so there are some medications that treat nausea that are you know synthetic analogs of thc so they took the compound thc they made a similar compound and bang got it fda approved and it's actually been approved for a while for decades and it it kind of works for nausea and appetite stimulant and that is approved by the fda in um in the united states so for specificity and pain like seen in ms this there's a thc analog that's not available in the us but about 17 other countries including some european ones where they use a synthetic thc uh to treat chronic pain and then recently um they take cbd and pharmaceutical companies purify it and make pharmaceutical grade cbd pills that can use to be treat seizures and that is fda approved in the united states there's some promising research right like cbd looks like it has some anti-inflammatory antioxidant effects that can be beneficial looks like it in certain types of tumors it could have a nice impact and you know some evidence that can be helpful for the symptoms and problems that cause glaucoma and you see i'm a psychiatrist so i live over here in the you know this realm here where there's really not good research showing that cannabis helps these conditions long term what we tend to see is that people in the short term you know they start doing cannabis oh it helps my ptsd and they say that for a couple months if we follow them out however like a year later they're not really any significantly better and a lot of the times they're worse and people that don't turn to cannabis or rely on cannabis as a medication for these psychiatric problems are better off than those who don't and again that's observational research it's not as good as we hope but that's that's the correlation that we see that's the connection that we see and here are just the names of some of the synthetic thcs um right epiduolex is the new cbd that's available i'll just fly through that in the interest of time and here's a little video about a family's experience with medical marijuana that i want to show all right um so yeah there are a lot of people who are very passionate about marijuana and cannabis and or um you know really tell your story this is really life-changing for me most of the cases i've come across that it hasn't had much of an effect a lot of parents get desperate they try cbd oils and they don't really see much improvement and then of course there's these kind of handful of cases that i see mostly in the media um where it's been life-changing and so this is some researchers i met with when i was preparing first time i gave this talk at the university of colorado denver where i did some of my training and they were researching kind of just what we saw there does the not the pharmaceutical grade cannabidiol but the the cannabidiol oils um that you can get at the dispensaries does that help you know reduce seizures and what they were finding was that yes parents would report yes my kids having less seizures since i started taking these oils from the dispensary however when they hook the kids up to the eeg monitors where they put you know all the chords on the brain and measure the brainwave activity and the kids were having the same number of seizures as before they started the um the cannabinoid oils so uh kind of the research hasn't shown that the oils you get from the dispensary are helpful however you get you know parents it's 85 it's life-changing we need to continue it so it's really important to kind of take it case by case especially because there's a lack of good research we don't have big studies on this all right so there's two times in our lives where our brain is really susceptible to marijuana one is when we're developing in the uterus of our mother and the other time is adolescence so i'm going to start with kind of in utero development when you know we're developing fetus so this again is animal research but phonatal is kind of the rat term for prenatal so before you're born you're developing your mom's stomach and this axis here is um how many uh cannabinoid receptors you have in the brain so you can see the two structures here the copis colossum and the fornix have a lot of cbd cb1 binding sites in utero and then those go down over time and then the cerebellum and hippocampus and the teenage years have a lot of binding sites so your brain has the most binding sites for cannabis the prenatal period and the teenage period so you know there's different views on this you'll see in the media this is the stoner mom she has a fairly popular blog she calls herself the booboo kissing classroom volunteering primrose stoned supermom sent it next to you at school pickup and here was um one of her posts about pot and the breastfeeding mom here's a familiar refrain studies on marijuana using mothers and their breast-fed babies are few and far between like pot and pregnancy there are some things people just don't want to touch perhaps decriminalization would have an impact on the availability of studies and we could ditch the archaic anti-reagan bullshit of the 1980s and move into the future or not whatever breastfeeding i'm a fan without totally outing myself i will say that i am somewhat of a closeted hippie so kind of her take on it and is true that there's not really research showing that breast feeding your baby um while smoking marijuana is harmful for the baby but that study also doesn't exist and you can imagine that study will never exist in high quality research because no parent is going to say oh here take my baby give it some cannabis which we do know it enters the breast milk and you know can get into the baby's brain and just tell me if it's good or bad uh you know no ethics committee is going to approve that study it's never going to happen so the labeling and warnings we see on marijuana in the state of oregon right you know you have to be 21 don't let children do it don't operate you know machinery doesn't say anything about pregnant or nursing mothers that should be advised stay away from it alcohol right pregnant women don't do it can cause birth defects tobacco right they have to put this label fetal injury premature birth and low birth weight marijuana has no such label like that in the state of oregon this is the position statement of the american college of obstetrics and gynecologists you know pregnancy doctors ob gyn and you know they kind of say we don't have the data so we say stop using marijuana while you're pregnant and i will say in medical school i was shocked this is the area of medicine that is probably the most conservative any risk that may be over zero percent to an unborn child is unacceptable in this country and this area of medicine right like i've seen don't do hot yoga even though you know there's not really research shane is harmful i've seen doctors recommend you know don't eat sushi don't eat soft cheeses don't eat sandwich meats you know don't jump on a trampoline i mean being pregnant is just a giant list of things not to do because there may be a fraction of a percent chance that it could be harmful to the baby and it's hard to i'm a psychiatrist right it's hard to inspire behavioral change in anyone except when they're pregnant people comply people will do anything you tell them and to say that marijuana which you know there is some research showing that it may be harmful to young infants and pregnant women um and people are kind of ignoring that or saying the research isn't good enough or just um kind of even thinking it's helpful or can be used as medicine during pregnancy or for children it's it it makes me nervous so from research on animal studies uh we know that you know when we give the mother um thc about 10 of it gets into the fetal um you know the blood of the fetus of the developing baby and we know that the endocannabinoid system right that's a natural system in your brain that has receptors and you have hormones that bind to those sites like we talked about earlier those start developing about 16 to 22 days after conception which is about the time um you find out you're pregnant if you're actively tracking if it's a boobs baby which about half of babies are you probably wouldn't even notice that and this kind of fancy terms is pretty much the brain and central nervous system which are developing and have binding sites already for cannabinoid which can be altered by um you know thc and non-natural or non you know brain um cannabinoids that are different than um the ones that your brain naturally makes so from the plant not from within the brain itself so the research on humans of course is flawed one it's illegal to research cannabis because it's a federal crime so we can't get federal money for it and hospitals can lose their federal funding if they research it and when we just look at observational data and kind of see what people are doing you know there's difference in socioeconomic status how much money people make how educated they are you know all the million other things going on in people's lives that we have to try to control for which is difficult in research like this but kind of what we what some correlations we are finding is that you know if if pregnant women use marijuana their kids will have uh more likely to have lower processing speeds and that's kind of a majority part of the measure of iq where it's exactly what it sounds like how quickly you can process information and also lower visual problem solving which is um kind of problem solving anything other than numbers and letters so doing puzzles reading a map um that sort of thing and when we looked at a big meta analysis meta-analysis means um they pool a bunch of other studies together the data to kind of have like one giant pool of information and draw conclusions from that that you know infants that were exposed to cannabis uh in the uterus you know have lower birth weight they were more likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and a higher stillbirth rate right but or in the state of oregon we don't see these warnings on the label and you know i have another slider move but pregnant women are using this more and more you know using cannabis for um like morning sickness and nausea and stuff during pregnancy because they again there's not a lot of research or warning labels and because of the lack of information a lot of people see it as safe all right so let's move on to adolescents teenagers um population that i work with a lot so the brain develops until about the age of 25 and that's kind of the number we've called it for most people that's about the the adult rain i mean the brain develops throughout your life but about 25 you have pretty much an adult brain so as it's developing through those teenage years it's very important to take good care of it what's going on during maturation is what we call pruning and this is a term we stole from gardeners so you can see if i was pruning this little plant here i would cut off cut it here and cut it here because i want the plant to grow up and grow tall so all the nutrients all the energy i want to it to go into making a nice tall plant i don't want these little side things so your brain your neurons do the same thing they make these pathways and when you're you know about 12 to 13 when you're in middle school your brain has more neurons than it ever will and it starts kind of cutting them away it starts pruning right if you if you're kind of learning a second language and doing a lot of you know so you're you speak english and you're trying to learn spanish too those pathways were developed during those years and spanish will probably be your best language other than your primary language throughout your life right if you try to learn a second language at the age of 50 it's going to be a lot harder because that language center in your brain has pruned and the connections have been made and to go back and change that later the brain can do it the brain is pretty amazing but it is much more difficult and with modern technology we can actually see these pathways in the brain which is very exciting this is kind of the new area of research in the brain we used to just look at the structures and kind of measure how big they were and maybe we could see how much blood flow they got which wasn't all that exciting but now we can see these strands and how different parts of the brains are connected and how it sends information from one structure to another right it travels along axons like we talked about earlier and this is kind of like the superhighway of the brain how information is transferred here's a study they did um when i looked at kind of people who started using in their teenage years heavy amounts of cannabis on a regular basis versus people who didn't use cannabis at all so this top one here is people who didn't use cannabis at all and you can see kind of like if you're thinking of this as like a wire nice tight connection can signal and send information efficiently and quickly nice um it's a nice looking connection there if you look down here with the heavy marijuana users it doesn't myelinate it doesn't insulate kind of the the neurons well so it's kind of like a frayed cord here where it doesn't send the information as quickly between these two parts of the brain so kind of with this imaging we can kind of see what it's doing in the brain and the result of that um you know one of the things we we think we know right the research isn't great but that it has an impact on cognition or iq intelligence quotient so this was kind of a neat study that started way back in the 70s um i started with a thousand people and you can see um the total of these numbers is how many participants they left with at the end it was only about 60 so most people dropped out or were lost to follow up which happens a lot with substance use research but you can see the most profound effect here um was the side of the graph so this side is um people that started using marijuana in adolescence and we're still frequently using through the age of 35 right here's their iq as a child and their iq is an adult so it dropped about eight points which is a big drop in iq iq you can see the average here is about 100 um for the average adult and the standard deviation is 15. so you're going to 85 and then when you go down to 70 that's the cutoff for intellectual disability which used to be called a mental retardation so a drop of eight points is you know over half the standard deviations that's a big drop in iq um you can see people who started as kids but kind of gave it up you know maybe had a drop when these lines overlap we can't really stay with confidence that this change is statistically significant um and you see people that wait until adult to smoke marijuana wasn't much of a change um one way or the other so really the people that i worry about are you know they start as kids just teenagers and they smoke a lot throughout adolescence and there's other reasons to be concerned too so right so this is you know people who use cannabis often before they turn age 30 i'm sorry before they turn 17 what do they look like later when they become 30 years old you know they're more likely to suffer from addiction to cannabis right so as we go from left to right these are people that use more and more cannabis so less than monthly monthly or more weekly or more and then daily so daily users are the most likely to be dependent on it again that's not surprising um those that are more likely to use other illegal drugs right and then those that are likely to attempt suicide these are people i see a lot in psychiatric hospitals you know less likely to complete high school less likely to get a degree interestingly in this study there wasn't an increase in depression although other studies do show that correlation and a little bit more likely to be on welfare now your risk of getting cannabis associated psychosis and remember i said psychosis is losing the brain losing touch with reality so you're really paranoid you're worried like aliens are out to get you you're hearing voices that aren't real they're telling you to do things uh kind of losing touch with reality and so you know the more times you've used cannabis the more likely you are to get a psychotic episode um from cannabis intoxication right like once the number hits over 50 it goes to you know close to 30 cases per thousand you know almost doubles um and this is canada use cannabis use that um can lead to schizophrenia and schizophrenia is psychosis the brain loses touch with reality but it's a lifelong disease where your brain is chronically losing touch with reality and you need treatment with antipsychotics which can be nasty medications um and even then sometimes it doesn't get rid of the psychosis all the way it just kind of lowers it dampens it down so you can see um and this one i looked at a specific gene in the body right the akt1 gene and so those that didn't have the gene um you know cannabis didn't really seem to increase the risk of schizophrenia those that had one copy of the gene the same story those had two copies of the gene bang you know seven times more likely to get schizophrenia if they used um cannabis on a regular basis they use it every day so everyone's brain is different some people can smoke high levels of cannabis and it doesn't really seem to have a negative effect on their brain some people smoke it just a couple times and they really lose it and they really can't handle it especially if they dab or use one of the more potent formulations so that's important to talk about with patients that hey everyone's brain is different you might not be able to tolerate it you might most of the kids i see in the hospital as you can imagine can't tolerate it and it's kind of tough to get them to stop and here's another kind of schizophrenia-like psychosis at the age of 26 you know and these are you know did you use cannabis before the age of 18 i'm sorry before the age of 18 years old so if you use cannabis before the age of 18 you were 1.6 times more likely to develop a schizophrenia like psychosis if you started using cannabis before the age of 15 you're four and a half times more likely than the general population to develop schizophrenia like psychosis so one thing i often do is say please please please do not use cannabis for at least a couple years when i have you know 12 13 14 year olds coming into my office i talk about using marijuana if the most i can do is get them to delay it a year or a couple years or at least until they're 18. preferably 25 um i can protect their brain and really ready to make a big impact that's what i try to do um and the effect of high potency cannabis on psychosis right so skunk is um kind of just a term for um a crossbreed that is highly potent cannabis so people that smoke skunk daily right you can see those that develop cannabis 5.4 times more likely than those that have never used cannabis and even using it just on weekends right increases your risk or just even skunk at all right and the low potency ones don't really seem to have any effect at all and someone talk a little bit of research that goes the other way there's not a lot of it but this person was at the national cannabis summit that i attended and he was doing a study in new mexico where he was looking at people with that were addicted to pain pills and had chronic pain and the ones that used cannabis um reported a higher quality of life a better social life they were able to do more activity even with their chronic pain and they reported that they had better concentration um and they also tracked like how many prescriptions they refilled for their you know controlled pain meds and people who smoke cannabis didn't need you know the opiates the morphine that stuff didn't need it as often and a lot of them were even able to get off their their prescription pain killers um the ones that used cannabis so you know he kind of concluded that you know canvas might be a safer and better drug for chronic pain than a lot of the other stuff we have out there we don't have good medications for chronic pain and some of them that do tend to get used are harmful so this is a good i would love this to be a good area of study for cannabis i love better medications for that not to be totally cynical i hope that there will be um more research forthcoming this is the abcd study clever little name where there this is a couple years into the study they took 10 000 kids um you know starting at age 10 and they're going to follow them you know for a decade and they're going to do multiple scans of their brain they're going to ask them how much substances they use how much trauma they've experienced and kind of how well they're functioning and what's going on in their life and we should have a tremendous amount of data from that again we're probably about you know eight or nine years from from getting that data back but uh i'm looking forward to that hopefully come back in ten years and tell you all the stuff uh that's changed or that we've learned at that point so this is my last slide these are my take-home messages there's a growing public perception that cannabis is not harmful and you know usage is increasing animal models tell us that cannabis likely impacts the developing brain during the fetal and adolescent times human research on you know how cannabis affects the brain structure it's flawed um but kind of some of the preliminary stuff is showing that there is cause for concern especially in people who use large amounts starting at a young age and use it frequently um you know there is some good research and studies and even indications for marijuana and seizures chronic pain um not so much research for like ptsd and other psychiatric disorders even though that's you know some of the most common uses for it and there's just a lot of federal barriers they talked about reclassifying the dea classification for cannabis a few years ago and moving it from schedule one to schedule two so that we could research it but that was shot down and i'm not really sure why i don't think anybody really understands why you know cannabis is schedule one and methamphetamine is scheduled to it doesn't make sense to me all right and now i can open it up for questions all right thank you so much dr nikolai for that presentation um we do have a couple questions to start off with um you mentioned that there's you know you gave a lot of data obviously in a short period of time um but you also did sprinkle in some anecdotal observations that you've made um along the way are there any other kind of general kind of overview themes that you might share in terms of you know when you're when you're uh themes you're seeing or the kinds of conversations you're having with your patients um and and maybe you know kind of their general situations or or reactions to you to the conversations you're having with them yeah so there is a lot of variability i mean sometimes there's people that come into my office and say you know i smoke marijuana i do it all the time it really helps when i stop smoking it and before i smoked it i wasn't happy and i am now and i'm doing fine and i'm you know okay that's you and that's your experience and that's fine other people it seems more bizarre i had one patient that checked that came to a psychiatric hospital for feeling suicidal and he was suicidal because he ran out of money to buy marijuana he got about you know five six hundred dollars every month on disability and he spent the entire amount on marijuana because he had to get you know specific strains so that he wouldn't be suicidal so that he could be happy and he was instead of paying rent he was living as a homeless person and spending all of his income on marijuana and you know i asked him the question you know you spend all your money on marijuana and you can't pay your rent and you're homeless you know does this seem like a problem to you and he looked at me like i was crazy and said of course not i need marijuana um i don't need shelter and you know people just really love and rely on this drug and to me that sounded more like an addiction than you know something that was having a positive effect on his life and i will say that so many people use marijuana now but it's hard to tell the effects that it's having so i did um i worked at a clinic in oregon that focused on you know teenagers that were having their first episode of psychosis right are they going to develop schizophrenia this long-term thought disorder where they lose touch with reality and there were a number of cases where you know they didn't really have very many risk factors but they smoked a lot of marijuana and i will say the ones that we could get you know it seemed like their brains couldn't handle marijuana maybe they had that gene you know we weren't able to test for them um with the ones that we could get off get them on medications tend to stabilize and do well and you know the psychosis would go away and they wouldn't develop schizophrenia and the ones that you know just kept smoking and couldn't stop tended to do worse and drop out of treatment and you know be in and out of hospitals and that sort of thing um i guess the final thing i'd say is that dabbing that is a huge part you know please do not dab do not use the concentrated oils on a regular basis that is you know i've had people come in and one kid started dabbing he did it a few times his parents brought him in he was talking to the fireplace and being very odd and he had psychotic symptoms for about a year and we treated him and gave him medications and he was able to go back home and then as soon as he got back home he started using again and turned 21 had easy access to it and kind of disappeared so those are kind of three things i see a lot in my clinical practice right on and it sounds like um you know one of the things you had mentioned earlier were some of the symptoms that you see in terms of elevated depression and things like that and then based on the the answer you were just giving it sounds like some of those trends are kind of correspond with marijuana usage in terms of if if folks are using heavily or used when they were younger that those that those effects would continue but it does sound like in some cases those um you know those symptoms are reversible in some ways i mean number one it sounds like it correlates to some degree when you stop using um but then also there are there may be some other treatments um available as well so i mean i guess part of the question is is it a lost cause when someone you know has already used when they were young or are experiencing some of these depressive issues or symptoms etc yeah so i'd say um it's it's never a lost cause there are i also work at the um oregon state hospital which is where people go that have kind of long-term psychotic symptoms they're dangerous and they can't kind of function in regular society and a lot of those you know so they can be stuck in the state hospital for months or even years and you see a lot of people i mean methamphetamine is a big issue here and people that have done a lot of damage to their brain and after um even kind of sometimes it takes several months or even a year of sobriety we do see brain function come back um you know there's definitely some damage that seems to be permanent but that you know they're at least able to stay in touch with reality kind of you know live on their own be safe that sort of thing um so i'd say it's never too late even if you've had this horrible drug habit for years and years that if you get clean and somewhere your brain has this remarkable ability to recover um and marijuana obviously not doesn't seem to be as damaging to the brain as methamphetamines um one thing with marijuana it really sticks around in the system a long time it takes your body a long time to metabolize it and to get it all out of your body and so that can be tough for people because you have to go through this very long withdrawal period and a lot of cases where you're nauseous and grumpy and having vivid nightmares because you for you know weeks or even months on end because you're withdrawing from cannabis but once you get through that people that used really heavy and were struggling i do see the brain recover and they get better um you know your body repletes its pleasure hormones so that our antidepressants and other medications can be more effective um so i mean everyone's different if cannabis is a problem for you and you can stop it and say yeah it's it's never too late um but again if you can do it um don't smoke throughout your adolescence because that is tough to recover from yeah it seems like those are the two biggest takeaways right if if you don't smoke in your adolescence um and really you know obviously just avoid it in general but it sounds like there's so much development going on in the brain during adolescence and that seems to be when it has such an impact so um you know thanks for explaining that correlation i want to remind viewers while we have a time for a couple more questions if you do have questions you can scroll down with your mouse at the bottom of your zoom screen and there is a q a feature there and it looks like another question just came in actually so let me read that to you do you know anything about using cannabis to sleep i'm unable to sleep without it after using daily for a long period of time yeah so a lot of people report that cannabis kind of has this calming effect on them or can help them sleep and i think the story with cannabis is similar for sleep aids in general which is that sleep aids can be effective for short-term use so if you're kind of going if you're traveling or if you're going through a period where you're stressed and having trouble sleeping that using sleep aids for a couple months can be helpful um or if your sleep schedule is just all wonky and you can't get to sleep that kind of using sleep aids for maybe a couple months to kind of get you sleeping at night and awake during the day can be helpful when we see people just use sleep aids life long right i take a sleep aid every night that's the only way you can sleep um again it's kind of the story we see with a lot it's helpful the first couple months but then after that sleep gets worse again and then it continues to get worse and worse and then people get stuck right i'm taking a sleep aid i've been taking it for years my sleep is terrible um and i i have this habit of being stuck on the sleep aid so that's always a tough challenge too because things generally need to get worse before they get better so you have to stop the sleep aid sleep is going to get even worse but then eventually your brain chemistry will start to normalize and then we can work on proper sleep hygiene and getting you you know good restful sleep so if you're stuck on cannabis you can talk to your doctor about maybe kind of just trying a different sleep aid to get you through the withdrawal when you'll probably have lots of trouble sleeping um if that's kind of your motivation to get off it you can talk to your doctor about trying things like that all right thank you that's i think that's something that is important to remember just if it takes so long for the drug to get out of your system um you know that to have the patience to to wait until your brain is able to normalize before you would um you know then kind of try to to to move in in a different positive direction um i this is a quite this is a personal question for me because i i remember reading it in your introduction about your opportunity to testify in front of the colorado congressional committee and i was just wondering if you could tell us a little bit about that it sounds like a very interesting opportunity yeah so when i was in colorado as part of the legislative committee for the um the psychiatrist organization and the child and adolescent psychiatrist organization there and there was a bill being proposed to legalize um prescribing medical marijuana for autism for kids and adults so me and a couple other physicians testified that we didn't think it was a good idea to legalize marijuana for the treatment of autism that kind of the research wasn't there or at the very least there needed to be additional safety measures put in place um so we talked about that and as you can imagine people are very passionate about this um the dispensaries paid to fly a lot of families out that camped out at the capitol for weeks um there was probably a dozen families that testified how helpful cannabis was for their kids with autism and was life-changing kind of like the video i showed earlier i'm just with autism instead of seizures and um the bill passed through nearly unanimously uh and now autism is uh an indication for um the use of medical cannabis in colorado however our organization we did kind of get some safety measures in place but the you know the diagnosis of autism in kids needs to be confirmed by a physician and another mental health professional and that um you know there was a pediatrician as a member of congress that really wanted the pediatrician the primary care doctor to be made aware that this was going on um so they don't want to interfere with her you know the pediatrician's medications and what they were doing um so yeah it was a really interesting process to go through uh it's you know i'm on the legislative committee with the psychiatrist here and it's you know work i plan to continue excellent excellent one final question uh to to wrap us up this evening um could you talk a little bit about the future kind of where you see things going i mean there's a lot of data that you share tonight that indicates that trends are are are going up in terms of usage um a greater portion of of of kids are are trying or using marijuana regularly the the the percentage of thc is increasing um so you know where do you think we're going from here yeah so i think with recreational use it will continue to increase a little bit longer than i imagined it will plateau um you know i think there's a set of people that are going to try and experiment with drugs and you know you know but also a set of people that really don't have much interest in it um we haven't hit that plateau yet but i i imagine it's coming here in the next few years with the rates of how quickly it's growing in popularity um as it you kind of this amount of powerful and frequent use of marijuana is around longer and we have you know kind of more research and we see what it does i think that will inform us a lot um and inform you know kind of the future youth whether it's something that they can get away with whether it's something safe or whether it's something that can cause um a lot of harm like we suspect it may and then i hope medically that it gets you know rescheduled by the dea so that we can study it and have high quality research from it i think there are you know we can certainly derive pieces of the cannabis plant that seem to have therapeutic targets and can be used as medicine um and it's important for us to be able to research that and prescribe it and use it like a medicine um it's a very odd feeling for me if i want to sign a marijuana card and give it to a patient that um hey go to the dispensary and kind of figure it out there's no dose there's no formulation right i can you know hope they're taking cbd and they're getting and they're just going by and you know dabbing um you know without having to pay taxes because they have a marijuana card um another issue there is that a lot of kids i talk to you know where to get your marijuana oh my friend's 18. he has a marijuana card for anxiety or something like that and he can um buy it for me so i mean cannabis it's everywhere kids are trying it and experimenting with it my hope is that we can get the more reliable information on what it does and doesn't do i think use is gonna continue to increase it's gonna get stronger it's gonna get cheaper um and there's gonna be more and more of it at least for the next couple years well that's the kind of a mixed a mixed out look i'd say right it's it doesn't look great in the short term but some of your uh some of your predictions i really do hope they come true with the ability to do increased research and um and hopefully have the ability to prescribe in a more specific and practical way um for your for your patients well dr nikolai i want to thank you once again for for uh this presentation this evening it was it was very interesting and informative and i hope our audience enjoyed it speaking of our audience i hope that you tune in to wu stream for upcoming content that we will continue to add on a weekly basis and thanks again for joining us tonight thanks again dr nikolai thanks everyone take care [Music] you", "VHdjn0ZKhZY": "welcome to a nother let's try it this time around we're gonna talk about CBD oil and my experience with it and just really I guess I want to talk about some misconceptions that people may have I know you guys you know you view these videos because you're like should I buy this or not and you know I'm not sure what I'm getting into and my whole goal today is to tell you about my experience and what does what this actually is what it does my personal experience with it and why I would recommend it right so that's that's my whole goal for you guys today so the first thing I want to talk about is CBD oil and what it is so CBD is a hemp oil extract it is where they take the weak light the cannabis plant or the implant and they basically just take CBD out of it and put it in here alright so so you can take all the benefit contrary to popular popular belief this is not side doesn't man I mean this has t seen it but it think it's like 130 it's like non noticeable you wouldn't even get affected by it so essentially this right here is not gonna get you high it's not like it's not like marijuana it I mean it comes from the same plant but it's not gonna get you stoned right because it's not using THC it's using CBD instead you know so don't go into buying this think you know you know if I've never smoked but I want to feel the feeling this isn't gonna give you the same feeling as I actually like smoking weed so just be aware of that it's not like an alternative although it does give you some other feelings and benefits that I feel are just as good you know people that they do medical marijuana all the time this has its own medical benefits in my opinion I talk to people who have told me you know I didn't really give anything out of it and I think that they may have been using it for the wrong reasons so I'm gonna go over why I initially purchased it what kind of led me to it and also things that it wasn't expecting that happened when I would actually got it so I initially bought it because under a lot of pressure work a lot of stress and I just have a really stressful job and just other stresses in my life were causing a lot of anxiety and I would get a lot of pressure on my chest almost so where it felt like someone was almost sitting on my chest and I couldn't catch my breath a lot of times and man it was just really overwhelming and I just I remember just getting on the internet and just like what do I do you know like what are some things that I can do and I came across CBD oil and you know I started researching and kind of you know doing what I do so that I can provide basically doing what you guys are doing right now by watching me right so I started looking into it and I want to know more about it so I started reading up on it and one of the one of the benefits was hey if you take CBD oil it'll help you with your anxiety so I was like cool like what do I got to lose you know I buy it and it doesn't work I'm out a few bucks but this is why I do these videos anyways cuz I want to make sure that everybody has a chance to see someone else's experience before they do it because it gives you a little bit of confidence going into it um that being said I did my research I wanted to kind of find you know the brand that fit me and I came up with Charlotte's Web it's actually pretty popular brand if you're browsing the internet and you search CVD this is probably gonna be the one of the more popular brands this was the first bottle that I purchased actually have another bottle over here I'm gonna go over here a second but I bought this for about thirty nine dollars plus tax and shipping a lot of fun stuff so I was like fifty bucks and it took like a week week and a half to get to me in the mail and I just remember being really excited to try it because I was so at that point I was just kidding angst anxiety every day was it was really bad is it really eating me alive and I remember I took this for like a couple days like a day or two and then I real actually started feeling the effects when I would have my anxiety bounds where I would think like you know what's the what do I have to worry about right like oh it's gonna be a tough day at work tomorrow or I've got so much going on or my girlfriend arguing or whatever the case whatever was giving me anxiety I would still have I would still think about the problems that I had to face but I wouldn't get that pressure and I wouldn't get that chest pressure and it helped me really concentrate on the task at hand so it didn't really change my mindset like I still was thinking like damn I got a I don't have a busy day tomorrow but I didn't have the sight the bodily side-effects I didn't have that chest pressure and I did have this shortness of breath and I mean I really just was able to control what was happening so it doesn't make you forget like your problems or anything I didn't I knew that I was gonna have trouble was that I would have planned better and I could prepare better for it so I thought that was a really good benefit um another benefit that I was actually not expecting was I normally I have sleeping issues like I have a hard time the only bed sometimes but you know since I started taking this like I could go lay down and really concentrate on go to sleep and I was out and I would knock out real fast so it was it was just a really unexpected benefit that I loved about it this bottle right here is pretty small I would say if you're new and you want to give it a like a try just to see how it affects you this is the way to go it's $39.99 like I said from CW Kemp calm and essentially it comes with this dropper basically unscrew it you fill up the dropper and then you pop it under your tongue I got mint chocolate I think it tastes minty definitely doesn't taste chocolaty so don't go into the thinking that I think they try to throw a little chocolate kind of taste on it buzz so I got this first and since it since it worked really good on me I know it's worth the investment I picked up their $100 box so to give you kind of a overview that's how big we're talking this thing's like three and a half times the size of this I haven't opened this yet this actually just came in the mail so we're gonna open it together and kind of see what we're dealing with and then I'll actually take a dropper too just to kind of show you guys what you do days we're I'm feeling extra you know anxious where I feel like like I'm just under a lot of like pressure I'd come home and I'll take two drops maybe would drop or two and and then I'm good you know so it has this really weird thing on the box I'm gonna try to open it as gently as possible but it's probably gonna tear so I'm not trying to be neat here I'm just trying to get it done right pop it open pop it open boom this is a huge bottle oh my god this thing is like a like a little mini beer bottle or something it's come wrapped in plastic this is very similar to the first one I got so they all come this like plastic wrapping so I I'm gonna tear it this thing until I can get into it this thing this thing is gonna last me a lot longer than the other one and that's actually what I'm really excited about this one was $100 which i think is totally worth it you could you know you can get only two of those little small ones for the price this is like three and a half [Music] here my makeshift garbage can and much like the other one this one just comes with a big drop this dropper is huge oh my God look at all that goodness when you can squeeze it out of so this is the biggest dropper I've ever seen in my life this thing's like bite feet wah or five inches long so here we go so I'm gonna I'm gonna take a full I'm gonna take its rocker that's about the size of a normal dropper and we're gonna hit take this I can really taste the plant they must have done something to their formula too because this tastes totally different from the other chocolate chocolate mint chocolate I think they may have turned it around I can it's like I literally bit into wheat but they put mint on it so it's not the greatest taste but I don't think of it for the taste I think of it for the benefit and I'm about to be feeling pretty chill I mean I've died no worries right that's the whole reason I got this so all in all if you plan on doing it and you're still a little wary even after watching this video don't be afraid you know if you're suffering from some really bad anxiety like I know what you're going through I've been there and he feels just like just overwhelmed and this stuff really takes the edge off and I know some people say oh I didn't feel anything but it's like you may not even be experiencing anxiety on the level where you can feel it on your chest and I feel like if you that's where you're at this is the way to go I'm gonna drop a link down here I don't do any of my videos as a sponsor or anything I don't get money from these companies although one day I would like to uh-huh or some credit or something but I'm not big enough on the video in the video market for that yet so I do these things for you guys and I want to make sure that you guys have the opportunity to see what you're getting into and I do my how-to videos because I'm I'm just trying to help people out you know I don't go into this looking for money and I don't think I ever will I may monetize one day but I mean it's not a big deal to me I enjoy what I do and I'm not hurting for cash as you can tell I buy all sorts of babies down stuff so I'll leave a link to the Charlotte's Web company down in my down in my here in the description and you guys can check them out this is the 7 milligrams they have a higher doses this is the the extra strength but I mean they have like ones where it's like double the strength of this so you're suffering like if this doesn't do it for you the first time but you don't slight effect mmm you may have to pay a little bit more for the upper end stuff but like I said I get bio 7 milligrams I mean it does the trick for me so maybe it'll do the trick for you that being said don't forget to hit that like and subscribe button and tell

huge for the industry shepherd smith here thanks for watching cnbc on youtube", "Sfpk2w-wGNY": "this is always a joy to talk about first of all dementia because it's very close to my heart in terms of taking care of dementia patients but I'm a geriatrician so I take care of older adults and if you want to consider what my specialties are it's in long-term care dementia and end-of-life or hospice and palliative care the buck stops with me I always say is unfortunately my patients die my goal is the best quality of life all right for the duration of their life the best part and the best quality of care so I also run a geriatric fellowship program training young physicians to become geriatric physicians for all of you in here and my advice and certainly when I'm in the training process I'm training them so that they know me and how to take care of me when I get older because I'm kind of picky but also I would recommend that geriatric medicine is a lot different than primary care medicine that's internal medicine or family medicine the whole principles are quite different and actually if you look back at what's happening in our primary care medicine you see the changes that might be occurring more of a holistic approach more of a team approach more of a shared decision-making and also planning for advanced directives in terms of advanced care planning so to speak what happens if I get this this or that as I get older dealing with dementia and the primary emphasis on this particular talk is is what can we do with regards to patients who have behavioral issues with dementia patients and it's marijuana possibly a role in terms of how we might look at alternative ways how we manage these behaviors in addition there's a lot of confusion before that's all right there's a lot of confusion as far as what the hell is marijuana and I would guarantee you that if I go around I bet you I might get 10 or 15 different answers of what marijuana is and then if I bring up the term cannabis what's cannabis okay so I hate to say this but much like I had to do is I have to learn some basics so I'm going to go over some basics so that when you see something advertised CBD oil is being advertised on every street corner that you can buy it here what is it that I'm getting because then what's the difference between marijuana and CBD oil or is there a difference I don't know so so I'm going to go into some basics and then I'm going to talk to you about some of the studies with regards to the use of marijuana where we stand with regards the use of that some of the positive pros and cons if you will of it and then switch into where do we stand with regards to the use in dementia or Alzheimer's dementia before I start I want to ask how many of you are caregivers or have experience with patients who have dementia good a good portion so you'll be definitely interested in where we stand with regards to the use of cannabis if you will in our patients who have dementia the first slide up here is I have geriatrics and polypharmacy good and bad news is we're living longer the bad news is is that we have more medical problems as we grow older and therefore usually that means that we're on a lot of medicines so in Doc's particularly our specialists like to prescribe a lot of medicines because they say you can't live without them I'm on the other side and the other side of that is is that I'm looking at people who are on these drugs but are having adverse effects of those meds and you know what a lot of the drugs that we use have what they call black box warnings that means that you could die from them so it's a constant balance if you will in terms of always assessing the benefit versus the risk overall and all of us as healthcare providers is do no harm alright that's easier said than done okay and you'll see why maybe as we go on so let's take a look the next slide is the problem behaviors are very common the most consistent abnormality that you're going to see over the course of dementia the course of dementia varies anywhere Alzheimer's dementia between eight to ten years but it goes anywhere from three years to twenty years all right so you can see the differences in terms of life span and now there are multiple types of dementia has anything in in this world it gets more complicated so we're finding different forms each of these different forms have a different we'll say memory effects if you will and other neurological deficits that we really have to be a student of to pick them up because it really does mean our this is this particular type more prone to behaviors versus not and if so how do we differentiate that and how are we going to adjust our medications okay and the behaviors are characterized for any of you that are involved in taking care of some dementia patients agitation verbal and aggressive behave behaviors all right and what does that mean hitting patients are hitting slapping biting kicking anybody have experience with their patients on that okay that's disturbing re or the good old yelling and screaming help me help me help me help me shut up well yeah all right and you just want to say that but these are all problems and they're difficult to manage and by the way how we manage them is different starting off by I want to say that the thing is a significant thing is is that there are serious complications that can be associated with that I can walk up to you and I could say you know you're a son of a [ __ ] all right and you're gonna slap me alright how dare you say that to me so number one patient may get hurt the other resident may get hurt and if somebody's trying to do a activities of daily living cleaning them changing them whatever it is they may get agitated they made kick and scratch is this comment yes it's very common okay and the question comes up is what do you do about it okay when the problem is is that the treatment options are very limited I can go through a list of about four different medicine medical medication groups and we've tried them all and each of them are associated with complications all right some more serious than not some of them as I said that can even result in death the more common drugs that have been used all right are now have the black box warning saying that you could die from this from sudden cardiac death that's only a minor not a minor complication but that's only one of the many complications that are associated with taking these medicines next slide please so possible solution can the use of cannabis be a benefit to assist in the management of these behaviors next slide so first thing is what is cannabis and what is marijuana so I'm gonna go through some basics and just so we all understand that and hopefully bring it home in terms of what we're looking at when we're trying to evaluate the benefit versus the risk of using marijuana or cannabis all right in our patients so next slide so the cannabis plants which are oftentimes said the marijuana plant so they use them interchangeably but it really is a cannabis plant alright and originally they were from East Asia but now as we all know they're cultivated throughout the whole world so everybody's growing marijuana all right original use was Industrial fiber seed oil hemp seed oil for example hemp seeds for recreational purses purposes religious and spiritual purposes to elevate the mood and lastly now more recently with the medication that we're looking at in terms of is this an appropriate type of medicine you actually have three different strains the most common ones there's probably several ones listed seva sativa the indica strain and one that we don't hear much about is this third strain which a true Dallas ruderalis and this Teva notoriously that strain so if you have a plant that's high or of this de Teva strain its where really most of the marijuana in quote marijuana as we can't say it which is invigorating uplifting okay and activating if you will makes you feel good as opposed to the indica stre which is more sedating relaxing sleep makes you sleep better okay there's characteristic and where CBD comes from okay so the next slide so the two main varieties that we see from coming from these plants and I'll start by saying there's a term that they use is of final phyto cannabinoids alright and we'll just use cannabinoids in general it's a technical term I realize that but the reason I'm using that is phyto means that there are the naturally occurring which is where marijuana comes from literally and then the endocannabinoids and guess what there in our brain we have marijuana going in our brain let's call it cannabis as opposed to marijuana all right so it's kind of tricky we'll get to that a little bit more so marijuana has a high THC content psychoactive intoxicating this is what we traditionally see on the streets and everybody's taking it particularly for all those medical problems that it's interesting how the young people have more medical problems than the older people when it comes to use of marijuana it's kind of interesting all right and then hemp all right which is basically CBD content in what we're seeing the CBD oils and different products from CBD that we're seeing on the market all right it's not psychoactive it's not intoxicating and again this is where most of the uses was in for industrial use again hemp seed hemp oil now the amazing thing is is that this last thing these are chemicals that circulate or that are fun in this plant there are four hundred approximately four hundred and eighty different chemicals that are in our marijuana plant hey and second of all of those known there's about 65 that have some chemical structure that are related to the endocannabinoids which are the ones that are circulating in our brain okay so it's a plant and you say well you know where should we really be dealing with this but how many of you familiar everybody's familiar with penicillin where did it come from it comes from a mold okay so it's be surprising how many things we might get up natural products that may be a benefit to us that we don't know about the problem is we need to study it and decide what is appropriate what isn't appropriate so some of the terms that you may hear marijuana the main ingredient in that is THC and that mostly comes from the flowers all right in the leaves of the plant when you get down to the stalks the plants this is where hemp is derived from from the stems and the stalks then you have terpenes and terpenoids and science interesting is it but how many Herot of aromatherapy all right everybody's heard of Roma therapy that's basically terpenoids it's a it's a class of chemicals that gives us scent all right I was recently in Amsterdam and it's like on every other corner is either a coffee shop which is literally a marijuana shop as opposed to a cafe which is a coffee shop or a head's shop all right which is all marijuana and it was kind of interesting because I went in there and they say well this is a lemon flavor this is a strawberry favor this is a caramel flavor I mean how many flavors do you have but nonetheless this is basically what they're talking about the terpenoids end up making the the smell and that they have very as medicinal effects such as lavender for example is relaxing to help you go to sleep so theoretically the terpenoids have some contribution to the effects of marijuana and then you have hash and hashish which is basically an extracted cannabis product composed of compressed purified preparations of stock resin gland and hashish is oftentimes the drug that they refer to which is the resident of the cannabis plant this is something that normally is smoked a lot so for some of the younger people this is probably old hat in here am i right now I'm looking I'm looking around for the younger nobody's even acknowledged he met alright and then lastly and this is where I got to keep in mind for those that are growing marijuana plants if you take a marijuana plant and you just crush it up put everything in it that's what you're going to get and you're gonna smoke it but you don't know what's in it and that's a real problem in a sense you don't know if it's got a lot of THC you don't know if it's got byproducts that are dangerous for you so and that's why buying street marihuana is really a raise as a concern in terms of what you're getting in that product okay so it's very variable therapeutic effect I don't know if you know but the recent statistics since marijuana has been legalized the number of ER visits associated with acute psychotic reactions related to that have gone up significantly okay so the only point is to point out some of the concerns that you have with what you're getting and and what effect it's going to have on you and the concerns that we all have and so if I has a geriatric doc is going to be prescribing a medicine for you or your loved one my concern is am i doing more harm am I going to create some problems okay so as I mentioned predominate temp is predominantly CBD this is normally what we're getting when we go and get some CBD all right has a lower concentration of THC it is the only legalized form of cannabis that can be prescribed without a prescription you know in order to get marijuana you have to have a medical marijuana card in order to get CBD you really don't now the good news is that it recently has been reclassified I think it's reclassified in thirty states Arizona is one of them so let me go back and just talk about when I talk about a Schedule one schedule to schedule one is no currently accepted medical use and the highest potential for abuse where do the opiates come they come in schedule two proven medical benefit all right but a high risk for abuse and that's why we have the open opioid crisis schedule 5 is medications with a low quantities of narcotics and low potential for abuse now I put robitussin does everybody know robitussin dm has everybody taking it you know that's a drug as central nervous side effects alright theoretically and the doses that we get or give you're probably not going to get much but actually so CBD has gone from a scheduled one all the way down to a Schedule five that's good news okay however the criteria must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration it can't have a content higher than 0.3 and that's vary from state to state some people will say 0.1% all right marijuana still scheduled as get Road ones rug so it's still not legal can be purchased without obtaining the medication of a marijuana card and the federal law keep in mind here's the difference a federal law it's still illegal CBD is still illegal some of you may have seen the news where the lady was arrested getting on an airplane she had CBD cream or oil or point mint of some sort and she was arrested it's under the airports are under federal jurisdiction therefore it's theoretically illegal and I want to mention that because from the standpoint of myself and treating this I have to be careful I mean if I do it in a federally regulated facility am I breaking the law and the question come and I don't want to get arrested not yet I mean you know I just got back one more just real quick gee oh that's I wanted to say so you really have to be careful federal law still has that Seabee oil and other cannabis cannibal dials are listening to schedule a and the newest drug which is mostly CBD is epi epi Leah Dix I don't know if you've heard about this but this is the medicine that now has been approved for seizures and young kids and really thought to be a benefit the studies look promising and there's a couple of new drugs that are coming out soon and ou allude to them as we go on next slide please so these are the benefits all right potential benefits all right keep in mind that CBD is a non psychoactive and there are very few side effects we've already talked about the pediatric seizures epidural ox is mine anxiety nausea vomiting inflammatory conditions paying Alzheimer's dementia Parkinson's disease but actually studied more in Parkinson's disease in an Alzheimer's dementia alright but so these are some of the potential benefits and now if these are benefits why aren't we looking at them more closely and try to determine you know what are these benefits and are there any potential side effects next slide on the other hand THC I'll talk a little bit more about the ratios THC is activating and a CBD counteracts that activation by cousin and relaxing so if you combine the two has thought that you may potentiate the effect of the eventual effective of any of the symptoms that you are treating on the other hand the CBD counteracts you just don't want to give the THC to you know having everybody sort of activated if you will that's what you're trying to suppress particularly in patients who have a cognitive impairment alright but pain is probably the biggest area where we're talking about and this is arthritic pain as well as what they call neuropathic pain or peripheral neuropathies opioid modulation we're gonna get to that a little bit more and I'm gonna tell you a little bit about how I think that there is some positive things coming out of the use of the marijuana that we're seeing in dealing with anxiety insomnia and spasticity the spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis so there is a new drug that's going to be coming out soon if any day is going to be approved for the use in patients who have must multiple sclerosis and has an appetite stimulant and I'm a little bit more or less disappointed in the one that we currently have we have a drug called Marinol and I think it's very expensive I've used it I think it's worthless drug and I unfortunately people still ask if we can take it and I usually say no because it is expensive and Medicare does not pay for it next slide so these are the synthetic cannabinoids which are Marinol is the drug that I talked about with regards to appetite stimulant epi dialogue which is for the pediatric seizures salty Beck says is the one that's now going to be produced it's almost there for spasticity with multiple sclerosis very positive outcome but good studies are eight that have shown the benefit and that's what really we need and then you have that naturally-occurring canna at cannabinoids which are marijuana in the derivatives and then now over-the-counter CBD as you as I mentioned you know I need any prescription you don't need anything you can walk in and you get CBD a buy it bottom line it's pretty expensive so bear with me again we're using CBD is it a benefit and I'll give you my own personal experience as a physician prescribing it for some of my patients next slide as you might guess we all know that smoking and vaping are big things I do want to tell you that I did bring along some brownies for you when you leave so I hope you had enjoy the rest of your day and just enjoy all right these are very common my wife just got some but I see quite a few people in terms of using this and rubbing it on our thrity joints I'm gonna say it's probably 50/50 and keep in mind you always have to think in terms of placebo something soft on your on your arthritic pain might make you feel better but it isn't really truly doing anything for the inflammation then the tinctures and oils this is what we are more or less using in our studies because it's easy for the patients to take the problem with the Edible is it's highly variable of how much marijuana if you will is in that particular cookie that you're taking and now you know in alcoholic beverages as well as soft drinks they are now putting CBD in those drinks and lastly transdermal patches and suppositories hopefully we don't have to get to that point to use those next slide so what is some relationship between plant cannabis all right the phyto cannabinoids all right and the endocannabinoid cannabinoids come yeah all right next slide all right so there is an endocannabinoid system in our brain and it consists of it's a biological system is composed of a lot of cannabinoids that are moving around in the brain okay all right and they actually ask as neurotransmitters I like this short order neurotransmitter transmitters basically what I'm saying is I say if you feel depressed okay the cannabinoids will have an increased secretion of those they'll hook onto the cannabinoid receptors and maybe counteract the depression so that makes sense to you you follow me so it's a chemical that attaches on or the chemical itself that's going to cause a reaction that's the same mechanism as all the other drugs that we use by the way right how many of you heard of serotonin okay so serotonin same thing okay basically the same thing and look how much we've studied with serotonin all right dopamine another one these are all chemicals that circulating the brain and have our neurotransmitters that create some kind of a reaction where they hook on to a receptor okay so the two that we know of now and there are many all right just what two AG and you don't have to know this but but these are mostly fun in the brain and then Ananda mind is the other one which is fun in higher concentrations of the body now the reason I say that is that they're all over the place so you have certain ones that are predominantly in the brain and certain ones that are predominantly in the bloodstream circulating in the body okay now they are also broken down and I maybe this is a little too technical but CBD and THC work a little bit differently CBD attacks this enzyme which breaks down cannabinoids okay and you don't want to do that I'm going to just say if you use Parkinson's disease you have dopamine and you have an absence of dopamine that gives you the Parkinson's symptoms so the question comes up is you don't want to take something that might be a benefit for you and decrease that okay on the other hand THC acts directly on the receptors alright and if it gives you more of a prolonged effect alright for whatever that endpoint is on the receptor depends on what system is in if it's in the system of the hypothalamus for example it may improve your appetite okay if it's in another system may help your memory if you will alright so there's different different mechanisms we just don't know enough about them yet next slide then these are the receptors cb1 receptors which are found mostly in the brain and spinal cord and then these they're concentrated in the brain regions associated with that behavior so again I mentioned the hypothalamus and maybe if we're gonna stimulate the appetite for example and just using that again cannabinoids you give them and they're going to stimulate the appetite you hear that the rationale behind the thinking behind is there a benefit for appetite stimulant and then the cb2 receptors found in a peripheral nervous system now this is where the anti-inflammatory approach comes in so it works on the immune system and it creates an anti-inflammatory so if you have arthritis theoretically all right it's going to make the arthritis feel less inflamed if you will as an anti-inflammatory drug and I don't know if as we get older the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs these of the advils and that person and a whole host of medicines that we take for our arthritis but as we get older there are more complications associated with it so for all practical purposes they almost become contraindicated in our older patients again what alternatives do we have for managing pain okay then I won't go into that x5 so let's take a look these are the things that internally in our own brain that they may be affecting appetite metabolism pain sleep mood movement it goes all the way down all right now the reason I say that our our older patients but better yet dementia patients have trouble with the appetite they may not eat they have pain that they can't describe so we don't know whether they have or have not pain but the older you get more likely you're gonna have arthritic pain sleep insomnia is a common problem people have sleep disorders all right and mood so it waxes in wane sometimes or more activated other times are more sleepy so we really have to deal with that but remember they also are involved in our basic functions our everyday living okay next slide so the latest term that's coming out is are there individuals which have a lower amount that are necessary to maintain good health vitality and well-being all right so this is called an end and kinetic cannabinoid deficiency and is there a syndrome that occurs now let me give you just a rough maybe guesstimate because it is being used how many people are familiar with fibromyalgia okay everybody okay good all right that's it's so about depressed effect aches all over okay do you think maybe it could be that there's a cannabinoid which affects all of these areas that that our patients complain of with fibromyalgia it's being tried so far there are no definitive results but I noticed that they are using it more and more and people who have fibromyalgia with the Hope Center because there is no good treatment so far all right there's a lot of treatment that's out there question is note I said good treatment so it's always possible to look into this so it raises the question is why are we looking at this if we look at dopamine deficiency serotonin deficiency why are we looking at the cannabinoid deficiency there's occurs in the brain next slide so and why is there more need this is certainly the reason why there's a need for more studies next slide ok I'll start off by saying is there a plus side all right to the use of marijuana that's been described we talked about all the symptoms and symptoms that are associated with it okay I feel hi that might be kids that are good a lot of these others were not sure of but we still use it with the hopes that we're gonna feel better have a good time sometimes it's the difference between taking an alcoholic beverage as well as a puff of marijuana that the trade-off is you're gonna feel better maybe with both which one has the least amount of side effects there are those what argue marijuana has the least amount of side effects I'm not going to go there but let's let's go studies have shown that that there is a reduction in prescription medicine so let's take a look at that a very important slide next slide so changes associated with state having a medical marijuana law in numbers of Medicaid prescriptions for drugs used to treat condition with medical marijuana look at this anxiety depression Lacombe a-- nausea pain psychosis seizures sleep the only ones spasticity quite sure why that fell out to be quite frank with you but the bottom line is so there are some studies that that you can look at CMS the Medicare Medicaid data and come up with there's less there's a reduction in the use of medications for each of these next one even more important okay in consideration of the opioid epidemic all right we have now look at over here this is every number of daily doses filled with the prescription drugs annually per physician in states with medical marijuana law by condition categorize category studied compared to the average number in states without a law look at the difference and and the one I point to is paying okay now we're in an opioid crisis no I don't want to say that we're gonna trade an opioid crisis for a marijuana crisis all right but the point being is as a river really need to look at this very very closely because we are in an opioid crisis and the question is do we have an alternative all right in terms of particularly going through withdrawal and some of the other medicines that we give to our patients who are addicted to opioids so that's a very important statistic I thought and perhaps a benefit that we need to look into a little bit more now as you know there's also on the other side in States who have legalized marijuana there's an increased incidence of motor vehicle accidents alright so a lot of negative things that obviously is quoted in the newspapers and you can quote it either way for those probe those anti marijuana use my concern is is that we just need more studies in order to make sure that we know what we're doing next thing next slide so this gives you an idea of the different studies if you take a look at the number of studies all right these are controlled studies 28 for paying 28 for nausea vomitting 14 for multiple sclerosis and if you take a look at the patients now the point is in order to have an adequate research study you really have to have large numbers and what's problem is is that if you go all the way down and looking here sleep disorder psychosis anxiety disorders alright there are very few studies you're really looking at them here and this is from 2:15 2015 now this was a meta-analysis so basically the Cochran study what they usually do is they look at all these studies that are put together all right that have been done on marijuana and they try to analyze whether they've been good studies or bad studies in this case they just looked to see if there were studies but take a look at these numbers I mean for twenty four glaucoma is something that wherever it is there's only a few six six studies for glaucoma and yet that's being billed as something that you can use marijuana for glaucoma and for eggs sleep disorders all right which are very common not only in our patients with dementia but in our older population in general so you could see there aren't many studies next slide so pain management since that is it so again here was again another Cochran study where they looked at all these different studies now note a lot of these with cannabinoid and with THC and the others are usually with pharmaceutical companies but if you really take a look all those dots are squares that are on the right side all right show that that favors the use of marijuana all right those on the opposite side know and negative I didn't go into each of these studies to see whether they were good studies bad studies whatever they may be I'm gonna point out some problems that we have with our dementia patients in terms of doing studies and how effective they are and the problems we have on judging whether or not they are really truly an improvement or not and I'll go into that a little bit later but the consensus is is that they probably do help in pain so let's take a look at that and can we find something the pharmaceutical industry is trying to produce an fda-approved drug alright which will have the combination of THC and CBD and to try to see whether or not it's effective or not and hopefully like some of the other drugs will get that passed so that you are able to take that whether you're it's federally regulated or not that you will be able to take that as a drug next slide don't go too far with this but I will tell you this all right and much as I talked about serotonin and dopamine alright there is some consider in some of the bay science is that maybe this is marijuana as neuroprotective now one of the things is with regards to marijuana they say it creates apathy all right over a long term used chronic use but we don't know what that chronic use is so the question is a little bit okay or is too much not okay so we don't know the answer to that so the bottom line is that but they it may be neuroprotective now again I don't want to go into this but I will solve it but much as I talked about serotonin dopamine and cannabinoids alright with dementia acetylcholine goes down alright and the drugs that we have available increase the acetylcholine alright and that improves memory that's just a very simple simplistic version of what happens in Alzheimer's dementia but THC competes competitively inhibits cholinesterase inhibitor all right that's what breaks down acetylcholine so and that's how the mechanism of these new drugs work is they they destroy the enzyme that destroys acetylcholine are you all following me on that I mean is that okay you got okay so I'm trying so that is one mechanism the other is is there's a still a theory that that this is an anti inflammatory process so we're looking at drugs perhaps that would be anti inflammatory in nature one of the drugs that promoted that maybe we don't even you don't even know about is is the statins are anti inflammatory and a lot of the benefits of the statins are from its anti-inflammatory effects so the question comes up is this is somewhat like an antioxidant and actually there's some pretty good studies with our diet that we take which is high in antioxidants is a good diet is one of the factors that you can be on to delay the onset and progression of Alzheimer's dementia so I mean we can do a lot of this on our own the question comes up is is there an effect on from the will comb cannabinoids for right now in terms of perhaps delaying the onset or improving dementia in our patients this we don't know not looking into that now but there are some studies next day next time so these are the drugs now in in dementia studies that have been and I'm gonna kind of go over these a little bit quickly but Marinol is the only drug that has been approved and for appetite stimulant that's predominantly its effect we've used that and it supposedly causes decreased agitation I'm just going to tell you right now I think it's worthless I think it's an expensive drug that has very little effect and I don't prescribe it because it's not covered by Medicare first of all you have to pay for it I just don't think it's of any benefit so most of the studies that came out are really using low dose everybody's concerned with THC and for justifiable reasons it makes you high so if I have an agitated patient with dementia do I want to give them a drug that's going to make them more agitated okay so what they did is they they gave low dose of THC alright and and it didn't appear more beneficial than placebos in a small study only 58 patients received this and they received a relatively small dose of THC over a period of time did not have CBD in it so the question comes up or it may have had a little but mostly it was THC study so then they went to a little bit higher doses using cannabis oil and in 11 patients no I want to tell you again love and patience means nothing how many of people have heard of prevacid gonna have a scent I know even if you're taking it I'm gonna tell you it's a waste of money but alright the point being is is that the studies that we're done are absolutely ridiculous and how they have marketed that I think is really pathetic because they are making tons and tons of medicine on this drug it's not a drug you can get over the counter but I think it's actually like $60.00 a month something like that and I just think it's a shame it's it's we're a vulnerable society and we don't want to get dementia so if somebody advertises this drug no harm but you're paying $60 a month if you're on a limited income that's a lot of money okay plain and simply but these were done on hospitalized patients now the NPI is one of the tests that is good for monitoring behaviors in dementia patients and in non dimensions okay but mostly in dementia patients now these were patients who are hospitalized so we just say when a hospitalized patients is high with dementia is hospitalized there are 18 other different things that can be going on the most common which is delirium so we don't know if it helped of delirium or the dementia they seem to say that it was improved and maybe it's a drug that we should look at as opposed to some of the more toxic drugs that we use in hospitalized patients who develop delirium maybe we should look into them the Cochrane review all right basically found no evidence that cannabinoids are effective in reducing symptoms so that basically saying is all the studies it's inconclusive that there is any benefit that doesn't mean that they're abnormal next slide I like to study that recently came on it's a study from Sweden and it came out in this past in April of two night 2019 and they did and the reason I liked this study is because this is along the studies that we're doing in in our dementia units okay they were in a dementia directed care facilities and Jen mentioned to you that that I work out of a facility called Silverado and it's a dementia directed care assisted living facility all patients with dementia it's a prospective study so we're kind of starting with a baseline all right but anyway they did ten female patients I have no idea why they only included female patients as opposed to male patients with severe behavioral problems and they were given larger than previous doses of cannabis and here's this ratio CBD and THC so if you're gonna give larger doses of THC you want to counterbalance that with CBD now the question comes up is are we negating the effects of THC by giving the CBD or what nobody knows this answer okay we don't know this answer but they did monitor the behaviors and the results there was a 40% improvement and behavior scales and they used a decrease of psychotropic medicines now I will tell you here if I have somebody on psychotropic medicines alright and then I decrease their medicine you know they're more alert more active and so what are we dealing with we're dealing with the excess disability associated with these medicines so the idea is it was at the marijuana or was it us just decrease into medication okay improving up daily care and improvement in direct contact so if you're a zombie on mantra medicine and I take you off the medicine and all of a sudden you're communicating to me I'm just saying this is some of the difficulties that we have in studying this it's just not an easy thing to study however the relief there was no adverse side-effects which is great and there was relief was persistent after two months off the medicines and by the way when we take patients off medicines oftentimes they get better and stay better with or without marijuana so it is tricky next slide this is the Arizona study that we're talking about now first of all I wanted to talk about some of the problems we have encountered with regards to beginning this study and doing this study we're in the process of it now but you have to get a marijuana card and from Arizona the state of Arizona the question comes up is if you have a patient who has dimension no longer capable of making their own healthcare decisions then does the caregiver be responsible for getting a card but basically now the consensus is is that both the caregiver as well as the patient have to get a card now this entails now take a ninety-year-old with dementia who has had dementia for eight years do you think they have a driver's license do you think they have a recent photo huh yeah you hope not that's right so my point being is it's really hard to get this information and it becomes costly I don't know if any of you know what the cost of staying in a a dementia directed care facility I mean it's anywhere from 5,000 to 8,000 and and continually going up okay that's a lot of expenses now you throw an other expense on we are actually we need two cards we're gonna get the medicine for for free so you need to necessary offer me information and the left doesn't know the right to be quite frank with you as far as what the actual law is so and and there's still a lot of confusion and I hear different things and the other concern is liability issues all right facility will maybe not wanting to take an effective side effects now we're doing I want to consider this as a pilot study and not at what they call an institutional review board study which is much more scientific but I want to get some preliminary data then go and get a random randomized controlled study that would allow me to have more teeth in this so we're at this point we're using anywhere from 15 to 20 20 patients and keep in mind I don't know that I could get this done in a federal facility so a skilled nursing facility that's under the regulations of federal regulations I'm not quite sure I can do that and as I mentioned the liability concerns at this point though I'm at least glad that they have legalized marijuana medicinal marijuana in Arizona that allows me at least to opened the door and start these studies yes well you have to go through a Medicare I'm sorry I'm a marijuana prescriber usually all right so I'm a medical marijuana prescriber and so I can it's okay to order it I put my name I fill out a form that your PCP can do that also it's very easy to get a medication marijuana card rather so but for this in this particular study I'm the primary care physician for the most part and if I'm not I will get it through the primary care physician of whoever's the physician for the Alzheimer patient that's not not a patient of mine next fine all right so this is our study anywhere from 10 to 15 to 20 we have approximately 15 patients that are signed up about a 16 week trial we're using the cannabis oil that's been shown to be the best route for patients who have dementia with a 2 to run CBD to THC all right now the other thing I wanted to mention is if you're going to get THC it has to be quantify alright because if I get THC from you and you and you from a particular company it's liable to be a different mo I don't know the amount okay and that's one of the problems when particularly when you buy stuff in the street or on the market wherever you're going you don't know how much you're getting and that's a real problem okay and we're gonna gradually increase these doses every two to four weeks and see what kind of a Reese we are we're going to follow alright with a washout period of time much like the previous study and see whether or not we've done some benefit with this but again all those things that we talked about is it am I where I want to get as the initial start this on initial patience with behaviors before they are on the more serious and more toxic drugs alright we haven't got that far yet but hopefully that would be the initial drug that we might try and I'd like to try that rather than seeing patients on multiple medications alright so we're gonna use the appropriate scales we're gonna have nursing observation which sometimes can be really subjective as opposed to objective go looking at drug reduction including the use of breakthrough medications obviously looking for the adverse reactions and making sure that is there some reversion back to the original behaviors after we stop the marijuana okay next slide break from medicine is I order as needed medicine so if you really get agitated while I'm getting your behaviors under control I'll have them give you some medicine to calm you down during that period of time while I'm working on a broader perspective of getting your behaviors under control our philosophy has always start low so rather than starting high and knocking the patient out I would rather start slow and go slowly but occasionally a little bit may not be enough and you may need some breakthrough medicine okay okay everybody so the side effects perhaps one of the more common ones is increased anxiety associated with tachycardia and that's the THC that's what you get when you take marijuana okay you get a little bit more anxious alright some people all right that's one side effects of too much THC elevation of a blood pressure tachycardia decreased concentration sleepiness so then you get the CBD that might be kicking in headaches dizziness paranoia and hallucinations I mean most of our patients who have to mention behaviors are have hallucinations or paranoia and they have delusions so we don't want to make those worse and the number one factor that we have to look at for this is the drug drug interaction okay I've had a negative success not good success in fact I think I've made situations worse by combining marijuana with anti-psychotic drugs that bothers me it makes me very hesitant first slide do no harm all right so am i doing more harm or less harm and I hate to say this I don't know what the hell I'm doing with the marijuana I mean I really know because we don't have any studies so but this is the biggest concern I go back to the dopamine serotonin and now the cannabinoids in the brain and we're messing with chemicals in the brain so do we know what we're doing and where are we going with that so that's a my biggest concern offhand next slide so where do we stand at this particular you know I guess I've not had positive experiences using marijuana there are those that have had positive experiences now the other effect is is it a placebo effect too so I'm taking medicine but patients don't know so you want to anticipate that you take that placebo component placebo is where you give them something that's not really a medicine and you in a lot of our drugs that are tested are placebo and and and the drug you'd be surprised how many people respond to the placebo a good 20 30 percent respond to placebo and some studies much higher by the way and particularly the drugs that we use are anti-psychotic drugs by the way that we use we need better clarification of the current regulations regarding the use of marijuana and then we need more liberalization of the laws alive for more research you know we've tried for years to do research projects with marijuana but you have to go they need to be federally improved and it's illegal so you can't you can't get a study with marijuana because it's federally against the law and this needs to be changed I mean you can prevent whatever you want to do but let's studies be done so we have a better idea of what's going on so we have a lot of potential but we're not there yet next slide so our goal is provide the best quality of life our patients comes in all walks of life in all degrees of chronic disease all right and so we always need to be looking for ways that we can improve on the health and again here's the case of take you providing the best quality of life as opposed to giving medicines that are going to give you a poor quality of life it's a balancing act it's difficult there is no magic answer all right but this is what ultimately we're looking at and so the next slide so be careful what we wish everybody in this room that came to this lecture I'm sure is saying I hope marijuana is perhaps an answer that we can use in conjunction with making our patients feel a little bit better okay number one on the list by the way it's an industry all right and they are expanding in leaps and bounds and what do you think there's much money being invested in made in its success all right we are a vulnerable population okay and looking for instant relief we always have been will always be and I don't blame us but at the same time we can be exploited and I think I'm throwing the words of caution out and we're not sure yet of the short and long term you hear this constantly over and over we don't know what the short term we don't know what the long term effects are all right so basically we really need to be studying a little bit more before we jump on the bandwagon because you're seeing it on the internet you're seeing it advertised you're seeing it everywhere take this but there's a lot of people making a lot of money it's expensive it's very expensive all right probably more than your routine meds that you take that are prescribed by the doctors and in reality it's not covered by Medicare so and the last slide is what we're really doing is looking to provide that quality of care and quality of life that we want happy patients all of us should you know be in a good place when we're dying death is inevitable and my goal at least is to see that you are in the most comfortable place with the best quality of life and best quality of care not always easy to do but we work hard and that's where geriatrics and hospice Doc's are really important in trying to provide that so with that I'll stop and thank you and any questions we'll open it up to questions [Applause]", "aGRPWLY39Pg": "in november two years ago a law was passed along medicinal cannabis to be prescribed by doctors to help treat patients with epilepsy ms or for people going through chemotherapy however since the law was passed many patients have struggled to access the drug and it seems doctors are reluctant to prescribe it in a moment we're going to be talking to hannah deacon now you remember remember hannah she's been on the show before her son alfie was the first child in the uk to be prescribed cannabis oil we're also talking to neurologist dr mike barnes who's a specialist in medicinal cannabis first though we're going to talk to matt hughes and matt is going to go to the high court to fight the current guidelines this is in a bid to help his son charlie who suffers from a rare form of epilepsy matt good morning to you um tell us about charlie he's three years old um when was he diagnosed with epilepsy and how bad is it so charlie was diagnosed at 10 weeks old with a severe form of epilepsy called infantile spasms or western germans as it's known so being so young the brain is still developing and the basically it's chronic brainwave activity so um it's not in a rhythmical state and that has a detrimental effect on his development as well so obviously through them early years your you know all their little milestones that babies reach charlie wasn't reaching any of them uh so he's now turned three last month uh but his development is that of around a one-year-old um so yeah it's been catastrophic on his development and doctors not always say i think that's and you've got you've got awful sign there unfortunately matt which hopefully somebody can twiddle a knob and reduce the echo that we're hearing here but basically when hannah went through her situation with her son alfie we thought from the home secretary that was the green light and there is this reticence from the governing body on this nice to actually take their mitts off this prescription it's one thing saying yes you can have this but why are doctors afraid to prescribe it essentially everything we're being told is the nice guidelines so we've got now got a nice challenge against noyce in the high court so essentially the guidelines that they've written are so restrictive although they do allow it it's so strict if the doctors don't have the confidence to prescribe um so essentially we're you know we're asking that these they're re-reviewed that you know the guidelines are using modern evidence and new evidence here in the uk and anecdotal evidence as well so nice or relying on randomized control trials um which cannabis doesn't fit into that model um randomized controlled trials are designed to test pharmaceutical uh pharmaceutical medicines cannabis is it's a plant so it doesn't fit that model so i was reading i was reading um that you you have charlie hasn't been prescribed cannabis by the nhs but you have been getting it for him privately since may last year so tell us he was having 120 seizures a day i believe tell us the effect that the cannabis has had on charlie since may last year uh so he started using as you say last year um and initially is he's really alert he's really happy um he come alive so before he was really lethargic and he's suffering some side effects from the the other anti-epileptic medicines and he's just come alive but then we started seeing the seizures reducing um so they've reduced from 120 you know we have weekends where he was seizure free but now you know he's been using it for over a year and it's you know they're no more than 20 a day and the um they're not as severe uh you know they're a lot less um they don't really bother him that much so uh yeah so as a result matt you and i taking the national institute for health and care excellence to court and um and uh they are effectively preventing the nhs from prescribing what you need for your boy let's go to hannah deacon um now on this and your son alfie as ruth said earlier alfie's 98 was the first to get cannabis on nhs prescription probably at the time hannah you thought job done politicians make these big announcements and the public then die down the public go all right that's all sorted then why is it not sorted well you're absolutely right we were very very proud that the law changed on the back of the campaign that we ran with endorphine and actually the reality is is that nothing has changed for people what's crucial to remember is that there are groups of families like matt's family who have been left highly dry by this failure in policy they're having to raise money all the time especially through covid which has been extremely difficult and that's the only thing that's keeping their children safe and out of hospital they're actually not using nhs um funds for looking after the children so this medical cannabis these private descriptions are you know saving their children the law was changed and nhs england said yes you can prescribe as you know doctors can prescribe as any other normal medicine but the hospital trust is saying no you can't describe and nice and other medical bodies are saying no you can't describe because there's not enough evidence so it's just a complete mess and in the middle of it we have very vulnerable people with very sick children who just are desperate to get sorted out the one person that can actually sort this out today and can intervene is matt hancock the health secretary he met with family you've got two hopes of that no hope and bob hope i would say it is so controversial and i want to go hannah i want to go to professor mike barnes to find out why it is so controversial mike you are a consultant neurologist and medical cannabis expert you heard what hannah said quite simply the um the the secretary of state for health he could make this happen we've heard the home secretary before pretending to make this happen and it hasn't happened why do politicians want to run miles away from making a decision on this i find it extraordinary why they do it's a remarkably safe medicine we know that for certain we shouldn't forget that in this country as 1.3 million people use cannabis for medical purposes every day so we know about its safety we know it can work yet for whatever reason nice has come out with a guidance that says we shouldn't use it because they don't think there's enough evidence which is actually nonsense what they've done as matt said earlier is look at it as a pharmaceutical product you can take aspirin and you can compare it against placebos if it works for a headache but you can't do that with a plant so a plant needs assessing of its uh efficacy and its safety in a different way and there's a huge amount of evidence that shows that cannabis medical cannabis can be useful for pain for anxiety and particularly for today for childhood epilepsy that evidence is overwhelming yet they've chosen to ignore it because why do you think that is professor barnes why have they chosen to i mean you're an expert in this field you said the research is there why are they choosing to ignore it i think they're looking at it as a pharmaceutical medicine they're trying to push it down a pharmaceutical route they say there's not enough double-blind trials which means that the patient and the doctor don't know what they're taking and they can assess that properly and that's true we do need more studies i'm not saying there's enough evidence for cannabis but there is plenty of evidence out there and you've got to think of these children have used every possible licensed medication they've been considered for things like diets and surgery and the doctors turned around and said there's nothing more we can do so why in those circumstances were the evidence and the safety don't doctors prescribe cannabis which we know works really well for many people who try it so professor when you weigh up the benefits against the uh concerns and we're talking about the lives of charlie and and alfie there what is your conclusion what would you say to charlie and alfie's parents about what they're doing and how they are finding the results that they are seeing but it doesn't surprise me that the children like alfie uh have made a remarkable improvement on cannabis uh and the important thing about it for any doctor prescribing is whether it's safe and we know that when it's prescribed sensibly by a qualified and knowledgeable doctor then cannabis is remarkably safe it's not the right medicine for everybody we know who to use it for and who not to use it for but for heaven's sake for the children who've tried everything else let's try cannabis see if it helps them describe it sensibly and let's get on and many many of those children will be improved immeasurably matt let's talk about your campaign again against them against nice bringing them to court department of health and social care they're saying at this today they say the decision on whether to prescribe medical cannabis is ultimately one for the clinicians to make now that that obviously is true but it's not happening so so they say well you can if you want so why is it not happening well again it just goes back to the guidelines so charlie you know there's different regulators so you've got the british pediatric neurology association with their guidelines on prescribing cannabis now charlie does meet then those guidelines as do you know hundreds of other children um but they're still not receiving the medicine so ultimately it just goes back to the nice guidelines they're just too restrictive and it doesn't you know cannabis is very new to doctors in the uk and it's new to trust and they just don't have the confidence uh to prescribe until nights then regulatory bodies kind of open up and start allowing hannah one of the things one of the concerns is it's often cited yes but you could be leading these children to being stoned what would you say to that um i would say come and have a look at these children when they've had seizures and they've been in hospital highest kites on pharmaceuticals i've seen my child stoned out of his mind on steroids and global zam and loads of other horrible pharmaceuticals that he used to have to take when he had that hundreds of seizures every week he's not like that now if you use as professor barnes said if you use medical cannabis correctly if you use high cbd and low thc products for children with epilepsy all they do is have happy lives their seizures are reduced my child is a happy little boy who is you know getting so much more out of life and that's why i campaign in this way so you know ardently because it's not fair you know if my child can have this prescription then all these children and what i would say is that these children have been on private prescriptions for 18 months they are the evidence they are showing their doctors every day that their children seizures are reduced that they're not in hospital they're not in intensive care and these doctors are saying well we're not allowed to prescribe and that's the problem trusts have no confidence they are not allowing their doctors to prescribe they are blocking their doctors and this is just unacceptable and as you say we've heard matt hancock's platitudes in the house is common saying oh yes doctors can prescribe it's nonsense it's not true and matt hancock is responsible for this mess he has promised us 18 months ago to sort it out for these families and actually what he's doing he's ignoring us we've written to him we've told him legally how he can help these families and he's ignoring us he can actually set up a fund like david cameron did for the cancer trust um some years ago for cancer treatments he can do that he can help these families but he's choosing not to and he's utterly disgraceful that he's turning his back on these vulnerable people and um last word to you matt how much is it costing you and your family to to provide um charlie who's only three with with cannabis paying it for it privately so initially right at the beginning you know 18 months ago we were looking at 500 pound per bottle um but as time has gone uh the prices have reduced so it's currently 300 pounds uh a month that we're paying yeah professor professor i'm listening to all of this and i'm i'm hearing from the medical authorities that they're worried about the risk what about the risk there is to humans on this and i'm looking at two parents talking about their two children and those children could die at any stage during the day they have multiple fits sometimes over a hundred fits could the risk of cannabis really be worse than the risk of not prescribing them cannabis no cannabis is is remarkably safe we know there are some people who shouldn't be prescribed cannabis those for example with schizophrenia or psychosis but for the great majority of the population it's quite safe to prescribe by responsible doctor who knows and understands cannabis and we shouldn't forget there's more we know about the safety of cannabis than any other medicine in the history of man and the reason for that is 165 million people on this earth use cannabis every day for medical spiritual recreational purposes 165 million people there's not any pharmaceutical product that can be introduced that has that depth of experience and knowledge of its safety profile it's not safe for everyone but it's safe for the great majority and it works for the great majority we must try it thank you for your analysis professor um hannah and matt thank you uh really interesting to hear your story everybody will have an opinion on it but just imagine if you were in their situation of you in the situation of mad and hannah what would you do you", "ZDHG7XJlqg4": "CASES IN THE UNITED STATES IN\nCASES BY STATE ON THE CDC\u2019S\nCOVID DATA TRACKER LOCATED ON CASES BY STATE ON THE CDC\u2019S\nCOVID DATA TRACKER

going on dr frank here founder of addiction mindset recovery coaching programs where we help people quit nicotine thc energy drinks and a whole host of other addictions so if you're in the process of trying to get sober or in the process of trying to stay sober be sure to click that subscribe button turn on your notifications i put out a video each and every day to try and help you so you don't want to miss a beat we have some super exciting content coming up here in 2021 i mean we're going to be covering uh uh an insane amount of topics when it comes to recovery and sobriety and helping you guys build better futures for yourselves so in today's video what i want to focus on though is marijuana withdrawal this video is by popular request and i want to try and paint a timeline for you guys and what it is you can expect when you're going through weed or thc withdrawal symptoms how to navigate those symptoms and how to get through them now i created the same type of video what that relates to vaping and nicotine withdrawal i put the links in the description so be sure to check out the description in this video because i put the links in there for nicotine and vaping withdrawal symptoms and a timeline for that so let's start by talking about the first 72 hours of quitting marijuana or quitting smoking weed okay and before i do that i actually want to make a quick disclaimer quitting black market thc cartridges is very very different from quitting high concentration thc medical cartridges which is very very different from quitting your regular day-to-day herb that's of high quality and not tainted with a bunch of junk in it so you have your black market cart withdrawals you have your high concentration thc product withdrawals which can include medical grade dispensary carts and then you have your day-to-day herb and the withdrawals across the board for those are going to look different on black market being the worst i then think the high concentration thc cartridges giving you more withdrawals than your day-to-day herb which is a bit more balanced out with some of the other endocannabinoids found in the plant or phytocannabinoids found in the plant my second disclaimer is not everyone is going to experience thc withdrawal or marijuana withdrawal some people are able to quit they can flip-flop on and off of the plant like it's nothing some people really really struggle with thc dependence in thc withdrawal if you don't believe me pause this video go check out cj the kid check out his account on marijuana withdrawal he was uh uh he's used multiple different types of substances and drugs and he rated his experience with marijuana up there with some of the other harsh substances so just just something to check out at cj the kid okay now let's jump right into it one of the most common questions i get asked when it comes to marijuana withdrawal or quitting smoking weed is the insomnia that's usually one of the first symptoms you're going to experience in the first 72 hours of quitting and i like to tell people right off the bat don't make a big deal about the insomnia you have to stop stressing over the insomnia because eventually your bra your body is going to allow you to sleep and that's my first piece of advice when it comes to insomnia when your body does give you the opportunity to sleep take it if it's during the middle of the day if you have to leave work and go take a nap in your car if you gotta skip school for a day or two because you need to sleep do it let your body heal you're sick you're going through a detox process take a sick day because eventually your body's gonna demand that you rest and a lot of people stress really intensely over that insomnia and it's not necessary because it's going to pass one of the most common mistakes i see people make or at least i would not advise doing it if it worked for you that's fine is they start to quit weed they're struggling with insomnia so they start taking melatonin they start hitting melatonin vapes don't do this leave the bottom drill at home leave the bottom drill on the counter did don't go to your doctor and get a script for ambient or xanax we're trying to detox your body from drugs not add more substances into your body your body's detoxing and it's healing and it's trying to restore its natural circadian rhythm something you have to realize about marijuana every time you smoke especially the higher concentration products you're impacting your body's endocannabinoid system if you don't know what that is i put a i wrote it out below google it after this video this system regulates your sleep it regulates your mood it regulates your appetite it regulates your bone growth it regulates your hormone production it regulates all types of things so it makes sense that when you quit using marijuana something that dramatically impacts your endocannabinoid system that you're gonna run into some problems some physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms so again let your body heal naturally don't take stuff for the insomnia just get through it it usually passes within the first week or so and i can almost guarantee you once it passes you're probably going to start to experience much better quality sleep than you were ever experiencing while you were using marijuana and the reason for that is because marijuana prevents your body from entering a deep state of sleep or rem sleep that's why you usually don't dream when you smoke a lot and that's why you experience very vivid dreams as you start to get your body back into that state of rem sleep or deep sleep when you stop using marijuana so that's another thing you can look forward to is the really intense really vivid dreams for the first few nights of marijuana detox or thc withdrawal or you know the first 72 hours of quitting weed so that's thing number one insomnia don't make a big deal about it major problem number two that most people experience in the first three to five days is appetite changes i remember when i first quit i really couldn't eat first thing in the morning i woke up i was always kind of nauseous borderline felt like i was going to throw up in the morning which warning could be a symptom of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome this is where you smoke a lot of weed you're constantly vomiting you're losing a bunch of weight you're having muscle pain and joint pain no one knows exactly what it is that's wrong hot showers seem to help this could be cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome chances are your doctor in the hospital they don't know what it is um different topic i put a video link above on that check that out if that's what you're struggling with whole different topic but anyways my appetite i didn't have much of an appetite so i found that i could really only eat one to two meals a day generally speaking when it came to marijuana withdrawal or weed withdrawal i would really focus on healthy foods and plain foods i was a plain jane when it came to my appetite selection chicken and rice cheeseburger and french fries no ketchup no mustard no sauces plain jane plain jane i tried to focus on eating healthier foods i avoided sugars i avoided caffeine those things really seemed to trigger me when i was quitting marijuana i also avoided alcohol for two reasons reason number one when i first started quitting marijuana i found that i was using alcohol to try and help me sleep at night that was a really bad idea because alcohol just messes up your sleep even more it might put you in a state of wipes light sleep but it prevents you from entering a state of deep sleep so i gave up caffeine i gave up alcohol i gave up sugar when i was quitting i mean like i had none i would just drink hot lemon water or herbal tea which is naturally decaffeinated tea it's naturally caffeine free rattler i avoided all those things and i focused on drinking a lot of water two meals a day my first meal would usually be at two in the afternoon or seven o'clock p.m in the evening i really couldn't stomach anything earlier and give your body the foods that it craves listen to your body of course if you're eating like listen most people who quit marijuana crave exactly what i'm talking about plain foods simple foods i also did things like drink bone broth and i also did protein shakes um those were a big help i was a big fan of sun butter peanut butter almond butter i was really big into the nut butters i ate a lot of pickles and i drank a lot of water that was pretty much my diet when i quit smoking weed one to two meals a day plain jane meals no sugar no caffeine no alcohol a bunch of nut butters in between and that was really it pickles that was really it so appetite changes listen your appetite is eventually going to normalize um usually i'd say after about the first month to two months you'll start to notice your appetite coming back exercise is often discussed and again at cj the kid mentioned this and he said something that really resonated with me he said the only exercise his body could tolerate when he first started to quit was swimming and i was actually in a very similar boat one of the few things i could do without having like excruciating muscle and joint pain when i first quit smoking was swimming and it makes sense because i think your body's pain perception is so thrown off when you first quit thc because what it does to your endocannabinoid system doing any type of like weightlifting or really physical stuff might actually hurt and cause you a lot of pain so if exercise is going to be part of your detoxing process i would recommend sticking to something that's very low impact very gentle on your joints maybe you're doing yoga maybe you're doing swimming maybe you're doing pilates maybe you're just taking a walk for 20 to 30 minutes each and every day during the initial phase of your detox process so i agree with cj the kid be careful when you're quitting weed because hey it might be uh jumping into exercise all gun hoe which i'm a big fan of might be a problem for you might be a problem for you what else is real important your support network during this timeline of quitting marijuana during the first three days especially which is where it's most challenging make sure you have a good support network i understand a lot of people they do they quit on their own just solo they wake up one day and they quit but if you have some friends you have some family that you can trust you know use that support network and rely on it because you're probably going to need it when you're experiencing some of those mood changes in the first few days i know for me my anxiety initially increased a little bit i was a little more depressed as well too when i first quit but long term after the first two weeks after the first month i had way less anxiety than i had ever had before and i had way less depression than i had ever had before i'll tell you when i was getting really heavy into smoking i was starting to get panic attacks i'm not the type of guy that gets panic attacks i had never experienced something like that before horrible feeling um and really i it's weird because i was smoking to help me with the anxiety but i was blinded to the fact that the anxiety was actually getting a million times worse because the only anxiety that smoking at this point in my life was relieving was the anxiety from the craving to want to smoke more weed just like the anxiety that you get from a cigarette right it's not actually relieving the anxiety that you're experiencing it's just taking the edge off of that craving that you have for nicotine so my anxiety was getting way worse and i was probably trashing my endocannabinoid system from all the weed i was smoking too in all the different forms so not shocking that i felt much better after i quit how long did it take for me to feel better after quitting weed i would say total probably about three months i really started to feel myself again and remember weed unlike nicotine can stay in your system thc can stay in there for up to i think it is about three months depending on the amount of fat in your body and remember too for those of you guys that start like exercising right away and doing like crash dieting to detox from weed yes that's an option but remember is that fat uh like decreases and drops from your body those fat stores are going to actually release thc into your system so don't be surprised if you feel a little bit funky in those first few days in that first month of quitting especially if you are dropping body weight and exercising and eating healthier because your body is going to be releasing those that thc from those fat stores so i would say about three months now black market carts i'm gonna make a separate video on that because when i was quitting black market carts the the marijuana withdrawals the thc withdrawal it was on another level the the depersonalization the manic behavior the mood swing i mean that was a whole different story now again not everyone is going to experience these withdrawals i hope you guys found value in this quick recap when it comes to marijuana withdrawal the first three days are going to be the worst if you can get through the first three months you're probably going to be golden don't stress over the insomnia feed your body the foods that it craves probably going to be in a quantity of one to two meals a day exercise but be gentle on your body in the beginning because for that first month exercise might be a little bit dicey i would highly recommend cutting out nicotine caffeine and booze during your quitting process and try your best to use your support groups if you're feeling depressed if you're feeling scared if you're feeling sad the last thing i want to happen to you is to go to your doctor and you get put on a xanax or something like that yes always work with your doctor and consult with your doctor before starting a new thing but hey don't hesitate to contact our offices here at addiction mindset recovery coaching we can hook you up with therapists mds coaches like myself we have it all on our team so i hope that video helped you guys good luck quitting let me know what do you need help with in the comments let me know i'll see you guys in the next video where i talk about cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome", "9SFK6jTQFAE": "talk to me about the New Year's Day in in Illinois for your company how did you do you know an incredibly exciting day you know uh decades in the making it was it was phenomenal it was a tremendous amount of support we had the the stores open from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. we had we had people lining up at 8:00 p.m. on New Year's Eve and at some of the stores and and you know throughout the day hundreds and hundreds of people waiting in line to get through like you said we service over 3100 customers yesterday was phenomenal Cresco has 30 licenses in seven states and Sunnyside is your national retail brand how important will Illinois be in the overall portfolio you know it's our home state and we're incredibly well positioned here to through the through the existing medical program you know when our operator has a 100% market penetration twenty-five plus percent market share which is by far the largest market share in the state we have three of the 21 existing cultivation licenses we're the only one with three we only have one other appear with two and everybody else has one so we're very very well positioned here in our home state to take advantage and make the most of this this new marketplace this new adult use market in what form do most buyers buy you know I think it was it was across the spectrum you've got your traditional flower products you've got concentrates and bait pens and edibles and you know depending on familiarity I think you've got some consumers who will tend to be in that flower concentrate formats and then newer more exploratory consumers the the vape pens and the edibles are a lot more approachable charlie are you concerned at all about the crackdown on vaping the crackdown on flavors and what it means for the future of marijuana no you know what we heard most yesterday was the consumers were very happy to have a safe tested compliance focused product offering that they could legally buy in the state of Illinois that was one of the one of the comments we heard most yesterday that's that is the benefit of legalized regulated and compliance focused cannabis is safe products educate me because I don't know how the system works how do you know that the products you are selling meet a certain quality standard and our set are quote safe that's number one and I don't mean to get on any kind of moral high horse do you have any qualms about selling an intoxicant in a world where there probably is plenty of intoxication already sure so I'll dress the first question first you know regulated compliance focused programs like Illinois in many of them definitely east of the Mississippi they set standards they set quality control standards they set safety standards as it relates to microbial contamination residual solvents potencies etc so you know not a single product can leave our production facilities until it's been tested and certified by a third-party lab that's also licensed by the state so that's you know one of the benefits of that legalized regulated cannabis is these consumers are coming into a licensed store and every product that they're buying will have the the test results you know again as it relates to exactly what's in that product from the potency of the cannabis related constituents and then also any any sort of supplements along with verification that there's no residual pesticides or solvents left in the product any qualms about selling about selling a product that is yet another intoxicant know a cannabis has been around for 5000 years my background of being a regulatory attorney prior to getting into the cannabis space it was one of the things that I had to address prior to entering the industry but to be honest with you is one of the things that I knew I had to offer to this developing opportunity in the US was a background in regulatory compliance to make sure that this industry was developed in the right way I think it's I think we're seeing the benefit of safe reliable third-party tested products entering into a market you know you see the data in in in most states with regulated cannabis you see a significant reduction in opioid abuse in those states so that the data is now showing great support for greater access to cannabis products and Charlie the fact that you have sales tax that's going up as the th THC content in these products goes up so 10% for lower THC as much as 20% on other THC what does that do to the desire you know I don't know that it has an impact on desire because again those it kind of goes by category by form right so the lower THC products are going to be your traditional flower products the increased potency products are the the concentrates that are for you know the more well-adjusted and familiar consumers that are able to handle the higher tolerance and it's also you know it the the price per milligram at that point is lower too so the increased taxes we haven't seen a we haven't seen an impact from that again one one day of data but we really haven't seen an impact from that graduating tax rate believe it

Sanjay Gupta captivated the hearts of Americans when he shared her miraculous story of recovery through the use of cannabis oil and Charlotte now lives a vibrant and healthy life wouldn't it be great if we had a plant that was good for our economy our environment and our bodies cannabis is that plan and we've had an intimate relationship with it for almost ten thousand years many ancient civilizations grew it from Asia the Middle East and Europe it was used as clothing rope rigging in sales it was used as food and medicine and even religious rituals George Washington grew it most of the founding fathers grew it and most of the original American colonies were required to grow it and send it back to the British crown and shockingly until the 1900s 80% of the world's clothing was made from hemp and here we are today wearing cotton what happened well in the 1920s new technology emerged and it made hemp incredibly efficient to process and all of a sudden it became a competitor to industries like cotton paper and synthetic fibers these industries use their vast resources and their influence to create a stigma of fear in the American public's mind and this stigma of fear obliterated cannabis as legacy of benefits and after a wave of fear gripped America these industries use their political influence to effectively have cannabis outlawed now interestingly just a few decades later at the onset of World War two the US Department of Agriculture came out and they asked American farmers to grow hemp for the first time in 30 years for the hemp for victory campaign to help the United States win World War two quite a change in propaganda from just a few years before but of course at the end of the war cannabis went back to prohibition and generations never learned of its history or its future potential and we are those generations now before we go any farther let's take a look at cannabis and hemp and marijuana and what we mean when we use these different terms now there are so many different ways to define this plant but we're gonna look at it the way the federal government does and they break it down into two plants hemp and marijuana now marijuana has a couple of uses the most well-known is of course it gets you high and it also has a couple of medical benefits too whereas industrial hemp it cannot get you high it has no psychoactive effects but has over 20,000 commercial applications why did the federal government bother defining hemp in the first place well it was a piece of legislation called the 2018 farm bill and it didn't just define hemp it legalized it for the first time in almost a hundred years and this incredible bipartisan piece of legislation had support from Republicans and Democrats alike because they saw the incredible potential of the plant the next part I'm going to share with you is a little embarrassing but my journey with cannabis began when I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and I found myself getting arrested for possession of a joint of marijuana and after a humbling legal experience and a period of reflection I found myself frustrated with the justice system and the stigmas that surrounded this plant how were we demonizing 20,000 benefits for one use not to mention the millions of lives that were negatively affected it was when I began learning through this frustration about all the incredible benefits of hemp that I went on a mission and after I realized its its history and its future potential and just how we got to where we were at with these stigmas and prohibition I quit my career and I moved out west on a mission to learn more and I worked as a consultant for many different hemp companies in agriculture and manufacturing and in bio plastics and textiles and now as the vice president of a major hat manufacturer I dedicate my time and intention to the reintroduction of hemp into our society and I look back at that experience and I'm thankful for it because it introduced me to the real cannabis and I learned that the stigmas are untrue and that hemp is incredibly beneficial for our economy for our environment and for our health one of the most fascinating benefits economy economically are the vast different uses that we can use hemp for can you guess what this house is made out of hemp Creek hempcrete is stronger and last longer than concrete it's naturally mold fire water and pest resistant and it's an incredible insulator which means it's energy-efficient I like to think that my jeans fit really well and that they look really good but they're also made out of hemp fiber hemp fiber is more absorbent it's stronger it lasts longer and it's more durable than cotton and it's naturally antibacterial and antifungal and interestingly studies have shown that using hemp sheets in medical practices can greatly reduce the cases of staph infection this last example I have for you is my personal favorite and this is a super capacitor and a super capacitor is essentially it's a cutting-edge technology that is a new and efficient battery and in 2014 researchers from the University of Alberta in Canada discovered a way to turn cannabis fiber into super batteries one of the leading researchers from the project said that the super capacitors they created from hemp were stronger and more efficient than any super capacitor on the market and let's not forget about all the other things that hemp can do it can make soap and beer and shoes clothing paper it can even make biofuel and it can make this pen which is made out of hemp bioplastic and it's not just about the economic benefits of hemp it's also about our environment and sustainability hemp is an amazing fight or a mediator which means it actually removes heavy metals toxins and pesticides from the soil and it's deep roots prevent soil erosion it needs fewer chemicals little water and less fertilizer than most other crops one acre of hemp can produce as much paper as four acres of trees and when you consider that hemp only takes four months to grow where trees take decades you start to realize the potential one of the best parts environmentally is that we can use the entire part of the hemp plant from the very top to the very bottom of the roots ensuring that nothing goes to waste and how many of you suffer from chronic pain or inflammation or anxiety cannabinoids like CBD and terpenes are two compounds from the cannabis plant that are on the forefront of a medical revolution they're being used to alleviate all different types of suffering from chronic pain and inflammation anxiety and depression and PTSD gastrointestinal administration and prostate issues fibromyalgia and arthritis it's even good for your pets and as of food hemp seeds are full of protein full of fiber and they're omega fatty acids are in almost complete proportional alignment with our nutritional needs you might have even seen hemp products at your local grocery store like hemp milk hemp oil and hemp protein powder and some of these products are even available in leading national retailers like CVS Kroger and Walmart so if it's so great and if it's legal why don't we see it everywhere well it goes back to that hundred years of prohibition hemp is at a deficit a hundred years of prohibition means a lack of scientific discovery a lack of farming and processing infrastructure and a lack of capital investment not to mention that when you do see those products on the selves shelves you're immediately reminded of the stigma and not their benefits but we have an opportunity we have an opportunity to reintroduce cannabis into our society not with the mindset of the past 100 years but with our feelings about it that lasted for 10,000 years and now we have the science to show exactly what this plant can do but we need your help what can you do simple lifestyle changes that we all can make changes like having conversations around the benefits of hemp and conversations that break the stigmas that we're used to and you can purchase hemp products when you see them on the shelves I'm confident that when we rethink our relationship with cannabis we'll see a time where hemp is as valued and widely implemented as it once was and more than it once was because now science will continue to discover new and exciting uses that will revolutionize our economy our environment and our health thank you [Applause] [Music]", "wczgY4htP0g": "starting today people in utah will no longer be able to go out of state to buy marijuana product which is already illegal under federal law medical marijuana patients will need a card from the utah department of health now before they could have just used an affirmative defense letter from doctors that recommended cannabis for medical purposes the utah patient coalition says about 60 to 70 percent have gotten the new cards and anyone who got in line yesterday to stock up might have a little bit of problem this morning that product also is illegal because they are no longer a medical cannabis patient unless they have the card a bill to make it easier to get one of those cards will be considered in the 2020

the legislation known as the compassion act passed the senate by a vote of 21-8 the bill sponsored by state senator tim nelson of florence it would create a medical cannabis commission to license growers oversee cultivation implement regulations and oversee dispensing of medical marijuana it would prohibit using cannabis by smoking vaping candy or baked good products melson says he was once a skeptic but believes the time has come for medical marijuana in alabama you know we're in a day when when something happens right right away we hear it and somebody's family member has it we see it and i i started listening to people and listen i'm not a recreational marijuana person i don't want that in this state i just want the patients who need it to have it the bill now goes to the house where it has failed to pass in recent years", "r7WHSYRTk18": "each friday on the 4 on 5 we're taking hot topics to the streets today one of the big talkers is the alabama senate passing a bill to legalize medical marijuana something that's already done in 36 states briana hollis is asking you should alabama be next do you see it passing in a state like alabama i think so i think i think it's got momentum now going around the country well i have some i think that there's some positives with that but i've got some concerns i i would be supportive of it if if there were good controls and people live within those controls children used to live in colorado and they taxed it so much to where it helped with the roads and everything and if people if they're going to smoke it they're going to get it one way or another to be honest with you it helps older people like me with their arthritis with their pain anxiety things like that so you'd maybe be for medical but not for recreational but only if the medical would be uh you know managed like other drugs are managed just very tightly and carefully so that there's no abuse it surprises me that alabama hasn't already so to be honest i was pretty surprised with answers that i got today with alabama being such a conservative state you know i worked in wisconsin before kind of a similar situation and people were didn't even want to touch this and here i mean today in downtown fairhope the consensus was they're okay with it they want to see it happen maybe it's a pregnancy hormone but the gentleman who said you know it could help with arthritis it really got to me i know i know we talked about that as the story was writing and he was really nice and i mean he does have a good point the science does show that so it's definitely interesting to hear from him and kind of hear that emotion a little bit from him when he was talking about that yeah it is something kind of opens your eyes and makes you think about that other perspective when you hear people like that or people who say you know they were at the end of their rope and their mother had cancer and got that and then felt better so yeah so what exactly does the bill this one call call for brianna so it's strictly medical and it would allow people with 17 different conditions including cancer including terminal ill situations kind of like you mentioned anxiety arthritis that kind of pain like that gentleman mentioned you will be able to purchase products whether it's in edible form or pills or whatnot capsules but it would have to be from a licensed dispensary and that would be regulated somehow in the state as well and it wouldn't include smoking it yes it would also include it would also include that yes okay so as far as the bill moving forward so it passed the same exact bill passed in the senate last year but when the legislature shut down due to covid19 it kind of put that at a halt so a lot of people who had been advocating for this for a long time kind of saw that as a big win and then with everything shutting down because of the pandemic it stalled and there's also a lot of talk that it's going to move slower through the house likely stahl the house actually wants to put it to another subcommittee first before bringing it to the full floor so no concrete timeline as to when we could get any answers on this quite yet but it is a very interesting conversation thank you brianna", "f1pIkFbjFDg": "a groundbreaking vote on the future of marijuana use today u.s legislatures and the legislators i should say in the house
