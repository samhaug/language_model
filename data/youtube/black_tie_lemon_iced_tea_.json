it a thumbs up and also subscribe to my channel for more such videos so first add in 4 cups of water then add in one and a half tablespoons of tea leaves now let the water boil for about 4 to 5 minutes once the water in the pan reaches this stage stir it with a spoon as you can see the water is boiled so at this stage you need to turn off the flame now let the tea cool down a little now once the tea is cooled just a little strain it leaving behind all the tea leaves as the tea was still hot I kept it on a wooden rack then add in 1/4 cup of lemon juice now stir the tea till the time all the lemon juice is incorporated once the lemon juice is mixed well the tea would look something like this then add in half a cup of granulated sugar to it you can adjust the sweetness according to your taste now keep stirring well for 5 to 10 minutes or until the sugar is dissolved after that let the tea cool down to room temperature and then let the tea chill in the fridge for about 4 to 5 hours once the tea is chilled and ready to be served take some ice cubes and add them in the serving glass then take 2 to 3 slices of lemon and add them in the glass finally add the tea and fill the glass only halfway then fill the glass till the top with some cold water and now your iced tea is ready to be served thank you so much for watching and I hope you liked this video and make sure to hit that subscribe button for more such videos and I'll see you in my next video", "PVv20GDSIeY": "hello my friends it's Danny and today I'm showing you how to make iced tea this is a DIY classic cold brewed iced tea recipe that truly could not be any easier to make it is delicious it's refreshing and it will save you a ton of money if you are used to buying your iced teas from the local coffee shop now to make the tea I like to use this one gallon glass container which holds 16 cups of liquid so usually what I do is I fill it halfway and I'll make 8 cups of tea what I really like about it is that it has a lid on it so when the tea is steeping in the fridge it stays covered you could of course also do this right in a pitcher if you prefer and if you wanted to keep it covered just put a clean dish towel right over the top and I'll be sure to link both of those containers down in the description box below if you want to check either of them out so I'm going to start by placing a teabags in the bottom of the container for a classic iced tea you want to choose a black tea and remember if you want a really great iced tea you want to choose a really great tea so look for a good quality tea that you love personally I love to make iced tea with Earl Grey tea because it's a lightly flavored black tea that's blended with bergamot oil which has this really light bright citrusy flavor so it's the perfect choice for a delicious iced tea and just as a side note you could use this method to make any type of iced tea that you like so if you wanted to do an iced to green tea or an iced herbal tea you could certainly do that the options are endless then I'm gonna pour 8 cups of room-temperature filtered water over the top of the teabags you could also do this with cold water but I do want you to avoid doing it with hot water because remember this is a cold brewed iced tea recipe and the reason I prefer this method is because I find that it really does make a cleaner tasting more smooth bodied iced tea whenever I make iced tea with hot water number one the tea tends to get a little bit cloudy and number two the flavors just a little bit more bitter so while the cold brew does take a little extra time to steep the lite-brite fresh flavor is well worth the wait then I'm just gonna give this a light stir pop on the lid and then place this in the fridge you want it in the fridge for a minimum of eight hours normally I just make this in the evening and then let it sit overnight so that the tea is ready to go the next day and another side note I wanted to mention if you like a really really strong brewed iced tea you could reduce the water to six ounces per teabag instead of eight ounces per teabag and that would get you a strong brewed tea once the tea has steeped for a minimum of eight hours you're gonna see that it has this nice rich color and it is ready to serve so the first thing you want to do is scoop out those teabags and then you've got a couple of options now if I'm making this tea for my family just to have for the week I'll just leave it in the refrigerator in this container with the lid on just like this and then when somebody wants a glass I just fill it glass up with some ice add the tea over the top and then add a big fat squish of lemon if we want it sweetened my personal favorite way to sweeten it is with liquid stevia I like the liquid stevia because number one it's plant-based it doesn't add any sugar it doesn't add any calories it's not going to affect blood sugar levels and it's already liquid so it blends right into the iced tea so I usually do anywhere between four to six drops give it a stir and it makes the most delicious refreshing glass of sweetened tea now on the flip side if I was going to make this iced tea for a barbecue or for a bunch of friends or family then I would pull out my pitcher pour the tea into the pitcher put in a whole bunch of ice some fresh lemon and then again decide if I was going to sweeten it or not if I was I would just do the math right so about five drops of liquid stevia times eight so I do about 40 drops of the stevia and mix that all together if you do not want to do the liquid stevia you could also take somewhere between two and four tablespoons of honey to spending on your taste mix it with a little bit of hot water and stir that into your iced tea and that would get you a nice lightly sweetened iced tea without using any refined sugars so whichever one you prefer they will both get you a delicious result this tea it's so light it's so refreshing I love that light citrus flavor I'm telling you this is a recipe you're gonna find yourself making all summer long it is just too easy and too delicious not to and when you do don't forget to snap a picture

nice large slice this will be used for garnish so he sets it aside and crabs his [ __ ] sets down grab his lemon squeezer he's a squeezer thingy he busts a lemon in and proceeded to squeeze half an ounce as all he needs with that into the glass it goes that doesn't seem like much but it's sufficient then he grabs a good bourbon this case he's using bullet two ounces to the top but he spills it quite everywhere on this wooden cutting board but fear not it is not wasted especially since he cleans up because that's and squeezes the rest just kidding he reaches for clothes and counts out 6 3

together but we were both also born and raised in the south Becky's from New Orleans and I'm from Macon Georgia and today we just wanted to take a minute to show you all how we make tea back home everyone in the South puts their own spin on making sweet tea we've realized our recipes are quite similar so today we're gonna show you how to do it so here's what you'll need to make a gallon of sweet tea first you'll need four cups of boiling water second we're going to be using six Lipton cup size teabags or if you have family sized teabags on hand you can use three family sized teabags for this recipe you'll also need just a pinch of baking soda and finally we'll need some sugar today's recipe is going to be using a cup and a half honestly you can sweeten to taste and I will admit I have been known to use two and a half cups of sugar in my sweetie finally we'll also be topping off with enough cold water to fill your gallon pitcher at the end jannis to purists however I'd love to add lemon and fresh mints bye sweetie so have some of that on hand as well if you like so let's get started bring four cups of water in a medium sized saucepan to boil once it boils remove it from the direct heat and now you're ready to put in your tea bags an old trick the becky actually taught me was to tie the strings of your teabags together this prevents the teabags from falling into the water or swimming away or even from the tags from falling into the burner and actually catching on fire once you've got the teabags tied simply drop into your pot give them a quick dunk make sure you put the lid back on the pod and then let's let the tea steep for about 15 minutes now that your teas steep for about 15 minutes move the cover and remove the teabags make sure to give it a good squeeze my grandmother taught me a little trick just a pinch of baking soda will prevent the tea from being better as well as give it a nice gorgeous color now that we've added the baking Center we're ready for the secret ingredient the sweet tea the sugar as I said earlier we're gonna be using about a cup and a half of sugar today so want to measure that out a way that I know that teas to my sweetness liking is I want my lips to almost pucker when I taste it once we thought all the sugar added to our tea we want to give it a really good stir you want to make sure that all of your sugar dissolves completely so don't be afraid if it takes a minute if you do start to have issues though feel free to put it back on the stovetop just to give it a little extra heat which will help the dissolving process once it's all dissolved you're ready to pour the tea into the pitcher excellent and now all we have to do is top off with cold water to fill the pitcher [Music] now you're all done just refrigerate to cool our sweet teas now been chilling in the refrigerator for several hours so it's ice-cold and ready to enjoy some freshmen Cheers delicious so there y'all have is a sweet tea that

"v_qHWgmsPrw": "  Let's just go ahead and face it If you're making cold brew at home, from scratch, you're addicted to coffee. And maybe, well, probably just caffeine as a whole. But that's okay. Let me be of assistance. Why \"cold brew\" right? Why? Cold brew vs Iced Coffee Cold brew extracts the coffee very slowly over a long period of time which limits the amount of acidity and bitterness that is already involved in coffee making. The heat in coffee tends to extract a little bit of bitterness and much more acidity. Whereas with cold brew, you got a lower acidity, lower bitterness And an overall smoother flavor. And more importantly, a higher -- wow that is a lot of saliva My mouth is obviously getting excited for cold brew. Plus not to mention a much higher caffeine content so -- You're welcome. Now with cold brew comes good beans. Obviously that's kind of a given but you know, use your favorite or ideally use a locally sourced, maybe a freshly roasted coffee. Some sites say that older coffee is better but that is up to you. Now we're going to be doing two different methods. But they both use the same grind consistency and same ratio of coffee:water. Now we're going to start off by grinding 1.5 cups (80g) of coffee beans. Now when you're grinding the coffee, keep in mind that you want the grind consistency to be relatively course, something like course cornmeal. Then simply add that coffee to a half gallon container. In this case, I used a half gallon mason jar. They're really great and they're cheap. Now for Method 1 which is the Immersion Cold Brew method. So to these beans you're going to add 6 cups (1400g) of cold or room temp water. Either/or, you just don't want it to be hot. Ideally filtered. Give that a good stir to make sure you've hydrated all the grounds. Put a lid on it and place it in the fridge for 12-24 hours. 24 hours will make a much stronger brew. And 12 hours will make a pretty light brew. Now for Method 2, the Hot Bloom method. This is essentially the same thing but this time you're only going to add 1/3 of your water which has been heated up until it's steaming hot, not quite boiling but pretty hot. And if you want to be specific, probably 205 degrees F Give that a little stir to hydrate the beans And let it sit for 1 minute, no more no less. Then immediatly after that minute add the remaining 4 cups of water and make sure that water is cold. So you want to cool this mixture right back down. Yet again, give it another stir. Put a lid on it and in the fridge for 12-24 hours. Now once that 12-24 hours is up Remove it from the fridge and now we gotta strain it. Now since I've give you two different methods to brew the cold brew It only seems right to give you two different methods to strain it. Now the first one, would be through a fine mesh strainer with cheesecloth laid over it. Downside and drawback of this method is that if you strain it through this and you're grinder doesn't get a super consistent grind then it's gonna be a little bit gritty. You're gonna get a little bit of grittiness through there. So this may not be a good choice for everybody. Now the other method that I've figured out is pouring through a pour-over type coffee situation. So I'm basically pouring it through the filter of the pour-over AKA my Chemex. And this actually filters out all the grounds. So it's super smooth, no gritty Literally zero grittiness no matter how inconsistent your grinder is. Takes a bit longer but hey, it works. Now you can also get this thing called a CoffeeSock. It basically brews it and strains it for you. I'll put a link in the description if you want to get it. I personally don't use one but a lot of people have been DMing me on Instagram about it So I thought I'd give it a little shout out. So that is it, Cold brew coffee. I don't really know what else to say. It's coffee. It's iced. It's got a lot of caffeine in it. Much more than regular iced coffee. And whichever method you choose, I trust you.

in this video I'm going to be sharing with you three different methods for making iced cold tea and we're going to be trying to choose a winner this video is going to go under the tea recipes playlist if any point in time you enjoy this video then please give it a thumbs up the more something the air the more tea videos are going to come your way and if you haven't subscribed to our YouTube channel yet then go click that button it is a sunny Sunday in London summer has finally arrived and it is hot and whenever the weather heats up we all crave a nice cold drink now you can drink hot tea on a sunny day in fact hot drinks in hot weather has been shown to help cool you down just as much if not more than drinking cool drinks but hey there is nothing better on a hot day than sitting back with an ice-cold drink and I'm always disappointed whenever you go to barbecues or you or you visit friends that there isn't more iced tea about everyone's drinking juices or drinking alcoholic beverages but where is the iced tea and those bottled iced teas that you can buy in the shops they tend to have a lot of artificial flavors or lots of sugar in and they don't use high-quality tea URL tea heads we want to really maximize the flavor texture and aroma of the tea when we are making iced tea so let's go through the different methods so first of all I'm working here with a green tea let me see see if you can see this you know what I put it in a glass so you can see the colour this is a Maki no Hara Shizuka Sencha this is mushy which means it's deep steamed and that's going to give the iced tea a beautiful color a really nice green color this is a tea that we are planning to get into stock it may leaf so keep your eye open for that and the reason why I picked this tea is because green tea is the most sensitive it's the most sensitive to reacting with time it's also a great tea for ice because it has so much so many of those bright light aromas it's got so much of those fresh aromas that iced tea just really suits well with it but you can do this with all teas this tea is probably the most sensitive and so the the attributes that we can assign to each different method of brewing iced tea their floor was in the successors will be amplified with the green tea so that's why I picked the green tea alright let's go through the method method number one is probably the most simple method and the method that most people use which is simply that you brew the tea as you would normally brew it and so in this case I brewed two teaspoons in about five hundred mill of water and the water is at about 75 or 80 degrees which is about 170 175 Fahrenheit and brewed it for about a minute and a half two minutes until I was happy with the strength and then I just strained it off into this jug and let it go to room temperature and then put it in the fridge and let it cool so this was done overnight you cooled overnight and we did this yesterday and you can take a look at the color of this now the color of this is slightly more yellow and slightly more cloudy than the fresh brewed tea so that's method number one and probably the most common method method number two is this one so for this one this is cold brewed tea so I've done a video on cold brewed tea before I'll put a link in the description below if you're interested to find out more about that but this is cold brewed which basically means we've taken the same amount of leaf in the same map water but we've just poured cold water over the leaf and put it in the fridge so this has taken its time to extract over about I would say about 14 hours or so it's been sitting in the fridge extracting and the beautiful thing about cold brewed is because it's in cold water it doesn't extract too much of the tannins so you don't get too much of the bitter notes of tea so even though the leaf as you can see is sitting at the bottom of this container it hopefully has not gone bitter so we're going to try that one there you go so that's a cold Brews method now you can take the leaves and brew them with hot water and then once you've finished a session take those leaves that still have a few more infusions to go put them in cold water in cold brew that way but I wanted to make these exactly the same so we have a fair comparison okay so these are the first two methods and I had to do these in advance for obvious reasons now let's brew up the third method and the third method is flash chilled and this is what we do at the main leaf tea house so if you ever visit us in London in Camden and you order an iced tea from us then we will flash brew it which means we're going to brew it fresh and then shake it over ice so I'm going to put these two teaspoons of the math you know harder fuku mushi Sencha in there I'm going to rinse this out the wonderful thing about working in the garden you can just pour it anywhere you want and I'm going to pour this I'm going to pour so we're going to try to match the same amount of liquid which is not going to be too easy but we'll try so normally I'd be pouring to kind of where the spout joins the teapot about here that's something in the region of about 450 mils something like that but because we're going to be shaking this over ice we want to want to do less than that so I'm going to do about half so here we go we're going to pour it in I would say to about here that's about half and we're going to leave it again I think that that with flash shield teas you want to leave it just a little bit longer maybe about two minutes so that you extract the most amount that flavor now what we're going to be doing after that is we're going to be straining this tea over ice you can do this you don't need a shaker you can do this in a jug like this and just put some ice in and stir it it's not necessary shaking it is a more flashy way to do it but it also means that you get these kind of little ice crystals forming which gives it a slightly more refreshing feel to it so these are the teas let's give it while this is brewing let's have a little sniff of the dry leaf oh this is a beautiful ginger fresh picked so I'm getting notes of toasted rice fresh-cut grass obviously that very very green not too many see notes not too many marine air notes more like stream like forest stream like that very fresh forest stream air so you're getting a bit of the pine you're getting bit of the grass getting the rocks you're getting that stream but there is definite warmth to it I would put it as toasted rice potentially kind of yellow bamboo those kinds of notes okay right so now that we have our tea brews I think that was about two minutes something like that you guys are on the stopwatch not me so now the idea is to pour this through a strainer you can pour direct and have the leads in here and shake it like that and then strain afterwards completely up to you no problem you can do that at this point you could also add flavorings like maybe some herbs maybe you could put some mint maybe you throw some ginger in so you shake it all up together that's also possible to do as well we'll talk a little bit about that in a second alright so I think that that's good so we're going to pour this out through a filter you have to filter these centers especially the fluke a mushi because the fukken mushi is deep steamed it means that the leaf is really broken up quite a lot so you need to put it through a nice fine filter like this so we're just going to make sure that that has gone through okay you can use this again you could throw this in cold brew and it would brew up really really nicely I'm just going to put that to the side okay so now I want to try and judge how much ice to put in it to try and match it it's always a surprising quantity I'm going to put in I'm going to put in probably about nine cubes of ice put this on this is where I make a mess shake it up you can feel it just going cold immediately okay okay so here we go right so now we're going to pour this iced tea into this glass and I think I've done a pretty good job of matching the amounts so let's put them all together and you can see method 1 method tune-up method 3 so first of all let's talk about color obviously this color has oxidized you can see that it's gone much more yellow its oxidized so the reason for that is because it was brewed with hot water it extracted everything out but then it was left for too long it was left in the fridge that's reacting with the oxygen in just this little chamber its reacting with it in it's starting to oxidize that means it's going to affect not just only the color but it should also affect the flavor whereas these two are beautiful beautiful colors right nice light green you asked me in which my favorite is it would be this one here because this is a deeper green it's still very vibrant still very fresh but it's a deeper green and looks really really really enticing and I can't wait to taste that alright so those are the looks but let's do a taste test these are fresh out of the fridge so they are very very cold as well now you can garnish you can do whatever you want you could add yourself a little stem of lemongrass some ginger little slice of ginger or some mint leaves as I said before you could also flavor these at any point so if you wanted to add some some fruit nectars you wanted to add some cordial you could that's completely up to you but I wanted to taste what they're like just pure alright so here we go method 1 method two and finally the beautifully frothy method three this is where I pour tea all over my phone okay and since this has ice in it there's nothing sadder than a cold drink without some clinking sound going on so you've got a you've got to throw an ice cube in keep it cold that way you get the nice clinky effect okay so visually clearly this is the winner but let's go with texture first so I'm not going to concentrate and taste just concentrate on texture and finish good texture quite I would say medium but the finish is definitely dry I can feel the oxidation that's happened I can feel this drying sensation throughout my whole mouth ahh world of difference soft smooth the cold brewing makes it sticky just it because the leaf has been in there it's developed to that body really really over the 1214 hours the body is really thick soft no dryness and I already am getting a lot more taste out of it but we'll talk about that later finally the flash chilled I would say the texture is somewhere in between for this one so because you've hot brewed because we've use hot water to brew you are pulling out those tannins a bit more and so I'm getting the texture but it's it's a much more light biting texture to dryness which comes it's more of a mineral dryness is actually quite an enjoyable dryness and it's more in the front of the tongue rather than catching on the throat try one more time yeah this is a kind of cloying catching sensation whereas this is like a nice mineral chalky kind of dryness that's actually quite quenching right let's move on to taste and I can already tell you that this one is not is not making me very happy at all tastes old it tastes it tastes okay so I'm getting the cut grass I'm getting the bamboo green bamboo but it just tastes old I mean I can't really put it any better way it tastes like it's been sitting it takes slightly stagnant it just doesn't have the same vibrancy as you would want from this tea and this is why green tea is a great one to test it on because you'll really notice it with the green tea it's not unpleasant it's a bit bitter it's kind of got more kind of dry grass notes a little bit of hay and it's just dialed down in terms of the brightness is like you've taken an EQ a nice bit of music and you taking the treble off it's just very very dull tasting okay cold brew Wow so I'm so much more than okay so we've talked about textures and a lot thicker but the taste is I'm getting green bamboo I'm getting mineral I'm starting to pick up some of the floral notes very kind of light dusting of kind of high note hyacinths kind of aroma those kind of sweet meadow flowers but very very light it's not it's not a floral tea by any stretch of the imagination but it's there do you mommy is coming through as well and getting that slight savory note to it which is great with Japanese green teas bright very bright but balanced as well so I'm getting new mommy I'm getting the the toasted rice nose but those slight floral notes the cut grass is not really cut grass it's more like uncut grass it's more like when you're sitting in a meadow and you're kind of you know having a picnic and you're lying down you're getting that kind of just nice fresh grass but quite early morning dewy kind of grass tastes delicious I would be so happy if I went to a barbecue this summer and somebody was serving this that would make my day okay flash chilled beautiful color beautiful darker more rich powerhouse full flavored as I said it's got more of the dryness it's got some of those tannins coming out but I really like that if you don't like that then brew with cooler water and you'll you'll control that but the flavor now I'm getting a lot more of the cut grass I'm getting a lot more complexity there's something yeah I don't know if you know these umeboshi these pickled Japanese pickles kind of sweet fragrant Japanese pickles that they put on the side of dishes like rice dishes or sushi when they are serving in Japanese restaurants there these pickles and umeboshi is one of my favorite ones it's kind of got a very kind of floral rosy flavor gorgeous this one has the most amount of complexity so selecting choosing a winner clearly this is out so this is what I would advise people to stay away from if you're going to do cold if you're going to make iced tea then please don't make this method because it's not going to do justice to the tea that you're using these two however are both amazing they are both delicious the differences I would say the pros of this one is texture the texture of this is so rich thick and soft it's a very smooth soft drink and you get a lot of flavor more of the bright notes more of the high notes less of the tannic notes less of the bitterness less of that kind of satisfying quench then this one this one has the most amount of flavor it's the most complex and it has that bitterness which leads to sweetness and I really love that but if you're looking for something that's very soft and elegant then this is probably the one to choose up to you guys feel free to experiment let me know the outcomes of your experiments in the comments section below that's it tea heads if you made it to the end of

thursday on christmas eve i'm laying in bed i was watching a christmas movie just like many other people on christmas eve were doing and i hear this god-awful smile it was just one smack and i had no idea where it came from it echoed throughout the city i immediately called my neighbors i'm like hey john do you know what the hell is going on he had no clue the next morning i wake up and i see the twisted t memes it led me back to the twisted t video and i put it all together it was the smack heard throughout ohio now wait before you click off the video i know you've already seen this video and i'm not gonna replay it or regurgitate the same information that's already out there i wanted to know more about the man who was talking [ __ ] i wanted to know more about the black man who stood there patiently waiting for this man to get out of his face i mean he handled himself better than most men could but it made me want to dig deeper after finding all these news articles that didn't have much information i spent the majority of the day trying to figure out who the white man was meet randy teeter randy lives in alleria ohio randy even docks his own address in that video two blocks away so randy lives two blocks away from that circle k he was not lying there is minimum information on randy online basically i know he went to elyria high school and he still associates or has contact at least through facebook with some of his high school friends i reached out to randy and i wanted some more information i explained tony that i wasn't trying to smear his name in any way or proclaim him to be a racist the internet is already doing a good job at that but i asked him a few questions such as exactly what date this happened on i also asked him what led up to the altercation was this something that happened outside did it happen back by the coolers i want to know more information about what led up to him going on this rant and calling this man the n-word several times i asked was law enforcement involved i was interested in looking into getting the reports from that night then i asked if he sustained any serious injuries from that twisted t well as you may have guessed randy never answered my request he never even opened up the message and i gave him plenty of time to respond my best guess is randy is staying away from social media at this point i can only imagine what this man is going through given the fact that he is now called out as being a racist and he got his butt beat on camera by a twisted t now let's talk about the man who ended 2020 with a bang the man the legend himself mr barry allen and how i found barry was i was looking up the twisted t video i checked it out on google it led me to some twitter feeds and that's when i ran across a post from a young lady who shared a gofundme page she stated that the allen family was going through a lot lately and they do not need any more drama in their lives and i found out a lot of sad personal info about barry i think barry's the type of man who doesn't want publicity from this barry doesn't want fame he doesn't want the drama i don't think he wants that nor needs that in his life at this time his son is only six years old and he has a mutation disorder basically his son has gone through countless surgeries and he's come out fighting every time they started a gofundme to purchase a wheelchair accessible van so they can get their children around the places but not only was barry going through the emotions of his six-year-old child having this medical condition barry recently lost his job due to personal reasons regarding his family he needed to spend some time with him and take some time off and he ended up losing his employment over that so can you imagine this man goes into a circle k all he wants to do is get a twisted t take his butt home and watch some christmas movies with his family and then he gets up to the counter and he has this [ __ ] in his face most men would not be this patient they would already lost their [ __ ] and beat the crap out of this guy now one more thing before you get off here i barely ever share a gofundme or ask anybody to donate anything so if you're feeling generous go ahead and check out that gofundme page i'm sure even five bucks will help out their family i appreciate each and every one of y'all i'll see you all in the next video", "gGFCVS2yFCE": "hey folks look if you know anything about the robinson family we're known to get together okay and then uh get around the table and have something that is delicious to eat you know phil cooks the jambalaya shows people how to do it mental stone been showing people how to to grill food on the grill okay that i'm uh sponsoring all right oj southern eye hammerstone with frog gigging and then jay showed hey let me show you how to cook a delicacy okay frog legs hey that ain't nothing okay that ain't what we went through all right what we into right now okay is i'm gonna show you important stuff first thing off boys hey you got your tea container all right and i think my wife buys okay this is community the family pack okay so hey you know pretty good sized pack of tea all right so that's four that's five all right i like mine kind of stout all right boys yeah last thing last thing you want is when you drink tea just to have it in a glass you know have it in a glass something like this right here let's get it just clean glass have you a glass of tea in there like that and then you can you can pick up a newspaper and you can actually read the newspaper through the teeth that means it's too weak all right boy it's got to be yo like i said i like mine stout this is the age of technology so there's two way you can do this you could put this in a pot and put it on the stove okay and boil it or you can just put it in here in the microwave right quick get the time on it okay cook time six minutes and stop now we play the waiting game boys for about six minutes oh here he goes again he got the knife up and he fell on it yep he fell on it [Laughter] all right first of all let me get my jug out ready all right boy i'm putting my water in here this is a gallon jug got them jugged i'm gonna put it about oh three quarters full maybe a little less than three quarters all right that's close enough all right as you see it as your water it's ready as soon as that thing beeps all right we'll take it out of there and put a saucer on it okay and then you would let it seep okay for about uh it should be cool you should let it cool off from heating because this that the microwave is gonna boil it all right so you need to just let it sit on on the counter for like 45 minutes maybe an hour and it'll be be you know you could do it while it was warm but it's better to let it get cold then you pour it up and then you have your teeth it's ready and here's the deal all right we was on uh dr oz show right and the whole family was there my okay field you know all of us you know and he asked uh who who who do you think's the healthiest person in here you know and jessica jumps up jeff's wife says hey i am cause i'm youngest he said nah he said he is he pointed to me and he said the reason why is that boy drinks about two gallons of tea unsweet okay and tea has antioxidants medical term okay got all kind of good things that is good for the body okay so that's another reason to drink you know unsweet tea put sugar in it right now then you start getting the belly like i'm getting right now i'm gonna have to start working out and get rid of this better too many sweets got to give up ice cream got to give up twinkies all that good stuff all right thanks beep ah here we go all right boys so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna do this right here and what i'm doing here is i'm i'm actually rushing this seeping process by letting it go down in in the water because if it ain't if it ain't set there for about 30 minutes so you got to do this where it'll be dark enough because you know like that you don't want it teeth you don't want it light where you can read the newspaper to it you want it dark all right well that ought to be good enough i would squeeze that but hey that that water's just been boiling so now i ain't squeezing it okay that's good enough that's all you do boys right here but i actually make two gallons a day i'll drink one during the daytime and then close to getting night i'll be having i'll probably have about that much left in the second gallon just while i have enough in the morning for half a glass when i get out of bed most people drink coffee i drink tea and it's not hot i do like hot cup of tea or whatever it's good yeah especially if you put lemon in it or something you know mix it with something but that's that's the cooking lesson for the day on making good tea and it's good for your body so until next time when we're cooking something else adios [Music] you", "7VIpQcEH5MQ": "walk in the black-tie kitchen my name is that in this video I'm gonna show you how simple it is to make simple syrup create a glass bottle sugar distilled water a funnel and a scale if you have one we're also gonna be using the kettle to warm up some water you can also use a microwave if you don't have a kettle just get some hot water we're adding about a cup and a half of distilled water because you don't want the off flavors that you can get from tap water or filtered water next we're measuring out about a cup and a half of sugar which here is gonna be about 250 grams once you have that set it aside and get your bottle on cap it put your funnel in and start adding your sugar simple syrup is a one-to-one sugar to water ratio so what we have with the sugar and 250 grams are going to use in water let's bring the scale back in and we begin to add our hot water you don't have a scale just measure out a cup of sugar and a cup of water and you're good to go cap it and shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake it for a little bit and set it down it may look a little bit cloudy but give it a few minutes and it'll be crystal clear put this in your fridge for up to 4 weeks using your cocktails or coffee and your cakes and if you don't put it in the fridge well that's how you get ants if you like this video share like and subscribe and until next time thanks move [Music]", "zhlkqOkGU8c": "hey guys it's Margaret from days well-spent and in today's video I'm going to show you how to make the most refreshing mixed berry iced tea you're going to need some blackberries raspberries and blueberries you'll also need some tea bags I like to use Lipton but use your favorite something to match the berries with a potato masher or a fork works just fine and then you'll also need some water to brew your tea with so for the tea bags you're either going to need three family size teabags or ten to twelve small teabags depending on how strong you like your tea if the tags are on and go ahead and remove the tags and then tie your teabags together if they have a string okay so we're gonna begin by heating up our water this water is already hot I have two quarts in here and you're gonna want to use more water if you have a larger picture we're going to take the teabags that we prepared drop them in and the burner is off and I'm going to go ahead and slide this to the back and set my timer for eight minutes okay so while our tea is brewing let's go ahead and get our berry mixture ready I've got one cup of fresh raspberries that have been rinsed got one cup of fresh blackberries also have been rinsed and now a half a cup of blueberries again rinsed and made sure that there's no stems on any of the berries come ashore and mash these up you can use a fork now we need to get our lemon juice and we need 1/4 of a cup of lemon juice that's usually about one medium sized lemon I love this little juice or mindfully to it it just fits on any mason jar or a cup that's equivalent I like it because I can juice in it and then stick a lid on it and store it in the refrigerator if I have more than I need add that to the mixture and now we need to add our sugar you're gonna want anywhere between 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup of sugar depending on how sweet you like it you can also use honey so now we're just going to stir this all around and our teabags are just about done but now our teabags are done you want to carefully remove the teabags I'm doing is just adding the berry mixture to the tea you want to go real slow so it doesn't splash okay so now what I'm going to do is let this cool just a little bit before I put it into the refrigerator we're gonna refrigerate it for about three hours and you want to make sure that you leave the berries in there wallets cooling that's gonna allow the berry mixture to infuse with the tea okay so our tea has been in the refrigerator for about three hours I'm gonna go ahead and give it a good stir what I'm gonna do is pour it into the picture I have a strainer on top of my picture you could also use some cheesecloth if you don't have a strainer that fits on to your picture I'm just going to empty this that can go into our compost bin the reason you want to into your strainer is it'll just go faster if it there's not a lot in it let's drain this last little bit and you can see the strainers captured all of those larger particles and the seeds okay after you give that a good mix you want to go ahead and add the rest of the raspberries blackberries and blueberries remember these are unmatched and to serve it all you do is pour it over a glass of ice you can strain off the berries or pour them into the glass and enjoy them while you drink your tea I hope you enjoy this mixed berry tea as much as I do if you have any questions about making infuse teas or about the instructions that I gave during this video be sure to let me know down in the comment section and I'll be happy to answer them as always be sure to visit days well-spent for more inspiration", "ww7MXIkzLiA": "hey guys welcome back to my channel so I posted this picture on Instagram of me and this turban look and received a ton of feedback and requests of people wanting to see a tutorial so stay tuned if you want to see how I got this look starting on hair that was previously curled I did perm rods but they were ruined so I just decided to go ahead and wrap my hair and determine for the day so I'm spritzing my hair with water to react some moisture and I'm also going to add some Shea Moisture jamaican black castor oil leave-in conditioner so I'm going to prepare my hair for a puff on top of my head this is pretty much how I do my puffs except most of the time I add more gel it really doesn't matter how you put it up and it doesn't have to be really tight either and I'm using this piece of a headband I will insert a picture but I pretty much by those sweatbands and I cut them in half to make this piece of fabric and I tie it so I can make it as tight as I want or as loose as I want and this is how I make my puff and I'm tying mine pretty loosely I'm not you know gonna make it too tight you basically just want it in a good spot on top of your head if you have shorter hair I've seen other girls use a t-shirt or some other piece of fabric to just go ahead and put in place on top of their head to create the hump so here I'm adding some eco styler gel to my edges and we'll brush that in I'm just because I do like to leave some of my edges out of my scarf and I like to style them for the look [Music] so this is a scarf I'm going to be using I received this from a vendor on Instagram and this one is two yards long went to make sure it's even on both sides and go ahead and tie it just kind of like you're tying a bow and just you know checking to make sure everything it's even and all my hair is in in the back and on the sides so from here I'm just pulling it tighter and making sure all my hair is covered at the top and then I'm going to tuck this top piece that was sticking out under the part that I tied in the middle and just make sure that's all tug to make sure all my hair is tucked away as well and this is what it looks like before I tie the rest of the scarf so I'm going to take that right hanging piece and just basically wrap that around not too tight and tuck that into the front section [Music] I'm going to do the same thing with that left piece wrap it around and took it into the front section as well I'm just playing with it making sure all of the pieces are secured and making sure that I like how it's looking and so I'm gonna pull my edges out just a little bit and I'm going to be using Carol's Daughter edge control to style my edges [Music] this is pretty much to finish look this is a super cute and just easy style to do it's really quick as you guys can see you just probably have to practice with tying your scarf it's not going to come out the same way each time thank you guys so much for watching and definitely stay tuned for more videos and don't forget to like comment and subscribe", "g-Y5gZzn6lM": "what's going on guys Bobby with consumer time capsule back with another review for you here and today we're at the capsule to talk to you about a brand new brisk iced tea it's symbiotic dark cherry limeade Brian you get a good angle on that bottle alright so this is I guess a like a promotional product in conjunction with the movie venom which was released on October 5th to feeders nationwide so basically what I'm saying is this has probably already been out for a few weeks and if you really want to try it now is definitely the time to do it I found the 2-liter bottle first a few weeks ago at Kroger for only a buck and then recently at Way Field in Atlanta Georgia I found the 1 liter which is just much easier to store in a collection so I did pick this up as well we're gonna take a quick pour here so you can see what the drink looks like kind of unencumbered by all the plastic that may have a little bit of a color to it there so there is your symbiotic dark cherry limeade brisk iced tea now one thing I do want to call y'all's attention to is brisk did a line of half and a half iced teas in 2014 and they did have a iced tea cherry limeade but it wasn't dark cherry so this may be different and it does have a really nice look to it like if you're gonna if you're gonna do like a movie product tie-in kind of thing this looks kind of creepy and I've got to imagine is is venom that's like a probably like a scary movie or is it a superhero movie scary scary superhero movie I apologize the only movie I watch is home alone as I've said here many times so first off and Ryan asked a really good question before we even started it only has 16 grams of sugar for a 12 ounce serving which for sweet tea is actually quite low but it really you get a lot for those 16 grams it is packed with taste and it's really it's it's a lot more cherry limeade well let me rephrase that so one more dark cherry than it is limeade or iced tea I'm getting a lot of cherry flavor what do you think Ryan I mean it can you can you detect some tea and more importantly can you detect any lime maybe a little maybe a little bit on the finish just a little bit on the finish and making a little bit little bit of like a little bit I don't maybe it's because of the sweetness though I was about to say mitten like it is really good it's like kool-aid it's like dark cherry kool-aid man I it is it's not that symbiotic though if you're gonna be you know going off the dictionary definition it's not really coexisting with the other flavors dark cherry is really coming to the forefront the other guys there in the bottle supposedly but not adding all that much flavor well so can we talk about it's a cherry limeade but it's not carbonated you know though that is bizarre I was wondering if it would be carbonate it's not it's an iced tea did throw this in am what are those things called the super super spritzer things it'll like oh yeah yeah yeah I'd be like SodaStream Ishq aynd of things ya know it I think it would it actually could use some carbonation it does fall a little bit flat in that area but that's about the only negative I can say unless you're really in love with the flavor of iced tea sweet tea specifically or limes which you can just just squeeze a little bit of lime in this thing and you're gonna be fine that dark cherry flavor is strong and it is delicious the in in the product itself the label looks awesome it looks like an action figure like a premium action figure package it's got like that super dark like I don't know purplish but like scary purple this is just a great a well designed product a well named product can we talk about symbiotic dark cherry limeade sounds great they get the movie tie-in going on but you don't have to be in the loop to appreciate how it looks and what it looks like for the gimmick I am gonna therefore give it a 9 out of 10 I love this product and for taste I'm also going I'd out of 10 I think this is really a great product and I think that while you still can you should go out of your way and you should check this stuff out right Ryan I mean this stuff is really delicious symbiotic dark cherry limeade I am definitely a fan it's not inspiring me to see any movies other than home alone but it is inspiring me to continue drinking the rest of this instead of pouring it down the drain which is an improvement from other drinks anyway speaking of other drinks we get a couple more coming up real soon we've got Mountain Dew iced cherry in polar Seltzer jr. for kids so states in the next couple days we're going to talk about some more drinks and see if they can compare to the symbiotic dark cherry limeade til next time I will miss you until I see ya Cheers", "WEWJs7DQMu0": "if you're watching this video you're probably like me you love tea and so that's more than half of the world's population do you know the tea is the second most popular drink water big number one and we all know that we need to take at least eight glasses of water a day to stay healthy especially with a corona virus or COBIT 19 death threatening our world today what if you can take you take those of eight glasses of water and infuse that water with more antioxidants and benefits that are associated with tea today I'm going to show you a simple way of growing your iced tea making it less bitter last time I'm going to show you best to you using a simple experiment showing the difference between hot brew and cold brew I'm going to use two regular teabags black tea and we're going to compare between hot and cold brew so here I'm going to put one tea bag into one cup and the other black tea bag into another cup so let's fill it up to the brim and that's your one cup of black tea using hot brew in the other cup let us use cold water let's put cold water into this cup exactly one full cup so the difference is that when you use hot brew is like watching a marathon so it's a very fast sleeping process so using cold water is kind of like watching a golf game it's very slow and deliberate so we are going to let it steep for about four to six hours put it in the fridge whilst for the hot brew or when it is about two to three minutes of brewing now if you're going to use it for fruits eat 2 to 3 minutes should be good enough if you're going to make a buck tea out of it you should double the time that you will take to brew the tea and now for the moment of truth this was the tea that we use hot water to brew cut brew and this with the tea that we use cold water to brew and get it in the refrigerator for about 4 hours first let's look at the color I'm going to transfer them into a clear glass so we can see the color okay so we start with the one using cold brew there you go and then let's put our hot brew tea into the glass two different ways to bring your black tea one it's a cold brew and it gives you a lighter color for us to have brew gives you darker color now let's give them a try we'll start with the hot room an occult group there's a whole lot of difference here the cold brew doesn't give you that bitter taste at all it's just refreshing and vegetal whereas the half root gives you that bitter taste which is normally complemented by packing it in with sugar making it less healthy so for a delightful iced drink iced tea I would suggest you do it the cold brewed way here's my cool brew tea and I put a lot of fresh oranges in it making it even more healthy packed with vitamin C Cheers once you've made your iced tea you can put it in your water bottle which you can drink up throughout the day stay hydrated don't forget to

small tea company out of miami established in 2011. i'm also the winner of 2019's first ever american tea masters cup and uh today we're gonna taste and compare uh blindly three bottled ready-to-drink black unsweetened iced teas coming at you the first thing we're going to look at with these teas is the color right the clarity because they all seem to be about the same color they have that kind of like a coppery brownish red that comes about with oxidation like when you're making black tea you pluck the tea leaves and then you roll them and bruise them and you let them sit and they get darker and darker and that's oxidation now once they're fully oxidized then they're roasted and that caramelizes the sugars and that's what gives it this kind of red color we can see that both of these cups are clear in the sense that we can see right through them but this cup here is cloudy right so before i even taste it uh my taste buds are going to be a little bit kind of like a on edge like i'm going to be a little bit kind of hesitant to drink it because we as humans don't prefer cloudy drinks we like clear drinks because they look clean you know so off the bat this one has a point against it but let's see what they taste like all right so this one has like a classic kind of indian black tea i would say like south indian like nilgiri it reminds me of like nilgiri teas it kind of has that like the tamrie that the tamar like jammy tamarin guava kind of tropical notes with some of like a malty base to it kind of tastes unfortunate though it's not even bitter it's strange it's like it feels like it's gonna get bitter but then it doesn't like satisfy the bite that you feel like you're gonna get it just kind of like wakes up your mouth but it doesn't deliver with the bite that is what makes like unsweetened chilled black tea so flavorful it does have a really nice finish i gotta give it to it like the the finish of it uh definitely tastes like tea not like syrup not like flavoring like it's it's a black tea flavor profile that sits on the breath and that's nice but the attack of it the attack is like the immediate effect of the flavor the immediate expression of the flavor isn't full enough to be really satisfying all right this one is like not aromatic at all it doesn't have literally any aroma usually like if a tea doesn't have any aroma then even if the flavor profile is really upfront when you drink it after you swallow it's gonna leave a flat finish and that's not uh ideal that's usually the case if there's not a like a good strong aroma coming off the teeth but let's see what it's like that's the weirdest tea i've ever tasted in my life weird that this tastes like if you put uh like three soda crackers in a cup of water for like an hour and then you strained it that's like the closest thing that i can associate this doesn't even taste like tea it tastes like it tastes bad it tastes like uh like old wheat like old soda crackers you know that's uh doesn't no good now let's look at the cloudy third also no aroma very faint this first one that we tasted it smells the way that good iced tea tastes you know like if you if you imagine like like a sweet iced tea that was fresh brewed on a back porch in louisiana in the summer like that's what this smells like it smells like tropical notes it has like like light tamarind it has a kind of jammy guava and then it has like a thick multi base that like you need like that you need like a a thick malt to serve as the base of the flavor profile and then you need to have some high notes usually of like tropical fruit or citrus fruit in the case of this tea like you smell the malt you smell the tamarind you smell the guava so that that's kind of the quality that you should be looking for is like a thick jamming concentration of fruit and specifically like tamarind and guava tropical fruit with an underlying malt so this is strange because it doesn't it doesn't taste like brewed black tea it it it it and and the mouth feel feels like a green tea earlier we were talking about the oxidation like to make black tea you pluck the leaves and roll them and bruise them and then you let them oxidize and then you roast it and that changes the the mouth feel it tends to have a thicker mouth feel than green tea uh this has a very light mouth feel yeah like it doesn't taste oxidized which makes me think that this wasn't tasted or this wasn't made by brewing tea leaves but maybe out of extract and i could be wrong because theoretically if it were an extract then it wouldn't be cloudy so maybe that's what's causing the clouding i don't know but the flav the point is that the flavor profile is very short and it doesn't have a satisfying finish neither of these i would say really taste like black tea at all they uh they just taste like very lightly flavored uh water so this is number one really full uh tea black tea flavor profile and an aroma and a really nice finish that leaves really pleasant tea flavors on the breath this is number two this one tate i mean this straight up tastes like water with soda crackers like i don't know what's up with what's going on here this has a you know it tastes a little bit more like tea than than this one but it doesn't have that finish you know that that tea finish that is uh they call in chinese huay gan huigan means returning sweetness so after you swallow the tea if you don't have a returning sweetness that comes back then your tea is uh not jojo i'll tell you that much okay all right well pure leaf let's see uh brood black tea and citric acid that's it those are the only ingredients here i think that again the flavor profile on this uh pure leaf black tea tastes iced tea the way it was meant to be brewed from real tea leaves fresh picked carefully dried and expertly brewed that's the processing for a white tea the pluck tea dry it that's it i like these roll brews oxidized roasted but whatever we'll be uh not be so obnoxious pure leaf is never made from powder so you can enjoy the delicious taste of real brewed iced tea in every bottle no high fructose corn syrup rainfoyer style rainforest alliance certified brood in the usa oh lipton lipton owns these guys that's right they know what they're doing you know lipton started as a scottish butcher and then uh started selling tea in the corner of his shop apparently people liked the tea more than the butcher stuff more than his you know cuts of uh or whatever he was doing and uh he just kept on doing tea and that's how lifting that started uh honesty organic brewed tea filtered water fair trade certified organic black tea leaves malic acid organic lemon juice from concentrate for flavor honestly not that good and gold peak uh unsweetened yeah this is strange like i think that their uh their sweetened product was very kind of uh satisfying but i feel like this is just really uh thin and not it doesn't taste substantial starts in the mountains where high quality tea leaves are picked for peak flavor pure filtered water oh they filter their water thank god [ __ ] are you kidding brood tea phosphoric acid produced for the coca-cola company so we have two coca-cola products and a lipton product and lipton did it well and coke didn't do so well so if we put them in order i'm gonna be like this honest t see how cloudy that is compared to the clarity of pure leaf so i think that's where i stand so pure relief good job guys your tea tastes like tea you", "w1ZMlaEkTk0": "[Music] Hey from our playing doctor with tropical fruit Department

how to make a wonderful sweet Thai tea with some delicious boba so first up to get this started we're just going to break down some tamarind which is very similar to what a date tastes like very honey like it has just a wonderful dark fruit flavor nonetheless we're just going to break that down throw it into a food processor just to have sort of a light puree sort of this chunky puree because there's seeds in it and all we're looking for with the tamarind is just to give off that wonderful honey flavor when we steep the tea and all the other spices you once the tamarins all chopped up you're going to add to the container you're going to steep all your ingredients in followed by some Ceylon tea and some star anise some vanilla extract some orange blossom water you can also add some cardamom and some other spices if you'd like and then you're going to pour some hot water over the top and let this steep for at least a half an hour all right so while you're waiting for your tea to steep you're going to start cooking your tapioca pearls so in a small sauce pot going to fill it up with some water bring it to a rolling boil and then add your tapioca pearls these specific ones which well link in the description box below where you can find them they take about 15 minutes to cook they'll rise to the top as you can see and that just shows you that they're cooking properly like I said they take 15 minutes in boiling water and then you going to pour them out into a separate Bowl and let them rest for an additional 15 minutes while they're resting you can make a simple brown sugar and honey syrup that they're going to essentially live the rest of their life in after they're done cooking so get another small sauce pot fill it up halfway with some water add some brown sugar and some honey and reduce this until you have a delicious brown sugar and honey syrup should take about five to 10 minutes once you have your sugar syrup mixture ready to go and your tapioca pearls are completely cooked you're just going to gently strain them into the syrup mixture now this does one of two things it stops the tapioca from overcooking and it imparts all that delicious honey flavor into the tapioca as well once that's done you're going to let this cool down for at least a half an hour before using you all right once you have everything ready to go you're gonna scoop a couple of generous spoonfuls of that delicious boba into your glass top it all off with some ice don't be don't be shy on ice here top it all the way off to the top and then you're going to fill it up three-quarters the way up with your strongly brewed tea and then of course you're going to top it off with this delicious cream mixture that's equal parts condensed milk and evaporated milk and that's it guys all you got to do is sit back relax and enjoy a Thai tea with boba but you can call your own I bobba bobba bobba let's get this pub on the road okay give it a good little mix mixi

available mmm good good yeah yeah it's not as sweet mm-hmm as a BOGO place which is fine but sometimes it's like nauseatingly sweet right well that has to do with probably the syrup that the Bobo's in I mean I'm not too keen on a really sweet tea are you do you like tea really sweet no that's one thing there's usually too sweet yeah I'm not a big fan what about the spices star anis has a little bit of orange blossom the tea you made this from scratch right yeah everything's from scratch except I didn't make the tapioca pearls um tastes just like Thai tea mmm let me get our date it's just not as

next time with another delicious recipe bye everybody", "PwPVNbpqgJY": "hi everyone welcome to soup top recipes I'm in the Sunshine State Florida even though it is autumn season here is still hot and tropical today I'm going to introduce you three of my favorite drinks that's so easy to make very healthy and delicious so let's get started the first one is a strawberry Gulam pea strawberry has a really nice red color it is slightly sour and sweet which makes a good combination with Avante this is the tea I'm using any olam tea that you can find will work doesn't need to be a specific friend the introduction says for every cup of water use one tea bag I like to do a higher ratio because once the tea is made you will dilute it with ice take the key out and tie them together I am using a fork to hold all the key strengths so they're not going anywhere while boiling the camera didn't catch that but that is what I'm doing on the side of the pot a teabags 5 cups of water move the teabags around a little bit so they can get soaked completely cover it and bring it to a boil once it is bubbling open the lid and move the teabags around let it sort of air out a little bit because it could overflowed if you're not careful cover it and let it simmer on low heat for another two minutes you don't need to do this for making regular tea but for making fruit tea I like to get the most of tea flavor out of the teabags two minutes later take the teabags out and squeeze all the liquid add some sugar taste and adjust the sweetness you want it to be a bit sweeter than what you normally like because we will add ice into the tea I'm sorry that the camera wasn't focused it is hard to cook and film at the same time after the sugar an optional ingredient is strawberry jam just to give the tea another level of strawberry taste so it has depth of flavors I used about 4 tbsp of it again you can address the sweetness as you like let it sit without of it so it can cool down a little bit while waiting we can prepare the strawberries wash them and remove the green leaves I am pressing and crushing the strawberries then roughly chop it I know this doesn't sound and look good they look a bit awful actually you can bind them if you want just personally I prefer this way because it is quite fun to take a sip and be able to chew the real strawberries I also reserved five strawberries slice them and that will be our garnish after you finish that the tea should still be a bit warm that is okay it doesn't need to be super cold because it takes forever to wait fill up your jar with ice and pour the tea in adding the crushed strawberry then please don't laugh at me that I use chopsticks to make drinks I'm Chinese I use chopsticks for everything anyway mix the drink so the red color can spread out that way it looks so beautiful and elegant and don't forget to add strawberry slices there you go a beautiful drink super healthy sometimes I like to wake up early in the morning and spend 20 minutes to make the tea then I have enough drinks for two days it's just such a good thing to do for yourself the second drink is an orange green tea it is also easy to make this one we're using 20 same as the first one I like to use a higher ratio than the instruction set so 4 cups of water a tea bags bring it to a boil the first tea I let it simmer on low heat after boiling but for green tea I don't do that because over cooking it will take away the freshness of the green tea squeeze out all the liquid that is left in the tea bag add some sugar to taste you can also skip the sugar if you want this to be sugar free it is up to you leave it uncovered so it can cool down a little bit while waiting you can prepare the orange what I like to do first is to create some orange zest that is where all the orange flavor is concentrated it is very strong and tropical gives the drink so much citrusy flavor after you had enough orange zest you can start squeezing the juice cut them in half first you could use the commercial orange juice it just won't be as fresh as this also you don't get to grate the zest it will be so much easier if you have a juicer but a fork works well too from 5 thick orange I get about 2 cups of juice by the way you won't get these orange meat from the commercial juice that is my favorite part so fun to drink also I slice an orange for garnish honestly you don't really need to do this if you don't chase for the presentation okay now we have everything we can make the drink fill up your job with ice orange juice thing then the orange zest there is a risk of over adding it because it is slightly bitter one tablespoon of the orange zest is the amount that I think it brings enough flavor without ruin the drink pour in the green tea an important note do not mix the hot tea with the juice directly or else a kind of ruins the flavor of the orange or citrusy fruit does that I love this drink green tea gives you a filling of spring season very healthy and delightful goes so good with the fresh orange it is great when you need a nice cold drink the last one is a lemon black tea it is like a upgrade lemonade but much more delicious you can still use tea bags but since I have the black tea that I got from China I'm going to use this for every cups of water I like to use six grams of loose tea so total 5 cups of water 30 grams of tea bring this to a boil and let it cool down a little bit drain it so you can get rid of the leaves black tea is actually called home Chow in China which means red tea that refers the color of the liquid I put it under the bright light so you can see how nice it is add some sugar to taste mix it well let it cool down a little bit and we can juice our lemon same as what we did to the orange just cut it in half and juice it I don't have a juicer so I use a fork I also have a sieve to drain the C's if you want this to be quick and easy you can use bottled lemon juice I prefer fresh ones though I got one cup of lemon juice from 12 lemons set that aside next I'm going to make my magic ingredient that will be sweet mint paste some fresh mint leaves put in a motor pesto add some sugar to help to grind it you can also use a blender I don't have that today and a model pesto is my only choice taste it a little bit I just love the fresh mint flavor very nice cool and sweet we're gonna use about one and a half tablespoon off that add it to the jar along with the lemon juice put in the black tea pop some lemon slices and some fresh mint leaves mix it up and it's done this is my favorite tea out of these three recipes it tastes like lemonade but way better than data that black tea and mint Iraqis you see me use fresh food slices to decorate the trunk in this video which is not necessary at all but quite important for pictures you can put that on Facebook Instagram sometimes you just need a little nice looking and delicious cold drink to make your day these are my daily drinks I don't drink coffee no alcohol to me fruit and tea is a really nice and healthy combination I can drink them every single day I hope you give them a dude if you did leave me a comment and let me know how it went as always you can check the scoop for the written down recipe if you like my show subscribe to my channel and hit the notification bell so you don't miss any episode and I'll see you next time bye", "oBGpOJ_hvH8": "hey you guys so I'm here to show you guys how to make my strawberry lemon-aid green tea everything's gonna be made from scratch it's super healthy and this is one of my favorite summer drinks so this is a way that you can take hot tea and then turn it into cold iced tea okay so what you're gonna do is get a pack of strawberry green tea here you guys can order it on the website again the back are clear so you can definitely see everything and so what I usually do when I'm going to make umm team four iced tea I get loose tea bags and like I told you guys before I prefer the brown ones because it's healthier and safer so right now I have about three cups of water it's ready boiling on the stove so what I'm gonna do is take a tablespoon of the strawberry green tea you can see there's real chunks of strawberries and green tea here so I'm going to go ahead and put it into the bag she's gonna dump that in and like I said before the tea is very strong it's very potent so I'm gonna put in two tablespoons of the tea so I have two tablespoons in this bag and then basically you're just gonna tie the end so that way it doesn't leak out and now you have a nice bag of tea so I'm gonna go ahead and make another bag real quick so now what I'm gonna do is drop this into a pot of boiling hot water and I put three cups of boiling hot water on the stove definitely boiling hot I'm gonna go ahead and turn off the stove and just let it seep so now while we're waiting for the tea to finish seeping we're gonna work on the lemons so you can take three large lemons either from Trader Joe's they're organic or else you can take about six small lemons and get the same result so I'm gonna use these three large lemons make sure you guys wash your fruit okay before you guys cut into them or use them make sure they're clean so I'm just gonna go ahead and slice them open and then I automatic I love this I'm a big fan of juicing and this is the best way to juice citruses especially if you have like you know arthritis or if you have you know hand issues it's easier to have the machine to make it stretch I kind of pour water on here just to you know drain the rest of those lemons that are sitting there [Music] then you just take that apart I'm gonna set that off to the side here now you're gonna do is pour your lemon juice into here so I'm gonna do is take this off of the stove and start pouring the ice in there to cool it down and be careful because it's hot you don't want anything hot splashing on you you can see the ice is already melting so that's gonna bring it down to a more lukewarm temperature and you can fish out those tea bags they can come out now and you can see they're like fully blown they've seeped really well look how good they look full leaves there's a big difference between our green tea in the kind of you buy in the store pull this up and the iced tea is nice and cool so now what I'm gonna do is go ahead and pour it import into a picture so what I do I save about a cup in there for a little bit more and this is gonna be for me to boil my strawberries okay so now we can pour this strawberry green tea into the lemonade mixture and I'm gonna keep this in the refrigerator to cool so like I said you gonna keep some of that strawberry green tea in the pot so then what you're going to do is add fresh strawberries you're just gonna go ahead and drop them in I already have them pre-cut up and then this part you can either add sugar you can add honey you can add a gob a whatever you feel is what you want to add to it what I'm gonna do is put this back on the stove and allow the strawberries to boil all right so this took about ten minutes to boil and it's really super sweet it's almost like a liquid strawberry jam this is the best way to make it from scratch so now what you're going to do is basically strain everything so you're gonna pour it into a strainer you guys can see the strawberries right here you want to make sure you pour it into a bowl that can handle heat you know push down so that where all the juice gets in there and then what you can do is once everything strains down you can use the strawberries that are left over for Jam for filling um you can use it as an ice cream topper yogurt topper so you don't have to waste these strawberries at all see so before I pour this into here because this is heat sensitive I'm gonna drop a few ice cubes in the strawberry mixture just to cool it down a bit so you're gonna drop the ice cubes in there and just kind of stir it in it's nice and sweet and thick now what I like to do because I feel like ice can tend to you know water down drinks so what I do I put frozen strawberries in there it's ice cubes she's gonna add a few of these and these will be like the ice cubes instead of using regular ice cubes it also makes it look really pretty as well and then you'll also want to go ahead and add some lemon slices and then I'm mint mint also helps if you're having any type of stomach issues any type of stomach ailments and you just want to stir everything around in there and it looks super beautiful and if you want to add a kick to it you can also add some club soda to make it sparkling as well that's what I prefer to do you can see it just fizzing and looking super good and that is how you make your very own green tea iced lemonade oh my god this is so good job and I know you guys are enjoying this right now at the tea lunch party so this is how you guys can make it yourself at home everything is natural made from scratch like I said if you don't want to use white sugar feel free to use honey agave anything like that boil the strawberries so that way the strawberries you know soak in all the sugary goodness but yeah this is off the chain I'm in love you", "ltE9ufnrA-g": "hey it's mark Wiens here I'm in Bangkok Thailand and today I'm going to be making the recipe for Thai iced tea known as Chalian so keep watching this video let's do this the most important ingredient is of course Thai black tea and a lot of people wonder why it's so orange and that is and it's tea and also includes you see yellow number six so that's what gives it the real orange e the classic orange e flavor when you have a Thai iced tea also key ingredients are both um and this sorry it's opened from the bottom so it's upside down but this is condensed milk sweetened condensed milk and this is just evaporated milk and then sugar as we wait for the water to boil we're just going to prepare our tea I am using a Thai like tea sock and as you can see this has been well used on many cups of delicious tea but anyway you could use any kind of strainer yeah really any kind of strainer would work or even a sock I've even used a real sock before we're gonna put about one kind of heaping tablespoon I have an authentic Thai Street food chain ladle but you don't really need to use this so anyway I'm gonna I'm gonna dip one cup of water this thing is pretty cool okay one cup of water you can really steep the tea however you like you could even just put your leaves in a bottom of a glass of hot water but in Thailand you'll see vendors using the tea sock method just steep the tea for a while until it turns nice and dark in color maybe about one or two minutes or so okay that should just about be steeped and we're ready to go pour a cup of the strained tea into a new glass or mug and this is going to be our mixing Cup add about two teaspoons of sugar two teaspoons of sweetened condensed milk and then give your tea a nice mix to make sure all that condensed milk gets stirred in then just pour in about two teaspoons of the evaporated milk which is going to give your Thai iced tea an extra boost of creaminess and you can see that beautiful oh that's pretty hot you can see that beautiful or me creaminess and that's the exact colour you're looking for okay so the next step this is just completely for fun but one thing is that it looks really awesome and another thing is that it gives it a little bit of like foam which which a real challenge it have so you don't actually have to do this or you could do it in a different way but it's pretty fun so you should try it oh you can and you can already see the bubbles just foaming on that the one thing about Thai iced tea is that you make it hot and then to cool it down you just have a full cup of ice crushed ice works the best another thing is that you want to make it a little bit sweeter then like if you if you taste test it when it's hot it's going to be a little too sweet that way when it hits the ice it will sort of melt it down and it will tone down that sweetness a little the last step is to pour your hot tea mixture over a full cup of ice and drizzle in a little more evaporated milk to top it off and it's ready for you to consume oh you just got to have this refreshing beverage in the heat of Bangkok yes you", "dUFHRzkeKtU": "good evening

iced tea and I'm going to use our seeping stocks which are biodegradable fiber sacks and I'm going to make a picture so I'm going to use the one-pot spoon this is the English breakfast black tea traditional lochte which i believe is very yummy smells lovely I'm doing this on a plate just for the sake of making too much of a mess try to line it up with the camera that's the English breakfast it's one of them filled seal this up because we don't want to have a dumping accident that's going to be the English breakfast two scoops and this is the lemon licious which is a fruit tea they both have different see pics steeping times I'm going to do one scoop of the lemon licious sorry about the lining up of the camera beautiful smells lovely try to do this with one hand here without making a mess stick that in there okay and what I'm going to do is twist these tie a little knot in them and because my dexterity is not a hundred percent I will be back in one moment with them all knotted up for the next step okay so what I did is just twist it and put a little not in so the tea doesn't come out but you notice there's lots of room for the teat expand and move this is the fruit to the lemon licious same situation got the breathing room they're fourth expand and if you're wondering why I'm using these seeping stocks today in the pitcher because this is what our ice tea infusion picture where you can put the tea in there have your hot water or cold in there I just want to be able to pull this one out at two minutes because it's a block T 2 to 3 minutes and then the fruit tea i could leave it in um but i just want to make it simple so i'll pull this out about 5-6 minutes the fruity can stay in about six i actually cut off the back of one of my bags are little brooch art because it's kind of plasticky from the packaging so i can leave it in my kitchen and it isn't going to fall apart so that's on every one of our tea bags okay so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to plop in our black tea and our fruit tea just going to slide my spoon out of the way and I'm going to just pour the water in here I've willed the water off and then I let it sit for just a few minutes you don't necessarily need boiling scalding hot water for tea and I'm not going to drink this right away so I'm going to stop right about there I'm going to set my timer for two minutes for the block tea and in two minutes will stand by and pull that out because we don't want it to get bitter you leave your black tea in too long it will go better so there they are and stand by okay okay it's been that about two to three minutes for the black tea and so we don't end up with bitter tea because this is hot water I'm not putting my fingers in there I'm just gonna pull out the block tea bag and I'm not going to squeeze it I'm going to just walk it push it around in a little bit drip it off I'm just going to set it aside hide your gardening my compost so i'll put that in however i might just steep that off again and have a light black tea for myself black TZ typically steep once now the lemon licious is a fruit tea which is about five minutes that it can be in there so we will leave that one in for another 23 minutes fruity could actually stay in there it isn't going to hurt it because it won't get better now let's take a peek in there it smells lemony like your traditional lemon Black team that you drink iced all summer long the color is already deep cannot wait I have a lemon waiting in the fridge for a garnish so we will be back just about two or three minutes we'll let that fruit tea hang out in there okay that's been about five minutes we're going to pull the lemon delicious fruit tea out again I'm using tongs because it is still very hot water if that ice don't squeeze in a mighty and we're just going to hang out like i said i might just restate that as a glass or just throw in the composter so here is our ice tea lemon licious english breakfast i did two of the pot scoops of the english breakfast which is the black tea and i did one of the lemon licious I like my iced tea unsweetened so I won't be adding any sugar or sweeteners to this what I'm going to do is I'm going to add some ice hence why I only filled it so full with the hot water because I want to pull it down as a nice so stand by for just another few moments okay so we've got our ice tea made with English breakfast lemon licious I've got some ice since I already making the mess since I made it like a concentrate so to speak and not the full water this will not dilute it if you were making it the full pot obviously you don't want to dilute it um I'm gonna put my computer it's gonna be a full one yeah a little lid even though i don't have tea in there that'll cool it down very nicely isn't that pretty I'm my little sample cup here that's a nice color again that's why malicious fruit tea with the English breakfast black tea first time I'm making it I wish we had smell-o-vision because this smells as good as it tastes I think I now have my new work in the yard go about to play ice tea every day tea I don't even think it needs a lemon as garnish because it's not going to last that long I'm going to drink this the way it is I don't need any sweetener in there i think the lemon licious is adding the sweetener for you on the Black team which is the English breakfast is literally black tea the lemon licious has apple bits hibiscus blossoms rosehip peels lemongrass lemon peels licorice orange peels black currants would flower blossoms a natural flavor so there's a nice variety which gives it that beautiful taste anyway cheers happy sipping deep tea with ginger be any questions comment below thank you you you", "D8RrugsquCE": "hi everyone welcome back to the kitchen today we're gonna be making a sugar-free version of an old holiday classic this spice tea Russian tea holiday tea whatever you call it is a family favorite no matter how you make it we're making a sugar-free version I can't wait to show you how this all comes together [Music] today we're gonna be making a sugar-free version of my mom's spiced tea now you may know this as Russian tea Russian spice team holiday tea there are a billion different names and it is totally a throwback to the 70s but I've had a lot of requests from a lot of people over the years could you please tell me how to make this sugar free I'm a diabetic I have a special dietary need and today we're gonna address that we have been trying to cut back on sugar for the last year or so and we've done a pretty good job the problem is finding a decent sweetener that we like that works in a lot of things that doesn't give you stomach cramps that doesn't cause you intestinal distress what you start off with now the original recipe you all know if you're not familiar it starts off with a whole bunch of Tang or orange flavored drink mix and that's got a lot of sugar in it it also has sweetened iced tea mix unsweetened iced tea mix and some spices it's delicious and we love it but we're trying to make it a little bit healthier and still be able to enjoy those things at the holidays so what you're gonna start off with is two cups of unsweetened iced tea powder I will leave links to the majority of the products that I'm using here today you can find these in your grocery store I bought all these things at Walmart if you're looking for the unsweetened iced tea powder is usually on the bottom shelf it comes in a tall jar and it's either gonna be lifting or nestea brand so you're gonna want two cups of that two cups of stevia powder no this is your sweetener of choice this is stevia and you can use Splenda you can use equal you can use a root all whatever you like but it's a cup 4 cup version so we're using 2 cups we have 4 packets of the unsweetened old-fashioned old-school kool-aid so there's 4 orange and 2 lemonade now my store was out lemonade except for a couple packets it doesn't matter it's gonna get all mixed up in there anyway so I wouldn't even worry about it so 2 lemon for orange a teaspoon of ground cloves a tablespoon of ground cinnamon all you have to do is mix this all up I like to put everything in a and take my whisk to it and of course you can adjust the sweetener if you like it sweeter you can add more sweetener if you like it less sweet you can adjust it from there I have found that the original recipe only calls for a cup of regular lemon tea and a cup of unsweetened sweet tea but it's mostly got tang in it since we're not using Tang today for obvious reasons because it's you know mostly sugar we have to figure out a way to substitute that orange flavor and that lemon flavor this unsweetened kool-aid is the way that I've chosen to do it I have seen recipes that use Crystal Light I prefer not to use that because I prefer to avoid aspartame now all of your ingredients are in the bowl and just keep whisking until it's nice and combined you can put this in in your jar and just mix it all up this is gonna make approximately a quart and you can put this in little jelly jars or you could put it in icing cones like ice decorator bags and then tie it up with a ribbon so it's a nice little cone enough that whoever you're gonna gift this to is gonna have enough for a 4 or 6 cups worth maybe it just depends on how much you want to give them if you give them a jelly jar which is this size that equals one cup you're gonna need a quarter of a cup of mix to make a decent sized mug of spiced tea we're just gonna go ahead and jar this up and then I'm gonna come back and we'll make a cup and we'll have Ric taste it will show you what it looks like then you can get busy making some of this to give to your friends and family for the holidays no I'm just putting this in a quart jar because this is going to be for a family and we're going to be using that I can always mix up more later if I'm going to gift this to people I put a quarter of a cup of the mix in my tea cup here and I have some hot water and honestly this looks exactly the same as if you use the sugary version it also foams up like that when you mix it you can feel free to float some orange in here you can put a cinnamon stick in there and it will be nice and festive you wanna taste it he's like folks do and it doesn't have an aftertaste and because we use the stevia powder it's not gonna give anybody any problems we always have to do a mix every year or two we're also going to be sharing another sugar-free holiday drink mix for you and in time I may adapt many of my original cocoa and tea mixes into sugar free versions for you you just have to make a few different changes they're very slight and sometimes you do have to have a specialty ingredient but they're easy to come by and you can always get them from Amazon so I hope that you give this holiday spiced tea a try I hope that you give them a try and I hope that you love them that until next time happy holidays [Music]", "COyD7tJmaPc": "hi today I'm going to show you how I make my long iced tea oolong I can't use green tea and I don't like all the caffeine in the black tea so I use coulomb tea it's actually very inexpensive so three teabags two liters of boiling hot water I add lots of ginger again I like the bite and the taste of the ginger and then I add three tablespoons of white sugar you could use honey I just find it easier at times I don't always have honey in my cupboard which I don't have today so today the sweetener is white sugar I let this cool on the stove and then I transfer it to a jug to the fridge my along tea has been sitting in cooling I'm now going to add some lemon juice I don't have any fresh lemons at this point so I put probably a half inch of lemon juice in the bottom of my jug and that would be to taste right pour in my and at times I use this tea in my fruit smoothies the what the fruit smoothie that I'm working on right now has lots of liquid so I don't need it today so into the fridge this goes and you have the cool refreshing tea that is actually very health beneficial I will post it in the blog the health benefits of oolong tea I hope you enjoy", "gzbUWgkaHn0": "[Music] YouTube friends today we are making a masculine soap using this fragrance black tie it has notes of pepper and leather and it is quite nice I'm using titanium dioxide a blue mica and activated charcoal and my acrylic mold I want the straight straight lines that this acrylic mold gives me and we're going to be working on a tiger stripe hi everyone now we're ready to mix up our batter let's check on the temperatures this is my lye in distilled water I'm an 82 Fahrenheit and my mixture of oils that I call suds 80 Fahrenheit so just for reference room temperature here is 74 points 8 I don't have air-conditioning so it's kind of warm in my home but that's fine you get used to it it doesn't really get that hot where I live so I'm gonna put on my I've got my gloves and safety glasses let's mix up this batter now I'm going to divide this into five I want this to be tiger-striped soap so if you've seen me soap before you know I have it sometimes attempting to do this and it doesn't work it's the fragrance accelerates on you then it ends up being a drop swirl not a tiger strike but we will try okay so that's the plain batter white with a bit of titanium dioxide blue with a mica called celestial blue gray which is titanium dioxide and the activated charcoal and black which is the activated charcoal so now I will add the fragrance hopefully this will be a view for you to see the tiger striping I'm very lucky today the fragrance seems to have decelerate and trace so wait might after she gets a tiger strip today so I'm just very slowly pouring one straight down of the black its go I'm gonna go black blue gray black and tell the batter blue white great luck so I'm colored butter if I could do this slower would be better but see that's color please more sir I find the more stripes and tiger stripes is a pretty earth looks then I'm gonna go from this side like this I got this better angle now what I rest on the side of that mold you have a steady your hand that's what doing stuff is all about you learn better ways to do it right gray so um I'll tell you what we did this week Aaron went to a Metallica concert he went to see Metallica I did not go to see Metallica because I do not like the music at all however I want you to go to the city with him it's two and a half to three hours away it depends on traffic and construction so it took us about three and a half hours actually to get down to town with a hotel bus so we meant after work we made it there in time for him to make it to the concert but something very interesting happened when we checked into the hotel it had been a long drive so Aaron wanted to use the washroom and I started unpacking my things so what my plan was and what I actually did was well he went to Metallica I worked on some of my crochet so I'll show you at the end of the video you know what I was working on I'm working on something called a scooty it's a scarf and a hook put together so like hoodie but plus scarf is called squiddy so that's what I'm working on with the super super super pretty yarn and yeah so we went into the hotel room didn't area let's use the washroom cuz he had to get going to his concert he was going with friends he wasn't going alone and I just didn't want to go so I didn't have a ticket I thought I just I'll be happier doing what I'm doing he'll be up here doing it he's doing so he went to wash him and then Aaron called me he called me and said I think you need to come look at this nice think you know yeah thought maybe he was sick something's going on so I went into the washroom and in the washroom there's a makeup bag it wasn't mine because I haven't been in that room yet and it was fully open and there's a toothbrush someone else's stuff and so we thought that the person before us must have left it behind and that also meant which was kind of gross they didn't clean the bathroom oh but you know the hotel was super super super busy like packed the entire downtown area this is an Edmonton all the hotels were full for this concert everyone was coming in to see this Metallica concert I understand it was the last North American spa location so just Tiger striping one color on the other and I'm doing much better now that I learned this whole rest my container on the side of the mold idea I probably learned this before and forgot it I've done many successful tiger stripes so we called to the office of the hotel we hit you go on the phone and he hit that service button and Aaron told him exactly what happened he's like there's something left behind from the previous person and also we thought let's look like maybe they double booked this room and so we looked for a suitcase I opened the closet looking for a coach or jacket or some you know dresses or something hanging up but I'm traveling I often the first thing I do is hang up my dresses so they don't get wrinkled we're the unwrinkle from whatever wrinkling happened in your suitcase but there was nothing there was no suitcase and when the manager or whoever he was some sort of assistant manager something of the hotel showed up in minutes he was fast so yeah he showed up he says anything else here and we're like no just his bag that's it nothing else strangest thing and so okay he took the makeup bag he took the toothbrush and he left and time again this one needs a bit of a stirring stirred up here with a chopstick Oh kind of a funny thing Aaron and I it's gonna give this a what's through here and wiggle this there we go get everything level I was starting to build up in the center and the sides look you can see through the acrylic that it's certain to work for me there cool alright happy - hurry up first stuff stick things up too much anyway Aaron tonight both had black bags that was just I had a black backpack and Aaron had a little black J bag kind of thing just a little carry-on sort of small bag because we were only there for one night and so I'm sitting there and we're talking about I think it's so odd but like that was odd what you know so strange we were discussing you know do you think this room's double-booked and you know what if I after you go to the concert this person comes back what am I gonna do what if I have to choose change hotels and you ran out of battery in your phone and you don't know where I am we're just watching all these scenarios and then there was a bag sitting on a chair across from me a black bag and I thought it was Aaron's back cuz he had a black bag and then Aaron crosses the room and goes to another black bag and he takes something out of his bag and that was just it I was the moment Isaac Aaron what messy bag there and I put to the page it's sitting on this chair look that's not my bag that's your bag it was so creepy Aaron just freaked out okay we gotta go gotta get out of here this is my room this isn't her stuff so yeah they had double they had sent us to a room that someone already had and you know the worst case Arab Aaron mentioned it later worst case scenario we could have walked in there and it was a woman seemed a one woman traveling all alone what if she was changing so anyway he's the oddest thing and then I felt so stupid because we told the manager guy that there's nothing else in there so I thought well how goes stupid Aaron called him right away and told him was like there is a bag here we just saw we didn't see before we saw it's here he's like I'll come right down under there come down there to the front desk yeah right get out of there as fast as we could because it was so creepy and went right down to the front desk yeah and we told them they're like we were but we were carrying their bags because now we have to come back all the way down and get a new room so we was carrying your bags and you showed it to him we're like we're sorry look we have a black bag we thought the black bag was each other's black bag so pretty darn funny they gave us a free meal is an apology and luckily thank goodness another room I guess stuff like this can happen I can't imagine how like with the computers how could that happen and because this person had been there you know she was probably at the concert she had come in gotten ready left her makeup out brushed her teeth gone to the concert so it's not like she just checked in that room they'd booked that room for her probably an hour or two before we got there anyhow the message is which I always do anyway put that padlock on your door when you like the bolts you can bolt it from inside so even if someone has your key they can't open the door I always do that in hotels just because if I know it sounds a little bit creepy I've been in a hotel once when two drunk guys thought my room was their room and they were trying to get into it and I could hear them talking minutes little room but until they left it was really kind of creepy that there were drunk people trying to get into room I was trying to sleep in so that's what we did this week and he enjoyed his Metallica concert it had fireworks had the end quick early cuz it was an outdoor concert and you know it's in a neighborhood where people live so I believe there's bylaws for that they probably had to end 11:00 or 11:30 so people that live in the neighborhood get some sleep things are certain to thicken up on me now I've seen on Pinterest some soaps that are so finely striped one way to do that might be to use essential oils and stick fragrance because I find those essential oils always decelerate my trace like tea tree I could have a nice fluid batter for quite a long time or you kid mix I could have only done this is a four pound mold I could have mixed up two pounds of batter and then starting it all over right now and that was fluid batter it's another way to do it that's how I'm doing my strips now I'm mixing up my batter with each stripe not mixing the batter and then trying to stripe so that is working much better honey you're gonna see my rainbow soaked I'm going to make soon traditional yeah be much better than last year's traditional look at what it did last year and it's just no it looks like a pretty silk but my stripes aren't straight over the years you improve on things this sips it smells good this black tie fragrance is a masculine fragrance yet lost masculine so if I made with shades and it has I still have it I made it around Father's Day so it's quite a long time ago I still have bars of shades and they still do you know people like them I find where I live men want to use body washes they're not interested in soap oh you know generalizing of course some want bar soap but most I think they like that Axe body wash there's one that said that to us he came by our families looking at the soaps they often come because first they think they're fudge so that goal function Oh so but then they're interested and they'll keep looking and Aaron happened to be there and this guy said I just use body wash and Aaron said it I you know I'm just wondering something and that guy's is what have you ever looked at what's in your body wash no so Aaron kind of challenged this guy to take a look at the crap you're putting on your skin in this body wash I know men like to shower no you know yeah I'm generalizing I know semantics baths but most men got to have the showers Aaron takes from himself takes very long showers but he uses my soap and he uses my shampoo in the shower we're fortunate we have a shelf in the shower one of those built-in shelves so he has somewhere to put his soap because you don't want the soap sitting somewhere where it's in puddle of water it won't last so it will turn to mush on you and give this a shake this is going to be flat like my shades soap turned out to be flat and this is going to be flat ends in this mold it's another reason why I chose this mold you get such nice straight lines dot flat top soap looks really good coming out of this acrylic mold I love this mold I'll buy some more larger ones maybe as this one gives me 10 bars that's all you really need and where I live soap doesn't sell that much where I lived I think what's hampering online sales these days is shipping shipping is so expensive so if you want to buy an $8 bar soap you have to spend $10 of shipping that made your bar soap $18 that's a shame there's nothing I can do about that in my own area I do free delivery that's you know within an hour driving so I will drive for two hours to deliver you an $8 per soap just cuz I will do that and I have debit so what I tell people is I can think of me like the pizza guy right but instead of ordering pizza you're ordering soap I'll come with a debit machine and bring you the soap you want and I have done this once it happens what's kind of funny cuz they headed to Theodore so ordered pizza so I made that joke I'm like sorry I'm not the pizza guy and I said actually we are waiting for the pizza guy we're also waiting so glady good about incidence the area I live in it's called Lakeland so it's a huge area of Alberta so if you happen to live in the Lakeland I'll deliver you some soap just order through Etsy or if your Facebook this is gonna be a long video I don't usually do my videos more than like 18 minutes this is gonna be a long one that you got the gift of an interesting story I've never heard of such a thing as a double booked a room in Canada I've heard of it happening no offense meant to Mexicans but I have heard the devil happen in Mexico early someone in Mexico went to Resort and found out that there were double books and they didn't actually have any any room and so some staff member or something gave they got a free trip basically they were given a room for free huh they had already flown there what are they gonna do they got caught yeah but generally Canada uses computer systems and things like that don't happen it happened if whoever was looking that room didn't hit save or something still showed is empty in the system I don't know house never worked in a hotel I've worked in all kinds of different jobs never a hotel my actually do there's some interest in it I find it so hotel across the street from me and I thought how simple it would be if I could just walk across the street to work maybe one day I will this is just plain old chopstick I'm gonna go back and forth like this and then up the middle down and around the sides finish voila that's the answer to the trivia let's see what it looks like tomorrow hopefully I was successful in making this very stripy like a tie so until tomorrow see you later take care hello everyone I'm here back now to catch the black tie tiger stretch soap I'm very excited to see inside this one so I'm just gonna line it up at the edge of my cutter here and pull down now this creates 10 slices and one end piece for people to smell here's the end piece I'm very very happy with it I got many many tiger stripes you see here I started to hurry a bit took my time down there started to rush a bit there but still has the design effective on top that I swirled a bit something's he's gonna be nice soaps it might make a nice Christmas stocking stuffer to have a soap and a lip balm get together for gifts for men I make some masculine solid perfumes but I think just cuz I put the word perfume in it they're not men are interested even though the fragrances are really nice I make shades and a leather one that I call favorite saddle redwood saffron and another woods when I forget what which which one it was very nice fragrances but I think men are just nervous to buy something that has the word perfume on it and didn't want to make separate labels just for the men's months besides the fact I I also didn't want to have a separate notification to Health Canada just for the men's ones when they go supposed to match the name you gave them this one might be my favorite one of all them I'm very happy with this finally good good tiger-stripe all the way to your littles I was lucky that this fragrance did not accelerate I hope that you enjoyed watching me make this black tie soap and take care of yourself and those around you have a good rest of the day and I'll see you in the next video bye everybody [Music]", "FjnNSzigTnE": "hey everybody it's windy

that helps me feed my family however there is a whole world out there at other product that I love and I've kind of come to this place of self-discovery in that if I'm not sharing what i really love with you and what really makes me happy then what's the point of me doing this I don't want to use just dampen up product just to try to sell it to you I want to use other products that make me happy and I feel like as a creative person by boxing myself in to only using one product it really does not allow me to share how great Stampin Up is with you because it actually pairs so nicely with so many other products and that is how i started my Stampin Up journey when I became a Stampin Up demonstrator it was because I needed their card stock bad I loved their card stock and i love that i can buy it in bulk and i love that i have it shipped right to my door and i love that it has other things to match it so when you're thinking in those realms a Stampin Up was a need i had thats and and it fixed it and filled it so the need i have now in my current life is still the same but i also find myself really loving some of it other stamps and products and things that are out there on the market and they pair so nicely with Stampin Up and I feel like I have to just show you that and branch out and try this and i'm scared i will tell you i am scared that's the honest truth I am scared that people watched my videos is Stampin Up demonstrator and see something I share and go buy somebody else's product instead of buying it from me I'm scared that somebody at Stampin Up my frown upon what I'm doing and not like the idea that i am using other products but i find in life that the things you're most scared of sometimes can be the most successful and sometimes the most beneficial to your spirit and it there's lots of things that make me nervous about losing business or losing customers because i rely so much on the money that I make with Stampin Up my household really does rely on it and so branching out and doing some different things feels really really scary to me but I just trust in like in the Lord first of all that he's going to provide for our family no matter what stamps that I use right so here we go I'm gonna do this card and this is a first for me and I'm freaking out so now you know okay so I have a piece of whisper white card stock here and it's cut out four and a quarter by 11 and then I've got a piece another piece of whisper white that I've stamped using the a happy thing stamp set this is a Stampin Up stamp and it's offered through celebration when you order fifty dollars you can choose this stamp set for free I'll be honest this is not a stamp set I cared for it first but then I saw a bunch of stuff done with it and of course I fell in love with it so um I love lemons and lemonade and iced tea with lemon in it so um I thought I gotta do something with this alright so I use this stamp and I stamped it all over and then I just use my blendabilities and colored it in that's it now I've got wild wasabi cardstock cut at one inch by 4 and a quarter here and all I'm gonna do my dimensionals left me here there is I'm just going to put dimensionals on the edge of the lemon paper that I colored in and I did this at the request or suggestion i should say of one of my YouTube followers so if you're watching this YouTube follower you and actually told me I should cut strips to conserve cardstock and I thought that that was a brilliant idea instead of cutting like so for example this piece of cardstock is cut at two and three quarters by four and a quarter so instead of cutting a three and a quarter strip by four and a quarter I'm just cutting small strips and by doing that I am conserving cardstock to use on other projects so I thought that was really thoughtful that she left that comment for me and so I thought I'm gonna try that and I will say it's a little bit more time consuming um so it's it is something I may not do all the time but I definitely think it's beneficial to to try it out so here I need a piece of Baker's twine and I'm just going to wrap it three times around here and then tie a double knot noctua tie a bow I'm just going to tie a double knot and you'll see why in a little bit okay so there's that and i'm going to go ahead and cut that off and leave those strings hang in there and then I'm going to add dimensionals to the pack of the green cardstock which is wild wasabi okay then I'm just going to add this whole piece right here leaving myself some space over here okay so here comes the fun scary part for me I love stamps of life stamps ok I think Stephanie Bernard is brilliant and so I bought these well actually I take that back I was given this stamp set as a gift because my family are huge iced tea drinkers so I thought it would be super fun to be able to do like an iced tea and card for my grandparents or family members cuz they would get it nobody else probably get that but I would they would get it so I was given this stamp set and so I went on um stamps a life website and i found that she has framelits or whatever these are called i guess they're not called framelits i'm just going to be new for me getting used to that dies um and then a whole nother stamp set so that coordinates so I was super excited to see that because when i saw this stamp image i immediately thought I need a Emmitt I need a sentiment that says when life gives you lemons make lemonade because that's what I thought of when I saw those lemons so stamps of life happens to have that sentiment so I'm going to go ahead and stamp that for you I'm going to open up this card and I'm going to be using momento black memento tuxedo black ink all right and then perfect when life gives you lemons make lemonade and then this is the cutest part of this card okay there is this little bitty stamp that is a little bitty iced tea well it's eliminated actually I say iced tea because that's what I originally got this stuff for little bitty lemonade glass with ice cubes it's so cute so I already went ahead and cut the card stock out because it's photopolymer all of her stamps or photopolymer so I can just see right through and stamp my image on top of there ok so now I have to do some coloring and I'm going to be using the so saffron stamp and write marker and I'm just going to kind of go around the edges here and then I'm going to color the lemon a little and then I have a light soft sky blend ability and I'm going to color in my ice cubes which is so cute all right now have my piercing Matt piercing tool and I'm going to pierce a hole here on the side of my lemonade glass and then we're going to add it to the front of this card which is just the cutest part right okay so I have to do the gross thing where you look the you know you have to make the point by getting your spit all over the thread so gross alright so in a tire little bow with our glass on there ah tying a bow on film I know I tell you this all the time I hate it because it never goes as smoothly it's like somebody standing behind you while you type then you just constantly make errors same thing okay so then i have my cute little lemonade glass hanging off of my card that says when life gives you lemons make lemonade how cute is that right i love it such a fun card was really easy to make and i hope you all like it I'm scared so leave me a comment and tell me what you think talk to you soon", "H845CIQjA1M": "today we're making the Irish poet using royal rose rose and you didn't

you want I said that you yeah yeah whatever just lost in music huh sticky Jay my last time I used a mo was the last time you asked to use JMO oh really I don't drink you know I don't drink if I had a pick up a whiskey to drink it wouldn't be an Irish whiskey and here's why why why is that Derek's fighting so i really don't have a good answer free all right I just like bourbon well there's your answer I don't feel like it's a good one slam it in there there you have a problem with whiskey too I you shall ring I had a problem with Jim Beam I drank most of the handle when I was like 17 and I was drunk throughout the next day I had to work yeah are you sailing yeah broke up with my girlfriend [ __ ] you drive me there my mom had followed me so I could get home in my own car afterwards it was an awkward ok thanks to college I can no longer drink whiskey without wanting compute um I had got a problem in college no before Coleman I think we were in college the first maybe we were freshmen I don't remember um it was it was seeing Sue Canadian Club no that's my supposed to be seven in 1707 seagrams wait wasn't seagram seven we used so much eternal i guess it was cigars and ginger ale look how that's floating work how nice that's cool look at that product shot right there I'm o thinkin buddy look at this right down that's great oh it's like magic why is it seeing like that because this is just water it's light but look at you can see other stuff i sear combination it's from the shake from the jaw it's just it's rising sir it's literally drawing the the citrus into the into the tea hmm it is those are those aren't carbonation that's particular particular term the from all of the particulates so do we drink we don't drink it like that though right why not do it it says top with we can't just do that it's not gonna taste that you drink this way though cuz you're just gonna drink the tea drag the straw and suck through that's a lot of work why don't is a lottery I guess you could stir I like the look of it though there you go whoa Jesus thanks Jameson holy Jamison I've never seen anybody do that when drinking at a bar like everybody gets together and everybody just like all right well fine sure ah ah usually these it was a cool look it wasn't good good luck at least we got on camera that's why we're here and I think it even recorded this my good okay sour a little bit the Jameson's good there I get that good whiskey flavor yep but I think the flavor of the Irish was he plays it feels like it just hahaha it comes out really well yeah you get a little bit of rose you get the tea you get the love it it's always oh that was like a rose tea like it does the herbs that kind of come at the end it's got a bitter dry finish I'm guessing it's called the irish pol because you're gonna get hammered on this and start being all oh you're gonna start colonizing yeah that'll work maybe philosophizing mm-hmm the balance on this is sort of the day being lost pausing boom balance is really good if I like a well balanced tree if you like the balance if you like the black tea flavor because there's black teen in Jameson so you got to be okay with jenison it means if you drink Jameson and it makes you spray onto the ceiling you don't like this drink and you maybe Linda Blair and if the answer says I'll glad you're laughing cuz I was like yeah yeah I don't know you tell me come on that's not my head smile no I think it's going to show no I was laughing going at some point it's all gonna come on I'm gonna understand why or I have to wait until next week um wait till the comments come out and the the black tea is subtle but it finishes they get it yeah you get that in an hour and the like the team has like a 10 any dryness to it yeah like I'm feeling it I feel like a card right now hmm jean-luc real gray yeah well i was actually looking for Earl Grey but I think this is this might have been lady grey or something oh this was okay yeah couldn't you were looking for I thought you were trying to think of another males so you were trying to think of where all great so John the question today I want a question a sar why what's your favorite bourbon and how would you learn to drink alcohol Street practice how do you learn how did you learn a drink alcohol strain what's your favorite bourbon and who's your favorite Star Trek The Next Generation character because of Burma kisses berbera yeah that's good stuff yeah I'm gonna have to hit you for your nursing that stupid question I know I get confused Eileen what would you think it is awry dad it's got to be fun Kentucky right get my thing you don't have to be but it's in that area but it's not made overseas I didn't know if it was like a whiskey or like it's not a Tennessee whiskey you know it's a makers mark bourbon yeah nobody cuz it's good i usually if i didn't have my house for a make a minute makers just nice and it's get the sweet mean it might go with those sweet vermouth manhattan yeah amat you know what I'm now I'm thinking about it I think you're in I calling you on is right and here's why for what this it doesn't have it this doesn't have an oak um finish right um it's not strong it's not some to it right i remember days me I would have just thrown up your laptop know this don't rope Jesus there's no real just throw the cap now and stuff you know how do you know Derek's not drunk cuz he just dropped the cap and caught it a minute um that doesn't not really okay it doesn't have a lot of okina there is a little bit of like what like almost like a French oh just a little bit finish but if it was out like a supercharged okie like Devils cut I think it would they would kill this drink you lose little t UD would claim the roads are very subtle right and you it turned this turns into more like a little herbal drink that's not arable like chartreuse if you used heavy oak you'd have to use a lot more and then we just turn into a whiskey smash she's also good but yeah ouch is very good but would be a different plenty of different this is your ass see Allison wants is good right it has to be Irish i would say irish japanese or canadian you're probably okay you get the bourbon country maybe Tennessee whiskey I think would be a little too potent yeah like a look rip rip your face off yeah no jacket no JD in here no beam no three wise men this drink is straight up the way should be don't get yourself this is this is X period this sounds good I say actually pretty good because roses ever tried to delegate at hey to play right in roses done right we got the rose water somewhere right yeah that's just it's got the that's an aromatic flavor what you get it in the aroma but you don't get in taste like this you know you exist in the aroma no no not really now you get the tea in the aroma right so if you're looking for more simple syrups we carry mall they're all I got like 60 nice yeah is there a ginger lime yeah we got you have your things a whole cardamom so if you're guessing we're gonna bring a bunch of different yeah nice simple sharp is really fun to play it because this is a sugar yeah and I don't want to make this like you could go out you can make this go roses and simple syrup boil it and then figure out what to do with it this is already done for me on but yeah that's it so now you know where to go to get you out high balls in the world simple service as well as your chef and squeezers and your Chicago eyeballs and shakers and everything yeah ha awesome drinks yup pow every day do you scum cow look at your age it's a fruit it's a pepper away that's adventure for vegetable ha ha ha well I think about it huh oh that's got like a really good balance of so the line gives a good citrus pneus you get licensed", "sDpK0gl14fk": "I'm sure you heard of it before it's the drink that has swept the nation in expensive grocery bills its kombucha and it can be made with four ingredients a little bit now let's briefly touch on what kombucha exactly is it's literally just tea that has been fermented and the way that it's fermented is you use this little discus shaped thing it looks weird it looks kind of gross to be honest with you I'm just being honest most people is it looks gross okay but I promise it's not gross just cuz something looks gross doesn't mean it is gross like Chile for example Chile looks and gross but for the most part it can be pretty good this little mass is called the scoby now what that stands for is a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast point is you literally just make a sweetened tea and drop this bad boy in there now there's a little bit of a process but it's extremely easy and if you've ever wanted to get into fermentation in my opinion this is a great place to start because it is so easy and requires very little time and if you don't know how to get a Segovia where to get one I have a link for it in the description below so an amazon link that you can actually buy one and have one delivered to your house or you may have a friend that hasn't if you have a friend that makes kombucha ask them for ask Opie go run over there and steal it maybe don't do that I don't want to get comments about people getting the police call in them okay all right so first we're gonna make our tea paste this is gonna make enough for a gallon sized jar if you don't have one I'll have a link below or you can get one from like Bed Bath & Beyond or world market pretty easy to find we're gonna start with three quarts or 2700 millilitres of water heat that up in a pot until it's steamy and hot do not boil this to that add one cup or 228 grams of granulated sugar stir and dissolve once you've done that make sure to turn off the heat and drop in eight black tea bags you can also use green tea if you would like to but I prefer black tea allow that to steep in hot water for four minutes once they're done steeping simply removed the teabags do not squeeze the excess water out as I'll attract some of the bitter components of the tea into your final product and you really don't want that it's pretty straightforward it's a tea so now you're gonna let it cool down to room temperature you can let that happen naturally or you can make a little ice bath and cool it down a little faster if you don't want to wait if you want to do the ice bath method you're gonna need two containers you gonna need one large enough to hold all of the liquid that you just made and you need one even larger to hold the ice bath in which the container of your liquid will sitting so as you can see here I've fashioned this little thing now this isn't an exact science but basically you're just gonna fill this up with ice about halfway and then you're gonna cover the ice with water and so that you don't want you wanted to be able to move around a little bit you know want the ice to just hold the container up you want the container to be submerged in the ice water now just situate your other container on top of the ice bath this looks a little awkward but it will situate itself when the ice melts so pour your hot liquid in and please make sure this container is heat safe once all your liquid is in simply just keep stirring it until it comes down to room temperature this will only take a few minutes like maybe one or two minutes make sure that the liquid does not become cold remember it needs to be room temperature so as soon as it feels roughly room temperature immediately pull it from the ice bath if it's ice-cold it will not ferment properly so be cautious when using this method otherwise just let it cool down naturally to room temperature with no ice bath and so it is time now you're ready to make your kombucha that is all you need to do you literally just made a tea and cooled it down now you're gonna take your tea important to a gallon sized mason oh let's just get a moment of silence for every time that I spill something so now you're gonna take your tea and you're gonna pour it into a gallon sized jar I got this one on Amazon like I said the link will be below and remember to make sure that the tea is at room temperature once you've cleaned up your mess you're gonna add 2 cups of something called your starter for your kombucha now basically what that is is it's just leftover kombucha from your last ferment so always save 2 cups of it whenever you're making a new batch that way you can add it to the new batch the reason why we do this is it creates an acidic of environment to help sort of push the ferment forward I know you're thinking Josh what the heck I just started kombucha for the first time how am I gonna have leftover well there should be some starter that comes along with the scoby that you buy if you buy one on Amazon or if you get it from a friend you can get the starter from them and then just basically use whatever you get from those sources now for some reason you don't have any at all you can substitute 2 tablespoons of vinegar once you've done that gently lay your Scobie in there so that it lays flat on the surface cover with a cloth that'll allow it to breathe but won't allow anything inside of it and just situate that with a rubber band or a hair tie whatever you got and that's pretty much it just leave that in a dark part of your house at room temperature for about 12 to 15 days oh and please label it with the date so that you know when you started it Megan taste it intermittently using a straw but do not use any metal in contact with this at this point the reason why you want to taste this as it's going is you want to know when you like it to be pulled some people may like it on day 10 some people may like it on day 20 it just depends once your kombucha is ready you can go ahead and drink it then and start a new batch or you can opt for a second fermentation aka fizziness but you can also add additional flavors here whichever you choose to do and remember to make sure to remove your Scobie there will probably be another Scobie that develops on top of that they kind of multiply over and over I have like four here you know you could just throw them you could just throw the old ones away and then keep the new ones and they'll just keep developing and rotating out or you couldn't give them away to friends and before moving forward do not forget to reserve that two cups of starter that we talked about I just like to pour it over my Scobie while it's sitting in the other container while I handle the kombucha on the side now should you choose to do the second permit you're gonna need to flip top bottles now you can flavor this with pretty much any fruit that you want I'm gonna do strawberry and rose water very fancy sounding but really easy to make they're gonna fill each bottle with a half a cup of fresh chopped strawberries do not use frozen fruit please the holding these flip top bottles tend to be a little narrow so make sure you're cutting the fruit small enough for it to fit through them then I like to add about a tablespoon of rosewater syrup to each bottle you can skip that and use honey if you don't have that obviously that's kind of a more particular ingredient then I'll also add two teaspoons of rose water to each bottle now this is also optional if you don't want to do the rose water you can't find it no big deal it's available at most grocery stores though but at least that I've seen just make sure that you do add that 1 tablespoon of honey or simple syrup if you want to add any other flavors or aromatics at this point you can do that now if not forever hold your peace then just simply pour your kombucha into each bottle filling them up leaving at least 1 inch of space from the top do not fill them all the way to the brim wipe off the top of the bottles add your flip cap and lock it that's right you're just gonna lock it and leave it out in the same spot that you left your kombucha at room temperature in a dark spot for about three to five days depending on how long it will take for your kombucha to get fizzy now be cautious here because these are generating pressure you want the pressure but they can explode I've had them explode before so just burp them once every day and bye burp I mean just open them up and let them release the gas that they're building up just do that once every day and then on the third or fifth day they'll be ready to go oh and I almost forgot please label this with a date do not forget to label it you want to know when you started this wait it doesn't turn into a small bomb anyway once those three to five days are up chill it enjoy and you're good to go kombucha forever and now it's time for more b-roll sequence to entice you [Music] you see I told you it'd be easy if you can make sweet tea and you can measure things you're gonna be just fine hello and also you should have the ability to be able to pour and not spill it everywhere like I did I get it kombucha is a little bit trendy whatever it's delicious okay take the time you won't regret it and neither will your bank account you're welcome if you enjoyed this video leave a like subscribe and I will see you next week [Music]", "Q10OCJ0sm9k": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] tonight we got another drink coming to you a hardened lemon ice tea so this is a drink you're gonna want to make if you got a big group of people coming over barbecue dinner whatever this is gonna keep us staying around your job look at the size of this courtyard we're gonna fill this right up and people are gonna be able to enjoy this all night long oh no seriousness we got to keep graduating like the quart jars they got to keep getting bigger every Wednesday night no this is what is this is 2 gallon there's two or one gal one gallon two gallon next week three gallon the weekend that week after that so let's get serious let's get started Bailey had a really good idea too from art we had a great little beach restaurant called shutters on the beach yeah and my idea was because when the fries come out of the deep fryer they're covered in oil and usually just throw salt on a boat what we used to do we used to take thyme and rosemary chopped it up real fine and throw it in the salt and what it does just add an extra boost of flavor right on top of the fries when they first come out and it like melts into the fries and it doesn't taste something so it's so amazing you know what we're gonna do we're gonna elevate that one step further and we're going to take and we're gonna put a lemon zest so it's gonna be lemon what I'm rosemary so the first thing I think we got to do is let's talk a little bit about this beautiful thought the pickerel so this is one that's already surrendered itself but I just thought I'd tell you a little sorry so yeah so we're doing it a couple different ways so some folks just pulled it up it some people love the taste of the skin you'll hear us and time and again we always talk about the skin ones this flavor in the skin maybe what would you do if you saw somebody toss and like chicken skin okay but some people you can't have it for a whole bunch of different reasons some people to text your thing whatever is going on but when you can see through the flesh you know that you've got that pretty clean but for us even this this I'm gonna say we're gonna do a star yeah you want to keep it fish stock there's all kinds of stuff fish soup if you've ever had it this is incredible man it's delicious and the thing about making a fish soup is one fish is never enough to make a really good soup a really good chowder so what we always do is we take these and then we make a stock and let's say we have a couple gallons so you take that couple gallons you reduce it down till it's maybe only 250 milliliters or 1 cup of liquid and then that liquid we put it in the freezer the next time you're making something like a stew or a janitor I mean even if you're doing stir fries if you're someone who loves their aquatic flavor make ice cubes out of that fish stock and what you do when you make a stir fry you only have to flip one ice cube toss and your stir fry and you've got beautiful beautiful fish sauce adds a little bit of extra flavor yeah ok so what should we start with first let's go Bailey's gonna start on his herb salt now I want to start off by saying I've got the deep fryer preheated so I'm using canola oil you can use peanut oil you can use vegetable oil you want to do when you pull it right out of that deep fryer as well you want to get that on into a bowl with some paper towel or something so it soaks up any excess oil and then also as you drop that salt on top of that batter that's also gonna get a cup some of the moisture from that oil so Bailey I are just talking about these and maybe we'll give them a good look at it while we're doing this Bailey and I are just talking about these fresh herbs so the rosemary is actually an evergreen so because it's an evergreen it smells incredible but because it's an evergreen green it has very woody stems and you can see that Bailey's gonna show you how to step it actually breaks off so so what you want to do when you're putting it into your soul is if you just grab the top and pinch and pull down you can see the woody stem and what's left is all the leaves all the good stuff that you want the time is a little different the time doesn't have as woody of a stem indeed can chop it finely enough to where it doesn't matter and also it has a ton of flavor in there as well as well in that but that also depends on the variety because some varieties of time you'll find it does also have a very woody stem this is not this is tender this is green and he's gonna chop that rate up now I want to show you this assault that we've selected and this hope you can have a lot of fun making these herbs salts so this is a sea salt it's very moist very it's actually damp you can see it's almost moving a bit like sand what we like to do will take four or five really great salts and put them together so you can do like a coarse pink Himalayan you can do a coarse gray even black salt so you can imagine you've got all these incredible colors you can put a smoked in there and let me tell you something this is not just for french fries think about your steaks and you know think about a venison steak with an herb salt you will need nothing else believe me you'll need nothing else so Bay's gonna chop this up good and fine and then what he'll do he'll start layering it in the pan or in the bowl and the key is that when you do end up putting this together to keep it so that it turns out really nice just turn it over like once a day if you didn't just shake it turn it over what happens is it'll get rid of any of that moisture while we're off the camera there let's have a look at this I want to talk a little bit about fish so these fish are this is a like for us what we were catching out there this fish is it's it's kind of a small pick role but so the belly the belly meat on it is very very thin so what I want to do is I want to show you something really simple now these filets we took and look at that beautiful flesh we took the scales off so that's ready to go so the important thing is when you do scale if you're going to take a paring knife and go in the opposite direction of the scales so that's very simple to do let me tell you something before you do especially with feral it's best to do it outside unless you want it to look like confetti on a wedding day keep doing it inside came in from his hair off his arms I was covered so now for those of you who don't want any of the skin on here's here's a really simple way to do pic roll quickly the great thing is about two round fish like this they kind of give you a little bit of a guide so you can see here where the flesh begins how it up the back you can feel it and it goes right down to the tail so if I want to do this by remove and remove the skin I'll just I don't need to scale it in order to do that just run my knife up in here and passes through very cleanly slice that and then excuse me I'm just working on the tape a little bit of a tight space here and then I'll just literally run my knife down the backbone and what you can do at home what I'm feeling is I can literally feel that backbone as I run down and when I get to this point now you can use a fillet knife the reason I'm using a chef's knife tonight is because if you don't have a fillet knife I want you to know that you can do it with a flat knife like this with a chef's knife when you get to this point so in this area you'll have all of the ribcage okay the rib cage runs right in this area here as you get past that you can pass a knife through here we go and you'll reach and just literally there we go we'll take it right down the end we're gonna leave that intact then I'm gonna run my knife along the edge and I can literally pierce through and I'm gonna cut right through those bones I remember the first time he ever taught me to fillet a fish it went nothing like what you're seeing right now well and I just I just skipped a beat there for a second so the reason that I leave this on is because I can I've got lots to hold on to so when you're working with a knife here your direction of tonight you always want that to be away from you so I'm gonna put a little slit in it right here towards your son yeah trust me I'm going with you and then literally just work your way down and as you do you're gonna pull off that beautiful fillet so you can see there's almost no waste here and now that I've got that off I want to show you the rest of this you can see that's where my knife slipped there so there is a center bone here and you can just literally run your knife along this now on a bigger fish you can literally run that and take those belly ribs what I'm gonna do for this purpose and it it really works nicely for deep frying is I've got a beautiful tail piece and then I've got this top loin part which is just perfect now this is so thin I'm not going to discard that but for me this is going to go into that fish stew and I'm going to flake off any of that beautiful flesh and when I freeze that stock it's gonna be right in there so I'm gonna have the beautiful taste and fragrance and of the and flavor of the stock but at the same time it's gonna have the texture all that beautiful flaky white you can see how all that thyme and rosemary and even the lemon zest has all moved in together the thing I like about the lemon zest idea is a lot of people when they're having fish and chips they'll take lemon and sprinkle it on their fur to their paper all yep now you have that same sour sweet coming into your fries I think it's gonna be you and remember you know one of the challenges I love to put out there is using the whole either the whole fish or the whole fruit and at this point so what we want to do literally is just take and run the knife along that bump and you'll see if you if you get bigger pickerel you can literally run your finger right along there and go up underneath and take those bones right out but for our purpose tonight again I'm gonna go to the end of that cage and then I'm gonna take that tail so I'm gonna have a beautiful beautiful piece of tail meat there look at that look at how gorgeous that fleshes it's just absolutely beautiful and then what I've got here is that nice big thick loin so the reason I like to do that as well is when I'm deep-frying if I deep-fry this thinner piece what happens is this will be extremely overcooked it'll be extremely overdone and what I want is good how we do there buddy pretty good I got I used a full jar you can see if you do this you know a couple weeks for at least a couple weeks if you use so like we do you'll have a beautiful herb crust salt for anything like if you ever pan frying your your fish one night or pretty like that said anything your steaks any way you want right in the lemon zest yeah just brings it to life you can see I got a full dirt you like dakotas drink I think it's fine yeah it's time for a little mixology earning hardened lemon iced tea and I mean like we said before this drink is if you're having a big group of people over barbecues dinner not this is what you want to make we're going with some Southern Comfort which has really nice notes of whiskey and spices and all kinds of great flavors we're gonna throw some peaches in there obviously some lemons we've got some black tea that we brewed earlier and some gorgeous clover honey the way we're gonna start this we're gonna add some iced tea into this right away or sorry not nice tea some ice Oh big gallon pitcher and then like I says for a lot of people so we're gonna start off with a cup of Southern Comfort now you'll see here I have a liquid measure what you want to make sure is that there's dry measure this is a dry measure so this is meant for dry ingredients flour sugar yeast those types of things this is a wet measure you want to use this for any liquids they are not the same thing so we're gonna go with a cup of this which is 8 ounces where's our cup measure here 1 cup this may seem like a lot but this is for a large group of people folks smells amazing Oh smell that yeah I got apricot peach flavors and that's what we're doing is we're hinting that's why we use these garnishes like the right we're hinting to the flavors that are in the drink already by adding this because Southern Comfort has a lot of hints of apricot and peach so we're just gonna dump that right in I do like adding the alcohol right away onto the ice just a preference of mine we're gonna add in so this is that black tea that we brewed earlier you can do with different types of tea you know you can do steep tea that have different flavors into it using loose leaf you know getting into coconut and raspberry flavored I myself just like a straight-up black unsweetened tea this will be sweetened a little bit by some of that honey that we add in this recipe will be online right after by the way so you can make it this coming weekend now lemon what we're gonna do to begin with is we're gonna roll this lemon you want to roll it so that you'll loosen up some of that pulp and juice you want to make sure to get as much juice out of a lemon as you can so rolling it just helps to loosen up it on the inside here or you cut it you get the most juice out of one lemon as you can you want to put your weight into it and then we're just gonna these are actually pretty good there's not many seeds you always want to watch for seeds someone wants a seed in their drink she's gonna squeeze some of this fresh lemon juice in there there's nothing like fresh lemon juice we are gonna add a little bit of lemonade in here just to make up for some of it go and then actually got my reamer there this is a reamer this helps get all that pulp and juice out really nicely that's a really good tool to really get as much you can use it for anything lemon juice or if you want to make some fresh-squeezed orange juice in the morning that school is really important to have in your kitchen and then I would be adding the lemon zest in here but in this pitcher we don't want to bog up that little spout down there at the bottom but the lemon zest will come from when we slice up these lemons and we toss the slices actually in and what you want to do is before your barbeque you could actually be great to make this the night before because then you can let you'll see all these things we're gonna toss in here do it the night before toss it in the fridge get it chilled and all those flavors are gonna infuse and come together especially those peaches if you let those sit overnight and then you eat one of those peaches the next day drunk peaches yeah literally before full everything different of those all right now we're gonna add just a little bit of that lemonade just to bring up that liquid level a little bit gorgeous color oh look at the color of that I mean we're gonna already start to eat with our eyes as we always say now honey this clover honey that's gonna bring some of that sweetness to that unsweetened tea that's but the nice thing about using honey first of all it's natural you have the ability to support one of some of your local blowers this is a local honey wherever you are support local buy local honey so I can support them instead of using sugar honey brings that flavor as well everybody loves honey is great and like the way this smells right now between the lemon tea black tea and the Southern Comfort this is honestly it literally just smells like iced tea yeah but as soon as you add those peaches that's gonna be horrible so this is just carbonated water I like carbonated water because it brings another texture to the drink I mean on a hot day you don't think if you had a glass of water and a glass of carbonated water this is so much better it cools you off so you'll see as soon as we add this and it's gonna you'll see those bubbles start to form in it look at that it's like having bread without yeast and then bread with yeast that's like having a drink without carbonation and then a drink with carbonation all righty now we're gonna mix some of this together first we're gonna take some of these mint leaves so mint leaves are great to add into a drink like this because you can just put them in whole no need to chop them those oils will come right out of the leaves into the drink if you let it sit if you drink it right away you're probably not gonna taste them too much but if you let it sit overnight in the fridge you'll taste a big time it's gonna infuse just like steeping oh yeah just like steeping no different than if you rub the leaves between your fingers and you heat up those oils and stuff you and then you smell your friends you smell your hands smells like mint no different than if you leave it overnight so that's about probably around nine leaves we're gonna toss in there now gonna take some of these lemon slices and what you want to do is you want to take your time here even though these are just lemon slices you want it look beautiful okay each step you take to make your drinks look more gorgeous your guests are just gonna like it even more so we're just taking time making sure that all of these levels delicious I smell so good we're just gonna toss these in first I'm gonna give this a quick stir before I talk about it bring all that together toss in some of these lemon slices right on top at Southern Comfort so you get those notes of the apricot no kidding okay and then peaches you know peaches are one of my absolute favorites I got married in Georgia so peaches have a they're close to my heart so we're gonna take that you have the Pitt on this side we're just gonna do slices here cut that in half if you can see that half half again and we're just gonna toss those in and that's gonna be so good and like Bailey said if you eat these peaches afterwards they're gonna be drunk peaches all right cut this in half again give you and take that pit out Swit again I'm gonna keep dropping these in that's so you know one of the things about the outdoor chef is we love wild to table and we love this this ever-growing story of the outdoors honestly we feel like we're part of a generation who's recapturing their history so what we want to do is we want to take everything that's been done we want to rebirth it we want to bring it back we want to make it new and we want to make it awesome we want to make it easy that was easy look at that that was easy that was five minutes you can make this toss it in her fridge or serve it right away and you're ready to go everyone can show up and they got a drink right cost a little bit more of that southern yeah I think just a little bit more only one cup yeah yeah yeah so you know your discretion throw me ain't you know why don't there throw we some of those hearts if you're loving this - I got it we got to show Dakota the nose come on drink these drinks are incredible guys we're giving away some amazing recipes give that a try ice-cold yeah peach lemon it's fresh yeah like you said the carbonation or the carbonation right rings it up also those little bubbles they carry the flavor yep and the thing is you don't need you just need a little bit of each thing some lemonade some tea you know the tea is what also refreshes you gives you on a day a hot day a little bit of caffeine if you use non you know you don't want to use caffeine free they'll give you a nice jump and then let's talk about a couple other things so let's say we got to do this non-alcoholic yes cuz we know some of you you can't have all called alcohol for a variety of reasons you're pregnant woman in the summer exactly so one way you can infuse this and bring it to another level we can ride this if we took and we juiced a couple peaches so you have a pure peach juice drop that peach juice in there beautiful increase the amount of mint and maybe increase it the amount of honey all of a sudden you have a beautiful virgin and what's its called again hard lemon ice tea and I mean if you want to bring in some of the notes for a virgin up to Southern Comfort Angostura bitters is a great way to add a little bit of that spice flavor a lot of the flavors that you would bring with whiskey into it add some of that in there three or four dashes and that's gonna bring that to life so the next thing we want to do is we want to do a little technique with the beer batter so let's put together this beer bag so the first thing that's going to go in is we got to start with the base of flour so just as straight all-purpose flour is gonna work great and what we'll do is we're gonna we're gonna talk about a few flavor ingredients now listen I got to tell you I've had the absolute privilege of serving a lot of really cool people you know presidents prime ministers celebrities and I've had that opportunity I can tell you every step along the way everybody always gets the same potato Seether the same potato the same pickle the same flour you might ask yourself out how do I make really great food and how do I do it easily you just have to find little ways to increase the flavor profile just slightly just like the soap what Bailey did with the salt a perfect example I mean you've seen salt I can give you our salt that looks like this which is just you know straight salt you can have that soap or you can have this salt now which one are you gonna choose we're talking about pennies per serving here a little bit of fresh herb a little bit of lemon and you've got yourself an incredible cooking element so let's start with 2 cups of all-purpose flour and pour important for this before you get to the beer get all your dry ingredients incorporated first and get them mixed together evenly before you add the beer that way everything is mixed in there really nicely stir yeah let's go with 3 so do 3 3 cups of flour and now let's do a half of the so cornmeal eyes you know cornmeal is beautiful corn when it's toasted think about 2 cornbread now I wouldn't want to do a complete value-add way you said I like thing about cornbread but what you're gonna get is you're gonna get a texture thing so we're not only talking about flavor so we're gonna have this beautiful golden batter we want something with some texture so this will stand up let's put actually let's put a let's put a full-stop tell you what we're not stuck in recipes we're not stuck in recipes we're not stuck in these recipes we want to be able to create something special on the fly there you go that's good 1 cut this so the next thing we've got here so this we've got a little bit of paprika and we've got some cayenne pepper now you don't wanna get these two babies mixed up actually this is the Cayenne it's a little more orange in color if you get these mixed up you're gonna you're gonna be in trouble so literally what we're we're gonna take about the equivalent of about a teaspoon now you could you could add pepper to this afterward but one of the things about any batters you want to make sure you get the seasoning in the batter as well and then we're going to take a heaping tablespoon of the paprika so paprika you know these are peppers as well a nice smoked paprika tons of flavor remember we're looking for those levels of flavor so that's why we got to get it done and when you're dealing with flavors such as strong as these and even cornmeal you don't want to make sure to always mix your dry ingredients first before you do wet what the last thing you want is somebody to be eating their fish and get a big bite of paprika or anything like that oh yeah oh thank you okay go for it bring that one together I always like to add fresh ground black pepper as well whenever using black pepper make sure it's fresh ground every single time we're gonna add a bunch of black pepper in this and the reason fresh ground black pepper is that when you grind it fresh you're gonna activate all that flavor that's locked up in those beautiful little berries oils right bro we've been talking about oils a lot the past couple of oily thing has oils but I would think when you toast the spice or when you grind the peppers down you're releasing everything has some kind of moisture in it not to mention the fact that the black the taste not to mention the fact that the black pepper will hold longer when it's full when it's stay fresher so this looks great now I get to do the fun part here this is if you're on your pontoon boat this is gonna you don't have it down beside you this is what's gonna hurt you good crack okay so we're gonna make it rain now what you want is a nice Pilsner we have done before a dark beer but you know just depends how bold you want those flavor the darker the beer the richer the flavor the darker the batter it just makes sense now even they were getting you know we'll get cracking oh wait already Punisher oh yeah it seemed like that wasn't good like twenty years of crack that's exactly okay so what we want is we want to texture keep in mind that as you're adding the beer that it will thicken up as it sits too so you want something that's the consistency of like a really heavy cream okay so let's talk about a few different cuts for fresh cut fries so when you're talking about russets you want to go ahead and leave in my opinion leave that skin on yeah you know it's a great classic way to do a french fry plus it's so fast and it's so simple and there's tons of flavor and why would you take it all life is difficult enough leave the peel on them taters so what you want to do is start off by and we're probably closer for this one - did you want to start off by giving yourself a good flat edge to work with so always slice the potato just slice it in half and then what you can do is you're working with a good flat surface yeah that's really important is the flat surface the last thing you want is to cut yourself in the kitchen and always I'd say the most important thing about cutting for me that when I learned as always to have a flat surface you have don't have anything rolling on in it's really easy to work with and uniform size especially when you're doing frying because the problem is if you have something that's a great big wedge you're gonna get something that's a little overcooked a little undercooked and you're just not gonna have the text you're looking for so you can see the math that I'm doing here I'm literally just making sure everything is roughly the same size for me I like big long french fries great for dipping and ketchup and in this Remillard sauce we're gonna make party to its hearty you know and you know the potatoes are beautiful so the russet potato is has you know a nice amount of starch and you can use white potatoes you can use yellow petitions red potatoes but for me the russet is the king when he comes to French for best french fried absolutely yep so I'm literally just gonna keep slicing these up I'm gonna do one more here and then we'll hold move onto the remoulade deep fryer deep fryer is hot and you notice the order which we went so that fish the batter is going to be holding there it doesn't have to go into the refrigerator has nothing perishable in it and it's ready to go as soon as we are it's nice to let that batter rest though what happens is some of the some of the starches they relax and it means that your batter will be more consistent and we'll get some really great results fries this is like being back at shutters on the beach you know I don't know how many hamburgers do you think we made there a lot I should be asking your brother cuz you worked the window but he didn't he leave the grill I'm man enough hamburgers so if I didn't make the hamburger yeah it makes to me burgers do you eat the burger so okay so now the key is we're just gonna let these sit in the water for a minute but while we do or when we come back and we're gonna make sure whenever you're deep frying what is the enemy of hot we'll see that look he knew what I was he knew I was going that's before that couple watering by accident is it a little bit that's the whoa now mayonnaise by itself is beautiful but what the REM Allah does is it just elevates it because you're gonna get that again it's slightly sweet slightly bitter and some of the ingredients are gonna tell you all about that so get that nail in there we'll just dump that whole thing in there and make sure it's mayonnaise ya know Miracle Whip please so and we'll have a recipe for mayonnaise for you to do if you want to do your own and then these little beauties so let me know can you she'll give me a show you know what these little beauties are anybody watching right now can you tell me what those are oh come on guys let us know what these are so those are capers beautiful capers and all we want to do code is just make one pass over them so just a nice chop one pass over so we have beautiful texture great and then let's put those in k4 Zin and then we've got these beautiful split some of these in his well put some of those pickles in yeah so literally the thing about the pickle is you want to literally take it just take a moment slice like this quarter it lengthwise then like this and literally just make then when you do this then a fine dice so doing a fine dice makes it so it will stand up and stick out but also that is its bite side so it's not going to be too big when you put that in that's gonna be just perfect you work on those I bring this together then I'm gonna put a couple spices in here as well we're gonna reach for this paprika make sure I get the paprika and I'm just gonna put a little bit of the paprika in there I love it for that smoky flavor I love it for the color and then it's gonna be lemon so once again you'll see you're gonna need a lot of lemons if you're cooking with the authorities yeah this is such an easy way to get flavor that's bright citrus is such an easy way to get flavor just chop them all up we'll need them okay and for me you can make a really fine round a lot so this can go into the food processor or you can chop it up but I like to have something with a little bit of texture the the fish is so soft to begin with why not give it a bunch of flavor little buddy here you can put a pinch of cayenne but this one is ready to go no tie to this time to start be your battery so it Pratt it's time to deep fry the first thing we're gonna do is because the fish cooked fairly quickly let's get some fries rolling here I'm gonna take and drain this off then we'll Pat these dry yep yep you know what you want to do is like we said before you want to Pat those dry if you toss those and even if they have if you can see that even if they have that slight residue of water on it you toss in a whole handful you're getting that oils gonna react immediately and it could boil over yeah and you don't want that mess in your kitchen it makes a terrible mess yeah now you see we've got this underneath pretty much underneath the hood and the reason why that works so good is we can turn that exhaust fan on now whenever you're working with deep fryers obviously this is never something that a child should be doing this is for moms and dads so in the basket and the first thing you do is just drop them down what I do I just give that a little shake you can see we've got just the right amount of water in there that it's not gonna boil over so while we're doing that I'm gonna get my F fish ready all right so the first thing that we have to do is we've got a little plate of all-purpose flour now yes we did put some of the all-purpose flour in the beer batter but one of the things have you ever made a beer batter and then the batter just seems to jump off just falls off jumps off it it's in the deep fryer so what we want to do is you want to take your beautiful pick roller and you just want to rule that so this little step here what happens is the starches in the flour they immediately bond to the flesh and then it bonds also to that beer batter making it stick beautifully if you can see you've got some yeah nice tail pieces here was lining them up here's some skin on skin on skin off personally I just love the skin on these would be perfect - these are perfectly prepped and ready to go if you wanted to pan fry them they're also ready to go now make sure when you're doing anything like this that this flour is contaminated now I know it sounds simple but this flour is contaminated you've put fish in it if you leave this out how long will it last if you put this in the fridge if you want your say making fish the next thing well you know Fisher Fisher kind of unique you know they're not like chicken yeah so you know you're no problem you can reuse this for a week you have just if you put it in the fridge but if you leave it out for any longer than an hour or something I wouldn't use it again no okay so let's check out our fries and see how they're coming along here Oh starting to crisp up and get golden already they look good so the other thing that you want to make sure to have ready is you need a big bowl and as much as all of that fat tastes so delicious and let's talk a little bit about one of my favorite fats and that is using shortening straight shortening as a fat in here is unbeliev it takes your fries to the next level anytime that we do a restaurant we use shortening that large just makes those fries taste incredible so what I've actually done in this is I've got canola but I had a pound of shortening and I put it in there the flavor is amazing shortening lasts longer in the fryer that's 50% longer yeah and the upside is to is when you unplug it and it cools it goes firm again yep so you're not slopping it around if you store it for another use those are coming up nicely that's sort of awesome yep and let's have a look at this batter now looks like it's good consistency you can see how it's actually settled a bit like we said now that you left it you can see how the consistency is actually changed so the nice little that's the great thing about using a beer batter is the fact that it's got all those incredible little bubbles going on this is a great way to know your fries are done they're floating up at the top they look absolutely that they're floating right at the top so I'm going to drain this for a moment before I tip it into the pan and then we'll tip it into this and this is where Bailey's herb salt comes in so you toss it first like this and then Bailey's herb salt it's just gonna melt on top of that see there's all that beautiful salt mouth all over that and has that hot that it's also you know Danelle rate in there I love it the more I love it yeah I love it okay so that's good now tell me what you want to get a plate for us leave this on and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get this beer batter ready to go in now one of the key techniques when you're doing fish is if you take let's take this beauty I think this is gonna be a hero right here so this is the tail you can see skin on that is a perfect piece of fish you know I don't want to tell you what you'd pay for that in a restaurant but you know if you're a fisherman you know the value in it and take bringing that home so what you do is literally take and lay it in that beer batter get a nice coating going on it and then this is the key when you go to put it in you're gonna do a wave do the wave do the wave it's literally it's it's a know March to the fish it's the final flap literally do this what happens is as that oil hits the batter it puffs up and then what she does is she floats and it'll float a little shake like this and that's gonna be rate on the surface let's do another one of these beautiful tails one thing you want to make sure of as well is not to crowd the deep fryer if you crowd the deep fryer what you'll end up doing is you'll end up it'll attach and you'll have it's instead of fish tails you'll have a big fish nugget they're just being just a giant nugget so again that flap now this this technique applies whether you do chicken you know chicken fried chicken fried steak onion rings and see how she floats like that now that we're important to make sure that you have the right temperature you can see we've got it set at 375 reason our Cuisinart professional deep fryer which has beautiful recovery time like a sneak behind you yeah yeah and and I'm gonna get a little lunch one of the best things that we do when you talk about different kinds of fish is when you take Lake Erie the lake where we caught these it's famous for yellow perch yes you take those gorgeous little perch fillets and do those in a beer batter I mean you want to talk about good that is incredible so fries on the plate this is the best part their eyes on the plate mount those babies up so we'll take and put some of that right there oh my goodness looks so good baby if you want to get a lemon and we'll do some lemon wedges put that on there so number one I'm just gonna lift this momentarily that beer batter has affixed itself to that tail it's attached to the fish it hasn't floated off and you notice there's nothing on the bottom of that tray so there's nothing that's stuck to the bottom they're floating freely and this is what's really important you want to make sure that there's enough free oil because these deep fryers are not like commercial deep fryers so what happens is as soon as you put even room-temperature product inside them immediately the oil begins to cool so don't overcrowd it this goes the same for if you're doing chicken wings or anything you're doing make sure to give it enough time number one to recover and number two don't crowd that pan I think these are just about ready to come out they're nice and golden brown they'll literally take and I'll just hold that for a moment so literally you it's hot make sure you got a pair of tongs to make sure it goes cuts off and you can basically stick a sanitizer so so then again we're gonna look back to this beautiful herb salt and we're just gonna like these babies up same thing that salt is gonna begin melting on that beautiful fish let's put this on our plate got that beautiful drink to pair with it look at that now listen this is a this is a dish that's gonna make you really really happy it's gonna make your guests really happy as well", "-LyxAHHo3kg": "okay so I know we can't go to

coffee um so needless to say i'm soaring i'm flying there's not a star in heaven that i cannot reach alright so as the title says today we're back with another starbucks video i know what you're thinking you thought you seen the last of me today we are going to be making starbucks refreshers and you might be thinking wait a second i think that this video exists already on my channel and to that i would say you're correct so basically the other day i decided i would watch my old videos because i wanted to observe how cringy i am especially in that video it's like bad it's it's bad even like the recipe is terrible um so i think i owe it to the people who like watched that video seriously and like wanted to know how to make these i think i owe it to them to remake this video yeah that video is just really really bad i'm sorry if that's how you found my channel so yeah today we're going to be making the strawberry acai very very hibiscus and the mango dragon fruit refresher so yeah without further ado let's get into making these drinks once again all right so in the last video i used like drink mix powder things and a lot of people commented that they couldn't find them but here's something that is a lot more accessible and literally the base to every refresher it's white grape juice you can find it everywhere it's basically just like a sweet juice you know it's like the same stuff that you drink on new year's and you were eight and you were like i have a glass of champagne but it was really just like sparkling white grape juice so you're gonna need white grape juice you're gonna need hibiscus tea and then i also have an acai tea because that's the only acai thing i could find i have some dragon fruit some dragon food i have some dragon fruit pumps is frozen into a solid block that's that's a thing i have some strawberries blackberries some mango that i can't tip unless i want to spill mango all over the floor and then i also have some freeze-dried strawberries all right so i figured i'd start with the strawberry acai you guys have no idea how many wrong pronunciations of acai i have heard throughout my years at starbucks we have the most common one which is akai um strawberry akaki um strawberry acacia i've heard them all i don't know what this is but i'm gonna use it all right so for the strawberry acai i'm using this glass i'm gonna do like a third of the way juice i brewed the two different teas next to each other took the tea bags out they're the same color and i don't know which tea is which okay we're gonna say this one is the acai one okay pour the acai tea in there to about the second third now i'm going to take this tool i don't know what this is for anyone know what this is comment down below not a clue and i'm just going to mush up these strawberries all right put in your strawberries probably not the most hygienic thing to do to put them in with your hands all right so far this is what it looks like all of the refreshers have like a green coffee bean extract in them to give them caffeine you can find that on amazon if you would like to purchase that and make these caffeinated but i didn't feel like it was necessary because i don't need it and if you just want the taste of these then this is perfect lastly we have the good old freeze-dried strawberries when i worked at starbucks these were like 50 of my diet i used to just eat the freeze-dried fruit all day all right so yeah here we have the strawberry acai this tastes exactly like the strawberry acai if you want get a little spicy you just add in your coconut milk on top honestly the way that it like gets like mix that up nice and good like boom you've got your pink drink all right so now we are going to move on to the lesser desired refresher and that is the very very hibiscus it has been compared to toilet water before but yeah follow the same steps put in white grape juice to like a third of the way get your berry hibiscus tea and pour that in boom i brewed the tea on extra strength so that it would be like hella strong see the last video i did about the refreshers was just like honestly what was i doing like why my behavior was uncalled for all right so we have the white grape juice till like here the berry hibiscus tea until like here some ice blackberries boom this honestly tastes a lot better than starbucks it has more taste than starbucks one which is bomb then if you want add the coconut milk boom you got yourself your violet drink purple drink violet i think this is i think it's a violet drink where is it i don't remember it's been a while this one tastes so much better than starbucks and i'm kidding i spilt um the pink drink on my phone and just let it marinate in the speaker there for a few minutes i don't know why i did that all right so lastly we are going to make yeel mango dragon fruit and for that obviously we're just gonna put in this third of the way grape juice and then and then we have the diced mango you already know everything is in those apple bee sauce things that i stole i'm just gonna dump like the mango juice and a couple mango pieces into here it looks like that the mangoes i have here are literally like canned mangoes so you can find them anywhere they're really cheap why does this taste like peaches conspiracy that tastes exactly like a peach now for the ingredient that i just completely left out in the last video dragon fruit i just like decided i wasn't gonna put dragon fruit in my last video for some reason take the dragon fruit put it in there use not your hands if you're serving other people but this is for me and me only so i do not care i got this dragon fruit at target alright so here is the mango dragon fruit it tastes just like the mango dragon fruit but like literally fractions of the price and you can make so much out of this like oh my god the ups guy is here i didn't order anything from ups but hopefully he has something for me wait it's my ring light i'm screaming also hi he can see me through the window my ring light came say hello to the newest beauty guru in town i'm just kidding i'm not gonna make beauty videos so yeah now if you want to make this into a dragon drink you just add coconut milk alrighty guys so yeah that is the cheapest and easiest way to make refreshers at home disregard the video i made last year all you need is basically white grape juice and tea so yeah that's how you do that i didn't think i was ever gonna make another starbucks related video but here i am also i know that it kind of bothers some people that i never do exact measurements but like honestly just do it to taste i usually use like the rule of thirds that has nothing to do with drinks the rule of thirds is like an art term anyways i usually use like thirds like i'll do a third of the juice a third of the tea or milk and then the rest of the third the ice so like do that or just do it to taste however you feel like you want it to taste whatever floats your boat whatever tickles your pickle you know what i mean one of these times there you go all right guys thank you so much for watching this video if you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up subscribe if you would like to um comment down below what kind of things you want to see on my channel i don't really know what i'm doing right now no rhyme or reason to my content leave some ideas down below there was like another refresher there for a minute what was it like kiwi starfruit or something and it like disappeared because there was like a bad batch and it was all rotten so i never got the chance to try it so i have no clue what it tastes like so i decided i wouldn't make it but yeah thank you guys so much for watching subscribe like the video um here's my instagram

series I'm going to show you how you can replicate the refreshing yummy drinks that you can find in Thailand and so we're going to kick off our series with of course the most popular Thai drink in Thai restaurants here Thai iced tea now Thai ste in Thai we call it chai in cha means tea and Yin means cool but in the context of beverages means iced so it just simply means iced tea but if you say that in Thailand it's going to be the Milky sweet stuff that you get in restaurants here but first of all what is Thai tea so you may already know this but all teas come from the same tea plant it's just in the way they process it after harvest and makes them into different teas Oh Thai tea is a black tea pretty much and the reason why it's got a really bright iconic orange color it's because there is food coloring added to it so nothing glamorous there umm and Thai tea usually has artificial flavoring added to it mostly vanilla from what I've seen so you know nothing was serious and there's nothing inherently Thai about it either it's just the way that we like to drink it okay so let's get started okay so we're starting with our Thai tea I'm using about three tablespoons of Thai tea leaves per cup of water and I'm using this also cloth coffee filter in Thailand they use this cloth bag looks like a sock really and and basically I'd recommend using a cloth filter like this one or paper filter because there's a lot of tea dust entice tea and find the mesh strainer is actually not going to catch everything and you get little bits of grounds like you do in French press coffee so cloth and paper would work one table sorry one cup off off the boil water really you can figure out the kind of set that works for you with whatever you have you don't have to get it to be exactly this setup now we're going to let the steep for about three to five minutes and now tea wise I'm using you can use whatever kind of thai tea you can get ahold of I'm just using this brand here just so you can see it and and I actually chose this one because it says on the bag please drink Thai tea mix I mean it who could say no to a bag that says please drink Thai tea so but any brand in my experience has been has given more or less the same result so there you go so there's that while that's getting set up we're going to get our mixing station set up so you want a glasses to be a mixing glass so I'm going in with about but a tablespoon and a half of condensed milk that works out to using a tea spoon and doing this about three times and of course you can customize how much of that you want and then to this I'm going to add two teaspoons of sugar and again what you might ask well why not just add all condensed milk and why mix it with sugar well remember that condensed milk not only are you going to add sweetness you're also going to add creaminess and thickness and richness which I find if I make the the sweetness with only condensed milk it's too rich and creamy and it's not as refreshing so I mix it with a little bit of sugar and oh my trick I almost forgot a little bit of salt just a tiny little pinch of salt will actually make the sweetness not too cloying it will brighten up the the personality of the sugar and it's the same reason why you always add salt into your cookies and your cakes and things like that in the meantime we also need our ice so you want a glass full full full of ice because this is going to go in warm and it's going to melt a little bit our ice so you need enough then we're just going to mix it if you're doing this for the first time you don't know how sweet you wanted you want to give it a taste at this point and you're tasting for it to be a little too sweet because remember you're going to pour this into this Cup and if this is perfectly sweet by the time it goes in here it will dilute your tea a little bit I'm going to add just a little bit more sugar in here I mean each time it's always a little bit different because you may not get your water exactly at the same each time sometimes I get more water out of the teabags and so that's why it's always good to taste so I could theoretically pour this in here but I'm afraid of spilling on camera so I'm going to transfer it back into my spouted picture here so I don't create a mess see how quickly our ice is melting that's why it's important to have a ton of ice otherwise it just won't be good okay not done we also need to add evaporated milk comes in a can just like this okay and that's another reason why you don't want to add too much condensed milk because you want to top it up here and you get a nice sort of waterfall gradient cool effect right here and you're done that's pretty much theis tea and for the full recipe you can visit hot Thai Kitchen calm although for drinks you can always just play around with it yourself keep your eyes open for the next thirsty Edition and I'll see you next time for another drink you", "B0eMZW1hxOc": "the first thing I do is turn it on saute so it starts warming up while I'm filling up the water and I know to fill it up right under the four liter mark because I know that's how much my picture will hold I still have it on saute just to get it to warm up while I get my tea bags ready I use five regular-sized tea bags and I tie them together and I kind of dunk them in my water just to get them soaked you don't have to do this it's just what I do I add in the sugar before I start cooking it instead of afterwards but it's your preferences afterwards I think that's totally fine I think I like to use a cup and a half of sugar in my tea so now I put the lid on I turned the vent to ceiling I turn saute off and I turn manual on for four minutes now you're just going to let the instant pot come to pressure and it is going to take a while because there is a lot of liquid in it now just turn the valve to release the pressure so you can open it and the time on here says 37 minutes that's just how long it's been done I just walked away from it and got busy and it's totally okay see it won't open until the pressure is released so now I've turned it off and I can open it now I'm going to take out my tea bags and give it a quick stir and fill up your pitcher and that's it", "YlLv_k6Bblw": "you told fan smoke session fan was Adnan what's the business hopefully y'all having a wonderful Friday man me not so much you know what I'm saying with a ghostwriter we're gonna try to raise the raise the boy a little bit vain and see if we're gonna make a change real quick so let's jump into this review I ain't gonna get into and to me you know what I'm saying we say that for another video let's go jump into this review I probably I wasn't even my letters neighbors and save money but reviews must be done and I'm trying to pump these mugs out I'm trying to get through all this product because I know that a lot coming in this way so I'm trying to put out as much quality content as possible for you all I'm gonna try to review as many different popular strains as possible from popular companies new companies unheard-of companies I'm trying to review and Dibble and dabble with everybody you know what I'm saying so I really hope that you guys will appreciate these reviews because I'm definitely try [Applause] excuse me I'm definitely trying to pop them out for you you know for sure man these papers man oh my god other people's kids oh [ __ ] black tie strawberries you're like so I already know this Michael be focused right money for y'all to be able to see this but this - strawberries if I don't let me see some likely it's not making a difference for real trying to tap on the screen see if we can get a little focus but yeah they said black tie strawberry gelato this is coming in at 0.27% THC which is under three which makes it legal all 50 states so let my nuts go CBD percent is gonna be eleven point nine five percent and we're looking at other is 3.14 percent so total would add up to be fifteen point zero nine percent strawberry gelato man I love gelato a little the THC strain of gelato we actually uh I tried bit further I was able to try that really for the first time maybe about a month or two though it was floating around in the area so when I started you know we got gelato gelato CBD flour now I'm like okay y'all check out my review - man I did a for gas house CBD a orange gelato I'm gonna jump in today mmm immediately you smell like strawberries and ass in a very pungent just Bank seasoning peppery smell mixed in with another very pungent and just as equally strong fruit and berries type of strawberry fragrances with so they both like right there with each other man you got the really pungent strawberry smell and then you got that really pungent peppery kind of seasoning seasoning neither did I you know new word of the day smelled as well what a load ankle oh [ __ ] off in there - I know y'all I was able to see those pictures at the beginning that's the best move right there we don't say that one for later in fact we don't look it's almost got like almost like a gold kind of a gold hue to it nice green not like a lime green again like a kind of a darker green with very nice very very very orange dark horn chairs very very excellent trim job you know the trim job is excellent no family is anything but yeah I can see they decided okay they kind of Acapulco gold kind of look too you know what I'm saying y'all familiar that's what this kind of looks like to me and definitely has a different fragrance you know you can smell the strawberries you can smell the dankness in there as well so let's bust another open you know miss bus sit down let's get that bus down and then other nerves I was in that too just some little smaller popcorn you know oh now when you do busted open you really get that strawberry Smith almost like a strawberry ice cream kind of a fragrance when you crack it open which is amazing cuz on the outside even smelling the bud I guess not a crack this one open no let's just get a different one you know outside you get that peppery kind of smell but once you crack one open and you smell it the inside you really get that sweet strawberry like it reminds me like strawberry ice cream so I'm not mad at that I'm really really wondering what's gonna come through on the flavor if it's gonna be the strawberry or the peppery I'm hoping strawberry I really don't like the peppery earthy kind of smoke tell you you really get that strong sweet strawberry fragrance breaking it down like this it's coming up in my face you know he's saying hello send me right now you know what I'm sayin I'm gonna blanch and say hello back when I fired you smile and again hey while I'm breaking down I hope y'all get y'all something to put in

them issues as much as possible so I'm trying everybody I'm going through the list you know you heard and I want to let y'all know who got word and what you subtract I'm only trying to get the bed back to this black-tie CBD to strawberry gelato nice flavor you can again it's just so this sauce is very subtle very smooth smoke but the flavor is just so subtle to me you know like right now I don't taste it in my mouth anymore I like something that's a lingering taste as with if it's a good taste not nothing bad it's not harsh you can't taste the flavor I'm getting like a very mild sweet berry type of a taste so I am getting that somewhat so it does you know it does have a strawberry sweet berry kind of a taste to it so you are definitely getting that Pleasant smoke for Shula nothing harsh not heavy you know how be I'd be coughing I'm choking I'm a choker you're getting a little bit of oil laying around there I can see that it's kind of developing a little bit of over your brain you know good good definitely good brother it's good flour mm-hmm yeah if you consistently pulling you go ahead flavor in your mouth it'll be there it'll stay probably much more pronounced as well and probably a better flavor even than what I'm getting you know vaping Bijlee I'm gonna get in today you know need to get somebody to somebody to send me send me send me one here to send me send me a one

cute little treat holder this is the perfect little holder for any type of k-cups but since I just love this lemon zest bundle I thought it would be really fun to use these little clear treat boxes so what I've done is I've gone ahead and cut the tabs off and it's much easier to cut these off before you try to assemble your box so these two sides caps you want to cut those off and then to assemble these boxes you definitely want to push the square side in first then the two sides and then the little pointy edge that's the correct way to assemble the bottom of these boxes so again that's the square side in first the two sides and then the pointy side okay and you're not going to want to fold the lids down because we're going to attach those like this and create kind of a little basket okay so I'm going to use tear and tape for this and I just want one piece right down the middle here because we're going to hide that with some designer series paper and if you lay this down and then set this one on top and you can get it lined up nice and perfect okay then I'm going to take some designer series paper this is cut one inch by nine inches and that's the perfect size so I'm just going to use a little bit of fast fuse down the middle and you can fold this in half if you want to kind of get the center might want to do that before you put some fast fuse on it and then that just goes right down the middle here and down the other side here okay then you want to take a piece this is from the pickup pattern DSP this is one and a half by 12 inches long so I'm just going to run some fast fuse down here and then the best way I found to do this is lay half on this side and then wrap around you want about a quarter of an edge quarter of an inch around the edge top and bottom and then you're going to end up with your seam right here and we're going to cover this up so that's just fine you can take one of the delicate doily fold that in half put a little fast fuse on there and then we're going to kind of off-center that cover up that seam then I'm going to add my lemons I've already got one stamped here you can add this with some dimensionals okay and then for the the cut one we're going to use daffodil delight to ink stamp one of those then I'm going to use a one and three-quarter inch circle punch punch that out okay and you see how this is kind of glittery and shimmery what I used was a 2-way glue pen we unfortunately don't sell this anymore but I have heard that the tombow multipurpose glue works just as well so you can try that that I'm just going to put some glue on this lemon slice and then I'm going to use dazzling decal slitter I have tons of this stuff because I just absolutely love it dip that in there tap off the excess and then you have a juicy little lemon slice we're going to stick that on our project with some dimensionals okay that goes right next to it and now for some leaves we're going to use the lemon builder punch and this is Old Olive scraps punch a couple little leaves in here okay and then I just use some little mini glue dots to add my leave okay and then last but not least we can add our little sentiment this greeting is from the oh so eclectic stamp set and it says oh hello friend and I'm going to stamp this with basic black archival ink on some whisper white paper and then I'm going to punch that greeting out with the little banner punch and we'll stick that on with the dimensional as well you know we can add some of these little enamel shapes this is on the old olive from the brights pack then you can go ahead and take a crop-a-dile and punch a hole right here in the middle you want the big hole and then you can just take some ribbon this is the new stitched edge ribbon with the old olive this is the daffodil delight double stitched ribbon and then this is gorgeous shimmer ribbon this is a black shimmer ribbon so we can just take you know um two-thirds of the yard and you can thread these all through the hole you just punched find the center and then tie a bow it's not as easy tying about with three ribbons than just one but just get it to where you want it and then you can kind of play around with it up puppies are fighting and then just trim your edges okay and then you're just going to stick your little lemon iced tea lemonade and you've got a fun little treat how cute is that thanks so much guys", "qHVnKGfqnGQ": "So. It\u2019s a sweltering summer day. The mid-day sun is beating down on you. So you duck into some shade, taking your requisite\nglug of water, settle down and munch on\u2026 what? I think everybody\u2019s got their thing. For some, maybe it\u2019s ice cream. For others, some cut watermelon, or perhaps\nan ice cold lager. But today we wanted to teach you how to make\nwhat we consider to be one of the worlds great hot weather snacks \u2013 bingfen ice jelly. See, as befitting an area that\u2019s nicknamed\n\u2018the furnace of China\u2019 in parts, this stuff is from the Southwest. It\u2019s light, refreshing, and basically the\ndefinition of a great summer dish. So we wanted to show you two sorts\u2013 first,\na nutty syrupy one called hongtang bingfen, which\u2019s probably the most classic.. then,\nalso show you some Leshan-style sanxian bingfen with lemon and rice balls, which\u2019s our personal\nfavorite variety. So, to get started with Bingfen ice jelly,\nyou\u2019ll need\u2026 Bingfen ice jelly seeds. Well, traditionally that is. See, these are the seeds of the shoofly plant,\nand while that is a new world plant\u2026 the seeds themselves aren\u2019t really commercially\navailable in the West. So while we will be showing you the process\nof how to use these - the very best Bingfen use them, after all \u2013 we also wanted show\nyou how to make it with this stuff: Cantonese clear grass jelly, which should be available\nat most Chinese supermarkets. So, the clear jelly up first. Process\u2019s easy enough \u2013 first just mix\n10 grams of your powdered jelly with 125 milliliters of water, and set that aside. Then grab a saucepan, toss in 625 milliliters\nof water, and bring that all up to a boil. Now pour in that jelly-water mixture from\nbefore, heat off, and give it a real good mix. As an aside, definitely don\u2019t feel bad about\ngoing this route \u2013 if you get Bingfen in China outside of the Southwest, usually vendors\u2019ll\nmake the same exact sub. So then just pour it into something heatproof,\nlet it cool to roughly room temperature, and toss that in the fridge for at least four\nhours and overnight would also be just fine. Next, the seeds. While I do know that these\u2019ll prolly be\nunavailable for most of you, we did want to show you the process anyway because\u2026 it\nis.. quite cool. So first we\u2019ll be tossing 50 grams of our\nshoofly seeds on a cloth and twisting it closed. You gotta make sure that you don\u2019t go too\ntight here though, something like this is perfect. Then just dip that in 1.25 liters of bottled\nwater and let it soak for ten minutes. After that time, you should be able to see\nsome jelly-like substance oozing out of your seed bag when you squeeze it. That gel will thicken this water, but we will\nneed to do a bang up job scrubbing this thing to get it all out. What we\u2019re doing here is extracting the\npectin from the seeds, which does take a bit of patience. See, the old story goes that bingfen was invented\nin the Qing dynasty when a woman was carrying shoofly seeds in a pouch and fell into a stream. Afterwards, when she was washing her clothes,\nshe apparently found that her seed pouch was, lo and behold, now filled with\u2026 jelly. And while that story\u2019s almost certainly\napocryphal, it does speak a bit to the essence of the technique here \u2013 just scrub that\nbag as if it was some laundry that you were doing by hand. You\u2019ll be done once the bag is no longer\nslimy to the touch, which should be about eight to ten minutes\u2019 worth of thorough\nscrubbing. Now, to give that jelly a proper bite, we\u2019ll\nthen mix it with some calcium hydroxide, a.k.a. pickling lime. So in a separate bowl mix three grams \u2013 or\nabout three quarters of a teaspoon \u2013 of lime with 250 milliliters of water. Mix, and let that settle for about an hour. When adding that to the jelly we\u2019ll just\nbe adding the liquid here, but not the powder at the bottom. So then just like the clear jelly, we can\nnow toss that in the fridge for at least four hours\u2026 and overnight is also perfect. So next day now, let\u2019s take a look at our\nBingfens. Now, most obviously, the one on the left side\nmade from the seeds has this really distinctive yellow-ish color \u2013 that\u2019s actually a tell-tale\nmarker of a Bingfen made from Shoofly. It\u2019s a bit firmer and toothier than the\nBingfen made from the powder, which\u2019s a little more watery. That said, the sort on the right is also perfectly\ndelicious, so either way, let\u2019s show you how to dress those up. First up, the hongtang bingfen. There\u2019s a number of different directions\nyou can go with these toppings, but these days you\u2019ll usually find some rice cakes\nin the mix. So here we\u2019ll be using about 30 grams of\nbog-standard supermarket rice cakes, but also totally feel free to use some of that pounded\nrice cake that we went over in our recent pounded rice cake video. Either way, just get it into about a one centimeter\ndice, and toss in some boiling water. Blanch for about thirty seconds, toss in some\ncool water to stop the cooking process, and strain that thoroughly. Then move it over to a bowl\u2026 mix with about\nthree tablespoons worth of toasted soybean powder to thoroughly coat, and that is good\nto go. Then of course, this bingfen also needs its\nnamesake\u2026 the syrup. This stuff was made from 60 grams of dark\nbrown sugar, 30 grams of rock sugar, and 180 grams of water. Just cook that all over low heat for about\nten minutes, or until the sugar\u2019s completely melted and thickened slightly. Then besides that, we\u2019ve also got some watermelon,\ncut into one inch cubes\u2026 some toasted peanuts, lightly pounded in a mortar\u2026 a bit of toasted\nblack sesame seeds\u2026 and a few raisins to finish it off. So to a bowl with 250 grams of your bingfen\nice jelly, toss in two tablespoons of the rice cake, one tablespoon of the toasted pounded\npeanuts, a half tablespoon of the toasted black sesame seeds, about twelve or so raisins,\na quarter cup of your watermelon cubes, and top it all off with five tablespoons of syrup. And with that, the nutty syrup-y hongtang\nbingfen is good to go. Next up, the Leshan-style lemon-y sanxian\nbingfen, which\u2019s not only our personal favorite but also probably a bit easier logistically\nto whip up at home. To give this one a bit of texture though,\nit\u2019ll need some of these\u2026 sticky rice balls. Now, you should be able to find these in the\nfrozen section of your local Asian supermarket, but if not we\u2019ve also got a quick recipe\nfor how to roll these guys yourself in the description box. Assuming that you\u2019re working with the frozen\nsort though, just dump them into some boiling water \u2013 no need to thaw \u2013 and let those\nboil. Once they\u2019re floating, swap the flame to\nlow and cook them for another two minutes\u2026 then remove and toss in some ice water until\nyou\u2019re ready to serve. Then besides that, we\u2019ve also got some Laozao,\nfermented glutinous rice. Most Asian supermarkets should carry this\nstuff, but quick warning that sometimes it seems to be labelled under the English name\n\u2018rice pudding\u2019. It\u2019s got a real mellow sweetness to it,\nwhich\u2019ll help balance out our lemon. So, 250 gram bowl of bingfen again. First mix a teaspoon of sugar into a tablespoon\nof freshly squeezed lemon juice, and add that to the bingfen. Next top it off with two tablespoons of laozao,\nabout two to three tablespoons worth of your sticky rice balls, and a couple slices of\nlemon. And that\u2019s honestly it\u2026 a pretty easy,\nsuper refreshing bowl of lemon bingfen. So Bingfen has like a million kinds of toppings. Another favorite of mine is the one that\u2019s\nsmothered in this creamy peanut sauce in addition to this like sticky rice cake, nuts, and fruits. It\u2019s really good, and the cool thing about\nBingfen is that it\u2019s like zero calories, so you can totally just like play around with\nall the toppings. So right, check out the description box for\na written recipe\u2026 a big thank you for everyone that\u2019s supporting us on Patreon\u2026 and of\ncourse, subscribe for more Chinese cooking videos.", "Ye81xfFOJrM": "how many of you are familiar with the Arizona Arnold Palmer light half-and-half tea this stuff is really good it's really good I like it it's not really expensive it just doesn't have the the stronger tea taste that I like I like a stronger tea taste it's all I've been making my own I've been making my own for months and I think I've perfected the recipe it's really good it's fairly cheap and I'm gonna show you how to do it right now be Arnold Palmer light half and half light heck first thing you'll need you'll need a jug it doesn't even need to be the dis jug this is just what I use you will need a cooking vessel you'll need some Lipton tea to make the tea I use country time yellow lemonade not pink lemonade I haven't tried it with pink lemonade yet you'll need a measuring cup so you can dip dip the tea when it's done and put it in the in the jug you'll need a regular measuring cup a 1 cup measuring cup a stir stick and a clothespin all right let's get started first thing you're going to want to do get a gallon of water I used that as the measuring but you get it 1 gallon of water and dump about 3/4 of it into the cooking vessel it's okay if it overfill because water will boil off and you'll end up adding water most likely to the mix anyway when you're done so do most of it I'll leave a lot of pint in there step that to cooking set it to boiling and while it's boiling we'll prep the teabags this is the easiest way I've found take 10 teabags ten four five six seven eight nine 10 tea bags open them up carefully pull the label off ten bags you know strings together and tie them together all right once the water has started to boil reduce heat take your tea bags push them down into the water as soon as they're good and soaked up and sinking clothes line them clothes pin them to the side and set your timer so your timer for four minutes while the timer is counting down kind of plunged the teabags up and down into the water every now and again don't want to poke Adam too much because when I did that before a couple of the teabags broke and I ended up filtering filtering all the tea through a coffee filter to get all the tea out of it I'm losing real Pleasant so just gotta leave it alone leave it boil bounce it up and down every now and again in past recipes what I've done is I've tried other tea like put one bag of Earl Grey tea in there I'll put like one bag and that gives it a gives it a bite it gives it I don't know it but some of the other people in the house that drink it don't like the taste of the Earl Grey so I stopped putting that in the reason I tie all the bags together I yeah it's so easy to pull them out and pull off and take them to the garbage can garbage cans in it anyway um yeah you just you don't have to try and pick them out one by one or you know just grab the whole thing oh blending ingredients list oh yeah yeah you need one cup of sugar one cup of sugar and one cup of country time lemonade but for almost it 4 minutes 20 seconds left it's done it's done alrighty remove from heat well shut off the heat back away and what you're left with is a nice tea broth I guess I would call it one full cup of country time lemonade and one full cup of sugar stir stir and let's set and tell cool what let it cool alright everything seems to be dissolved so we'll just clean up our mess and let it cool and dump it in the jug well I suppose I don't have to come back maybe I could just uh go over to the sink dip in pour into the jug after it's cool top it off with water if you need to because a lot of the water or some of the water will boil off top it off and mix it up and there you have a gallon of Arnold Palmer white half-and-half tea lemonade and there you have it gallon of Arnold Palmer light yummy", "Yb13jURGfV8": "[Music] hi and welcome back to the twin craftwork advent calendar it's december 17th and this is today's beer let's open it up great color looks spectacular it's very strong it's seven percent that's a great beer amber colored uh very rich in taste it's good beer today's special guest is a post production and scoring stage manager at ucla school of theater film and television he's an awesome pro tools instructor and he's a master of body surfing and underwater recordings and he's an all-round great guy uh let's see what proto-shortcuts he has for us welcome to dave's train of thought where i'm going to combine multiple hotkeys in order to create an awesome workflow we're going to do this by first experimenting with a mixed cocktail long island iced tea which is made of gin triple sec white rum vodka blanco tequila ice half a lemon and a coke it's very easy to make you just add that lemon juice in throw the ice in a cup a shot of each of the spirits and then add your coca-cola and you're good to go but i'm gonna make something more awesome a long island shifty which is ginger liqueur blue curacao spiced rum black vodka reposado tequila ice half a lime and coke again juice the lime add the ice add in the spirits and then add in that coca-cola so now i have the long island shift tea and now comparison time i've got the long island i've seen on the right and i've got my long island shift tea on the left let's see how they taste that is not enjoyable this totally wins hey magic of editing dave's office all right so how does shift-t become useful to us all right i've created these three tracks but the problem is is that if i hit p and semi-colon to go from track to track yeah dark mode lets me know a little bit better but let's imagine i had like 50 tracks here rather than three tracks here it might not be the easiest thing to know which track i am in working with so if i engage shift t that engages link track and edit selection and as a result when i hit p and semicolon the track names also highlight so i know exactly which one i'm on so now when i hit shift r i'm like yeah i know that one and i could shift r and i go down here and hit yeah sweet so now what i can do is a super fast three-part harmony observe so i've shift r'd on the track that is selected and i hit numpad three merry christmas merry christmas all right and then shift r and semicolon and shift r and three merry christmas merry christmas merry christmas all right and we hit shift r and we hit semicolon and we hit shift r again and we hit three merry christmas merry christmas merry christmas merry christmas and there you go as fast as that i have now accomplished hearing all three simultaneously merry christmas merry christmas merry christmas merry christmas merry christmas anders man that shift he's good thanks dave that was awesome uh i need one of those long island shifties uh what a great presentation thank you very much you know what to do like subscribe comment see you tomorrow [Music]", "h9Uk2ZU8A-s": "[Music] just another lemon tree [Music] i can't see [Music] blue i'm turning my head down [Music] i wonder how [Music] just

lemonade the smell of this one lemons berries pineapples super furry almost overabundant for the smell of it I thought the taste of this was just gonna be too much just like too fruity but let me stop you right there it is not this is it make no mistake about it this is a great black tea lemonade fruit concoction the limit of this one is the champion it's the winter clear cut of what you're gonna taste in this oh but not like overly butter not super sweet not super sour at all not super tart this is a nice like base lemon not very acidic the other flip fruit flavors are there with it I believe the other fruit flavors almost like taming the lemon to not be too sour or anything like that bring it a little more sweetness and the sourness but not too much of that and you have the black tea in this one which is there but you know what the black tea this one said hey you guys can you guys could have this one I'm gonna hang out come on you know I had to make it ice right let's check this one out it's great the ice version isn't as sweet as the husband put this hot version isn't too sweet it's definitely not the ice version more mellow with a sweetness but definitely they're like you wouldn't have to sweet him there so this is like an not a unsweet tea and I was sweet and tea of course you say sweet tea depending where you go that rain just like very much but this one is more on the unsweet side of like if you kind of really sweet sweet tea and you have of course unsweetened tea which is just as sweet this is more on that unsweetened side but definitely still some sweetness is there any description of the video you'll see how I brew each one of these one of the viewers who mentioned like hey B needed you let us know how you bruise heat everything and that's great I should've been doing that from the very beginning but I started doing that about a month or so ago you know shortly after she said that any ingredients here we've got black tea pomelo peel which is pomelo pale sugar citric acid candied pineapple apple sugar Apple Apple citric acid sweet blackberry leaves hibiscus blossoms natural lemon flavor and lemon peel orange peel lemon granules which is mallow dextran lemon juice natural lemon oil and sodium alginate and says may contain your milk as far as I can I guess an allergen warning you got the Battle of the black tea and the fruit okay and then to fruit wings and you have the lemon versus all the other fruits in the cage bro your Rumble match and then the lemon wins that's how they'd say so that's what goes if that is it with the review of the country eliminated by Davis T hope you all enjoy the WT have an awesome day take care", "bnLuxryvRDs": "[Music] well hello kindred spirits thank you again for joining me you don't know how much i appreciate and love all the comments that you leave me below they are so sweet and it makes me just happy to keep creating videos for you this time i am sharing some herbs in the garden and what i'm doing with them such as making pesto herb salts for gifts and for myself some herb tea and also smudging sticks so here we are right now i have collected basil i have some of it in the drying shed for the winter and also i'm going to be making pesto which i absolutely love my husband doesn't like pesto that much so all the more for me what i'm doing here is i have about four cups of the pesto leaves and then i put some pine nuts on a tray and i'm going to pop them in the oven and roast them until they're nice and golden brown [Music] roasting them in the oven really brings out the flavor versus the raw pine nuts and this whole recipe it's i do it by eye but i'm going to give you kind of what i think i used here so i had about four cups of the basil and i have a half a cup of parmesan cheese half a teaspoon of pepper teaspoon of salt [Music] and i would say two cloves of garlic and let's see oh and yes the pine nuts i probably have about a half a cup or a third a cup i just used what i had on hand now i am going to blend it well and after this is all blended nicely i'm going to then add the olive oil [Music] now when it's at this stage i'm going to just use my spatula and get some of the things on the bottom mix it up and then it will be when i add my olive oil and for this particular batch i did about a half a cup of olive oil [Music] and there you have it pesto made from fresh basil in the garden and once again you don't have to be completely precise with the amount of ingredients you put in you can make it to taste and i'm also going to take a lot of this put it into ice cube trays i'm going to cover it with plastic just while i put it in the freezer and then once they're frozen solid i will take the plastic bag pop them into it and keep them in the refrigerator for the next time i want fresh pesto in a recipe [Music] [Music] well this is the first time i've ever grown lemon verbena and make lemon verbena tea and i'm telling you right now i'm going to dedicate a whole garden bed just to this plant i was watching an old video just recently and i saw that these were cute little seedlings and to think that they grew to these plants and the tea that this makes is so delicious i'm looking forward to growing more next year already because i'm going to go through my batch of tea faster than i want to and the day i was editing this i brought a friend out to the garden and it's already sprouting new leaves where i trimmed these so it's a fantastic plant i did wash down the lemon verbena and i'm just putting the leaves now on a little drying tray before i put them in the oven unlike some of the items that i dry in the oven such as fruit these did not take very long at all i have it on a very low heat i popped it in the oven it may have been a half hour 45 minutes but you can gauge it to what you believe is best i took the tea and i crumpled it up and i just couldn't wait to have my first try i'm going to buy some tea bags but right now i'm just using a coffee filter and about two teaspoons of the tea and i'm going to add my boiling water and like i said this makes such a delicious tea it's it's lemony but has a little creamy undertone if that makes any sense and i also add on some of the batches i've added some of the lemon balm that i have but i think i like it with just the lemon verbena so the next thing that i have grown for the first time are these little pearl onions i had grand hopes of pickling them and having them available for my husband but there were just so few of them that i decided to use them and mince them in a dried herb salt that you're going to see next and i also used them in some cooking but what a treat and how fun it was to collect them and you can also chop the greens from this plant i didn't i wanted to i cut them with the hopes of doing it and i forgot to bring them in the house and they wilted that's just what happens sometimes at the davis homestead garden [Music] and here are the little pearl onions we're getting ready to make an herbed salt now you can make whatever salt works best for you i love to make a roasted chicken with lemon and rosemary and thyme so that's what i'm going to be making here i also added a little bit of lemon thyme but what i'm gonna do first is i'm going to get my lemon and i'm going to use the the microplane here and just get the top skin do not go down to the white pith because that is very bitter and then i'm chopping up my little onions it took a while but i got those and once again this is very similar to the pesto you add what you like now i started with a smaller amount and you will see later that i ended up adding more to add more herbs to the salt it just wasn't the amount i wanted i'm showing here that i have the herbs sitting in water i picked those last night and i wanted them to stay fresh now if you don't have a garden or windowsill herbs a lot of these you can buy in the grocery store in the produce department they sell them in packages so if you want to make something like this it's easily done just head down to your grocery store or farmer's market and you can make some herbed salts for yourself or for gifts so what i'm here doing now is i'm just taking apart the rosemary and this is my lemon thyme that i'm adding very easily strips off and just showing you my mess it gets very messy when i'm cooking and baking and i'm going to put this in the food processor i've tried with salt on the bottom first and herbs on the bottom first and i do like putting the herbs in first and then adding my salt and you're going to see that i'm using a coarse salt now i'm using a kitchenaid here it's a brand new one because i killed my cuisinart i can't help but wonder if the cuisinart would have chopped the coarse salt a little bit better just the few times i've used this unfortunately i know i don't like this as much as the cuisinart or i might even try another brand it just wasn't up to what i wanted to do on some of the things that i made but right now here i'm showing the herbs that i added to the salt mixture after but what you have once it's complete is this ground up wonderful mix of herbs and salt and i spread it out on a tin foil lined tray and pop it in the oven on low heat and you're going to see there's actually some peppercorns in there i ended up picking those out afterwards because they did not process in this food processor so i ended up adding just some nice ground pepper already to my mixture now you're going to want to make sure that this is drying out this is after i pulled it out and it actually made like a hard sheet and i was able to crumble it first but this is it nice and dry you can see the herbs in there and after i put it in the jar the past few days the longer it's in there it smells amazing i'm using some very small jars here like i said i'm going to give these as gifts so i'm going to package up four of these and then i'm going to find four salt grinders and put them aside for christmas gifts or housewarming gifts [Music] [Music] and for myself i pulled out my mortar and pestle and i'm just trying this to make sure that it worked fine with the salt and it does it gets nice and fine and i will be able to use it on a roasted chicken here's another first for me and i think i want to mention that don't be afraid to try something new for the first time a lot of this channel you're going to see things that i'm doing for the first time and sharing with you so what i'm making right now are smudging sticks and i do not know a lot about them i've been researching them i do know that some people use smudging sticks to help clear the energy in a home or negative feelings in a home that's for those who believe in it and i'm okay with that i'm also going to be learning this for health reasons of course i'm not a doctor and i'm not a medical professional but i have been learning a lot about herbs and they are medicinal and when i read about sage even helping with mood and helping somebody sleep and that also burning these smudge sticks is uplifting due to the scent i figured i'm going to give it a try so i have to be open and honest that at the time of this filming my sage sticks are still hanging in the drying shed which you'll see at the end of this video but i haven't tried it yet and i'm very anxious to but what i'm doing here is i've pulled together sage i have some mint in here i have lavender and i've also added some thyme and i've put the herbs in between two layers of the sage and i put a string right in the center so you see this the string is down along the middle there and i'm going to add the sage right on top i forgot to mention i do have a little tail of string that you might see off to the right of the frame here but right now i'm going to wind very tight the string around the sage trying to wrap the leaves upward covering the rest of it and the reason you're doing this tight is once herbs dry they do sometimes slip out because it shrinks so i'm going to go all the way up to the top and then you'll see that i'm going to go all the way to the bottom and once i get to the bottom i'm going to wrap it several times nice and tight because that's where i'm going to be holding on onto it [Music] once it's wrapped nice and tight i'm going to take that cut the string and then tie it to that other little tail so that it's completely wrapped up like a little package and then it also gives me a string to hang it after i'm done and then the final part of this is trimming the top getting all the loose items off and then also the bottom and yes note i'm using scissors for this because my clippers were were way down in the garden shed and i was just too lazy to go get them [Music] i'm going to spare you the making of four more but here's another that i pulled together real quick and then once again at the end you're going to see that i hung them in the drying shed and today i checked on them and they are drying nicely now once i try these i promise i will let you know what i think i'm almost wishing that i made one with just sage so i could compare them but i have plenty out in the garden i'm about ready to make some more but i just wanted to make one to see if i liked it and here they are hanging in the drying shed i could have hung them individually but i decided to put them on one long string just to not take up as much space they're next to my lavender which i cut previously so all my lavender is cut down and it's already grown back actually in some areas so i might have to do a little final trimming of that before the fall arrives i know i've said this but i'm going to say it again thank you so much for watching my youtube channel especially for those of you who

"what is up guys welcome back to another video today i will be making a Starbucks vanilla sweet cream cold brew if you guys have any other recommendations leave them in the comments below and I'll see what I can do let's get started [Music] alright so the first step is gonna be grinding the beans I recommend using something like a favor ona or French Roast just because those darker roasts have more flavor the ratio I like to start off with is about one to six beans to water so I'm gonna measure out around 1/2 a cup of beans and use about 3 cups of water set your grinder to a relatively coarse setting if you mess up with this part it's all good as long as you get a nice even grind it should be okay in the end transfer your coffee into a container and then pour of your water I'm gonna be using a glass jar just to make cleanup a little easier give that baby a nice stir just to make sure everything in that container is nicely incorporated seal it up put on a counter top and let that brew for about 12 hours at room temperature you can't let it sit for a little longer however when I've done so it has come out a little bitter but you never know you can give it a try and you might actually like it a little more alright so now it's time for the filtering process waste a coffee filter on a metal sieve and run all the liquid through it I recommend also putting the grinds to just because they absorb a lot of water and it's good to get every last drop out of them take your time with this part as it's already been brewing for 12 hours you might as well just wait the extra five minutes to run it through the filter correctly towards the end you're gonna see some of the coffee pull up at the top just use a spoon and scrape the bottom of the filter to clear out of the way and the rest of the coffee should fall through at this point you could pour this over some ice and give it a taste test but since it's already 9 p.m. and it's not one of those nights I'm just gonna put it in the fridge and let it sit overnight for next morning now I usually use this filter from conjugator just because you don't want to be using disposal paper every time you make cold brew and it's a lot more cost-effective alright it is now the next morning and I'm gonna show you guys how to make these Starbucks manoa squeak cream cold brew first you're gonna need some vanilla syrup I'm using this one from Taurani but any brand should work measure out about a tablespoon and a half put that into a pitcher 1 tablespoon of heavy cream this can be adjusted based on your preference give that a nice stir or your coffee over some ice if you're trying to get in a static looking cup I'd recommend going having an ice just so when you pour the heavy cream on you're gonna get a nice layering effect and here is the part you've all been waiting for [Music] [Music] [Music]", "DARqED3EyUk": "[Music] [Music] [Music] hi guys welcome to me with TV and God doing porn Ateneo it I tie milk tea so

have put this off way too long I have to cut my miss down to let my date palm and other plants get some light so I'm going to make some iced tea and all I do when I cut them down as I snip down just before a leaf setting at paw trim level I'll show you what it looks like when I'm done so this is what it looks like when it's done you can see the mint all along the side it actually is starting to grow up all around the pot mint is very resilient and it will grow from the roots and start more plants by spreading with the roots by cutting it down I'm now allowing for my date palm my coleus Laskin violet my indoor peppers and tomatoes to get some light as I'm growing my mint inside and I don't use pesticides I don't have to rinse it off I can use it just as is I'm not going to worry about picking the spins or the dead leaves off because they're just dried mint leaves there's nothing wrong with them and they're not going to hurt me and if I were growing this outside the leaves would be like ten times the size hopefully when I go to my grandmother's today I can show you what it looks like when it grows outside now when I make my C I make sure I have enough water for the container and I judge it by that this is a one gallon container that I've been able to keep cold water in the hedge and I'm on to my last glass and a for the last of the water into my cup and I'm going to fill it up with fresh water from the tap because of the size of the container and how long it takes to fill I'm placing it in the sink don't mind my food disposal in the think that is a lemon that I put in there full lemon skin to kind of clean it out I don't like to use chemicals so I use citric acid to clean it out but this will take a few minutes to fill up so while it's filling I'm going to get a pot and meet you back at the suit now that I have my pot my containers filled up I'm simply going to dump contain in add water into the top now as the water boils a lot of the water is going to evaporate however that's okay because we're going to be putting stuff into it we're going to put the burner on high and let it come to a complete boil once it comes to a complete boil we will put our teabags and our mint in if you want to add sugar for a sweetened iced tea you could add a quarter of a cup to a half a cup depending on how sweet you want your teeth of sugar into the water now this gives the sugar time to completely melt and chemically bond to the water however I don't like sweetened iced tea so this is going to be absolutely sugar free I will let my kids in my family add sugar to their ice cream as they dispense it for themselves now you can use whatever whatever tea you like as long as it's a black you could use an English breakfast tea use an original blend and afternoon tea you can probably even use a green tea or a white tea for this recipe however this is my great-grandmother's recipe so I'm going to be using red rose original now that the water is just about boiled it's not at a complete boil however we're going to bring it to the boil with the tea bag I'm putting 10 teabags into playing seat and take five tie them together drop them in to the water and loop them on one handle I'm going to take the other flies and do the same thing on the other handle oops I forgot to apply it now you can see through the scene that the water is already darkened up with the teabags and they're just sitting at the top and they're not fully submerged now instead of mint you could put lemon if that is your preference however I've had the tea both ways and you don't think it would be good in tea however let me tell you it is phenomenal mint is my go-to when it comes to tea I don't do honey I don't do women well I do on occasion but mint is my my favorite then we're going to let this boil about five minutes and I'm going to turn it off and let it cool back when you let it cool down on the soap now that the teabags are in and it's still boiling you drop this whole thing of mint into the tea once the mint leaves are completely cooked into the tea it is done and it typically takes three to four minutes that's why I put the teabags in first get them a nice dark seat because we're going to put a little bit of cold water at the bottom so we don't melt our pitcher okay so once your mint looks like this startings kind of look like spinach you turn off the heat but you leave the pot on the soap leave the pot on the stove and let it cool off if you want to take it off the hot burner and place it on another one so it's cooled off faster that's fine but don't try to pour this until it cools off once your tea has drained a little bit you're going to remove your teabags and dispose of them you can squeeze them out if you'd like or you can just pop them into your compost no tea leaves are more than just compost not only do they not have to be composted you can throw them directly into your garden and they will enrich your plants or you could throw them directly into your garden to stop feral cats from peeing in your garden it also works with other animals as well stop animals from digging it keeps the bugs away has a lot of uses I mean you could even put used tea bags and dishes throughout your house and it'll keep the flies in the summertime from coming through your screen and going after your students I'm going to let the mints in there a little bit more and then I'm going to put that into my compost as well and my compost I just have some dry leaves from my houseplants tea leaves and coffee grinds I'm Savin my vegetable waste for a project to do with Ember amber has not been in the videos lately because she is on her summer vacation it is the first week of summer vacation and she chose to spend it with her great-grandma so hopefully she will be home tonight okay when your tea cools down enough for you to handle it you put a little bit of cold water on the bottom of the pot and you simply just pour it directly into your pitcher and gallon water and we put a little bit of cold water in and we're just above the three liter line of ice on it has to cool down before you can have some the mint will stay in the pan and all the tea will come out that's just liquid coming out of stuff now you don't want to leave the mint leaves or the tea bags in your iced tea because it will continue brewing even after it cools off and it will become stronger and the flavors will be overwhelming it won't be refreshing anymore and remember when you're boiling your water before you put your tea bags in that's when you add your sugar depending on how sweet you want your tea you could put a quarter cup of sugar - a half cup of sugar no more otherwise it will not dissolve and you will have sugar at the bottom of your iced tea now we're simply just going to place this into the refrigerator and let it chill for a few hours and it's ready to drink", "MZZ3tkC4LZU": "the Indians lava spices and a few selected spices in a masala

slices of peaches some mint leaves muddler and you're going to muddle this all together let's get your fork put it into your glass like so get some your unsweetened iced tea fill it halfway and you're gonna top it off with your Stella broseph peach and for garnish you can just use a little bit more of your mint leaf like so there you have it guys the Stella rose up peach iced tea keep celebrating", "eHuMGSURrQA": "I'm paid to fix and it's like me you suffer from sensitive teeth and there's probably a few things on the menu that are a bit of a no-no so Colgate sensitive Pro relief have challenged me to come up with a recipe that's just too delicious to strike off the menu so I have created three gorgeously delicious iced tea refreshes perfect summer drink great to share with all your friends and family and a great way to reinvent that classic brew so our first one is a cold brew green tea lemon and blueberry ice tea refresher green tea the reason we're going to cold brew is that when you add hot water to tea if AC can bring out the tannins in it which is what gives you that slightly bitter taste so in your cold brew you don't get that at all so we're gonna have one liter of cold water to 5 teabags and to that we're going to add a gorgeously zesty lemon and we are just adding the zest for this one so I've actually got here a speed peeler because what I want is not the fine grated zest I want nice big strips so we're gonna peel that across and what you want to do is peel quite lightly so you don't go too far down to the pit the pith has got all the bitter stuff on so if you can avoid that you're going to get an even more fresh zingy gorgeous ice-cold tea push everything down give it a nice stir and let that infusion start and then this is going to go into the fridge for six to twelve hours no more no less any time in between you're just going to leave it to brew nicely tea number two a delicious Earl Grey with mint and orange one of the ingredients in our gray is actually bergamot which is made from the rind of a type of Seville orange basically gets the oils from it so you've already got those natural citrus flavors in there which we're going to enhance with a beautiful fresh orange so into this again one liter of cold water with five Earl Grey tea bag lovely okay and one liter should serve about for quite generously so again you can double up these sizes for as many guests as you've got round for the summer pardhu give it a little mix okay so to this we're going to add in three sprigs of mint I mean the whole sprig with all the beautiful leaves but whenever you're using Minh never ever forget to give it a spank it basically bruises the lead and releases the natural oils and of course well I think the star of the show with this one we're going to add in our orange and again like the last one speed peeler and we're going to take the zest and then that is gonna go to our fridge as well to cold brew for again six to twelve hours finally we're going to do a redfish tea with raspberries our red Bush is one naturally caffeine free and two also has naturally less tannin in so it doesn't really have a bitter taste it has a very sweet taste actually so we're not going to cold brew this we're going to actually brew it like a normal cup five teabags again into one liter this time with nice hot water straight from the kettle secret kettle if you're using a glass jug then do make sure you're using heat proof glass so you can leave that to brew for five to eight minutes obviously the longer you leave it the stronger the brew at that point take the teabags out and then leave aside to cool down to room temperature and I asked the assembly jobbing so I've got ourselves a nice big jug that we're going to serve it in I'm going to stack this full of ice because we want this to be super super cold colder the more refreshing and then to that we've also got our lemon from earlier so I'm going to cut that up into some nice fat one centimeter segments okay and then that's going to go in there and because you've got that lovely sourness from the lemons we're now going to bounce that out with some sweetness from the Blue Room so let's pop in a nice handful of blueberries as well we're then going to use a sip and pour in our gorgeous green tea you mix which is so beautifully cold brewed they have it lemon and blueberry ice tea refresher our first our gorgeous trio so we're going to follow the same process with our other teas as well got our beautiful Earl Grey and orange and into that we're going to chop up our orange just like we did with the green tea in the lemon and also stick into extra mince there for some added fresh delight with our gorgeous red bush mixture and make sure there's raspberries in there all mixed and muddled around with the ice get super super cold do you make sure your red bush is at room temperature as well look how beautiful they are love it when a plan comes together slow first up if you're feeling a little bit zingy we're going to try our green tea lemon blueberry that is so fresh and when you get is you get a lovely edge of sourness that's just lost with that little twinge of blueberries delicious perfect right next up if you're feeling a bit more sophisticated we've got our Earl Grey with the orange mmm just delicious moving up moving on we've got here I'm all kind of sweet come on great for the family this one so you've got a lovely bit of natural sweetness through from that red bush and those raspberries which I've actually burst a little bit just through using all the ice oh that is so good you've got to give this a go in fact tell me which is your favorite combination in the comments box below and if you want to see more of my Colgate sensitive Pro relief

short one and quick one just a small thing not epic but this is a product I've been waiting for for as soon as I heard was announced about a month ago I've been trying to find that I finally tracked it down today I'm big nerd I've been a spider-man collector since the mid 80s I've sold some to me priceless collections throughout the years to try to make it try to pay rent but I don't have a lot of the comics still but I still have a lot of the toys that I bought over the years and even got the key to my house is a venom key from probably wondering why I'm talking a spider-man like a nerd this is a new breast ice-t just came out this is in conjunction with the new movie venom that just you know Tom Hardy that I'm already hearing it's horrible because Tom Hardy's the most boring actor in the history of the world but this is symbiotic dark cherry limeade brits tea as you see Venom's I don't know if you can even see that yeah I met him on the cover but hey you know anything tied in with spider-man is okay with me still gonna probably see the movie kind of bomb to hear about so many negative reviews but I can't exist suspect except I'm sticking with like the normal storyline they're doing their own little take on it and nerds like me like to stick to the original whatever the canon or whatever the original storyline but we're gonna give this track that sounds good aside from all that bad news about the movie this is brisk iced tea symbiotic dark cherry limeade venom only in theaters and we are hashtag venom okay let's give a try what you think Spidey well it's got a nice limey cheery foot you know there's a lot of cherry limeade out there but this is black cherry limeade and I've never seen that before so that sounds pretty good like the um Mountain Dew ice chair edge instead it's really subtle but that's because it makes with iced tea I would like to try like a black cherry limeade juice but this is iced tea dark cherry limeade that's really good though it's really subtle but it doesn't taste like cough syrup doesn't taste fake it just tastes like a nice sweet cherry because that's what the black ones are they're nice and sweet and it's got a little hint of lime pretty decent I think I'm not sure if Venom's in the theaters yet it's probably pretty soon you know don't let me ruin your excitement for it if you're gonna do it but this is good if the movies not at least this is brisk iced tea Cindy I have dark cherry limeade then uh hey thanks for watching this quick one we got more coming up got some big ones coming up around the corner always

If you're already overwhelmed by all of the\noptions on the Starbucks menu, you may be wondering whether or not the world really\nneeds another coffee drink to choose from. You may also be wondering just what makes\ncold brew different from any of the other cold coffee drinks already available. For starters, iced coffee and cold brew are\nmade with entirely different brewing processes. Iced coffee is essentially hot coffee brewed\nat twice the strength and served over ice. In order to make a batch of cold brew, Starbucks\nadds its blend of coffee grounds to cool, filtered water and steeps them for 20 hours. Starbucks describes the flavor of cold brew\nas having, quote, \"the right balance of sweetness with citrusy and chocolate notes.\" In case you're wondering, those iced espresso\nbeverages don't use cold brew coffee, either. They're made by pouring espresso shots over\ncold milk or water and ice. Cold brew is something completely different,\nand now you know! If you thought Starbucks' 20-hour cold brew\nsteeping process was intense, Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew takes things to the next level. The drink puts a twist on the coffee chain's\ntraditional cold brew coffee by infusing it with nitrogen bubbles. Nitro Cold Brew comes out cold, so you won't\nneed ice. It also comes out with a foamy top \u2014 much\nlike beer \u2014 so you can forget the milk, sugar, and straw. The drink has built quite a following, with\nthe Nitro Brew with Cascara Cold Foam holding the top spot in a Thillist ranking of all\nthe drinks on the Starbucks menu. But if you're the kind of person who needs\nto have your coffee supersized, you're in for a disappointment. Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew is served in tall\nand grande sizes only. But there's a good reason for that: the drink\nis not available in venti because serving it in that size would cause the drink to lose\nthe frothiness and bubbles that make it special. From your first sip, you'll notice that Starbucks\nCold Brew has a distinct flavor from the other cold coffee drinks on the menu. Everything from the beans to the special slow\nbrewing process gives Starbucks' latest coffee creation a reason to stand out from the rest\nof the pack. Starbucks cold brew starts with a unique blend\nof coffee from Africa and Latin America that is specifically designed to be served cold. Because there is no heat involved in the brewing\nprocess, there is less acidity than iced coffee, and as a result cold brew has a much smoother,\nfull-bodied flavor, according to Starbucks. The delicious smooth flavor of Starbucks cold\nbrew may make you want to gulp down your drink in record time, but try to resist. Take your time to enjoy the taste, because\nthe flavor will not change with the temperature. Unlike iced coffee, the cold brewing process\nhelps to keep the flavor consistent. You may depend on your daily dose of coffee\nto give you the energy to get through your day, but you may not know that a lot of other\ngood things are happening in the process. Drinking a cold brew coffee provides many\nof the same health benefits as hot coffee, according to Healthline. Caffeine consumption has been shown to help\nboost your metabolism and enhance your mood, and drinking coffee can also help protect\nyou from serious illnesses. According to a study by Harvard Medical School,\ndrinking three to four cups of coffee each day has been linked with a reduced risk of\nserious illnesses such as Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and Parkinson's disease. Is an advantage to choosing cold brew coffee? Cold brew is 67 percent less acidic than other\nvarieties, which means that it may be easier for people with sensitive stomachs to digest. And if you always add cream or milk to change\nthe sweetness or texture of your coffee, opt for nitro, skip the creamer, and save on some\nfat and calories. Starbucks brought a little fall flavor to\nits menu in summer 2019 when they introduced the Pumpkin Spice Cold Brew, the first new\npumpkin-flavored beverage on the menu in 16 years. In case you were wondering why Starbucks would\nlaunch a new fall-inspired beverage in the summer, it probably has a lot to do with business. As Forbes reported, a Starbucks spokesperson\ncredits the Pumpkin Spice Latte as being the company's best-selling seasonal beverage of\nall time. The chain had sold over 350 million as of\n2018. The popularity of cold coffee has risen dramatically\nin the last few years, with cold drink sales at Starbucks increasing from 37 percent of\nsales in 2013 to 50 percent in 2019, according to NBC News. With numbers like that, it's no wonder they\ninvented a cold brew version of this seasonal favorite. Contrary to popular opinion, espresso and\nand dark roast coffee don't necessarily always have the highest levels of caffeine per serving,\nand the amount of caffeine in your coffee depends on everything from how your coffee\nis ground to the way it is brewed. If you want the biggest caffeine bang for\nyour buck at Starbucks, it may depend on your preference. When you're in the mood for cold coffee, cold\nbrew is definitely the way to go, as it has more caffeine per serving than a traditional\niced coffee. According to the nutrition facts listed on\nthe Starbucks website, a grande cold brew contains 205 mg of caffeine, compared to 165\nmg of caffeine in a grande iced coffee. But, you might also want to consider that\na grande Pike Place has 310 mg of caffeine, so it's all down to one question: hot or cold? Check out one of our newest videos right here!

"w7An6nWb-PI": "I think it's pretty unanimous that garlic is the goat of all seasonings and I know that we're gonna get that one person that's like oh and that's okay but let me show you something really quick here's a nice little cross-section of garlic it's great brings a tear to my eye childhood memories all that good stuff but there's another life changing side the garlic that you might not have ever seen before and I'm not talking roasted garlic toasted garlic that rhymes I'm talking black garlic okay so it's fermentation Friday but I have some bad news this is not a permit I don't even know why I'm putting it on fermentation Friday it's a commonly mistaken as a fermented product but it is totally not because the enzymatic process that's going on is actually the my yard reaction which if you don't know what that is I'll put a link in the description describing what it is because it's gonna take me way too long to describe it all it takes like the spicy sharp garlic into like a very mellow caramelized almost smoky just brown sugar tamarind like all these like rich sweet flavors with like a nice umami background like this is literally a flavor explosive bomb of deliciousness I'll get off my soapbox and let's make this shall we all right now black garlic is insanely easy all you need is the right equipment and requires almost no active effort so you have three different choices here that's right you got options my number one choice which is the route that I went was my Sahara dehydrator which will be linked below the second option would be a typical rice cooker you know like the one that cooks rice and the third option would be my fermentation station all of which will be in the links below now I chose to go with the dehydrator just because of the accuracy and even distribution of temperature but unfortunately you cannot use your oven for this though now for the easiest part so first thing you need is well garlic whole fresh bulbs of course Ivor I would recommend doing a lot of them or at least as many as you can fit in whatever device you're using I think I did something like 12 total bulbs then you're going to individually wrap these babies tightly in plastic wrap and then tightly in two layers of foil think of it kind of like a little tinfoil hat for your garlic except instead of shielding it from electromagnetic fields you're keeping it from drying out or you know all the good stuff cool that's pretty much all the effort you're gonna need to put in here that's right now if you're doing this in the Sahara dehydrator you'll just place the garlic in a metal or heat proof container that will hold all of them I use the shallow half Hotel pan which I did not steal from the restaurant that I used to work at link in the description and then place it in the bottom of the dehydrator and set it to sixty degrees Celsius or a hundred and forty degrees Fahrenheit then just close those doors and literally just let it go for four to eight weeks that's it and don't forget to reset the dehydrators timer every 99 hours I know it's a while but it's literally just sitting there so I mean just live your life now if you're doing this in a rice cooker it's the exact same method except what you're gonna do is place some sort of small grate in the bottom to keep your garlic from touching the actual bottom of the rice cooker then just place your wrapped garlic in the rice cooker and set it to the keep warm function with the lid on now my understanding is that the rice cooker may run a little warmer so check your garlic after three weeks now as for the fermentation station you'll do the exact same thing except you'll place the wrapped cloves in a little pot then place a lid on of course instead of the exact same temperature of 60 Celsius or 140 degrees Fahrenheit and for just about the same amount of time and guess what that's it there's nothing special that you need to do to the garlic just let it do its thing and live your life sure it takes kind of a while but it's only five to ten minutes of active time to get started now just a reminder once your gerlichs done just pull it on let it sit at room temperature for about a day just to redistribute its moisture and then store it in the fridge just make sure not to pull the garlic out until it's completely black not dark brown but totally pitch black like midnight so it's essentially a very slowly cooked and very slowly browned aged garlic that's essentially what's going on here now let's talk about how to use this stuff think of it as a way to add sweet rich umami to just about anything there are no wrong answers here some people even add it to ice cream and I can attest it's quite good now this stuff is super soft so you can easily just mash it or spread it on something like toast but I'm looking for something just a little more refined now if you followed me on Instagram which by the way if you don't be sure to click the link below and you know hit me up then you might have seen my black garlic bonito butter yeah the most amazing compound butter of all time it's actually insanely easy to make once you have the black garlic so you're literally just gonna take 3 tablespoons or 1 gram of bonito flakes and then just sort of roughly chop that just that it's not so big little pieces are good then do the same thing to 1 to 2 heads of black garlic that's obviously been peeled you can do as much as you want I only did one head but you can totally do too and it will still be amazing and then just add that to half a pound or 227 grams of unsalted butter that is totally room-temperature and softened then just mix all that together lay down a nice sheet of plastic wrap and scrape out your butter onto the plastic wrap and slowly rotate the plastic wrap around it sort of create a sausage shape grab the ends and make sure that there's no seen by the way because you don't want this to spread out of the side when you're doing this grab both ends and then basically roll that sort of sausage shape against your counter over and over and you'll notice it's start to get tighter and tighter and tighter until you get a nice little tight you know sausage shape tie off those ends and then place it in the refrigerator until totally firm and solid and if you don't know what to do with the compound butter like this I mean you can do anything that you would use get butter for but my personal choice would be to put a nice thick with to seize coin on a beautifully seared steak and then just let that melt over the steak and just go to town go to town on that home another thing we can do is make an amazing black garlic chimichurri now in order to do that you're gonna roughly mince a single Fresno chili and then finely chop a whole bunch of parsley like an entire individual Bunch I mean I used Italian parsley the zest and juice from 2 lemons and then two heads of black garlic finely chopped then just add enough olive oil to cover all of that in a bowl and mix it together season it generously with salt and you've got an amazing black garlic chimichurri they get spoon over a nice steak or some roasted chicken or potatoes or literally anything that you want to taste delicious also blend it up a little marinade with one head of peeled black garlic 1/4 cup or 60 8 grams of barley miso 2 tablespoons or 14 grams of olive oil a splash of mere and a splash of rice vinegar a little bit of salt you know something just kind of like thrown together blended it up and then pour it on some Wagyu short ribs and marinated them and it was delightful you get the point here black garlic can replace anything that uses roasted garlic or fresh garlic or whatever you want to add the most amazing Amami explosion of your life but do you want to know what else has an umami explosion b-roll [Music] because we're gonna do her helps you in just a moment but I gotta commandeer this just for a second that song you just heard was a custom-made song for us by my boy Sam aka Prince Fox he will be in the description Eden as song is titled hit him with the b-roll so you know anyway alright guys and that is it black garlic we done did it now the Sun is starting to go down so I only have a few minutes before this goes completely dark in here I hope you guys actually try this because it was it's really honestly easy it just takes it just takes a bunch of inactive time you're just literally putting it somewhere and then letting it sit to me this is something that a lot of people can do and you get to experience a really cool process that may lead to a bunch of other interests within cooking and food and blah blah it doesn't really require any skill at all unless you have unless you struggle like wrapping foil around stuff in which case then you might struggle with this recipe I know people are gonna ask about the garlic smells so if you watched at this point thank you you get to reap the benefits of that it's not that bad honestly the first like week you can definitely smell it but like it's really not that obvious at least in my opinion and then after that like it's slowly diminishes to the point where like you can't even smell it like it's really not that bad and if you wrap the garlic well enough like it won't release that much smell so just make sure you grab the garlic nicely and you're good that's it for today so [Applause] that was nice nice look I might say so right now I'm actually working on some work ideas so if you guys want to leave a comment and ask for anything specific please do it now while I'm developing stuff if you like pictures and sneak peeks and all that jazz and you want to DM me I try to respond to as many people as I can then be sure to click

Fabric Store. Tie-dye is a form of shibori, which is the ancient Japanese art of dyeing fabric. There are many different forms of shibori including folding, stitch resist, and pole dyeing. Today I'm going to tie fabric with rubber bands to get 3 different dyeing effects. So let's get started. The materials you'll need are: fabric or an item of clothing, Rit dye, rubber bands, salt which is optional, a container for dyeing, a spoon, rubber gloves, measuring cup, and also plastic to cover your workspace, and a pot for boiling water. For best results, use a fabric made from natural fibers like cotton, and pre-wash the fabric. Wet fabric takes dye better than dry fabric so soak it in warm water and wring it out. I'm going to tie the fabric in 3 different ways. First, I'm going to create a bull's eye effect. Lay the fabric flat, pinch the middle, and pull up. Wrap rubber bands around the fabric, spacing them out as much as you want. The more places you tie rubber bands and the tighter you wrap the fabric, the more white space will be left when you dye it. The dye won't be able to fully penetrate those areas. Next, I'm going to create a stripe effect by folding the fabric like an accordion. Wrap rubber bands around it like before. You can alternate which direction you're folding the fabric as you add the rubber bands. The last pattern will be small circles. Pinch pieces of fabric and tie it with rubber bands. Repeat until the fabric is covered. The less fabric you wrap. the smaller the resulting circles will be. Make sure your workspace is covered with plastic or something to protect it form staining. Heat at least enough water to easily cover the fabric. With the water near boiling, pour it into a container. Put on rubber gloves and add the dye, shaking it first. I'm using denim blue Rit dye. If you're dyeing cotton, rayon, or linen fabric, adding salt will help the dye absorb better. Thoroughly stir the dye bath. The amount of dye you use will depend on the color you want to achieve, the amount of water you're using, and the amount of fabric. Place the fabric into the dye and let it sit for at least half an hour. You can move it around and open up some of the folds a little to allow the dye to get deeper into the fabric. If you want to use more than one color, you can pour different colors on different areas of the fabric. Set your container on an angle or put the fabric on a rack so the colors don't pool together. Pour on the dye and rotate the fabric to get all sides. I'm using petal pink, tangerine, and lemon yellow Rit dye. Make sure the fabric is saturated with dye and let it sit for at least half an hour. Rinse in warm water, then cold, until the water runs clear. Take off the rubber bands as you rinse. Machine wash on cold and hang dry. With these 3 ways of tying fabric you can create a bull's eye, stripes, and small circles. Get creative with different ways of tying the fabric. You never quite know how it's going to turn out, but you can get some unexpected and beautiful results by experimenting.

In this tutorial I'm using red cabbage and ground turmeric to make natural dyes and create an ombre design. So let's get started. The materials you'll need are: pots for boiling water, iodized salt, turmeric, a strainer, a cutting board, a head of cabbage, vinegar, measuring cups, a spoon, a knife, unbleached muslin, and gloves. First I'm going to cut up the red cabbage into large chunks and put it in the pot. Once it's all chopped up fill the pot with water just enough to submerge the cabbage. Bring it to a boil and let it simmer for about an hour. While the cabbage is simmering I'm going to prepare the turmeric dye. First I'm going to mix three quarters of a cup of turmeric with 12 cups of water and bring it to a boil. I'm also going to add a few teaspoons of vinegar to make it a little bit brighter. While these are heating up, I'm going to prepare my fabric. Make sure the fabric is wet, I already rinsed out my fabric. Then I'm going to scrunch it up lengthwise and tie the middle with a rubber band. The turmeric has cooled down a little bit, and now I'm going to submerge this end of the fabric right up until the rubber band. Let it sit for a half an hour to an hour depending on how saturated you want the color to be. This has been in here for about 45 minutes, so I'm going to take it out and rinse it with cold water. The cabbage has been simmering for about an hour now, so I'm going to strain it into a new container and add salt and vinegar. I'm putting in two cups of salt and a few teaspoons of vinegar. Make sure to stir it well. Now I'm gonna submerge the other end of the fabric up until the rubber band and leave it in for about an hour. Stir it a little bit so that the dye gets to all parts of the fabric. When you're ready to take it out rinse with cold water until the water runs clear. Then machine wash it with cold water with an all-natural non-toxic detergent and air dry. So these are the results obviously the turmeric is a lot more vibrant than the red cabbage. I'm really pleased with how the yellow came out. The red cabbage is actually more of a light gray more than red and I think next time I will use beets to make it more saturated and more vibrant. Thanks for watching this OFS project.", "mJHV-IcuBPo": "hi i'm matt tegner with ty and timber beer company i just want to show you guys how to make our signature cocktail the life's a peach starts out with a little bit of copper run moonshine i really wanted to focus on moonshine because nobody really does an upscale moonshine cocktail copper runs fantastic the sweet character of the corn really comes through on this one and it really plays well with the peach so what i do is i take black tea and then i infuse that with real peaches i emulsify it and then i break out the solids that was two ounces of black tea infused with peach so you added an ounce and a half of moonshine to your tea mixture like so and then because you bring in all those tannins from the black tea you kind of want to round it out so i like to use a little simple syrup not a ton here we're looking at about three quarters of an ounce and then to add a little acidity a half ounce of lemon juice so moonshine to me is very very specifically southern american it's just a classic drink also peach tea is very southern american so it's kind of taking two things that they're very famous for making one cocktail out of it and no cocktail is complete without the proper glass and the proper ice after we've shaken that you just want to pop your shaker and then you're just going to simply strain that into the glass over the large ice cube and it's really well balanced with the black tea and the peaches actually this could be a very dangerous cocktail there's not a ton of booziness to it so you can find yourself over indulging if you don't keep track of what you're drinking and no drink is complete the proper garnish and what's tea without a lemon wedge there you have it the copper run life's a peach moonshine cocktail", "v68jcNTR4hA": "hi i'm southern teague and today we're going to teach you how to shake and strain cocktails it's me i'm going to hi i'm souther teague and today i'm going to teach you how to shake and strain cocktails [Music] first we're going to start with what's called the dirty pour and for this one i'm gonna make uh dale de grasse whiskey smash uh half a lemon squeeze right into the cheeter several leaves of uh mint gonna go right in with it give it a pretty aggressive muddle just want to get some of the oils from the lemon peel into the drink as well it's definitely part of the drink some cane syrup for martinique whiskey smash must have whiskey this is bourbon so the dirty poor doesn't come into play very often uh once you get out of college um but there are drinks that require it because you want all of the things that are in the tin to wind up in the glass and that's it the lemon juice is in there the sugars in the cane syrup the whiskey we've got a sour happening a bit of mint to augment it and we're going to do the a hard shake and a dirty pour plenty of ice hard shake to bash up the mint and the lemon some more the dirty pour is everything in the tin goes right into the glass without straining at all and that is a whiskey smash whip shaking is a technique that mostly lives in the tiki world so we're going to make sort of a swizzle uh i'm gonna take a tall swizzle glass i'm gonna break a few sprigs of rosemary and press them into the bottom i'm gonna fill the glass full of pebble ice and the drink is black seal rum dry whiskey fresh lime juice pineapple juice and chartreuse an herbal liqueur made by carthusian monks in warren france now a whip shake is very different than a typical shake we're going to use pebble eyes for the shake and not very much of it and then we're going to shake until we don't hear the ice anymore until it's almost completely melted if not completely melted so literally this much right this will be enough to slightly dilute the drink but we don't need to over dilute it because it's going to go over pebble ice where it will continue to loop pretty much right away but it will chill it and it will aerate it as well [Music] so that's the whip see it's frosted up so it's nice and cold and the dirty pour just means again we pour the entire contents there you have it this drink is called the black tie affair and it uses the whip shake and dirty pour technique next i'm going to demonstrate a standard strain making a drink called the flight deck which is a variation on the aviation cocktail a classic serve this one in a coop and we're going to start with uh some lemon ginger tincture from 1821 bitters in atlanta then monkey 47 gin delicious highly botanical amazing gin a small amount of lemon juice maraschino liqueur which is uh it's the distillate of cherry pits so it's clear and the flavor is more of almond than of cherry and it toes the line between sweet and dry bakaroka this is a cinnamon and clove bitter from the czech republic people say it tastes like christmas ice and shake so for a standard strain and shaking cocktail we're gonna use a hawthorne strainer that's the one with the springs right we put it right over the top of the tin and we can control the gate uh using the little button right if you have things that you want more particulate matter to flow through you keep the gate wide open if you want to keep it tighter and have less things come through you want to tighten it up that is the flight deck a riff on the aviation cocktail finally we're going to demonstrate the shake and double strain so we use a double straining technique when we have particulate matter in the tin that we don't want to wind up in the drink this drink is called the spring rain this drink is called summer rain it involves cucumber slices that get muddled ginger syrup cucumber and ginger are very fast friends in the cocktail world i'm going to add a little bit of celery shrub shrub unlike a bitters is made with some vinegar so it brings some extra acidity lemon juice plymouth gin again a vigorous shake to break up all that particulate matter and then a double strain so in this case we use that hawthorne strainer again but it's not going to be enough to get all the particular matter out that i want even if i close the gate all the way which i'm going to i'm going to strain through this a fine mesh strainer or t-strainer you might ask why double strain when i could just strain through the tea strainer but this is helping to stop everything else from coming through and that is summer rain so that's four different shake and strain techniques for to use when and where appropriate i'm southern tea and i'm just here for the drinks [Music]", "9zcheTQfvR4": "hi this is dr vivek

vera gel and just that will be enough see these things are going to take time it's not going to happen in a moment because skin takes time to regenerate to fix itself so just be patient keep it doing but for sure in a month you will see the results so first is applying aloe vera gel if you want more effect you can add three drops of tea tree oil or the neem oil neem oil also three drops to five drops will be enough just add it and then do the massage and yes it will help you the second my recommendation it is very effective one it is about the use of derma rollers derma rollers are very effective easily found all over the world but only if you will use them in the right way that's why many of the professionals means the dermatologist or the good cosmetologist they use them they can teach their patients how to use it and then people can use it by themselves at their home easily available what you have to do is just two minutes massage one or two minutes very light massage of derma roller on your face this will do magic and after doing the massage after 15 to 20 minutes you can just put this aloe vera gel that i have said on your face and you can sleep at night i am saying again it should be done very gently because if you will press it more it can cause pigmentation it's very easy to use it's not a rocket science you can ask your cosmetologist or your dermatologist how to use it they can explain you and then use it if properly use i am saying again it can do miracle for your skin so using derma roller is a very good stuff plus it is used only if you don't have active acnes if you will have active acnes or acnes are over there on your skin you will be doing it they will burst up and they will cause infection so it is done on the acne scars so derma roller which i will recommend the size of the derma roller that can be used on the face is 0.5 millimeters so this is what you have to use whatever i am saying in this video it's about derma rollers or aloe vera gel they are easily available all over the world but if it's hard to find or you are not sure about the quality then i will put the links down below in the description box you can just have a look my third recommendation it is very effective but it is little bit in controversy i myself don't recommend it for a normal skin or for a long period of time it is the use of baking soda yes baking soda will help if you have the acne scars or you have acne on your face only it should be used for a short period of time means for two to three weeks that's all if you use it regularly or for long period of time maybe right now you will not see the side effects but as you will age surely there will be side effects so better to use it just for a short period of time it's for two to three weeks and every week it should be used only three times not more than it so just use it in this way and yes baking soda will help you you can just mix it with water and just apply it this will help you introducing the redness or the uneven skin in all these yes baking soda will help you you will see the results within 10 to 15 days you will have the results but always remember you have to not use it for long so this is effective use it and then switch to more natural stuff that is like use of aloe vera as i have said my fourth recommendation it is about using the ice cubes yes ice cubes helps a lot because they contract the skin the pores so acnes will be treated if you have active acne then also what you can do just take the ice cube put it in a cloth and just tie the cloth and just put it on the active acne what they will do the cold eyes will help your skin to contract and when your skin pores will be contracted then the extra oil that is produced by the skin it will be reduced for a time being so if you have pain if you have any of the problems or discomfort in your face then using ice will help you what you can do is you can put two to three drops or three to four drops of the tea tree oil in your ice tray plus you can add a little bit of cucumber juice to it and then you can apply this it will be more effective it is done on active acne or if there are scars on this also because it will help in the contraction so this is what can be done my fifth and the simplest tip that is effective it is use of rice water it will help inhaling of your skin it will give the moisture to your skin if your skin will get all the nutrition that it is needed and all the moisture that it needs then what will happen it will start healing itself and the beauty of using the rice water is that you will never have any kinds of pigmentation so it is a treatment of pigmentation that is caused by acne scar and yes it will help in regenerating of the skin that is also a big help in removing the acne scars so using just rice water you have to boil the rice take the water and just spray it you see it's so simple just use it spray it one or two times in a day you can do it especially at night you should do it and this will help acne scars are not very hard to treat the only thing is it takes time so find the home remedy or any of the procedure that is more suitable to you and continue with it and it will give effects if you lost to a dermatologist then he will say that skin takes time it's like two to three months if you want full effects so the only thing is to do it constantly these all are herbal remedies they are effective try them smile more because it will reduce your stress and yes it will help you in improving the blood circulation of your mouth and this indeed will help you in fighting with acne or acne scars so smile more stay happy stay healthy", "sjP8b25080Y": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to vintage cooking corner today i'm going to be making lemon tea bread this recipe is from my new macale's 1963 cookbook tea breads are very popular in england you can make so many different kinds but today i'm going to be using lemons i also decided to try something new which was storing all the ingredients all the ingredients that i could in a mason jar i think this would be an adorable gift you could put all of the dry ingredients in a jar put a lemon with it tie a little maybe like string around with a tag that says the instructions i think that would be super cute so if you want to try this recipe with me this is what you need so in my mason jar i have two cups of flour one and a half teaspoons of baking powder fourth a teaspoon of salt you also want one cup of sugar two eggs one third a cup of milk one stick of butter 2 teaspoons of a grated lemon peel and it also calls for a half a cup of walnuts which i don't have so if you want to add walnuts go right ahead and then for the glaze that we're going to use on top we're going to use fresh lemon juice about 1 4 cup you can also use bottled lemon juice if you don't want to buy real lemons and about a third of a cup of powdered sugar you also want a bread pan and your oven preheated to 350 degrees [Music] so make sure to shake everything if you have it in your mason jar and what we're going to do is we're going to alternate between the flour mixture and the milk so we want to start with the flour mixture a little at a time pour a little bit of milk in flour mixture milk until the last thing that you're adding is the flour my sister [Music] bread is finished and i took it out of the pan and putting it put it on a cooling rack and so while it's still pretty warm we want to make the glaze to pour over it oh i made a mess so we want powdered sugar and lemon juice and you can use real lemons or you can also just use bottled lemon juice [Music] [Laughter] [Music] foreign [Music] okay here you go lemon tea bread is done i added the glaze it looks so beautiful and

the best time to try a snow drink but I'm not gonna get snow from over there my dog just peed so the key is finding the cleanest snow and I think I think this spot is good what do you think yeah yeah I don't know what else is under there actually don't even know if any of the snow is safe to ingest but I'm doing this for you I love you right on yeah I'm back inside of my warm house and how silly of me to want to make a nice beverage during the snowstorm I want to show you how to make one of my favorite Thai beverages is tie-line tea you might be familiar with Thai iced tea that's that really nice sweet and milky drinks I'm going to show you an even more refreshing in your mouth Lam tea the most important ingredient here is Thai tea powder now you can get this in Asian groceries or you can order online and basically Thai tea is made up of black tea leaves that are blended to things like starring nice maybe some vanilla bean and cardamom and it's also known for its signature deep orange color and that's due to artificial food coloring and I'm not a big fan of food coloring but tities not Thai tea with that fat they cash it since the powder usually comes in big packages I like to store the rest in these rice containers look at that Oh smells so good now to make sure I know that it's Thai tea I put the label right here in order to brew the tea you're gonna need a really fine fine mesh strainer if you're buying the tea powder in a Thai market you usually will find this next to it again you can order this online if you can't find it I'm using this French press contain and all I'm gonna do put a few teaspoons in there have some hot water here loli pour it over the tea leaves you'll start seeing that deep orange color come out it's like fake suntan spray I don't know let's yummy to me just let the sit there for about two to three minutes you know it's ready when the water has turned that deep dark orange I'm just gonna remove the strainer while the tea is still hot add the sweetener of your choice I'm just using some white sugar and as little or as much as you'd like I just allow it to cool down alright update we wanted to speed up the cooling down of the tea so you put it out in the snow you're gonna enjoy a nice cold beverage after can we all give a round of applause to Leo you did a fine job cooling down this team a short can blow look at my glass of snow this is a lime tea so I got this beautiful line we sit right into the tea I like lots of lime did you see her I [Music] think horse know I had this drink many times we went to Thailand

Martin I'm CEO and founder of copa de vino number 15 go funny vinyl at one point considering the biggest myths the Sharks had on the show cope with the vinyl brings you wine by the glass by an entrepreneur so confident that he refused offers from the Sharks in two separate appearances but if you happen to see James Martin pitch his product then you might understand why a deal was never made despite being an awful person however Copa de vino experienced a flood of sales following his first pitch in 2011 growing from $600,000 in total sales to nearly 5 million before the year was even over by 2016 the company was earning roughly 15 million annually allowing James Martin to make his second pitch to the Sharks on right now contracts of over 15 to 20 million dollars on private label projects with 711 with target with some of the biggest wine companies in the world really though is more of a battle between entrepreneurs and his way of shoving his success in their faces even so Kevin's admitted to Martin being the one that got away which might explain his interest in civics wine another wine by the glass brand that appeared on the show on season six my product is the doorbot I'm seeking $700,000 for a 10% stake in the company number 14 rake a que door buy originally pitched as the door bon entrepreneur jaime Simonov introduced the product as a revamp home security system in a place of a doorbell equipped with a camera ring strings footage of your entrance to your tablet or smartphone it was a unique idea however Jamie didn't have the numbers to back the product up or a 7 million dollar valuation Kevin was the only investor to make an offer let Jamie decline on the upside however doorbot did attract a large number of investors outside of the tank which led the company to three million in sales the following year raising more than a hundred million from their investors in 2015 including Richard Branson and Qualcomm Ventures doorbot has rebranded into the sleeker ring and as of February 2018 has been purchased by Amazon for more than 1 billion dollars it's a wonderful outcome it's a great thing you know I'm not jealous of it do I wish I had a piece of

concept allows users to match with friends of friends so there's at least that mutual connection the idea was there but the results were lackluster with the revenue being in the negative the year prior and even when they predicted 10 million next year it would only break even most of the Sharks dropped out of course but mark came in strong with the biggest offer the show has ever seen granted

delivery on our entire Mother's Day collection number 12 the books company through Amazon it's been shown that online realtor's are dominant in the consumer market by getting rid of the middle person aka the real orders and distributors the product becomes far cheaper taking advantage of this opportunity john chavis developed the books company and pitched his online floral arrangement delivery service to the sharks in season 5 at the time the idea of delivering flowers was unheard of and it didn't seem very practical considering shipping would take a minimum of six days well at the time but what's most confusing about the pitch was Armas judgment over the name I'm pretty sure a nine year old could spell bucks Barbara anyways once the segment within two months time John received a 23 million from a small group of investors within two years that number grew to 44 million with one investor being Robert Herjavec after realizing the values books offered the customers hi sharks I'm Brooks I'm Tanner number 11 proof eyewear appearing in season four of shark tank brothers Taylor Brooks and Tanner Dame traveled all the way from Idaho the pitch stirrer handcrafted wooden framed environmental-friendly I were at first sight they were impressed with proofs I were sales records as well as their unique product and while kevin O'Leary and Robert Herjavec made separate offers neither for what the brothers were looking for instead the Dayne brothers proudly forged ahead without shark funding pun intended by the way thanks to the group's 15 minutes of fame it allowed proof to earn more than two point five million in revenue the same year they've since opened a flagship store in BOS idaho and there are over 1,000 stores across north america and have reached their way into markets overseas those accomplishments are even more impressive when you realize they've grossed more than 10 million an overall sales since their pitch in 2013 number 10 coke jacks by Derrick Piquet's definition coach X has remarkably turned an inconvenience into an opportunity the 20-something entrepreneur walked his way into shark tank in 2012 to pitch his ticket free coat check system which was surprisingly brave considering he had zero sales under his belt at the time despite this bump in the road however Derrick still received an offer from Mark Cuban for $200,000 but declined as he was only willing to offer 10% equity since his appearance on the show though Derrick's managed to pick up several loyal investors to help further the fund for coach acts as he has managed to maintain an impressive list of contracts with popular venues in New York City including Madison Square Garden the Barclays Center Webster Hall and bound Sporting Club among others I'm down here in Chauvin Louisiana at the Indian Ridge shrimp processing plant where if I'm making a perfect shrimp burger I need the perfect shrimp right at the Gulf of Mexico number nine chef big shake a que CBS foods hamburgers chicken burgers veggie burgers fish burgers shrimp burgers yeah that's a real product and apparently it tastes fantastic when chef Shawn Davis appeared in season two and proposes unique take on the shrimp burger the Sharks ate it up literally however as we form from watching shark tank a bad valuation can easily cost someone a deal in the end the shark scored content with the numbers so Davis left empty-handed it's not to say his head wasn't held high or praise over his product and even the Sharks were hopeful for Shawn success not long after a local group of investors watch Davis pitch and made him a better offer in less than a year chef big shake was in over 800 stores across the United States 2,500 now causing sales alum from 30k in 2011 to over 5 million annually just goes to show why someone shouldn't give up on their dreams hi I'm Elena Phoenix and I am the owner of zero shoes and I'm steven sashen I'm the CEO number eight zero shoes essentially walking barefoot into the shark tank these two self-proclaimed long-haired aging hippie athletes wound a lot of people at home but sadly not our investors other product in season four and zero shoes are an ultra minimal stylish sandal intended to make you feel like you're walking or running barefoot the couple's biggest downfall during their pitch though with Steven sessions and Lina Fenix is predicted five million dollar valuation Kevin was the only one willing to take a bite but even with so much financial experience under their belts they just never saw the potential that's Stephen and Lina dead now comes the shark tank effect where zeros shoes sell more in a week than they would have in three months in 2015 they sold 1.5 million in product and in two years they've expanded enormous Lee grossing 5.2 million in 2017 not bad for just a piece of reverence and strength $160,000 investment for 20% equity in our company number seven cell Helmand everyone has dropped their smartphone at one point or another it feels like they keep on getting easier and use of the break so why not have some type of insurance for it coming in with a solution David are two so and Mike Kane pitched her idea for a tougher phone case which might still break but it comes with a guaranteed repair and replacement warranty and that's the beauty of cell helmet unfortunately the Sharks viewed it as a flawed system just waiting for fraudsters and the idea could be easily done by other much larger companies so their dreams much like our phone screens were shattered after the episode aired however our two so and Kane found their inboxes filled with offers from investors pounced on the opportunity and now are available in over 3,000 stores across the United States Echo Valley meats makes the best meat you'll ever eat we specialize in that old-fashioned butcher shop quality number six Echo Valley meats a meat connoisseur in his own right David Alwyn has always had a knack for making good food and it's a skill that he displays strongly during his time on the show in season four the product was fantastic and the Sharks literally ate it up but in the end Allan's biggest problem proved to be his lack of skill as a presenter and entrepreneur sure he came in with a modest 190,000 in sales however he has no clear understanding of a business plan and barely knew his customer base unlike some entrepreneurs though David Allen took the Sharks feedback and turned it into an opportunity Echo Valley gained a massive market exposure after their appearance on Shark Tank racking up close to 1.4 million in sales the following year Alwyn took this as a chance to redeem himself did some major turnarounds by putting more focus into mail order and returned his shark tanks in season six to strike a deal with Mark Cuban don't you just love a happy ending hello my name is Jeff Street I'm the owner of high con LLC number five high con LLC appearing in these second season of shark tank Jeff's troupe performed an amazing pitch for his fire hose hardware manufacturing company when he asked for $500,000 for a 40 percent equity stake at haikon LLC Stroupe demonstrated firsthand that his innovative Hydra connector can make a huge difference for fire fighters by shaving off valuable seconds from the time it takes to connect the hose to a fire hydrant potentially saving Wow Kuban expressed his own vision for the company though I made an offer to buy out Stroupe for 1.25 million alongside a three-year $300,000 employment contract and 7.5 percent royalties it goes without saying that he would have been well off for a long time and in the heat of the moment agreed to the deal off screen however the deal fell through allowing Jeff Stroupe to grow his business eventually making hai Kaun LLC a multi-million dollar business have you built this right now number four lip bar with top Rancher G from L'Oreal to LA to Estee Lauder the beauty industry is like a minefield for newcomers entrepreneurs Melissa Butler and Rosco Spears were determined however and pitched there extensively colored line of lipsticks despite the questionable list of shades available the products all natural high-quality takes on things impress the sharks though due to the duo's lack of past and future projected sales along with a downright confusing marketing strategy the Sharks did a bunch don't waste them trying to sell lipstick on the other hand the girls pitch attracted the attention of numerous magazines like cosmopolitan and ebony allowing lip bard to launch their own tour to further spread their brand as a 20-18 lip bar products are exclusively available at target locations across the East Coast and one in San Francisco hello sharks my name is Julie Boucher and my product is slawsa number three slawsa the combination of salsa and coleslaw isn't something you come around very often but who doesn't love a little bit of sweet with some heat well apparently the Sharks butter Julie bush' pitched her Slauson product in season 5 to our entrepreneurs to which she received rave reviews all around which is why her rejection was so confusing what's worse is you typically see products featured on shark tank more than double and revenue after their episode airs this is known as the shark tank effect however slawsa did not Julie's been led down a long winding road but through the increased product development to bring new flavors to the chain as well as being featured on television numerous times flosses managed over time as a 20-18 the delicious condiment has made

gourmet pickles okay miss pickles gourmet everyone loves a 100 year old secret family recipe and the short tanks are no exception pitching their recipe for lynnae's gourmet pickles in season five while Laneige seller and a leek Houlihan got through to their stomachs it was lynnae's inability to differentiate themselves from other pickle brands that got them thrown out without a deal two years later in 2015 the company made huge efforts in rebranding into what is now miss pickles gourmet allowing Linnea to secede from presidency and allow ali kullin to take over majority as of now not much growth has occurred however miss pickles are available online through Amazon for 10 percent number one rocket buck the beauty about Shark Tank is that you see ideas you'd never expect in a hundred years it's like who would have thought there were still more ways to innovate a notebook well appearing in season eight Jack Epstein Angela may it's their reusable digital notebook capable of erasing your works by microwaving it these two entrepreneurs have claimed to have reinvented the notebook and despite having two million in prior sales to coming onto the show the Sharks just laughed them off little do they know their rejection led them to become a massive success shortly after the duo's episode aired sales reportedly taught down at 10 million F Steinem LeMay took the opportunity to

beforehand we'll need to soak the lemon in the honey which I will go into detail later on in the video for the second part of the ingredients we have 2 black tea bags 250g of hot water 100g of cold water and some ice cubes so for the first batch of ingredients we'll need to start out by sprinkling some salt onto the lemon and scrubbing it do put on a pair of gloves to prevent the salt from hurting your skin then we'll place the lemon in water and let it soak for about 10 minutes after that rinse the lemon and wipe it dry slice the lemon and remove the seeds for this case we only need half of the lemon but you may also prepare the other half of the lemon which you may store it in the fridge for future servings so after removing the seeds take half of the lemon slices and place them in the jar of honey add in the brown sugar as prepared earlier and stir it till it's evenly mixed you will then want to make sure you cover the lid of the jar tightly and place it in the fridge for at least 2 days here you can actually prepare more of these in advance and store them in the fridge which will save you some time when you want to actually make them now after having the lemons well soaked you will notice a darker shade on the pulp of the lemon and we're ready to move on to the 2nd batch of ingredients firstly for the black tea bags I'm using the lipton yellow label stretch the tea bags out and place them into a teapot then gently pour the hot water into the tea pot  and let it steep for 5 to 15 minutes the longer you let it steep the richer the taste of the tea after the tea is ready remove the tea bags from the teapot note do not squeeze the tea bags as some would do as the taste of the tea would turn overly bitter now pour the tea into a bigger jug and add the cold water next add in the lemon and honey we've prepared earlier into the jug as well we'll then want to stir it with a wooden spoon and let the sweetness of the honey lemon seep into the tea you may then pour it into a glass and add some ice cubes into it and there you go your very own iced lemon tea if you like this video do leave a like or comment and subscribe to our channel!", "3oYf2O22F5M":

watching", "PrEB91Xv7hc": "- Annie of living Regina budget today we're gonna make dalgona Thai iced tea or dalgona Thai tea this is probably my favorite of the dog go to drinks because it foams up a lot more than the others is perfectly sweetened and it has that characteristic Thai iced tea flavor what's different about this dog gonna tie to drink is that it could be made dairy-free with your favorite nut milk or a dairy-free alternative and it's easy to make with a hand mixer and just a few ingredients so let's get started so you can choose between using teabags or loose leaf tea the Thai tea bags they don't have blue coloring in it if you check the ingredient in the back is just bhakti and star anise seed and the flavor is lighter than the Thai team mix so this Thai tea mixed by the brand pantai is what restaurants use and has that authentic Thai tea flavor but it has artificial food coloring in it to give it that orange color in this video I use the Thai key mix because I need it to look like Thai iced tea we're going to do 3 tablespoons of Thai tea mix and this recipe is 2 steps we're gonna brew the Thai tea first and then we're gonna whip it into the dull Kona mixture next we're going to add a cup of hot water and we're gonna give it a stir and let it steep for 3 minutes you can also use a coffee press for this it would make it much easier but if you don't you can just put into a bowl and strain it out so it's been three minutes now we're gonna stir it people stir and we're gonna spoon it and we need to end up with 4 tablespoons of brewed tea for this dog gonna recipe and if you feel like this is taking too long you could just pour the bowl into the strainer it's just gonna spill a little bit don't forget to strain out all of the liquid from the tea leaves using a spoon next is step two now we're gonna do the dull going apart we're gonna add in four tablespoons of the brewed Thai tea that we just made this recipe has the most liquid out of all the other dog owner recipes I've tried and I think that's why it whips up with so much volume at the end next we're adding half a tablespoon of instant coffee then add two tablespoons of sugar then we're gonna give a little stir with a spatula and we're gonna use our hand blender in the beginning start on a low setting first so that everything incorporates and as you can see the sugar still sticks to some parts of the bowl so you're gonna stop the mixer and scrape down the sides keep going and move up to a higher speed and you can see that's starting to foam up and the volume is increasing and the bubbles mean we're getting more air into this mixture and making it lighter and fluffier and you can see the colors starting to change its lining up to a very light orange and I know at this point you're gonna probably think you're done but keep going cuz here you go when you keep going it gets even fluffier it's starting to look like whipped cream and you can see there's stiff peaks now and this is the point where you can stop and I just want to let you know that with a hand mixer you're gonna get it fluffier faster than the stand mixer now we're ready to serve our dough go nuts high tea and you can use any milk you want regular milk or a dairy alternative and you can add ice if you once I like to scoop in my dog gonna make sure with a nice tuned scoop because it just works better Wow look at this beautiful creamy fluffy dog gonna tightiy it whipped up so much that it's gonna take up half the glass so make sure that you get a tall glass and you only fill up the milk halfway so you could leave room for this creamy fluffy dough gonna make sure in this last optional step I like to use the whisk attachment of the hand mixer give it a little twist to make it look good for pictures so before drinking use a spoon and mix the creamy whip part with the milk and enjoy the velvety rich cream makes it taste like a specialty drink from a high-end coffee shop this drink is all mine don't tell my kids because I'm not sharing if you liked this video give it a thumbs up and subscribe for more videos like this also check out my other dog owner drinks see you next time bye [Music]",

of sugar heaped but remember that sugar you can always use the amount you feel you need and then we will use one and a half pieces of lemon this is medium size of course if you use a very big one with a lot of juice you can as well use one if you're using a large one but we are using this medium size one and a half pieces and then we will use one and a half liters of water that's about six cups of

another video! Today, I'm gonna be melting one of every candle from Bath & Body Works together into a Frankencandle. - That's right, bad makeup science is evolving into just... bad science, I guess. So I have previously mixed together every beauty guru's eyeshadow palette and every lipstick from Sephora, to find the average or most marketable eyeshadow or lipstick shade with generally pleasing results. And so, of course, my beady little eyes have been searching for something else to mix. And seeing that it is the holiday season, the first thing that came to my mind was Bath & Body Works, who go ham during the holidays with their seasonal candles. Now, Bath & Body Works has been around for a while. In the early to mid 2000s, they were especially notorious for their body sprays, of which I had many. But sometime over the years, their candle game has evolved into one of the most well-known parts of their brand. Helped by the demand they create with their large sale on Candle Day and the seasonal limited edition candles they release, people freak out about Bath & Body Works' candles. Az4Angela: I look around, there's barely anybody in the st-freaking store! *exhales loudly* Saf: and I'm not immune to this. I also love a good three wick burner, and they have such a large inventory of candles, they really do have something for every nose. So I was thinking, if I bought one of every candle that Bath & Body Works sells, particularly now, as they have both their normal odor inventory, as well as their holiday scents out, could I create the ultimate, layered megacandle of my wildest dreams? Something that works for all seasons, kind of like Christmas in July? Well, there's only one way to find out. All right! Let's do it! So we are outside Bath & Body Works right now, and we're gonna go in and try and buy one of every candle scent that they sell. Now, from looking at the website, we noticed that they have multiple listings for candles with the same name. Alright, so these both say Mahogany Teakwood. So before purchasing any, I wanted to see if they were actually different scents or just the same candle with different packaging. I think they're the same. So I guess we only need one of these. So, that's candle number 1. With that settled, I pretty much just got to work grabbing candles. And unlike lipsticks, candles are large and heavy. So my bag started filling up fast. I'm just covered in candles. Can I give you this bag? Tyler: Yes. - So after sweeping the store and going from display to display to make sure we had at least one of every scent available at this location... [candle falling]\n(Safiya startled) Oooh! It's fine. ...we checked out. But even though we had what felt like a crap ton of candles, we soon realized we didn't have nearly as many as we had counted online. In fact, I'm pretty sure we only have about 60 candles in here. Oh! 55. 55 candles. Which is actually about half of all the candles we need. So we're gonna have to fill in some holes. Now when we brought our candles home, We cross-referenced them with the list of candles we found online, and quickly noticed that a fair amount of the candles we had bought in-store weren't listed on the website at all. And on top of that, most of the ones not listed were the limited edition holiday candles. So, I ordered every remaining candle that was available online and then hit another Bath & Body Works to see if there were any holiday ones that weren't at the first store. Saf: Luckily for us, they had plenty of Christmas candles. But unluckily for us, a lot of the Christmas candle names sound very similar to each other. But we did end up finding 27 more candles that we hadn't found either at the first store or online. So I would say that it was a success! And adding that to the 55 candles from the first store and the 35 candles ordered from the website, we ended up with 117 different candles. There were one or two that were sold out online and probably a couple that we didn't even know about and couldn't find, but I would say that we bought pretty close to every candle available from Bath and Body Works. Pretty damn close. Okay, so these are all of our candles untopped. Safiya: Decapped? Just to, ya know, see what I'm getting myself into. I mean with all of them open, I am getting like so many different scents in my nostrils, it's hard to think. Over here it's a little harder to say, but over here, it smells like Froot Loops I think. And just based on the fact that it smells kind of different as I move around, I don't think that we'll be able to figure out what the final scent will be just from this, so I think it's time to start figuring out how exactly we're going to melt all of these together. So I'm going to categorize these candles into sorta like, scent families just based on which ones I think go together. They do also list the fragrance notes for each candle on the bottom of the jar as well as on the website. But for my purposes, I'm gonna be grouping them sort of subjectively. And once they're all sorted, my process is to basically take a melon baller and scoop out a little bit of wax from each candle to put into our mixture. And hopefully one scoop from over 100 candles will gather together enough wax to make one candle! The Frankencandle. The Frank & Body Works. Safiya: Also this hot plate is not on. I'm gonna put in all the wax cold first and then melt it later. So our first scent category is foods. Not Christmas foods, more like brunch foods. And I'm gonna start off with this one: French Baguette. Now this is our only single wick candle, because it's the only one we couldn't find in a three wick. Other ones are available in the smaller jar but I like the big ones. Oh! That smells wonderful! It smells like a toasted croissant. Alright, so I'm gonna start scooping. This one has like the smallest surface area to scoop, so this one might be tough. Saf: Oh my God. Saf: Oh there we go- there we go! Tyler: Oh yeah! Saf: Alright, so next I'm gonna use this like giant toothpick to poke the wax out of the melon baller. Cause it's, not stuck, but, you know, it's waxy. And with that, we have one candle down, hundreds to go! Well, like a hundred and a few. Alright, so lets start getting into our groove here. You know what I mean? Lets start scooping. Saf: Let's start... ballin'! I raise my leg like a - like a stork. Saf: That's how I ball. So in this food category, we have 10 candles, most of which are generally sweet. And the majority of their fragrance notes have to do with vanilla, sugar, sea salt, and different fruits. Namely peaches, lemons, and all kinds of berries. And though I would say a lot of them have similar notes, they do have varying levels of boldness. Tyler: What is that?\nSaf: Oh! (disgusted noise) I feel like there's just like two buckets of candles. Like candles you can stick your face in, and candles that stick their face in you. Oooooaaaaaaah! Like this Banana Split Milkshake candle is almost offensive, but it's not even the baddest of the bunch. Okay, so this one is a Blueberry Maple Pancake candle, which smells a little bit like if IHOP got smacked in the face by a blueberry. (Tyler laughing)\nSaf: Yep. And the smell actually gets stronger when I dig into it with the melon baller. Saf: (overwhelmed) Ooooooaaahhh! That's a strong one. Mr. Grinch. And then this is the last food-scented candle, at least until we get to the seasonal ones. And this one is called Georgia Peach. (Southern accent) There's been a murder in Savannah, Georgia! I know that like no one from Georgia really talks like that anymore... Saf: But I'm really just referencing The Office right now. So with all of that wax scooped, let's take a whiff of our concoction so far. Ooh! (Saf laughing) Right now, I pretty much smell only blueberries, but we'll see what happens over the next couple of hours. So next up, we're moving on to what I would call the \"spa scent\" category. And I would generalize them by saying, it seems like it would be nice if someone sprayed it on your face. So a big staple for the notes in this section is flowers, in addition to the somewhat ambiguous water fragrance, which I think kinda fits the spa theme, as well as a speckling of citrus. And I think that in general, these sort of like floral, leafy spa scents are a little less pungent. They're more of a fragrance than an odor. And I think that maybe because of their subtlety, some of them really strum some nostalgia strings. Like Villa Bergamot. This one smells like the gift shop at Colonial Williamsburg. And White Tea & Ginger, which smells like... ...my baby doll did when I was 5. Saf: Yes, definitely! (laughs) Alright. So checking back in with the pot... Hmm. Mm-hmm. It definitely smells a little more floral, but I'm still smelling the blueberry. I am! I swear I am! With like a touch of lemon-something. Alright. So after this category, I have three candles that all smell like Abercrombie & Fitch. All of them are like some variation on teakwood, which must just mean Abercrombie & Fitch smell. Oh yeah. That's Abercrombie. I know this scent well. It haunts me in my dreams. I just hear like, pounding house music and I smell this scent. They also have this one called Mahogany Teakwood High Intensity, which is for when you wanna smell like you went into Abercrombie & Fitch with your friends in 2007 and never left. And then the next category is six aromatherapy candles, with two eucalyptus candles kinda like thrown in the bunch. And after all those, our concoction smells like... Blueberry. (laughing) With a dash of like, soap. So I'm not sure if any of the therapeutic elements of these candles are gonna make it through to the final mixture. I don't know if anyone can truly be relaxed when smelling that blueberry one. So our next category is summer. So I'm gonna start off this round with Island Margarita. There are 18 candles in this category, and actually, a fair amount of them are named after drinks. Now we do have an entire separate section of alcoholic drinks coming up next, but I would say that these are like SUMMER  drinks. And in terms of the scents, coconut, as well as other fruit like mango and pineapple, are well-represented. There's also a few candles with general ocean scents and assorted wood smells. Ocean Driftwood kinda smells like Hollister. I guess teakwood smells like Abercrombie, and driftwood smells like Hollister. I will say though that I think that most of the candles in this section smell pretty nice, and they are making our mixture smell more like coconut. That may be though because there are a lot of tropical candles on top, so we'll see when it melts who really comes out. ...on top. So next up, let's move on to the New Year's/alcoholic drinks category. So first up in this round is Champagne Toast. Which smells... I think I've lost the ability to smell. It says it's supposed to smell like champagne, berries, and tangerine. I do smell some berries. But it's almost like berry Tums. Besides that, I would say the candles in this category are meant to smell sort of like party drinks, cologne, or perfume. For example, the most popular notes are champagne, fruit, manly scents like sandalwood, driftwood, and leather, and perfumey scents like patchouli amber and peonies. Party Dress actually smells kind of good! Unfortunately, it seems that after about 50 candles, my ability to smell is somewhat going away. In The Stars kinda smells like Party Dress. Now I think I forget what Party Dress smells like. Can I get high from this? (Tyler laughing) Saf: Alright, and then this last one of the festive category is called Black Tie. And it smells... also like Party Dress. (Tyler laughing)\nSaf: I'm confused. Okay. So with that, we're done with the New Year's celebration, alcohol category, and we're moving on into the more seasonal candles. So I'm gonna go for a quick walk to clear out my nose and then we'll move on to the fall candles. So this section has 10 candles, And I would say the general vibe is things you would smell or eat or wear around a bonfire. With common notes such as cinnamon/clove, wood, sugar, and a little bit of pumpkin. They're kinda like the candles that Bath & Body Works probably tries to sell before it's like really couth to put out the Christmas candles. It's like the early November candles. Saf: Exactly. This one smells kinda like Michaels, like craft store. Tyler: Oh, yeah. Saf: I just wanna\u2014 (candle fights back) OHHH! It exploded. Sorry. I got... too excited. And as for how our mixture smells after the autumn scents, I think I am picking up on some of the cloves that were left behind. Though I am still smelling a lot of, like, the fruitier scents from earlier. So we've got cloves and fruits. Take that as you will. So next up is our winter category. which I categorized by taking candles that were definitely seasonal, but were not specifically Christmas-themed. I would say they're more in like the snow, frosty, forest category. Tyler: A walk through the forest in December. Saf: Yes. So this group has 12 candles and they're generally supposed to smell like trees, like cedar, pine, and fir, as well as spices, like cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. There are also a few citrus notes, berry notes, and plant-y notes. As well as one super-sweet hot cocoa candle that doesn't have like any of the other notes we mentioned. Oh, this is a bold one. But it's definitely winter-ish. (overwhelmed) Oooh. Ooh-hooh. (candle resists) Whoah! Saf: All is well. Saf: Sparkling Woods just came for my wig. Saf: I know. I wonder... what will be the wig of 2019? My money's on merkin. Woah! My merkin! It's flown! Okay. And with that, we are done with the non-denominational winter scents. I will say that some of these upcoming aren't necessarily \"denominational,\" but I feel like they are more specifically Christmas-targeted, either with their packaging, or with their names. First up, we have general Christmas. Okay. So right off the bat, something I'm very excited about is how many different colors there are in this pile. I feel like we could use a little sprucin' up! A little spice! This is Cherry Frost, but you know what I mean. And beyond the colors, this category fragrance-wise is pretty strongly characterized by a lot of vanilla. And once again, trees. Notably cedar wood and balsam. Kinda smells like a Christmas wreath. They also use the descriptors \"frosted\" and \"snow-capped\" a lot here, but I'm not sure exactly what that means. Also a fair amount of this packaging is holo. The thing is, I know that Cristine sent Bath & Body Works a cease and desist for trying to take some of her holosexual branding. So... I'm gonna say they probably got this from Cristine. Moving on.... This one's called Merry Mistletoe. It actually smells like Indian food. (Tyler laughing) Saf: It kinda smells like tamarind sauce. Saf: It also kinda smells like mint chutney. Though I find that often those two things are together. So... maybe I'm smelling a milieu of them both. And then to finish off our penultimate category, We have Frosted Coconut Snowball. A lot of words. That could mean a myriad of scents. Saf: Oh, yeah! I've never had one of those, but I've always wanted one. So now I want that and Indian food. Alright. So that was Christmas general. It smells... essentially like a psychedelic lemon bar. I think some of the tree scents are starting to read \"lemon.\" If that makes sense? And I'm definitely smelling some sugar. So that's where like the lemon bar comes in. So now, onto the final category: Christmas foods/drinks! Christmas edibles. So this is our biggest category, with 24 candles. And the fragrance notes are basically just ingredients for like Christmas desserts. Like vanilla, sugar, cinnamon, caramel, orange, ginger, and my personal favorite, peppermint. Like here we've got some mint chocolate. Saf: Right? I wonder how it tastes. Tyler: It smells like mint ice cream\u2014 Saf: It tastes pretty good. Saf: Yeah. You want some? Saf: Don't eat candles at home, kids. Do as I say, not as I do. And besides having some tasty ones, this category also has some iconic Bath & Body Works candles. Ah! So up next we have Winter Candy Apple, which I'm pretty sure was one of the candles that the Bath & Body Works freak out lady freaked out about. - I don't know. I've been busy taking care of bitches all f***ing day! Saf: Ooh! Saf: I'm not sure it was. (laughs) It kinda smells like Juicy Juice or like Fruit Roll-Up. But listen, I get it. It's the principle of the thing. You know? They said they were in stock and then they weren't. I also could not believe that that happened in Appleton, Wisconsin. - Appleton, Wisconsin, I want everybody to know... This happened in Appleton. Saf: In general, I would say these Christmas food scents are pretty hit or miss. They're not all bad, but they are all pretty strong. So if it's not a scent you like, you're pretty much out of luck. Kind of like with our final candle: Hot Buttered Rum. Ooooh. It kinda smells like root beer candy tastes. Saf: Candies, though.\nTyler: Yes. Saf: That's like a really bizarre and like maybe random reference. Tyler: No way, Saf: Really? Tyler: I think so. Saf: Is that mainstream? Let us know. Okay. So we are finally done scooping wax out of candles. Now let me just give my pot a little interstitial whiff, just to see how it smells before it's melted. Hmmm. (Tyler laughing offscreen) Maybe just like... peppermint berry sugar. But I guess we'll find out what it actually smells like after we melt it down. I think, though, my hands are a little tired and our noses are a little tired. So I'm gonna call it a night, and then in the morning, we'll check back in and melt it. Alright. So it's the next day, and because of Daylight Savings it's almost the next night. But regardless, we're gonna melt. Whoooh. Oh! It smells caramelly this morning.\n(Tyler laughs offscreen) Afternoon. Evening. What time is it? Now I'm gonna turn on the hot plate to start melting the wax from below so we'll see, I guess, from above if anything starts happening. Okay. So it looks like after letting the mixture melt for about 20 minutes, It's definitely deflated. There was a decent amount of height to our wax mountain, and now it's more like a lump, maybe. Alright. So what I'm gonna do next is bring in this hairdryer. Just so we can heat up the top layers of wax because clearly the bottom layers are melting, and the top layer's just kinda chillin'. So with out wax shavings melting together, we are almost at our final Franken mixture. Now as we mentioned, we had 117 candles that were scooped for this experiment. And all of those candles had a total of 385 fragrance notes listed. Saf: And the most popular notes overall were any variation on wood, vanilla, sugar, cinnamon, mint, orange, coconut, apple, clove, and musk. I will say though that some scents are just stronger than others. So even if they are listed less frequently, they might still poke through. I'm looking at you, demon blueberry. It kinda looks like a grape Jolly Rancher and malt liqueur. Alright. so after a little more hairdrying, it's melted into this, like, dark, potion-y looking concoction. Saf: (creepy voice) Hello, Clarice. And now it's time to mold it into a candle. So I've got a large Frankencandle jar right here and I have these kind of like wick adhesive thingies. So I'm just gonna stick three wicks in there. And once we've done that, I'm gonna tape the tails to the side of the jar so the wicks don't fall in while we're making the candle. Alright. There we go. Now I think all that's left is to pour the wax in. Should I go, like, down the middle? Saf: Alright, let me try. Saf: Oooooooh! Is that enough? Too much? Oh my God, it's a tall candle. Saf: Yeah! Saf: Wow! Oh, that's awesome! Oh my God, it's already hardening. Ooh, yeeeeeah! Yes! Tyler: It's hardening? Saf: Yes! It's already hardening, look at the outside. So I think our mixture is looking pretty cool right now. That ombre is everything. I might even say it's... lit? Saf: But it seems like it's gonna take a while to fully solidify. So let's just leave it here, leave this camera rolling so we can maybe get a little time-lapse situation, and then we will cut our wicks and smell our candle. Okay, so here it is. There she blows, as some would say. I think that in the end, she's really dried down to be kind of like, a dusty lavender color. Which is interesting, though I guess it makes sense thinking back to how many of those candles were blue and red. So I'm just gonna head upstairs to actually smell the candle. just because there are a lot of -uh- competing fragrances down here. Also I brought some coffee upstairs just because some people say that smelling coffee is like a palate cleanser for your nose. This coffee's, like, over a year old, for sure. And after that, it's time for the whiff of truth. It's not bad. But it's hard to pinpoint, like, a name for what I'm smelling. I think berry, honestly. It is a little bit of a caramelly scent. I think it's like a sugared berry. Tyler: Okay. Saf: And that's my best guess. Tyler: You know what? Maybe it's stuck in my nostrils, but I'm smelling some of that blueberry. Somewhere, deep in there. Saf: So now that we've both smelled it cold, I think we've gotta light this sucker up. Okay. It smells really good when lit. Tyler: Oh yeah? Saf: I think it's still a berry smell, though. Tyler: Okay. Saf: I'm getting like a cozy, indoor, berry, cookie. Tyler: Maybe a pancake? Saf: It is possible... that the Blueberry Maple Pancake ended up on top. But even if that's true, the Franken-Body Works scent definitely has some layers to it that are hard to pin down. And I really wanna be able to convey those to you guys effectively. So I embarked on a smell quest to get more opinions on our candle to share with all of you. I'm gonna go up to strangers and ask them to smell my candle. Hahaha! This isn't creepy at all! Tyler: It does sound sexual Saf: It sounds like a euphemism for something. So right off the bat, we had people corroborating our guesses as to what the Frankencandle smelled like. - It's sweet, maybe something baked? Like a cupcake, maybe? Saf: Any undertones? Pretend you're a candle sommelier. - Maybe some fruity, like, raisin undertones? Saf: Raisin! With opinions like baked goods and fruit... Saf: As well as some holiday undertones. Saf: Cinnamon. Alright, fair. Anything else? But there was also a contingent of people who were picking up on undertones of the candle that I could not smell. Saf: Floral! A Bath & Body Works, totally. Saf: Okay. With a few votes for flowers... - Smells like, Saf: Lavender! That's our second lavender! I am totally missing the lavender here. So after getting some conflicting opinions out in public, We decided to go see Daniel Stone at Stone Candle Bar in Santa Monica, where they both produce and sell candles, as well as hold custom candle-making classes. Daniel, we did something weird. (Tyler and Safiya chuckling) Daniel: That's what I've heard And we were hoping he could give us an expert opinion. - Would you like me just to... Saf: Yeah, just...\n- Put my two cents into this? Saf: Put your nose right in it. - Alright, so immediately it smells like a holiday scent. As holiday scents tend to be overpowering and kind of gormandize and rich. Now if you don't mind, I can get a little bit more out of this... if I rub the wax and let the notes kind of come out.\nSaf: Sure, yeah. Saf: Swatch it. - Still. Really overpowering with that apple cinnamon type, cookie, vanilla scent. Now in an attempt to figure out exactly what the Franken-Body Works smelled like on our own, We had actually sniffed all our candles and picked out 11 that were kind of close. None of them were perfect, but if you hold Chestnut & Clove, Hot Cocoa, and the dreaded Blueberry Pancakes up to your face at the same time, I think you can kind of smell all of the layers of the Frankencandle. Yep, that's pretty good. So we've been trying to figure out, like, with our own devices what it smells like. - Yeah. Saf: And we came up with blueberry pancake... - Yeah, blueberry pancake. Totally. Saf: hot cocoa, and chestnut clove. - Chestnut. Chestnut is a great one in there. Saf: Alright, there we go. So it sounds like our little three candle combo was the way to go. - I'm sure you put other things in here. Saf: We did. (laughs) - I'm sure there was some ocean fragrances and some sandalwoods and a clean linen and all those wonderful things are just overpowered by the food fragrances. And so that's what you end up with. Alright. So... Expert opinion: it smells kind of like blueberries plus sort of a cinnamon-y, holiday undertone. - Walnut, chestnut, cocoa... Yeah. That should do it. Saf: Alright. So I think that is our best attempt at conveying the essence of the Franken-Body Works. Now what I will say is that I think the candle looks good and smells enjoyable, but like Daniel said, you can't really smell any of the non-sweet scents. So I'm not sure it really is the best of all seasons. It's more just like... Christmas. And I think that has to do with just how strong the food scents are. Because even though notes like mint, musk, eucalyptus, and sandalwood were very popular, I don't really smell them at all. Regardless, I am pretty pleased with our final candle. And I'm definitely gonna be burning it for a long, long time. And while I'm not sure I would recommend Frankencandle-ing, as I don't know if I'm gonna be doing it again, and it did give Tyler a prolonged headache, I am now pleased with the amount of candles I have to use in the coming months. I'd say we have pretty much a year's supply of candles right here. Saf: I mean, not if we burn it literally 24/7. Saf: Oh. (laughs) Thank you guys so much for watching our final video of 2018.

Welcome back to Generasi Kopi ! Welcome to Icip - Icip Kopi ! I have a partner with me today. Which is also a cool barista from Otten Coffee, Haris. And Haris is going to join us with making my own recipe coffee. First, I want to inform for coffee lovers. Who don't know that Otten Coffee have Youtube Channel right now? Subscribe Now. Because there are so many recipes and tips about coffee that I can do for you. Okay, this recipe will appear in Otten Youtube Vlog Channel. Today, I'm going to make Ice Coffee Lemonade with Rosemary. Imagine, something cold and refreshing combines with Rosemary spices. You must be so curious, Ris ? Yeah, I'm curious actually with the taste. Are you ready my partner for making coffee ? He looks so ready. Haris will help me to make. I will do the coffee and he will do something for lemonade. There is brown sugar. It also has longan and Rosemary. For the lemonade, I had squeeze the lemon just now. You need around 150ml lemon water. And also 250 gram of brown sugar. For the Rosemary, it's all depends on your taste. When you are in the mood, just put as many as you want. If you don't like Rosemary, just put a little bit. Make a little twist in your lemon. And this longan will add on the end of the process. Of course, today I want to use Kerinci Coffee. Can you explain how is the Kerinci taste ? There are the profile notes, Fresh cedar aromatics. Sweet Acidity. Blackberry and Cocoa flavor. Juicy body with herbal finish. So, it is so suitable to mix with this kind of drinks. The taste will be so fresh. Yeah, that's right ! I'm going to brew the coffee. Haris is going to help to blend everything. First, we need 230 gram of hot water. Use the hot water to dissolve the brown sugar. There you go. I just pour the hot water for 230 gram. Okay, I have poured the hot water. Put in all the brown sugar. As I need 250 gram sugar. Stir the brown sugar until it dissolves. Then, let's brew the coffee. I need around 27 gram of coffee beans. 27 gram. I will grind the coffee to medium coarse. As today, I'm using Chemex. Okay, a little bit to 27 gram. Okay, 27 gram. Everything is freshly prepared by me. So, coffee lovers, you can feel how fresh the brewed coffee. Wet all the paper filter. There is no dust comes from the paper filter into the coffee. Get rid of any paper tastes. For the Chemex, I will add ice cubes on the bottom. So, I can feel the refreshing sensation. Even more, the weather is quite humid. Have you done ? Yeah, I've done. Quite fast. Next, put in the lemon. Put in directly all the lemon. For the ice cube, I need around 230 gram. Until it blends completely. Make sure it blends completely. They will be unhappy, if you don't blend completely. 230 gram. Next, add the coffee ground. And for... And for the water, I need around 220 gram. All has been ready ? Great ! Now, it's my turn. Pour slowly the water. With this kind of method, it produces more bright coffee. For Chemex, we usually gets more clean taste. It also has more body than other coffee maker like V60. So, we will mix the coffee with other things makes more refreshing. All I want is refreshing. To make this Ice Coffee Lemonade with using Chemex. So, we can feel the taste of the freshness sensation. Wait for a while. Want to get free coffee ? This is different, sis. I brew coffee with Chemex for around 3 minutes. Actually making coffee doesn't need any standard. Still have guideline. But, it all depends on taste. In truth, it has ratios like 1 : 15 or 1 : 17. But, it all depends on taste. Need to do some experiments as well. If you think you have reached to the target, then just keep continue. And you can do some experiments. Like this coffee, suitable to mix with other sensation or ingredients. You can get another coffee taste. There is nothing right or wrong. The most important thing is keep practicing and practicing. That's right ! It almost reaches the target. And maybe... For those, who likes coffee may wonder where is the coffee taste. Actually, I've mix-and-match the taste. The coffee sensation keep staying in the taste. In other hands, you still can feel other sensation. For example like lemon. Brown sugar. And by the way, this Rosemary is the important thing. But, I almost forgot. This is Rosemary. Rosemary is a spice. You can get this spice at any supermarket. Usually, I just used my hands. Don't worry ! My hand is clean. Usually, I add 4 pinch. One. Two. Three. Four. 4 pinch. Put all inside. Stir all together. Stir slowly for a little bit. Actually, for the Rosemary, You want to feel more the Rosemary aroma. It's okay if you soak Rosemary in water for longer. Yeah, I've done ! Okay, you've done, it's time to mix ! It's quite simple to make. With just using... With just using your favorite coffee. For more refreshing sensation, let it be first.

I let you... to pour everything. Yeah, pour everything. This is Ice Coffee Lemonade with Rosemary. Plus with longan, for more refreshing sensation. There you go. Thank you.", "Lh57E0d654g": "hello Selina from tease da Comte UNM Pierrot so this week we're going to do something a little bit different we're going to do a Q&A session we got Amy who was asking us recently about what is the flavor that we put into tea this is actually quite a frequently asked question so let's tackle it okay firstly if you're thinking about four teas like you know the strawberry patch and things like that and you're thinking that it's just a bunch of fruit to dry it up and put together you think correct now is actually flavor added to it because just the dry fruit themselves I'm not going to give you that punchy flavor after you have to alluded it many times with the water just think about you just have one teaspoon for this tea mixture put into your tea pot or your tea cup or whatever and then you pour in you know 200 mils or so of hot water you know a cups worth of water in it so you're diluting in many many many times and so in order to still give you a decent taste you do need a flavor added in most cases so that's the first thing second thing is when it comes to flavor the next question we tend to get you know a lot is is it artificial from the tea manufacturers we have talked to and some of the fruit flavoring companies that we have talked to as well they said they're artificial colors sorry artificial flavors are not actually allowed to put onto food so what is left is basically two categories of flavors that are typically put into tea and they are typically in liquid form so you spray it or you know pour it in and then you mix it well and so on so it's either natural or nature identical natural is pretty easy to understand that's basically just imagine if it's apple juice and you just contains that to this very concentrated form however most flavors are not dense enough not intense enough to actually do that so what happens is there's this many substance added on and that becomes your nature identical flavour so going back to the Apple example apple flavor ashley on his ons really light so often they add this enhancer to it to actually bump it up and there are a lot of you know sort of misconception that you know because there is this added thing so it it's it's not that healthy now I'm no scientist to bet you know I do understand that you know like a lot of the alcohol based flavors they tend not to taste all that good you know after you drink it you you just have this really funny flavor in your mouth I get that versus some of the other flavors like the ones that we have sourced we have found them actually tastes quite natural and we do actually try to source as many natural flavor as possible but going back to that example of apple flavor often it's just simply not available on its own form on its own natural form something has to help to actually enhance it to bump it up so in the world of flavoring most of the flavors are actually nature identical then you have a smaller percentage of them but as natural they tend to be a lot more expensive and then even a smaller percentage of them are organic so when you go and pick up a box of organic lemons here for example from anybody out there chances are that is actually using natural flavor not organic flavor and that is totally legal that's a crazy world we're living in I personally find this somewhat deceptive because if you pick up a box of organic lemon tea you naturally think the whole hundred percent of it is organic but what people are saying is no actually I need ninety five percent you know the other five percent may be the flavor so it's something that's not a lot of people are talking about and awful of course there is a lot of vested interests in the industry when we talk to tea supplies often they they they have the same point of view you know they say oh you know it's legally allowed you know you can put five percent of natural flavor and the organic tea and we just think that's pretty crazy stuff it's not really the you know the common sense approach to it so what we have ended up doing is we deliberately go and source organic flavors and everyone saying golly they are going to be super expensive and it is I mean they're not cheap at all but having said that you know we we feel this is really to get at a sensible way to go so if you see something like organic hazelnut cream or organic black tie and so on those we have actually sourced organic flavors and we put it on so there is this really sort of funny you know grace turned away the flavors overall you know you can certainly try using try fruits like lemon peel and citrus orange peel but with most people they tend to also add a layer of bitterness to your tea so it's not I do to put a lot in berries some of them actually got enough punch to itself like whole berry that we use a fair bit sorry I should call it yeah hole barriers it's okay not hold on berry they're different sort of Chinese haul and blueberry doesn't really work coconut itself now even actually add it's sort of like an oily film on top of your your your liquid you know once you put it so not every fruit can be just simply dry up and then just put in and if that does bother you you know these added nature identical type of things then don't use them in our product details page you will find the ingredient list and in the ingredient list if it says flavor that chances are it means that is nature identical the reason why we put it that way is simply because some of the tea that we bring in is already flavored now they said it's you know passed FDA regulations and oh it's natural but they cannot really define it for us the supply cannot really define it for us whether it is nature identical or natural so we're taking a safe bet and we're just saying its nature identical or we just simply say flavor which is legally allowed as well you don't have to put down the whole shebang of it but if it is natural flavor and chances are it's actually something that we brought in because now we know that it's definitely natural we actually write down natural favors so hopefully does it helped you to clarify some of the confusion in relation to flavors and yeah if you have any question feel free to drop us a line you know where to find us teas come to a you and if you do like this video and want to ask you a question for the next Q&A session like the video and send us your question I'll catch you next time", "k_zXVLhfFBs": "okay i don't know if i'm going to use this clip but hi guys welcome back to my channel we're starting this off in my car if you're new my name is karen if you're not me thanks for stopping by again i just got out of cycle bar it's like right over there i'm super sweaty and gross but i so i went to cycle bar this is my fourth day in a row i think i'm trying to go like four to five times a week anyway um i have gotten or made coffee every single time after like i've never gotten it out so we're gonna go get some duncan because my points are about to expire it said so come along with me to get some lovely dunkin donuts coffee and y'all i always get i mean everybody knows this i always get starbucks but i kind of wanted to get dunkin it's a hit or miss if i don't like it i'll just make coffee at home really quickly i knew this was gonna happen i'm really quickly gonna call my mom and ask her if she wants coffee um i'm sure she's already had it and that she'll say no but we'll see okay so i actually called my dad too because um i don't know i just like he always is like asks if i get him coffee and then i never do so i got my dad a medium hazelnut coffee black because he said he's gonna put creamer in it i need to get my like cup holders down and then i parked by the way because clearly and then my mom gets a small caramel coffee of cream i was gonna try to set up my camera but i was on phone with my dad literally to hang up with him in order to order whatever and then i get an iced caramel macchiato with oat milk sometimes almond milk actually 99 almond milk at this dunkin because this dunkin never has oat milk and they finally did today like they've had it they're just always out of it or whatever i think i'm gonna put both coffees in the back because my cup holders like literally suck up front like i'll show you guys my cup holders in a second i've had drinks pour out of it and spill so we're just gonna only have to take care of mine up here and then i drop both straws and i got three straws which like is kind of weird but my mom hadn't had coffee because she was at kroger she took my dog to get a haircut and i was like oh she'll be back or to go to groomers whatever you call it should have bentley jordy went yesterday and then she was like oh yeah i'm just leaving kroger now so she never got coffee so i got everybody coffee well besides my brothers but they're probably my younger brother's probably still sleeping my older brother works um let's try it it's so good ah so strong like hella strong but very good okay let me show you guys my cup holders this is how much they suck like they're just like these type of things so like when you you can put my cup holders away if that makes sense i mean i never do because i always have like a hand sanitizer in it which is right there sorry it's a mess i need to like clean it but the cup holders stuck so i had um a venti iced coffee in this one grandes like this size 16 oz doesn't usually fall out i had a venti over here once it fell out the side like this spilled everywhere over there on my way to a sorority meeting it was literally terrible so we keep it right here and i hold on to it while i make any sort of sharp turns but yeah these suck my car is a 2003 so like i mean this is what i'm left with with cup holders but i'm not gonna complain just got home from psychobar drank my coffee um stretched my new plan is to stretch every time i get back from working out just like in my living room to stay flexible i don't know i've been a dancer since i was three and i don't want to lose my flexibility so that's the plan is just to like stretch all that jazz so i just did that for a little bit i just ordered a sports bra on we made too much i'll show you guys that at some point yeah i wore this bob and weave sports bra than these navy wonder trains to cycle bar i'm going to go ahead and shower and then i have um a an assessment to do for a job application i need to do a for my marketing class just some other kind of random stuff so that's that i'm gonna go ahead and get showered because i feel kind of gross hi guys good morning i am leaving um for work this morning i um if you guys did that like what it was saying the um order online or like not order online where you mobile order the other day and then like in between like i think it's like three day period you have like a free drink to use so i'm gonna go get that free drink um sadly for some reason i don't know what it is the mobile ordering system i can't order an ice soy vanilla latte or um the brown sugar drink so i'm just getting a caramel macchiato with oat milk and um i'm getting a venti with extra ice so it's like a seven dollar drink so i mean like that's kind of worth it in my opinion um i can't decide uh whether or not to go through fort thomas because they're school like that could be like really dangerous but we're gonna go i'm glad i ordered online though because it said nine to 12 minutes so i'm hoping i can pick it up and get to work i left 10 minutes early so we'll see what we can do we're going through my town which means like we're gonna be dealing with school traffic maybe but the thing is is it's only 7 20 and they don't start till 8 so i feel like i shouldn't have much school traffic to deal with also hair is hella greasy it didn't look good in a clip that's how greasy it was my hair's in a ponytail not loving it kind of sad about it so i don't really know but i have my camera mask today i have

of than my house is if that makes sense so um like i shouldn't have to like i don't know if that makes sense yeah i'm like not talking right because i'm just struggling starbucks is closer to work it's just like closer to the highway than my house is so i'm leaving like later than i wanted to but it should be okay i'm trying to mix this together um i'm gonna turn my camera off soon though because it's good i like listening to um the radio show in the morning i don't know if that's weird like do you guys listen to like bluetooth music or the radio in the morning that's what i want to

this is really good i just mix them i've never had the oat milk one so um clearly they didn't read the extra ice things this has no ice in it kind of annoying whatever because no yeah there's not ice

clip because i can't get it curled so let me know i'm just wearing this aspen um sweatshirt it's like blue with some aligns and apls i was trying to be like cute and i was maybe gonna wear this like the diamond dye or the marble dye marble dye crew with my lines and like some air forces and then my hair looked like trash so we went with uh just this really simple fit so let's go so in front of a dark window my hair looks terrible my closet door is open one second okay i think that's as good as it's gonna get um i'm gonna show you guys a quick haul of what i got from like home goods tj maxx actually i don't think i got anything from home goods but tj maxx and target so let's do it so from target i got two strapless bras because i have two back here that i just ordered from amazon and neither of them are good enough so i got some from target we're gonna try them out probably end up returning them there's this skims one that i really want but it is still out of stock so i'm waiting for that one to come back in because i think that would probably be like the one i would enjoy the most but we'll see and then i got a mattress pad nothing exciting about that either mine's just old sciatica mattress pad to fit a clean sized bed i think i'm gonna go ahead and like clean my room tonight because it's only like eight o'clock and i'm gonna eat dinner and clean my room because it really needs it my cl my favorite claw clip broke again i think i said that and they were out of it at target and they were out of the even bigger one which would have been better because these are even smaller but it comes with a pink or tan like tortoise and black brown tortoise whatever we're gonna see if it works for like a work day and then i'll probably get the bigger one i picked up the tree hut scrub supposedly this went viral and tick tock but two of my best friends cassidy and claire um both said that they're obsessed with this and they've been obsessed since before tick tock um and the one they normally get them like something rose was out of stock but they did have the cotton candy one so i just got this they said it's like amazing to scrub like your body and stuff like your legs and everything before you self tan and as you guys know i am an avid self tanner so we're i'm excited to try this out from tj maxx i picked up some kiss lashes for dance um and then some

gold packaging because it's like the holiday but it's still champagne pop and it was at t.j.maxx because they like aren't giving out like a special edition highlighter and it's just regular champagne

our microwave like we haven't changed it but i'm going to show you guys how i make my shaken like oatmeal oat milk brown sugar espresso whatever it's called the shaken part it's completely optional sometimes i am in a rush getting ready for work don't do the shaking part and i just brew the espresso with the brown sugar and stuff put it over milk but this time i'm gonna shake it because it's a sunday morning and all i'm about to do is homework i have nowhere to rush to because i don't have work until three o'clock so let's show you how i make it so first thing is add one tablespoon of brown sugar to your cup that you're going to be brewing the um espresso in also i'm putting this in the blender bottle for a few different purposes that you guys will see add a dash of cinnamon you only need it for a little bit of the taste if you love cinnamon add more i ended up adding a lot more cinnamon as you can see and brew two shots of espresso over the brown sugar it's the best way to get it all melted and combined and then it's a tablespoon per two shots of espresso so i do like half a tablespoon obviously and then less cinnamon if i'm doing a single shot of espresso and then brew that measure out 2 3 cup of plain oat milk doesn't matter what brand but plain not sweetened or anything like that add a few ice cubes to this espresso cinnamon and um brown sugar make sure it's tight on there and [Applause] it should grow a lot pour it over ice this is what it looks like add your milk stir well maybe there we go stir some more because it's not all combined down there and enjoy this is what you're left with as you can see the top is like super super frothy not just like a normal froth and you're left with a very brown sugar cinnamony shaken oat milk espresso this is literally so good you can taste it from the top extra guns okay thank you guys so much for watching this vlog i know it's kind of a rambunctious weird vlog hope you guys enjoyed make sure to subscribe down below

under my students now too bitter for me so for this Thiago with about two cups of sugar at least in the Sierra because that was like very bitter otherwise than that the flavor of the raspberry stand

not using a ton of animal products and that's how we made these delicious tastes so I'll have the recipe link down below and anyway I hope that you guys enjoy and let's get started so the first thing that I did was I created my oven to 325 degrees and I am just going to go ahead and start buttering my pan I use the same hand in my Game of Thrones video or it's also lemon cakes it's from the pampered chef and it's like these flower designs so I think this is a good one honestly if you have movie bunch [Music] as well [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so get the light and fluffy synopsis

start off I've brewed I'm brewing three different kinds of tea a chamomile tea a black lemon tea and a fruity herbal tea to show you different colors that you can achieve from tea each of these teabags are currently seeping in one cup of previously boiling water I'm going to let these cool bit because I want to get the most color out of the teabags into the tea before I start dyeing the yarn but you can certainly use the heat from the boiling water at the beginning to start dyeing your yarn from that point it's all about personal preference so I will be back once I am done brewing my team alright it looks like my teas are ready so I am going to remove the teabags and now I need to add my acid source since we only have a cup of water or I've liquid in each of these measuring cups I'm going to add one teaspoon of white vinegar to each one well alright so here is actually over pour its write it a little more than one teaspoon of vinegar but it's not an exact science um I would like to right now I have pre soaked my yarn in just plain water and I'm gonna gently wring them out and place them in each of the dye baths now the amount of yarn it's four grams of percent wall fingering weight yarn all right make sure that these are nice and submerged looks like still of these rats means I'm actually going to well hard when wet but untwist and unwrapped them could leave them in this you know in the twisted form but the die will you can see that there's some white spot so actually can't believe I forgot to do that all right there you now we're ready okay the T's are still a little warm but it's not enough heat for the color to set so therefore I'm gonna move all of these samples to the microwave all right and I am going to microwave on HIGH until the water starts to boil so I've started with about three minutes and just when the water starts to boil then we'll stop and turn off the microwave took about six minutes to come to a boil just giving you a kink the different tea colors and now there's the chamomile whoops like that and we're now gonna wait and let these cool before removing the yarn and Washington unlike other submersion dyeing techniques we aren't going to expect the waah the dye bath to clear because there are a lot of color molecules in tea and more that seem to absorb the amount of yarn all right Mikey colors have cold and I am going to remove them from the back to wash them off and English warm water so this was the Black Sea chamomile and fruity herbal tea so you can see that there's a lot of color left back in these die back so you can use this to die more yarn or dye yarn in greater quantities than yarn in greater quantities than four grams how much I started with you and you can see we've got some very like subtle colors here but there we are does need watching with a tiny bit myself just to remove any excess color you wouldn't want anything else and the colors that you get you can also try different amounts of vinegar to see how you can vary the color but you'll get really nice subtle colors from Steve and I'll be back to show you the colors one and everything I've dried well here we go we have three different colors of yarn dyed by three different types of tea we have a pale color from camomile we have a sort of pinkish Brown from the fruity herbal and we have a brown from the Black team and just for comparison here is some undyed wool so it even so you there is some color that we got from the caramel tea even though it's very subtle and I'll move this next to the other two types so there you have it thank you for watching this tutorial on how to dye yarn with tea I am Rebecca from chemnitz and this video was brought to you by all free meaning calm", "2CNKjLmUjLQ": "thank you for selecting T forte the luxury t experience offered by premier properties around the world by choosing t forte you have added another integral strand to the memorable interactions and service that is the tapestry of the all-important guest experience in this brief informative presentation we'll provide you with some T basics so you can respond to your guests interest in tea with T's increasing popularity your guests are becoming increasingly sophisticated tea drinkers so it is important to have basic tea knowledge about the cultivation and brewing of tea its flavours benefits and the cultural lore surrounding this 5,000 year old brew the tea category is hip hot and healthy hip with skyrocketing sales among consumers of all ages tea has become the hip and trendy new beverage hot tea is one of the fastest-growing beverage categories in America healthy tea has even more beneficial properties than previously reported with health benefits ranging from helping protect the body from many diseases to preventing premature aging scientists are finding the mass media a conduit for their steady stream of research on teas health benefits confirming folk beliefs dating back to the legendary moment when errant leaves of a nearby camellia sinensis bush colored Chinese emperors shenlong's pot of boiling water in 2737 BC and the world's most consumed drink after water was accidentally discovered so let's start with a basic tea knowledge if you can remember just one thing this is one of the most important facts all true tea types black blue long green or white originated from a single plant the camellia sinensis plant what determines the difference between the types of teas is the way that it is manufactured now I use the term manufactured very lightly as it is important to know that the tea's selected by tea Forte represent the top 1% of all production and represent artisanal handcrafted T so this processing used for our tea is really a handcrafted art oxidation is the process that differentiates the t's think of when you cut an apple and you leave it out it turns brown this is the oxidation process this is used with the tea leaves to help develop the variety of flavors so the difference between white to black is the degree of oxidation with white being the least oxidized and black teas being the most keep this fact in mind when we talk steeping times and water temperature the white teas are closest to the raw leaf as they are just air dried while the black teas are rolled and broken to expose more enzymes to the air to fully oxidized the leaf drying and/or firing stop the oxidation process as in wines toois determines the difference in character climate soil altitude all play a part in determining the character of a leaf and it changes from flush or harvest to flush ervil's are technically not tea they are often called tisanes which comes from french herbals are a blend of herbs spices fruits and flowers and since they do not contain the camellia sinensis tea leaf they are not truly teas all herbals are naturally caffeine free the caffeine is imparted by the tea leaf so if a guest is looking for a decaffeinated option herbals are a good choice you will hear a lot these days about leaf tea and the difference between leaf teas and teas in a traditional paper teabag to brew in a paper teabag the tea leaf has to be cut to facilitate steeping leaf teas were traditionally only available in loose service but with the advent of new open weave materials these high-quality teas are available in infusers this has made it easier to enjoy the highest quality teas as leaf teas retaining the highest levels of essential oils and brew the most nuanced beverage a few key bits of information that are important for you to know an easy rule of thumb is that caffeine content is related to the leaf that you are steeping the temperature of the water the higher the temperature the more caffeine extracted the length of time that you steep the tea the longer the more caffeine in general use steep black teas at a higher water temperature for a longer time and as a result it has more caffeine with regard to health benefits tea is an amazing beverage I would encourage you to visit tea usa.com for in-depth reports on the latest research but by way of top-line tea is very rich in antioxidants these are the molecules that tie up the bad free radicals

enjoyed a fantastic meal decadent dessert and lingering over their coffee and tea Forte a grand finale to a wonderful evening and as we all know guest satisfaction leads to exceptional tips everyone benefits in Imperial China it was believed that quality tea could only be made with water sourced from where the tea bushes grew because the minerals in the water complemented the taste and character of the tea Emperor's commanded water carriers to transport water from pools and springs and tea growing regions and decreed that tea be brewed only with water drawn from these sources and fires made with wood cut from the same area rest easy the perfect cup of tea is not that demanding the key ingredients to an extraordinary cup of tea are water purity water temperature and steep times many of these components are out of your control and we understand that ideally you want to be sure to pre-heat your vessel pour a bit of hot water into the vessel swirl it around and pour it out then unwrap your tea infuser and place it in the vessel pour the water over the T as the agitation of the water over the tea infuser releases the essential oils and flavor cover the cup or tea pot and be sure to thread the signature t forte leaf through the hole in the lid if you're using our accessories be sure to present immediately to the table as steep time is critical to an enjoyable beverage Steve time varies by blend please note the details on your screen your white and green teas are closest to the vegetal state and as such you need to make sure that you don't cook them by over steeping which can cause them to be bitter if a guest says their green tea tastes bad it is because it is over steeped herbal teas are your most tolerant and never over steep the longer they steep the more flavorful they become in terms of what goes with what many guests enjoy milk and sugar or lemon with their black tea remember never lemon and milk together as it will cause the milk to curdle with green white and herbal teas you do not want milk or cream let's review a few of the accessories that complement the experience this is the presentation tray there are six rows of four infusers a total of 24 this

person for that brenda bauer so i believe you haven't won before so that's good so those are for those two people and as you know each week i have my project sheets live on my blog at stamping gala dot-com so you can print these off for your convenience and it has all the sizes that we're going to use today the dimensions and also the products so you can go ahead and print this off now or you can wait till after the video is done and you can have those for your records when you recreate these projects alright so the first thing we're gonna make today is this birthday card and again it's done with the lemon zest so we're going to bring in the products a couple of the things I did offline to save some time so this first piece we're gonna have to score so let me bring in my scoreboard and we're just gonna score this at five and a half so this is 11 inch sheet of cardstock by four and a quarter people sometimes ask me why I choose to have my card open this way and what I like about it as opposed to the five and a half by eight and a half way is it stands up better for you when you're when you have it on display so that's why you do that all right so we're gonna bring in the lemon lime twist and off line I took this piece of whisper white paper and I use the scattered sequins embossing folder and embossed it for you first so if this is a product that you like I have a feeling that this embossing folder is gonna be discontinued so is something that you like you probably want to get it soon also on Monday the night Stampin Up is going to release the discontinued list so you might want to check my blog for that if there's anything you like on those discontinued products again you want to get those right away too because once they're gone they're gone okay so I'm snelling a piece of the tutti-frutti designer series paper here at the bottom and I'm making certain that the border is all the same and then I'm going to add a piece of the tutti-frutti in the lemon-lime Shack right in the center to pull this together also if you like these products you want to make sure that you place an order by Monday the night because Tuesday when I get up I cut all the products and I send them off to you you get all three making takes for a minimum $30 order on my online store and again you can catch that at Stampin gala com using this inbox or this hostess code okay we're putting this on the card all right if you notice I have some of the silver Baker's twine behind the lemons and the lines so I'm gonna take that and all I did was I put a little bit of snail on here on the card and I'm just gonna wrap this around my hand a little bit not too much and I'm just gonna place it on here and it doesn't have to be perfect in fact you don't want it perfect just kind of like that now keep in mind that each time it'll be slightly different all right we're gonna do some stamping now we're going to bring in the lemon stamp this and I'm using daffodil delight and we're gonna punch it punch it out and I might need to cut it down a little bit to get it in the punch properly yep this is a what they call a builder punch which means that it has the leaves on there as well so you build the final image or project alright so we're also gonna stamp the lime and we're using the lemon lime twist for that another piece of scratch paper and this one is punched out with the one and three-quarter inch punch circle punch just like that and then lastly we need a couple of the leaves I'm doing this one by one because how the punch is set up what will happen if I don't do it one by one I can punch stamp the image and it punch overtop of the other things it makes a mess also so we have almost all the pieces now we need the other leaf one last punch and we're almost done here okay I did for the other projects I did punch them off line stamp and punch them off line okay so we're just going to put this together now I'm going to add some dimensionals to the back of the line just put this about right here and then of course some dimensionals behind the lemon and you want to put them just on the one side otherwise it won't fit your card correctly because it'll be kind of lopsided the lime is already up on dimensional so you just want it to the to the left okay so we have that and we want to be able to slide happy birthday under there as well now we're going to put the one with the stem on here with just snail and then finally I like to put the next one up on dimensionals I've had lots of requests for a bow clasp so I may be doing that shortly with online teaching you how to make a bow now I'm just gonna show you real quickly I just put the ribbon across my two fingers and wrap around on the bottom I go through the top and through the center bring it back through and I'm gonna go right under this one loop and pull it tightly now if you notice my other thumb and finger did not move it off so I'm just going to pull this tight and then take it off my fingers there you go and just trim it we're gonna attach this with a glue dot right here okay we're also gonna add a couple of the sequins so one here and if you notice these are like the lemon-lime but they also have in the same past we have yellow two which I'm going to add a yellow it also has pull party looks like very burst and also pumpkin pie okay so those are done now we're gonna just stamp the happy birthday to put on there and here's the strip and I'm gonna stamp it in lemon or yeah lemon line okay hopefully I'll get it straight this is gonna slide right under there so I'm going to need to trim it some and the dimensional is just going to go on the end and we're gonna put snail on the other cart because it's already lifted on that side cause it's gonna slide right in here pull it out some okay all right so we have that done now we're gonna do the inside let me show you what the inside looks like so I already used the this stamp with lemon limes so I want to clean it off because I'm going to use the lemon this member the the daffodil delight this time alright and I stamped off twice so let me show you I'm gonna bring in this piece of whisper white cardstock Inc this up and stamp off twice and I'm gonna stamp this right in the middle okay so it's very light then what did I do with my stamps action let me come back to that we're gonna put the other pieces on a semi states that I'm gonna put this right across here and also we have a piece of the designer series paper we're gonna put this across as well just for a little bit of trim okay and trim off the ends remember to place your orders by Monday and you'll get these items these three make and takes in the mail okay so I do need to stamp these let me see what it says live it was zest so I'm gonna take this up here use this black and this one we're gonna stamp right on top with a daffodil delight here and the lemon lime twist and I'm just going to Center it right over that come out perfectly so we're gonna add this to a piece of lemon lime twist all right now what I like to do is add some Baker's twine on the inside I like Baker's twine because it doesn't add a lot of bulk to the inside of the card so just tie this in a knot now if you would like to see a video on bow tying just leave me a message let me see some of your message messages here also Stampin Up is coming out with their new catalog very soon we get to see it on April 9th the demonstrators so if you are not a demonstrator and if you're not currently working with a demonstrator I'd love to send you a catalog if you think that you're interested in doing business with me in the future I would like to earn your business and I'll send you a catalog for free okay so we're gonna snail this down and here is your first card first project okay I hope you like this card so we're gonna move on to the next project now the next project we're going to make is this little box right here got it tied up and I am gonna make a couple of changes to it so I'll show you as we go along let me see if there's any messages I have to look at I see a lot of people are interested in a bow tie in class so I will do that not on a Thursday but maybe some other time within the next week I'll put together a small boat in class so we're gonna go ahead and make this project so I need my score in okay and we're going to start off with a piece of eight and a half by eight and a half so what we're gonna do is we're gonna score this at two four six and eight and it doesn't matter what side you start on because it's a perfect square we're gonna turn this sideways and we're gonna score it at 2 okay while we have this out I'm going to bring in this piece of designer series paper and this is five and an eight by five and and eight we're gonna score this at one and a half on all four sides and then we'll be done with the scoring on this project by the way if you're wondering what's in this box I'll show you in just a second it has Crystal Light six things a Crystal Light in them so what we're gonna do is fold on all score lines don't forget this score line okay and what we're gonna do is cut this little rectangle out but we're gonna also put an angle on it here alright so we're also gonna cut up on all these these three score lines all the way up to the cross score line which is this way these boxes are really easy to do you want to take your tear intake and cut some of this off all right I like to put it on my wrist I can control it a little bit better what you're gonna do is put it on this little fold line right here close to the score line but don't go over it as you can see right here see it's folded over so what you're gonna do is just take this off now and fold this in half and fold that over top and it's perfectly matched now this is going to be the back with a fold - so what you're going to do is fold the sides in first and what I like to do is I'm doing that is put a little bit of glue on there and fold that down and since this is the back you want the back to going first and the front last so we're going to let me see that okay so the back this one's gonna go I'm gonna put some more glue on here fold that one in and then finally the front so there's your box bottom all right now what we're gonna do is bring in the top you're gonna fold on all score lines this is so simple to put together for those of you that do craft shows this would be a very easy item to make for craft shows all right so what we're gonna do is bring the scissors in and cut on the score line both sides right up to the fold and then you're gonna angle this off you did the same thing right on the other side up to the score line and then cut it on an angle all right we're gonna put some glue in here and I just use Tambo gonna fold that in meet it at the corner you do have to hold it for a second same thing so you're gonna do this on all the corners one of my readers on Facebook is it's her birthday today her name is Julie Thompson so happy birthday Julie I hope you have a good day today we're gonna hold this one as well and finally the last one and glue in there all right so this is gonna go right on top just like that okay all right if you notice I have two lemons but I'm gonna change it to a lemon and a lime so all projects will have a lemon and a lime okay so I do need to bring my big shot in again [Music] and we use piece of lemon lime and a piece of whisper white whisper white I'm going to use the stitch framelits the second largest and then we're going to use the scallop circle from the layering circle dies and run these through okay I'm just going to smell these two together and I have to get a punch this is a handheld punch so I'm just going to punch a little hole in here I can hardly see it so I know my I need a little bit bigger so before I put the other pieces together on here I'm going to run this right through here you need to cut this off a little bit I'm getting it frayed just a second if you have a hard time threading needles you can get some of these from your dentist or the drugstore and they work great you can just push this through here and also put this in here you can get it and then just pull it through and it threads it for you just gonna leave this up like that okay so now we're going to add this sign here so we're just gonna add the the line first put this sign here I stamped this off line and then we're going to add the lemon with dimensionals I feel like I'm all thumbs today with these and again we're gonna add the leaves the first one's going down with just snail and the second one is going to have a dimensional I think I like this better than the two lemons okay so next I'm going to take some more Baker's twine and I'm just going to double it over and I'm going to tie a bow with Baker's twine what you want to do is hold it tightly so it doesn't twist on you a lot of times it'll twist if you don't hold it really tightly and then I just cut all of that off and we're gonna add the Sun with glue got my scissors and add it okay just like that alright so now we're gonna bring the ribbon end this ribbon is really pretty it's our mini striped ribbon and we're gonna do is just make a bow with this I'm going to tie the tight across the box and then we'll add the tag you always want to get the knot really tight it makes the bow look prettier because it makes the little loops more puffy and cut these on an angle always okay so now we're going to take this and we're going to add it to the ribbon here and I'm just sliding it under we're going to tie it in a knot and then if you want you can add a dimensional or a glue dot so it stays in place it's up to you but don't tie it all the way up because then it looks kind of funny just too close okay so I'm going to trim off the excess baker's twine and here's the second project here's the difference between the two lemons and lemon and a line so I end to like this one better but anyway inside here I have these Crystal Light lemon ice tea and there's looks like six of them in a pack it comes in a plastic container but I wanted to make a box for it so I'm going to move this out of the way so there's your second project so now we're going to move on to the third and this will be the third project okay you just clean this up a little bit and we'll move on and i do want to close some of these because they'll dry up and let me look at some of the the messages here we have a lot of people watching tonight I see somebody said they don't know where to find the Downloads what you want to do is go to stamping gala calm and you'll find them there it actually says project sheets and you just click on them and you can print them off right there okay so what we're gonna do to make this what it requires this is from our lats to love from what dice that's to love back streamlet dice comes with 10 dice to make this box so you do need to cut two of these box sides of the boxes out okay and what I did here is after I cut the two boxes out and before I put them together I cut a hole in the front one and I'll show you how I did that as well so let me bring the Big Shot in I did cut one off line so you don't have to watch that twice you're gonna put this on here and of course I'm using daffodil delight I'll cut this out I got to keep this close by because we're going to use it again in a second okay just pop this off of here great I didn't get it all the way I'm gonna run it back through again you should be good to go let me make sure I don't know white didn't cut all the way through there did it that time okay maybe I had it off a little bit and didn't know it okay so what you're gonna do is we're gonna take this and we're going to snail a piece of the tutti-frutti designer series paper right on the front it has to be I like to put it on there first before I cut it out okay I'm going to Center it between let me show you here there's two score lines here and here and you want it centered in between there so we'll put this down that looks good right there okay so what we're gonna do is bring the Big Shot back in we're gonna use this die lay it that on there I try to use a punch but it just it's very difficult and it cuts the side of the box here and it just doesn't look as attractive so bring this back in put this right in the center a little bit lower Center from top to bottom but from this way you want to have it a little bit towards the bottom oh and this Way's the bottom actually all right so we'll put this on here and it's just gonna cut the circle out usually what I do is I always pop this over and make sure it is indeed cut out and it was so we're done with the Big Shot for tonight and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a piece of our fit is this is called our fabulous foil acetate designer series paper there's three different designs one side is gold and one side is silver it does come with a piece it's like protected with this clear plastic coating and you just have to take that off before you use it okay so I'm just gonna put a little bit of snail on here and I want the silver side showing so when you're putting this down you want to see the gold so I'm putting that down and then it creates the window okay so now this is going to be the front of the box so we want to make sure that we score and these score lines okay and since this is going to be the front of the box we want to add this sticky strip right in there or taran tape okay put this on here I like this Taran tape because you can just rip it with your fingers and the kind we had before with the red sticky stuff over at the cover it would always stick to you and I couldn't stand that okay we're gonna bring the other one in and fold on the fold lines I made some really cute boxes with this at Valentine's Day as well and for my crap ladies if your local to the Canton Michigan area I do classes every Saturday morning and I have clubs all the time as well so what we're gonna do if you're interested in in joining any of those just send me a message and I'll be happy to give you the information okay so I'm taking off this the tops of the the tearing tape just like that no it's gonna go the flaps are gonna go the opposite way so what I did was I laid this down and I want to follow that line right there you don't want to go over that line so just like that and then you're just gonna bring this over and connect these two sides so it'll go right there all the way down okay so this becomes the bottom okay and then this part is the top just hose this in all right and then all we have to do is decorate it so I'm gonna take the the line I'm gonna put this right here and then again the lemon is going to go on dimensionals and if you want to put candy in here what I did was I just took some a plastic treat bag that I had you probably have treat bags laying around or you can just use a baggie and put that in there and put fill the candy in that I don't like to have the candy just open you're going to add the leave and this one I'll find dimensionals just like that okay we're gonna add a bow so again we're gonna take this ribbon across the two fingers here wrap it around and come across the bottom and I cut it off about six inches from my pinky okay again we're gonna go up through there and back in the center in the front and then this loop right here I'm gonna go up and over and out just like that okay pull it tight and then trim off the edges the ends we're gonna add a glue dot and all you have to do is add the candy these make great favors for weddings or showers anything like that and you just decorate them appropriately okay so we're gonna bring back in some of the sequins and I like to use both the lemon and the line put one here okay so here are your three projects and you can see here you can see the lemon heads in there let me bring in this and also the card

I hope you enjoyed these products and make it a great night bye bye", "zPzckfr8rzc": "hello and welcome to my channel today I will be showing you guys how to make a detoxifying water it's refreshing it Detox's as well and it's really really healthy like for those of you that don't like to drink plain water just to replenish your day it's really really refreshing so I have this - half of gallon yeah it should be half of gallon because with one gallon I filled up two of these Hera's so I'm gonna be filling up those two with a gallon of water I'm gonna be making two types of teas the first one's gonna be its the lip 10 100% natural America's favourite team and it's this one right here doesn't really focus it so I'm gonna be making black tea with slices of orange and you know you can also add honey instead of sugar you could add honey for like energy and stuff like that but me I'm not a sweet person so I don't put no honey and no sugar and the other one I'm going to be showing you is the green tea and this green tea is from Costco it's the Kirkland brand of course this one comes with a little bit of matcha it's green tea with matcha and it looks like this and I love the little stalks the little baggies because they're a little bit different than the Lipton so you don't have no flakes in the water I'm gonna start off with if you're not yet subscribed make sure to do so hit that thumbs up button and hit that Bell notification so you get notified every time we post a new video so I'm gonna get go ahead and get started like I said half of this gallon is gonna go on the first one I'm gonna add half a gallon to the first one and then the other half is going to go on the second one and these two pictures or how would you call them picture both these two pictures I did purchase them at Costco and this was a while back I don't know that you'll have them I don't think so cuz I haven't seen them in the warehouse anymore it's been out quite some time now it's been a few years so okay I put that whole gallon in these two pictures I had already cut up some cucumber for the first one for the green tea one I'm gonna add a cucumber and some mint leaves we have some mint leaves in my backyard and my little garden guys and then I'm gonna add little slices of green lime and they look like this it's almost gonna look like the cucumbers in there but instead it's green lime and like I said you can add honey if you like it sweet this is huh what I'm gonna do it for the little baggies of cheese instead of putting them all in there I do lock them with the cap and I'm gonna show you how look at the little socks they're really really nice because if they're different I don't know you could see them the no flakes wont roam around they stay in the little baggie okay that's one I put four bags in each half gallon right here that I have in front of me so this is how many to the green tea with matcha added a little bit of lime a little bit of cucumber and some mint leaves for little packs of green tea okay I already have the four here so what I'm gonna do I always tie them into a little knot so they won't roam around and then I'm gonna lock them with the cap this is how I do it a little string there so I'm gonna go ahead and make a little knot here so they stick all together that's how it looks with the little knot so then I'm gonna put it inside the teeth and I'm gonna close it with this top right here it's gonna look like this and the little strings are still out here so the tea bags are not gonna be in there roaming around they're just gonna actually do the job I'm gonna mix it and the water is gonna turn green it already has all the ingredients in there which is the cucumber the four bags of green tea with matcha the mint leaves and some green line so this is how it's gonna transition and it's gonna look green and of course you can add you know stevia or honey if you don't like it playing but for me I like it playing specially with the Maine cucumber in line it's really really refreshing especially with you know summer coming up and all that I don't bite soda if I haven't bought sodas for over ten years now I know but of course you know if we go to a restaurant and if we have like a birthday party and so on we do bites of it as then but like girls should shopping buying sodas and stuff strength no I don't do it even Ashland drinks the plain water I haven't bought any Crystal Light anymore I do buy the bigger packet and I add them into a big gallon and I make my kids Crystal Light the lemonade and that's you know zero calories zero sugar is zero everything so that's what they drink if not you know I always have water and stuff and that's what we normally drink I also buy sparkling water just so you know think it's odor whatever the case is and that one I do mix it with me relax when I drink the sparkling water okay so this is how T number one looks this is the green tea now I have the other picture here this one's gonna be black tea and again that one I'm gonna go ahead and put some orange slices in there that way it gives it like the Ong flavor and it's black tea and it's also pretty healthy this one is the left hand brand I also buy it at Cosmo I'm gonna go ahead and add the slices of orange in there and I'm going to open the little baggies of tea I'm gonna add four baggies in the jar which is a little picture right here and it's half a gallon in there and that does the job okay and again like you guys on the first one I like to tie the four little bitty babies together I tie them into a knot this is how I live it keeps them together so I'm gonna remove this cap right here that way they stay in place and I'm gonna lock it with the cap this one's also nice and ready and this is considered the black tea black Lipton tea and I added some slices of orange and you're gonna see it transition it's gonna change pollen here in this one's consider the black with Tim tea with the slices of orange I'm Ina flip it because I think it has a leak yeah and I keep on my refrigerator I've been doing this for a week now I usually do it around this time you know to detox and refreshing the body it's really refreshing like when you drink it and right now that's starting to get hot and you know the kids are even drinking it they're like move it's that good did they have mirror that's because I put me relax on my sparkling water I'm like no whatever's on the refrigerator it doesn't have me relax this is how it turned out guys it's black Lipton tea with slices of oranges and again you can add stevia or any you know sugar of your choice or honey honey would be a healthier choice but you know if they want to add a little bit of sugar whatever the case is they do it in their own cup because I like it like this and these are my two teas right here I hope you guys enjoy how I make my tea I just wanted to show you guys what I drink throughout the whole day to keep me going with fresh and healthy you know it's good to detox the body green tea black tea all sorts of teas give you energy I mean it's refreshing it's pretty good so whenever like we right now I make them over and over and over I do buy the boxes at Costco so I have a ton of the black tea and I have a ton of the Green Team I hope you guys like the video if you're not yet subscribed make sure to do so and I will be back with more informational videos a different type of videos look down in my description below and that tells you a little bit about us", "kYYbujRPuDA": "trav that over here on the counter it's me venom venom I have now infected this brisk iced tea to become the symbiotic dark cherry limeade we are venom you and the iced tea or now venom we are venom your venom no we are phantom inside the iced tea no we are venom don't you see the hashtag we you should try this drink I mean you should try us so you want me to review a drink that has a symbiotic alien inside of it and it also somehow changed the promotion on the cover of the drink the advertising now has venom on it promoting the movie and also it has an actual alien inside of it which is not actually a movie it's actually real oh just do it for the views do we have a deal okay what is up guys I'm backing into truck something else for you that's really weird okay so yeah this is the brisk iced tea symbiotic dark cherry guys check that out and it's promoting venom which is in theaters now let me know in the comments what you thought about the movie and also check out my venom movie reveal go ahead and plug that cuz I can and it's my channel I can do whatever I want with my videos because I need to sleep I'm very curious about this it's literally named something else because the venom being out and I really like the advertising I like venom on it it looks really nice this is actually a really cool poster idea for the movie instead of that weird Tom Hardy and venom slash thing that's obviously very photoshopped it looks disgusting not in a good way but this if they would have just had like a black something like just black there's nothing on the left and then I'm space on the right for the poster that'd be a better idea so yeah brisk iced tea being brisk they don't get along well I'm just gonna be honest I really don't like brisk I've tried a couple I think like maybe two flavors and I've never reviewed one but I've tried them in the past off-camera and I just didn't it's just not for me I don't know where it is so you go guys it's about as dark as it looks in the bottle but I want to go ahead and pour it in a glass just to get that extra measure check on it looks pretty good looks like tea but just a little redder a lot darker let's get into a symbiotic dark cherry limeade from brisk maybe this is the one maybe I can actually like a brisk there we go [Music] how much sugar does this thing have 16 grams that's the problem needs more sugar um because I'm not really getting I'm getting the dark cherry taste but it's really really subtle and it's it's dark yes it's very kind of heavy kind of the same sensation I get from like Mountain Dew Black Label except Mountain Dew black levels a lot better obviously no lost sugar but a very subtle taste but I'm getting that kind of like tea flavor that hits right away and it's kind of like bland it's just kind of there and not a lot of flavor going on no the more I taste it though the better against it's one of those drinks that kind of has to build I guess cuz it's really not that bad it's just that first taste is like no flavor but I guess it just has to sit for a second the dark cherry kind of comes to the surface becomes more like lighter the more flavor you get cuz the darkness and the heaviness like really threw me off at first I didn't know you know it has just had almost no flavor and then it just kind of builds but yeah I can definitely tell that this is a dark dark cherry drink it has a cherry flavor but a little heavier like more cherries I guess I don't know if that made that doesn't make sense at all but it's like more cherries ended in the flavor to make it like more bold and more like heavy my maids kind of coming in the line mate taste is kind of an aftertaste to it it's not like a sprite or whatever where it's like really really right there but the limeade is kind of late like I said brisk I've never been a fan but this is honestly my favorite so far I mean it's pretty good especially when he left the flavor build what I give it again you know what maybe just because this bottle this 2-liter was adult middle of their aisles like in the walkway section if you know Walmart that middle section before you can enter the aisles there are the dark symbiotic dark cherry brisk sitting there and I was thinking man that's that's a good promotional move for the movie and yeah and it's brisk and people bribe brisk and brisk is cheap so there you go fit him does it taste like it's got a symbiont inside of it I don't know I've never tasted a same bag what mine running around is them sometimes you know let me take over just a few times don't kill anybody but take over a few times I'd like to jump across buildings and stuff everyone I would definitely use the symbiont suit for good so from me and venom I think I would give it about a 7 out of 10 it's for me it's better than average I would still get it again that kind of brought it up a little bit but it's not like the best thing in the room but it's also not bad I've tasted worse tea but definitely go try it for yourself don't take my word for it I think people would really enjoy this especially the brisk fans it's a very you know subtle and very like mild like very very light taste and I don't know how to really explain that it's not like this huge explosion of flavor and I think that comes from the tea part tea is always kind of a soul type of drink with not a lot of flavor unless you add more to it what I like to taste this with maybe some more sugar yeah but that's just my kind of taste but what do you think about it have you tried it and let me know in the comments if you haven't think it goes so i swatched watch it till he's capable meteor trap drives people like share subscribe and all that people stuff guys hit that notification bell if you're new I just spit everywhere hit the notification bell if you're new and that's really subscribe you always saving me in the next review tried out and peace out", "dStIzaqyWSg": "[Music] most of gratitude in dopey trip today we are in Berlin and we are here at happy barista and became too happy baristas because they do something called nitro coffee and want to actually explore what is it and how it's made yes so here at happy baristas we are going to meet two owners Marianne and Roland were one of the pioneers of nitro coffee in whole Europe there was almost nothing so they had to figure out themselves and that's the reason why we came here to ask them what is it and how is it made [Music] and we came actually here because we want to know little bit more about the Nitro coffee it's something people heard about something that maybe people try but what is actually nitro coffee for the people who have no idea what is natural coffee simply put I think we do cold brew coffee which is charged with nitrogen and served on a tap like a beer so the nitrogen it gives the drink really this creamy creamy mouthfeel and gives it a really white foamy head like a skinner sphere and it doesn't really affect the taste itself but it affects the way you perceive the tape so it kind of likes a little trick on your on your mind and that's why it's very important what what copies do we choose for for the nitrogen's because we always have to then paste it as a final product after it's being pumped with the nitrogen and see how it actually really tastes like I think when we first met and started talking about let's make a cafe together we were looking for a specific thing that could set us apart and at that time no one was doing natural coffee in Berlin or I think neither in Europe brilliant and we've seen this trend in say and we just said okay let's let's figure this out I think it was also if you remember one of the reasons why we wanted to deny for coffee is to give the effect of offer coffee with with milk but without having the milk in it hmm to teach people that are drinking a milk coffee that you can actually drink a black coffee but also get the texture and the sweetness that they would get out of a milk coffee I think it's a very nice way to bring to bring black coffees to people yeah it's really like we are drinking coffee can make the milk to even likely Spitzer its violence so if I would have an espresso filter coffee and the nitro coffee next to each other how you know what are the differences um for me like the espresso is the the thing that you just really need to sip quickly and you're you're good to go the filter for me that for someone who has time and wants to slow down and enjoy the vibe the atmosphere the coffee itself and the Nitro is I don't know I never really thought about it for natural Institute it's a great summer trip really I think if I can had one way of looking at the differences press Oh filter or a nitro maybe you could tie it into alcoholic drinks so expresso a shot a filter maybe a wine because you want to be tasting the different filters that you have and a nitrile a beer now I would like to ask you about actually the step I think the first is the the coffee itself choosing the right coffee of course then of course next step the recipe like the cocoa recipe how long what are the ratios do we want to have it strong do we want to have it on the lighter side so figuring out all of this and once we have the recipe then the technical side of introducing the gas that's that I think that like the one of the most important parts to figure it out the time the pressure and yeah even what kind of a guess even though we're talking about nitros we had a bit of a do you do just pure nitrogen or do you do a gas mix so that was also yeah very importance of the ground in the end the whole situation with kegs of course finding our right eggs how do you kick that how do you clean sanitized those things how do you make it all hygiene space what the was the longevity of the product the the good thing about nitrogen is that when you get all the air out and you just have nitrogen it feels the product so it doesn't oxidize and it doesn't go off or at least for a certain period of time of course if you have a coffee in it it lasts for a couple of weeks the benefits the benefit of having a nitro on tap nitro brews on tap will be ease of ease of service you literally the barista literally just needs to pull the tap down and this drink is finished you can serve this drink obviously the preparation and the production is is another story but that we do after that's not something that the reader will do while the customer is waiting nitro brews are also very profitable strength I think this is important in this time in the coffee industry where where our margins are under pressure so you're talking about big batches so you're getting you're getting good economies of scale as well when you when you when you're talking about larger batches of coffee and tea so really for the summer and I prob'ly is a fantastic thing for a coffee shop to yourself and also in terms of we're talking about the coffee shop environment space it saves a lot of space because we don't need bottle in fridges so you only have the tabs on top of your counter and that's it so there's a lot of things like saving on space saving on space and working environment as well you don't have to you don't have to have these big trucks that are delivering your bottle actually one of the one of the biggest things why I completely forgotten why we wanted to do this it's because I hate I hate getting deliveries every single week of like the trades of bottled drinks and then you always need to have the phrase with empty bottles stored somewhere for them to pick it up they take so much space and they they always come in the worst time of the day when you're completely busy at the lunch are like we came to pick up the bottle and like that's not so there's one actually one of the biggest reasons why we didn't wanna do I think nitro coffee has a potential to teach people that do not know about coffee that they're so much more that you can do them with Hawking no I think having taps in coffee shop and serving drinks from attack I think that is one of the ways for coffee shop support in future because it really it just has so many advantages and nitros like we said we will cover that night Rafi and and we're pushing it today went further with the nitro beers with coffee and lemonade so there's a lot of options there that people probably then looking to and start experimenting more that is taking coffee as an ingredient start looking for other ways in our industry that like the coffee shop can go so we hope that now you understand way better with the nitro coffee is if you want to try just to buy here in heavy barista Berlin and if you liked the video message about like button subscribe and we will see you in the next video thank you very much for

healthy cold drinks for hot days?\nYou can ask any questions about ottoman\u00a0\u00a0 sherbet and please do not forget\u00a0\nto support it by liking the video.\u00a0 this will be a yellow drink to be made, you can\u00a0\nchoose the fruits according to the color you want.\u00a0 Lemon, granulated sugar, and ice water\u00a0\nshould always be the main ingredient.\u00a0 The materials to be used in this\u00a0\nvideo will be a thick-skinned lemon\u00a0\u00a0 and a separate type of lemon with a thin\u00a0\npeel will be used with plenty of water.\u00a0 6 lemons in total\n6 juicy oranges for squeezing\u00a0 5 red non-sour apples\n1 carrot\u00a0 7 liters of water in total, must be ice water\u00a0 I will use 500 grams of granulated sugar\u00a0\nand the last 2 sugars known as atomic tea.\u00a0 A characteristic of Ottoman sherbet is\u00a0\nthat it contains a variety of spices.\u00a0 ginger powder\nblack seed\u00a0 powder turmeric\ndry mint\u00a0 filter cloth to serve as a strainer and filter\norange squeezer\u00a0 stone mortar\nfine-eyed grater First of all, cool the fruit in the fridge,\u00a0\nthis is important, the fruits must be cold and\u00a0\u00a0 wash the fruits thoroughly with cold water.\nto be clean, you can wash it in two layers\u00a0 lemons with thick rind and\u00a0\ngrate their peels finely,\u00a0\u00a0 grate only the yellow parts, the\u00a0\nwhite parts have a peel bitterness\u00a0 It is important to use the yellow part of\u00a0\nthe peel to give the sorbet a yellow color.\u00a0 grate the orange peels in the same way\u00a0 Add sugar into the grated ingredients\u00a0 Grind the spices in a stone grinder to a powder\u00a0 By crushing the spices in this way,\u00a0\nyou get their aroma to come out.\u00a0 For information, add a few drops of oil\u00a0\nto extract the aroma of powdered turmeric.\u00a0 The taste of ginger is very good,\u00a0\nturmeric will give yellow color,\u00a0\u00a0 black cumin is very healthy,\u00a0\nand mint will give freshness.\u00a0 Mash and knead the ingredients\u00a0\nthoroughly with your hands.\u00a0 At this stage, you can add 1 liter of ice water.\u00a0 I always say it must be cold, thanks to the\u00a0\ncold, the bitter taste of the lemon peels\u00a0\u00a0 cannot penetrate into the drink.\nchop the lemons as you see them\u00a0 Break the lemons' fibers by squeezing\u00a0\nand crushing them with your hand\u00a0 You can cut oranges in the same\u00a0\nway or squeeze and add the juice.\u00a0 Add the carrots and apples\u00a0\nto the blender and mash well\u00a0 add crushed carrots and apples and mix\u00a0 strain the juice into a large deep bowl\nthe filtering process will not take such\u00a0\u00a0 a short time, watch carefully, repeat\u00a0\noperations will be done several times. After straining the juice, add ice\u00a0\nwater to the peels again and mix\u00a0 After filtering the juice again add ice\u00a0\nwater a third time and mix and strain again\u00a0 fourth time add ice water, mix and strain\nAs long as the yellow color comes out,\u00a0\u00a0 you can repeat this process 5 times, add 1 liter\u00a0\nof water and strain, then repeat the same process.\u00a0 If you are going to consume all of them in\u00a0\n1 day, the sherbet can be drunk this way.\u00a0 The lemon fibers in it cause the\u00a0\nsherbet to become bitter after a day.\u00a0 Therefore, if you want to keep it in the fridge\u00a0\nfor up to 1 week, you must filter the sherbet.\u00a0 You can use this tightly woven white\u00a0\ncloth called pouch as a filter.\u00a0 Fill the juice well and tie the mouth with a rope,\u00a0\nsqueeze it with your hand and filter the juice\u00a0 You can add sugar by controlling the taste,\u00a0\nobviously very little sugar was used here.\u00a0 500 - 600 grams of sugar was used and a\u00a0\ntotal of 9 liters of sherbet was obtained.\u00a0 There are Ottoman sherbets of all colors,\u00a0\nred colored sherbets are generally famous.\u00a0 The yellow prince sherbet is a\u00a0\nsherbet similar to what we do\u00a0 There are more types of sherbet such as rose\u00a0\nsherbet, cranberry sherbet, Goruk sherbet.\u00a0 I plan to make these sherbets when the time\u00a0\ncomes and share their recipes with you.\u00a0 I think this traditional\u00a0\nsherbet has been very good,\u00a0\u00a0 some sweetened sodas cannot replace this drink,\u00a0\nI always prefer to make a healthy drink at home. We have come to the end of a detailed\u00a0\nvideo recipe prepared for you.\u00a0 Thanks to everyone who watched the videos\u00a0\nfrom start to finish and supported me\u00a0 See you again in a new video, goodbye", "sIwVhqOHmrw": "hey guys welcome back to my channel and thank you so much for watching in today's video I'm going to be showing you how I made this adapt or a looking little sloth cake so we will get right into that in a second I just wanted to say if you have any cake themes you'd like me to do feel free to suggest those below I'm going to build my cake in two parts so I'm going to start out with the base and for that I've got two 6-inch cakes that I've cut in half and I'm going to be filling those with some Swiss meringue buttercream that I've added a little bit of melted chocolate to the Swiss meringue buttercream recipe I use will be linked below so once my cake is stacked up I'm taking a five inch round cake board and I'm placing that right into the middle I'm going to carve my cake because I want it to be more rounded so starting from the top I'm cutting rate where the cake board is and then just tapering out so I'm not really touching the bottom two layers that much so once I was done carving I had this general shape unfortunately my camera didn't film when I was carving the very bottom but you can see that I just took my knife on an angle and carved in so the very bottom of the cake just rounded it slightly the next thing I did was my crumb coat so I added a sin layer of my buttercream all around my cake and then I set that in the fridge for about 25 minutes until it firmed up [Music] for the head of my sloth I'm starting out with a six inch cake and then I'm stacking a five inch cake on top of that this piece is actually going to be the bottom of the head of my sloth I just wanted to carve this a little before I added everything together just to make it easier on myself so I'm taking my knife and on an angle I'm just cutting away the sides of the cake just for the gap between the six inch and the five inch isn't so large I'm going all the way around just making small cuts and then holding my knife so it just kind of tapers in it certainly doesn't have to be perfect because I will carve this more once the entire head is assembled but once I had this general shape I added a smear of buttercream to the top of my five inch cake and then using that same five inch cake board that I use to help me Park the body I'm just placing that on top next I flip that over and then I stacked on two more 6-inch cakes just using more of my chocolate buttercream so once my cakes were stacked up to this point I have the five inch on the bottom and then I have three six inch cakes on top so I'm going to go around with my knife and just round out the edges and make sure that everything kind of seamlessly fits together once I was done carving the bottom of the head I grabbed my knife and just rounded out the very edge of that top layer to get the roundness on the top of the head you could just add more layers of cake and then carve that out but to save myself some time I have a six inch ball pan that I'm lining with some saran wrap and then I took the offcuts from my cake and I mixed that together with some buttercream to get like a cake pop texture so it wasn't too dry or crumbly I could roll it in my hand and it would create a nice ball that wouldn't fall apart I packed that into the bottom of my ball pan and I didn't fill this up because I knew I wouldn't need like the whole thing I just filled it up about halfway and then I packed it down with my hands and then I used the bottom of a cup as well you want the surface to be quite even and then I pulled that out because the saran wrap is in there it came out really easily and I flip that over and place that on top of the head of my cakes so once the cake was all stacked together I just use my hands to make sure everything was in place I didn't want this to be a perfectly round head I want it to be more like at oval shape so I just went around with my knife and cut away any little bits that were poking out but this was the general shape that I ended up with I took the body out of the fridge which was now nicely chilled and I added some support so I just put in some straws and then cut those so that they were flush with the cake [Music] I added a little bit of buttercream to help the head stay in place and then using a cake lifter I placed that right on top and just lined it up next I crumb coated the head of my sloth and then placed my whole cake into the fridge for about a half hour once my cake was ready for the final ice I added a thick layer of buttercream all around the entire thing and then I got it as smooth as I could with my spatula to finish it off and make it extra smooth I used a piece of cardstock you could also use acetate and I just went around the entire cake hard stop Bend so it'll form to the cake and it can really smooth out the rounded head and it just allows you to get the smoother finish than you could with your spatula I place that back in the fridge to chill and then started on my fondant now I looked at a ton of pictures and there was brown sloth and gray sloths and they had all different textures and colors so I just went with the brown because I had tons of brown fondant already on hand so I'm rolling this out onto a cornstarch surface to bone eighth of an inch thick and I want it to be quite a large piece once it was the size that I wanted I picked it up with my rolling pin and then draped it over the top of my cake and I moved really quickly to try and smooth out the fondant over the head as fast as I could I'm covering this cake in two pieces so it will crease and pleat at the bottom of your fondant in this step that's totally fine I'm going to cut that away anyway I want this to be smooth down right about where the neck is so where the it kind of dips in on the sides of the cake [Music] so once the head was covered and there was no pleats I took a knife and I just went around where I wanted the kind of neck area to be so I went really slow and made sure my line was as straight as possible all the way around for the bottom of my cake I'm rolling out another piece of brown fondant this time quite long and just measuring to make sure that it's going to go all the way around my cake as well as be tall enough to cover the whole thing I trimmed the sides of it with my pizza cutter and then I rolled up the entire thing on to my small rolling pin and uncurled it against the cake I knew I was going to have some access at the bottom and that's totally okay the important thing is that these seams at the the middle where the neck is line up [Music] I had a bubble form in my fondant and all I did to fix that was poked it with a really short small pin and then just gently guided the air out through that hole and smoothed it down I took a scrap piece of my brown fondant and I rolled that into a ball I'm just rubbing that gently over the entire cake because a regular fondant smoother it wouldn't really help you with that shape so this just allows you to get it ecstasy's for the excess at the bottom I'm just using my pizza cutter to trim that away [Music] now that their body is covered in fondant I'm going to start on the face so I have some white fondant that I added a little bit of ivory food coloring gel too I made myself a template for the face so I have this oval shape here and then to the top I kind of added like imagine the top of a heart to either side I cut that shape out using my exacto knife and then using a little bit of water I just press that to the front of the face for the patches on either side of the eye I have some dark brown fondant and then I made myself another little template just imagine a big end of a possible stick I cut out two of those and then using some water I attach those to either side of the face just kind of curving down the bottom bit so they work completely straight using my balling tool I marked in two holes on either side and then just made them bigger so there are an oval shape I rolled out two black balls and press those into the indents I just need for the nose I'm using more of my dark brown fondant and I rolled it into a oval shape and then just using my thumbs I tapered down the bottom of it and grabbing my bowling tool again I added two indents for the nostrils using my fondant tool I just marked in a little smile my sauce is gonna be wearing a bow tie so I rolled up some black fondant and then cut out a long strip using my pizza cutter I brushed a little bit of shortening all around the seam and then added my black strip so that's the two ends met in the back once I had wrapped it all the way around I just used my exacto knife to cut a seam at the back [Music] [Applause] for the arms and the legs I have my light brown fondant and I'm rolling out this long teardrop shape and flattening that against my work surface I didn't need to use any water or shortening to attach the lens to the body because it stuck to spine but you could just brush them on if you find that it's not sticking [Music] using my balling tool I'm adding three indents to the very end of each of the Lyne with some white fondant I started out with a little ball that I rolled out into it to your drop shape and made sure the very tip thought was quite pointed and then using some water I attached each of my little nails into the indents that I made I wanted to make a pretty simple bow tie so I have some purple fondant that I've rolled into two equal balls and then I'm going to make another really fat to drop shape and press that against my work surface once I have two of those I push them together so the tapered ends we're meeting and then using the back of my paintbrush I just marked in two indents on either side and with another little ball of purple fondant I rolled that out and so it was a bit longer and then just place that into the middle [Music] with a little bit of water I just attached that right to the front for the top hat I'm rolling out some black fondant so it's a little bit on the thicker side and then using my cutter I'm cutting out a circle I'm just cleaning up the edges with my fingers and then I'm going to set that aside [Music] then I want to create a cylinder shape so I'm taking some black fondant and I'm rolling that out and I'm just going back and forth and pressing each end against my work surface while I kind of spin it around this creates like a really flat top because I don't want it to be super rounded you can see I placed the bottom of my hat so that circle that I cut out kind of off-center on the sloths head and then using my fingers I just slightly turned up either side so it wasn't laying completely flush against the head to help keep my hat firmly in place I added a skewer into the middle of that cylinder shape and I'm going to press that directly in the center of my circle of black fondant and then to finish it off I added a strip of purple around the base of my hat [Music] for the eyes I added two little balls of white fondant to either side before the catch light just to give it a little more depth so this was the final look guys I frigging loves loft so I think the starter notes super cute thank you so much for watching and don't forget to subscribe and give this video a thumbs up if you liked it", "6lTg16R0unQ": "I'm going to show you how to make kombucha tea you need to start out with some distilled water and I'm just going to make one batch in one batch calls for three quarts of distilled water so I'm just going to measure it out here put it in my pot then I'm going to turn my burner on high and bring this water to a boil now water has come to a boil so what I'm going to do now is add one to one and a half cups of sugar now you just get a spoon and stir it a little bit and then we're going to let this boil for five minutes and I'm going to turn down my heat a little bit just so it doesn't boil over and I'm gonna put the timer on while water is boiling I'm going to go ahead get my tea bags ready I just have regular tea bags and you need four to five teabags so I'll just do four get them ready my family has been drinking kombucha tea for about eight years now so instead of drinking soft drinks or sweet tea we'll just drink kombucha tea okay what I'm going to do now I'm just going to tie the teabags together that'll make it easier when we fetch him out of the tea the sugar water has been boiling for five minutes and what we're going to do now is add the tea to it and I'm going to turn off the burner and I'm going to let the tea steep for ten minutes now I'm going to put a fan on the tee and I'm going to let it sit for 20 more minutes and make sure that you still have it covered while this fan is on it I just turn the fan off and it's been 20 minutes I'm just going to put that down and then I'm going to grab a cookie jar and this is just a one gallon cookie jar that we bought you need to make sure that you use clear glass just like this you don't need to have smoky glass or colored glass so I'm going to go in for up the tea and I just get it out with a fork usually the tea bags right there I'm just going to pour the tea in the cookie jar a little bit of a mess and I'm going to cover it and then I'm going to put the fan back on it and it needs to cool till it gets to be about 90 degrees and that's going to take about an hour and a half to two hours it's been about two hours and I turned off the fans and I'm going to check my the temperature of the tea and it's about ninety degrees and that's where it needs to be okay so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to put a kombucha mushroom that I've had in the refrigerator in the tea this is kind of what they look like okay and then I'm going to pour this tea in here which is the starter too you need at least six ounces and this is about six ounces going to pour that in there like that and now I'm going to cover it with a white cloth if you don't have a white cloth you go to Walmart or a fabric store and get them to cut you a piece of 100% cotton cloth and then I'm going to go put this somewhere just in a quiet place away from the trash can away from the kitchen and we're going to let it sit for seven days it's been seven days as we made our tea and for the last seven days I've had the tea in a quiet room but today I brought it down to the kitchen and I'm going to uncover it and then I'm going to reach inside and I'm going to separate the mushrooms because what's happened this past week you have what's called the mother mushroom and that would be this one here but it oh it made this mushroom we call that the baby so you separate on they stick together and then I'm going to get it and I'm going to put it over here in a jar where I have actually some more mushrooms just going to put them in here and you can see I've got some kombucha tea covering these mushrooms so now you can store these mushrooms in the refrigerator for several days as long as you keep them covered with kombucha tea until you're ready to make some more kombucha tea and this tea is ready to drink you can pour it up in a pitcher or you can leave it in this container just remember it's important to store your Commission tea and to drink your kombucha tea from a clear glass container don't put it in plastic or colored glass or metal or ceramic always keep it in a clear glass container I hope you enjoy your tea you you", "3FL4BgYguyI": "hey y'all welcome back happy holidays today we're gonna be making a ooh baby red velvet cheesecake cake honey it is gonna be absolutely delicious and they're

there now we're gonna add our eggs super-easy to make a cheese cake y'all but just make sure all your ingredients are room temperature it's gonna take you about five minutes to make this cheese cake add your eggs to that and as you can see I'm turning my bowl just like that okay just turn your bowl I'm gonna add our eggs in one at a time and just mix it for about 20 seconds in between to get them nice and combined you don't want to over mix your batter just get it nice and combined okay and we're gonna add in our sour cream gonna let's hang this up and down okay make your nut like everything okay don't add too much honey we make a cheesecake not lemonade okay folks we'll talk about doing a group chair for our ladies gonna need that just add your sour cream and then we're gonna blend that up for about 20 seconds or so I'm on low speed here don't want to mix it too high because like I said honey it's gonna be looking like it's be looking like it's gonna oh I turn a relationship we don't need that okay one cheesecake to be nice and smooth all right we're gonna add our splash of vanilla and we're gonna also add in our tablespoon of flour I like to use the tablespoon of power just to bring it all together also helps to prevent the cheesecakes from cracking on you okay so add your vanilla your salt and also your flour to that and it's gonna blend it up just like that we are done with the Cheesecake took about five minutes to make and you want to take a rubber spatula just get all the mixture socked up okay make sure you gotta look something there okay do you be looking like food never mind all right next step here so I've got my springform pan that I'm going to be using you got to have a springform pan to make cheesecake out and it's gonna be found at Walmart for about maybe seven dollars i'm using a 9-inch springform pan and I took some parchment paper not wax paper but parchment paper and I just kind of cut around the edges of the pan just to line it okay you use some kitchen shears or some scissors to do this step super easy place it at the bottom of the pan okay and as you can see now we're gonna pour our cheesecake mixture into that on top of that pan okay look at that right there that look nice and luscious fording it's just like that I've already preheated my oven to three hundred and twenty three make this for about 45 to 50 minutes on three hundred and twenty degrees okay another I use the word about because this is going in between two cheese two layers of cake don't need to be on a premium okay so we baked it for about 50 minutes when it comes out looking like this is gonna be slightly jiggly that's how you want it to look okay you're gonna sit this to the side for about one hour for it to cool okay well let's cool all now if you just a cheesecake let it cool out okay and once the cool off you wanna unclamp the pan just like that and pull it off okay now we're gonna let this just cool completely in the refrigerator okay so I wrapped it up and my saran wrap just like that right there you want to cool the Cheesecake completely now you can do this stuff a day ahead I like to actually did this a day ahead well I did the layers to a deer and I just assembled the cake the next day so we're gonna let this chill overnight or up to six hours or if you want to pop it in the freezer totally up to you but honey just go ahead and just put it in a refrigerator honey ain't gonna hurt you just do this a day ahead okay this is Sunday you can go ahead and do this tonight or tomorrow and then put the cake together on New Year's I mean on Christmas Eve and you'll be fine okay so now we're gonna start with the red velvet cake layers all right if you know my if a cake is the bomb job you made it for Thanksgiving it is so good just gonna use same recipe but I shortened the ingredients so make sure you check description box gonna start with our own gonna start with our buttermilk okay pour the buttermilk up in there make a nice and sucked up in moist then we're gonna let the spirit lead us Harley yeah with that of vanilla put a splash of vanilla in there but don't you put no splash of that red food coloring okay make sure you measure their honey because I don't be 100 good looking really don't be stopped doing retail we won't wreck the blood of Jesus red okay so I really a man alright so I'm gonna mix all of my wet ingredients together okay and now I'm gonna add in my sugar okay I'm not gonna use a hand mixer for this y'all because I feel like mixing the red velvet cake by hand actually allows to be moist and lighter and fluffier and it's not overworked by hand mixer it's really easy to just do this by hand okay so we add in our sugar we're gonna add a little bit of cocoa you see that it was so it was so sad and it makes your neck snap you know where it went add a little bit of cocoa not a whole lot of cocoa single chocolate cake it's red velvet then we're gonna add in our flour to that okay and I also list my regular cake recipe I'll link down in the description box to but you'll add all together and we are done that's that's everything the cake is already mixed up you see me add that flour eggs everything and we mix it all together now I've lined my um my cake pans here has some nine-inch cake pans I'm using a 9-inch springform pan for the cheesecake and want to use a 9 inch cake pan for your cake layers because you want to all to be the same size okay so I'm just gonna spray my bottom of my pan with some pan with some Baker's joy whatever your nonstick spray good nonstick spray and pour your batter in there okay this is gonna make two layers okay we're gonna make two layers of this we're gonna tap the pan and let it just sit for about two minutes so that the bubbles dissolve and then we're gonna bake it on 325 degrees for about 25 minutes as you can see when the cakes start to pull away from the pan y'all on the sides then you know the cake is done and take it out okay and it's nice and moist now we're gonna do a trick that I always show you guys with your cakes especially red velvet we are going to what we're gonna sweat it out sweat it out wait it out ya ever gonna sweat this cake kind of make it nice and moist huh that cake gonna stick to the roof of your mouth yes it is gonna be so good so take that parchment paper off you don't have to line it with parchment paper I just did that because I had some leftover from when I was cutting it out for the cheesecake now we're gonna sweat the cake this is a great stuck to my good friend Brian show me years ago honey okay we're gonna sweat this cake for a couple of hours I just sweated overnight basically like I said I made all of my layers and she's kicking everything the day before so I'm just gonna wrap these cakes up and saran wrap okay wrap the legs up and sit them to the sides honey going back to your business now the cheek now it is time to put our cakes together so I'm slipping over the cheesecake cuz we chilled it overnight and then I'm pulling off that parchment paper now I've got some cream cheese icing here I'll link that down description box Susie and get that recipe and we're just gonna put the cake together we done y'all this is super easy I know it probably like it what's on the beginning I was lying a bit yes you are can't you see we are done it's so easy just do it the day before now we're going to put the cake together I got my cute text and I put a little dollop of icing on there just to secure the cakes and we run across that Kaitlin pray honey honey it'll be something and you guys know I don't know how to ice a cake to save my life honey okay I can't ice microwave out on wet paper bag but that's okay honey we're just gonna put together anyway it's gonna be good okay we're gonna put some icing on top of our layer the cream cheese icing and then we're gonna also take our first cheesecake like I said if you just want to use one cheese cake it's up to you baby I like to make it being honey do it big for the holidays so I'm doing two cheesecakes if you want to do to cheese cake just double the recipe okay so we're gonna put our cheese cake on top of that and put a little bit of ice in between layers gotta hear that icing up in and make a soft through okay and also help that cake stick it together then we're gonna put all of our just gonna repeat the steps like I just did and boom ice in between the layers and there you go now here's a trick of your eye if your cheesecake is kind of sitting off like that just take a little butter nice and just kind of smooth it out just like that okay and it'll make it nice and even and all your layers to be nice and even now we're just gonna ice the outside of the cake y'all do not talk about me don't come for me don't go for me it's good that's all that matters okay and we're gonna ice the outside of the cake just like that right there just a nice little layer of icing ice the top of it and no matter how I look anyway because we're gonna cover with some pecans because your hand that's a red field without some pecans okay Opie : so we're just gonna ice it like that right there okay and then we're gonna take some good old chopped pecans if you made my chocolate chip cookies you know you got some left over okay and just put a little bit on top just like that just just grate a little pretty like that right there okay it don't matter it's like a it's like one of them the middle me and idea who that you know they're kind of ugly but they treat you good yeah this hat is cake is okay poppy look a little ugly but it's okay it's cozy it's good instructors okay so now we're just going to chill it in the refrigerator for about two hours chill it before you cut it okay for about two hours and

later bye-bye", "TCT2-c5K3uk": "and welcome back to us doing stuff in places with things or as i like to refer to it melissa took some time off from work for vacation time and ended up at the doctor with the ear infection because that's how that always works you take time off and you wind up with the doctors anyway so we are here to tell you about one of our favorite things in korea when it's cool outside tea what's so special about tea i'm glad you asked korea has these things they are fruit and extract um teas basically they also kind of look like because if you i don't know if you guys can see it from there but it kind of looks like a jar of jam because it's got the fruit in it still so um in fact i think some people actually do use it as a jam spray i think you can use it as kind of a spread but due to the miracle of modern technology and we have a thing over there that puts hot water out so we don't have to boil anything we are gonna make some tea so first off we got what is this that's the lemon honey this is lemon honey tea for a full cup of tea you need somewhere between two and three this is a teaspoon right sure how about two and three spoons because this is just a regular normal house spoon right regular spoon not the big one i've never really known the difference on that some of it's a bit chunky so guesstimate it sticks to the spoon so you may need the hot water to get it off the spoon i'ma start with two because we're using regular coffee mugs and not travel mugs were you making two mugs of it oh i forgot four cups for one for each i can math right so lemon honey so one of the things you have to remember when you're drinking this is you're going to want them as soon as you put it in you're going to want to mix it yeah it will settle if you let it sit for too long and by the way the first time i had this i literally was like what do i do with all the junk in the front of the cup because i didn't know and chuck's like you can eat it and i'm like oh cool it's fruit it's fruit all right we can taste test make sure i've mixed it well enough to your liking okay personally i could stand for there to be a little more in there but depending on how sweet you like your tea or how thin this is still fairly sweet and you get little chunks of floaty fruit in it so and it tastes exactly like what it says on the label lemon and honey so just as a surprise here we've had the lemon honey and we've had the citron one before the ones i'm most excited about are jeju halabong halabong mandarin tea and by the way if you've never been to korea jeju is an island off the south coast and they're relatively famous for um the halabong oranges and the omija tea and omija i believe is um shishandra berries but yeah that's lemon and honey it's fabulous it's basically one of your two starters most people either start with citron or honey or lemon honey all right next one all righty so next up we are doing the halo bomb orange this one no this one is not quite as thick as the other one so try not to make a mess now last year around this time we were actually in jeju weren't we yep yeah so i um i'm gonna do three because this looks a little less concentrated so we had while we were there quite a bit of the oranges there and um oh yeah the halabong orange or the mandarin oranges kind of in love with those in fact i think i still have the number of the guys so we're going to be ordering more of those yeah the season for those by the way is like december and january is when i think they're he said they're sweeter in december yeah so so i'm waiting till december and then i'm gonna call and order if you're in korea and you see somebody selling jj oranges get some december and january is the is the the time you want to buy it right so we have not tried this one so this is a virgin test that one's too thin anymore yeah okay this one's a very thin one it's very um runny as well so it's obviously not constant so where this one if i turn it this way it slowly moves this one if i turn it this way it's all running so okay it's definitely orange flavored but it's that's soothing it's a good orange it's soothing but it's not coating okay so it's not overly sweet so difference being the lemon honey is very it's it's got more i think it probably has more sugar in it this is it's not coating so the diff this being a thicker one it tends to more syrupy it can stir up a little bit this one is thinner but the flavor is on i mean it literally tastes like a drink it's got that strong orange that strong deep orange flavor that hollow bone oranges have it just doesn't have any real there's nothing to go with like coating effect to it so probably if you were drinking just a lemon it wouldn't have it but that has honey in it so you've got the coating of true yeah but it also makes a difference in what type of syrup that they're using to yeah how thick it is like i said that one when you turn it doesn't it barely move it it looks more like a jam or marmalade in comparison to a syrup i really like this the important thing to note once you open one of these jars they now must go in the fridge because you don't want them to go bad yeah when they're sealed they're fine you can keep them in a cabinet but once you expose it to air and you get that that process going stuff starts going bad gotta keep in the fridge i'm a fan i like this one it's not bad i think i'd have to make it a little thicker though maybe all right so now we're on to the omega or the franken waffle berry or whatever what she called it she's andre that thing yeah the franken waffle berry the whatever berry so amiga i've actually had um omega tea before when we were out with friends and when i had it that time it was actually a cold drink this isn't even a syrup this is just a liquid but the cold drink that i had had like a almost like a sprite or a cider base to it with the omega added to it yeah that one i think is going to require a little bit more you might just want to pour mostly because it is a straight solid base it's still thin but at least it's thick enough to taste so this one you're going to be one measuring tablespoons i think we're about up to four or five tablespoons of syrup in here so far okay that tastes like and what does amiga taste like chet franken waffle berries so amiga i think koreans like that a lot because they say it has a lot of health benefits too if i remember correctly i think that's what i don't know about that but it tastes good this is really it's really good it's very um it's not overly sweet but it has a good fruity kind of taste to it that if i if i had to throw a description out and it's vague at best is fruit berry tea if i had to compare it to something i would say it's more cherry i'd say it tastes kind of like a a plum or a cherry with a with a almost like a raspberry hit to it or maybe it tastes like chassandre berries maybe maybe it's good it's really good i like it that one's going to be one i drink a lot of it it is a really good tasting tea and it does have a i guess if you put it above it it has a slight like soothing coating action if you have a scratchy throat it is good it is good now on to what is basically everybody's default favorite citron now if you don't know what a citron is look it up it's a if you don't know look it up because we're not gonna tell you but the way i understand it is the citron is actually the like origin fruit or it's further up the family tree at least from most citrus fruits so your limes your oranges your mandarins are all like hybrids based on lemons based off of the citron or at least in relation to it but further down the tree if that makes any sense but it's like your second cousin four times removed just look it up because we don't really know i am not google and this is just what he's heard i guess not that you've researched right um i've heard it from several sources so either everybody's wrong together or which has somebody which happens or somebody knows what they're talking about yes also does happen so you will generally find this in any asian market that has a korean section or korean mark or maybe even a japanese market because it's very popular it's also very good this is another this is one that definitely soothes and coats as as you drink yes if you've got a scratchy throat if you've got a light cough that's not therona you know you got a little under the weather ah get on the spoon this will both be soothing and sweetening if you can get it on the spoon literally guys when he said we were gonna do a video of something that was gonna help my throat make me feel better i thought he was gonna maybe make me eat cheetos and drink whiskey i've done that he's done that it's hilarious that doesn't help your throat it burns um it's like napalm so don't believe anyone that tells you otherwise why i trust him i don't know i should know better mmm tasty so sweet lightly citrusy not as strong as you know acidic bite to it so out of the four my favorite is always going to be the citron i think that's the first one that you ever gave me secondary i'm either going to go between the tangerine or the omega but i'm just not sure which i definitely like both sookie what's your vote because you're whining in the back you clearly have an opinion she just would like to try one of them so yeah the citr citron is obviously like the best all-rounder it's a little bit tart it's a little bit sweet it's a little bit coating it hits all the bases they have others as well um there's a jujube one there's i think we saw a ginger one yeah there's a ginger so they're they're honey ginger i've seen that too they're definitely more flavors and more variety there's plum tea the plum teas are also the muscle is really good yes um but this this is what we chose um yeah out of this four i'd actually have a tie for second because if i want something based on pure flavor i'd probably go for the omega but if i want something more for like a scratchy throat or something i'd go for the the honey lemon next the halamong orange isn't bad but i think like the oh media one you'd have to put so much of it in the cup that i'm not overly concerned about that part at all it's good true literally it this is this is like warm oranges and i know that sounds weird so when we were in jeju we stopped at a place it was on udo island and we had some coffee there and we had some ice cream and one of them was like a jeju mandarin halabong coffee so as as a the touristy thing that they do there is they will put holobong orange jeju mandarin or especially if you're near udo island peanuts because they grow peanuts there in everything and to be fair most of the orange stuff like the orange ice cream with the orange was really really good yeah the orange does really good in the ice cream in a latte and a latte it was bad because literally i was like oh it's like a latte you know like when i get a pistachio latte it's just pistachio it's not like coffee with it but no they put coffee in it and then that weird peanut latte was having peanuts just smack your teeth as you're drinking is just weird it's straight it's it's an interesting they were it didn't taste bad but it was a very odd texture i did not care for the orange latte in jeju yeah but an orange tea i would have been thrilled with yeah orange and coffee not the greatest combination of flavors um but just warm oranges and like a t tea or hell even if they mixed it with like a milk tea or something well remember too that orange is like orange is usually what they put in with regular black tea a lot of time like a lot of teas that you're used to drinking have orange mixed into it so it's a good flavor enhancer with actual tea itself well there you go there you go so if you're making tea and you want to give yourself a little extra flavor to it adding that might not be a bad idea either anyway that's gonna be it for this video so like subscribe do the internet stuff i'm gonna go drink some tea we're gonna drink some tea see you later [Music] you", "gMbvdQs5na8": "hi guys yeah gonna have to excuse my pajamas because yeah Sunday and I don't feel like changing so we're in quarantine and yeah we're in quarantine so but this one likes to be extra so she bothered to change no I just changed my jeans oh so we're gonna be making Starbucks drinks yeah we're making two of the ones that we actually really like um which are also the ones that we had right now I don't know where mine is but she has her is our you're just gonna make two and see if they taste similar yeah yeah cuz we're bored and it's too much to spend $5.00 on the coffee on the drinks everyday so we might as well learn how to make it at home actually not that hard so kitchen I guess let's get right to it okay how much water uh not too much because wait uh not too much because we want to we're only making one serving rights in the video they made a whole batch oh okay so we're making two drinks right we're making me I just tried to latte which is my choice because I love it and then we were making the we tried to find the ice squawk well I tried to find she's just here to be annoyed right now okay Oh baby will she's gonna make that noise and then we're making the ice teens that you can get uh we have kind of like a choice like we're gonna customize it and some of me exactly the same way that targets people make it but so right now she's making a lemonade with ice which is like supposedly the kind that they use so I have the recipe over here which is exactly what she's doing over there right now so come on so we have to wait for this sugar to dissolve yeah right and then we have to juice your lemons depending on last week it's a little it's a lot it's lime juice so we're just gonna be using this because this is what we use we never juice our own lemons like so much work we're lazy well she's lazy on them and then we're gonna combine the lemon juice and the syrup water which is the sugar water and then pour on the juice and the simple sugar wanted to okay so then we're gonna combine two and then we're just gonna leave it in the fridge and we're gonna like make the rest of the drink or we could just put some instant it well the ice is already gonna go I'll be fine cool yeah so that parts are done and then we have to actually make the tea itself which is go to the page I can't copyright into this so once we're done once we're done with making the lemonade we're gonna put half of it in the thing okay so we're gonna do that just all over the place because half of it is going to tea half of the values for the lemonade we're making two different things no but this the lemonade is part of the drink yeah so why can't we just do one just put this aside trust me the other cuff okay okay this and now put the loan in there I'm gonna put the lime juice and we already have this dissolved this is so not gonna go okay so this is where we choose which green tea we want right okay yeah I know you never used to stuff so we have green teas which is tropical with vitamin C and then we have honey lemon and ginseng I'll just use this one so we're gonna need two is this as just one is the peach and mango by Lipton I gave up these two units so this is where the customization comes in thing it's just the tea bag or is it it's a tea bag be sure yeah okay so we need 1 cup of water and we need to soak it into three to five it looks like we got a boil first water no she didn't bore lick you have to put hot water or else the tea bag isn't even gonna see that's why no can we put it in the microwave yeah I'm saying you said what like we need to make the okay so the cup of water is gonna go in the microwave put it in there okay oh she's she doesn't know how to work this I really don't hold relax I just realized I was recruiting okay so we're gonna soak the teabags for three to five minutes and then reassemble okay on some all right yeah are we gonna put some ice in it yeah so we're gonna use this jar yeah we're gonna use the jar that she's been making the tip top coffee in the dojo at the dalgona I don't know Jay so do I put in ice in here right now and over it because it's gonna start to know because that's gonna take you to five minutes oh hey Isis in your mouth yes so yeah so far it okay don't really know how it's gonna go at the end [Music] our water is now hot so they're gonna bring two tea bags are we gonna essentially steep it okay this one's actually really oh she's making okay so we're not doing four cups because it's only for one person yeah Oh with 40 minutes of chai I have chai huh we have the chai back to you guys yeah I know I already did this part because we have to let it steep for 4 to 12 hours so I already got it okay that's why I was telling you that I need to prevent our you know pre prep for your half oh I thought you mean that I need to prevent our you know pre-prep oh I thought you we because we chose our drinks and we were going okay no no come on we're not doing 1/4 cup because just as too much so we're just gonna do we need one to two tablespoons so we're gonna just do one to two tablespoons and then we're gonna add water the same amount oh so big nose liquidy pirates okay so we're gonna do that part so we're gonna take some honey oh we're doing the next string I forgot to say that we're doing my drink now while we're waiting for the thing to steep we're gonna make okay let's just stop watching it you don't okay so we're gonna put take one to two tablespoons of honey we have pure honey especially using some neck so those are awesome cause they don't use that we use pure honey yeah cuz we're bougie or not um I think I'm just gonna do one tablespoon okay it's too much I know my water we're gonna microwave for 30 seconds [Music] [Music] we do the mixing mix to combine plus all mixed up in Harrow I know we remove the tea bags from the steep tea which I already remove it's a tea bags this is going in the garbage okay next date and then we're just going to pour them into one cup and some ice cubes I will take three three yeah three looks like a big amount honey uh uh I put in all of it why not we don't want to waste anything we're good people no wasting food here leave some space so we know now yeah oh that looks exactly like it did in the video so I think I want to leave this much space yeah and then we add milk for the taste so we had the milk for some taste all that looks exactly like it [Music] okay that's it and then we're gonna stir hold on I got a little touch to add to it I need you to not look back wait okay I have my eyes closed I don't know what she's doing I don't know what I'm filming a fee if you add something that's like I absolutely hate I'm gonna be very upset okay look Oh funky straw oh okay okay I thought your day hey that looks exactly like the turkey actually oh yeah exciting a glamour in the camera it's like a little bit darker it's yeah but it's pretty like decent yes but we still we need to take the teabags on until you take the two more than two minutes yeah a lot more steeper so I'm gonna start with just putting ice into the cup you don't even know how much okay now here's the lemonade hi mom the video survived we're gonna follow her so we have ice cubes already in the glass yeah come just just see okay so we add the steep tea which is this it's over there I lived there so we can yeah so let's show you guys so here's the thing we're gonna look so good that looks kind of like the passion T in the video yeah and then what are we doing next [Music] we're signing syrup in then I can't move lemonade yeah we we we gotta put in lemonade no that's it is that it ah I put that money syrup into but I'm pretty sure we're supposed to put that in what we missed it yeah and then we mix enix like your drink we did well she goes the ice water but this is the peach mango but it looks really similar oh thanks here's my little here's my little funky straw know what enough is okay so looks wise for her drink they actually look similar this one is a little darker though ours are a little darker but I think we should try it now okay you try yours first and then we'll try mine [Laughter] so it doesn't let me it's dim it definitely needs to cool down a little needs to cool down a little but it actually took it doesn't taste as strong as the Starbucks one taste but it my mum just keeps making us laugh but it does taste pretty good here try it yeah okay so category if it looks wide yeah but I think it's a solid nine it's a solid ten actually know that I'm not a solid um they look at for taste wise I actually want to kiss this the ice melted yeah cuz of hot water so it definitely nested hill yeah I think I believe mine in the fridge American later okay so now nine let's hold um so it looks like I nine - just because it's darker any need Starbucks way I think you pork too much of the mini stuff because that's all I can taste right now it's not bad it's no I can say it say it tastes pretty good yeah yeah it actually tastes really good I think we're just gonna start making our own dupes Starbucks drinks good we're gonna do that one bucks guys come to these stores combo one bucks you know find this in Toronto find us that one charming Avenue but I think this was a really good experience yes so you don't have to drive definitely don't have to drive all the way to Starbucks if you want yeah well we don't yeah so like you

to go under the basic tea education playlist if any point in time you enjoy this video then please give the video the thumbs up the more thumbs in the air the more tea videos are going to come your way and if you haven't subscribed to our YouTube channel yet go click that button maybe you are somebody that's just getting into - you're just starting to explore this wonderful world afforded by this amazing plant or maybe you are already an experienced and passionate tea head that is looking for a little bit of help to convert their friends and families well this video is for you we have been in the industry for 10 years we've been selling tea a tower tea house in Camden in London for over 10 years so we've got a fair amount of experience at teas that convert people into the world of true tea now if you go to our website main leaf , put a link in the description below there is one area of the website where you can answer one simple question and I will give you my personally curated selection of 5 TS that I think would be suitable for you I've also done another video called how to make people fall in love with tea go and check that one out I put an I'll put a link in the description below as well and in that video I express how important it is if you are a tea head somebody that's passionate about tea that you Piketty which you are passionate about which you love because it's your passion and your enthusiasm that is going to be so infectious and bring people into the world of true tea and I stand by that but given our experience I have found that there are some teas that are more successful than others and I picked three teas today that I want to share with you before we do that I want to make it very clear that even though this is a video for tea newbies and to convert people into tea it doesn't mean that these are basic or introductory teens these are still high quality teas that everybody and anybody should try alright ready let's start with our first tea our first tea is Imperial green Imperial green also known as dragon well green also known as long jing this is a classic classic tea one of the most famous Chinese green teas and for good reason the reputation is justified you can get this in many places that be wary of quality because there are so many different grades out there why have I pick this teeth well one of the reasons why people want to get into tea is because of health reasons and rightly or wrongly the media tends to focus in on green tea always you see reports about green tea whenever there's a health article about tea it always uses green tea and this is predominantly because green tea is higher in Capitan's which are the very powerful antioxidants however between you and me or tea is healthy and green tea is being picked on because of its higher level of antioxidants in the test tube it doesn't necessarily mean it's that way in your body but that's the subject of a completely different video so people coming into the world of tea for health reasons are looking for green tea and maybe you have had those terrible green tea experiences usually from a tea bag or from some very poor quality green tea that has given you this stewed bitter nasty green tea taste and a lot of people come back to green tea with a lot of trepidation a feeling that they should get into green tea but in fact they don't really like it and they kind of walk in with a little bit of like well I know I should but I don't really like it and this is the perfect tea for them because good quality green tea is a world away from that nasty teabag green tea or the dusty musty bitter astringent nasty stuff which is commonly solved so this is the way to open your eyes up to the wonders of green tea right let's scope this to the season for this tea has to be early spring it has to be early spring preferably preaching mint which means preferably basically before April 4th around then so early spring tea very very important the cultivar there are a few different cultivars that are used for Dragon Well or launching but the one that we use is long ding 43 which is a very very good cultivar for this tea origen this has to come from sir Jiang province so Jiang province is the protected area for Long Jing tea it has to come from that area otherwise technically you can't call it Longjing tea now there are launching style teas made in other provinces but if you want the real deal then I suggest you start off with a Jiang tea picking and processing this is bud and one leaf or bud in two leaves and it's pan baked and that's the key difference between Chinese green teas and Japanese green tea sits pan bait which gives it the nuttiness and warmth which is so special about this team particular and most Chinese green teas finally the elevation this is 600 meter high tea so that's the information that I would be looking for if I was purchasing Longjing okay let's get on with tasting okay so let's begin before we blew up this tea I want to show you a quick quality marker for Longjing tea when you are selecting your long junky looks a tea that has this kind of white and yellow fluff or small hairs on the leaves and you may see some little balls of white yellow fluff also this is a very good sign it means that the tea is early spring pick tea because young leaves it very early spring will still have those fine white yellow downy hairs and when the tea master is pan roasting the tea pan baking the tea then he will be using or she will be using circular motions which will strip those hairs off the leaves and make these little balls so these little balls of white yellow fluff are a very good sign don't think that it's mold we've had complaints from clients saying your tea is molding it's not moldy that is a sign for very high quality tea okay so let's brew this up I have a guar chai one here and I've got water here which is around 80 degrees Celsius it's about 175 Fahrenheit I'm just going to quickly give the Glasgow one a rinse I'm not going to be doing a full tasting for these teas today because that would take too long I'm just going to give you a snapshot of what you should expect when you purchase and take these teas so dry leaf goes in let's give this a smell ah so creamy notes nutty notes the classic flavor descriptors that we use our hazelnut chestnut but it's also got grassy fresh grass nodes to it but not as high as say a nanji-bhai char and it's that balance for launching which is what makes it so alluring and so successful for converting people to the world of green tea as I say most people they have very very very bad experiences of green tea because they've had awful stewed teas because the there that leaves are broken and or they're made into teabags which makes it tea dust and that produces very very low quality tea you can see the tea rinse how clear vibrant beautiful bright yellow green color that is and I'm already getting an amazing scent of this liqueur and we quickly smell the dry to the wet leaf so now it's been hydrated so I'm getting more of those summer notes summer Meadows some fruit there as well wonderful I'm just going to pull this away so we're just doing the tea rinse just to get rid of any broken leaves that are in the guy one and we're going to go for our first brew we're going to be doing flash brewing here this is going through start brewing if you don't know what gongfu start brewing is there are plenty of videos out there that I've made about gone through start brewing I'm not going to get involved in that now but this is the best way to brew your Chinese tea again beautiful bright colored liqueur really really nice and let's move in for the taste I'll show it to the camera one more time clear clean but you can still see there's some those white hairs that you saw before in the lease you can see that they've kind of broken up and that gives texture and thickness to the teeth it's been a while since I've had some long doing this is one of our staples any client of may lease you know we're always going on about how great this two years and and it's one of our most successful teas cheers everybody so you get this buttery start you get some hazelnuts not roasted so much maybe more raw hazelnuts green chestnuts that's light them smell when you walk pastor at Christmastime when they're roasting chestnuts very very slight a whisper of that but I'm also getting some floral notes I'm getting some orchid I'm getting some vegetal notes it's got a definite brothy aroma to the leaf or keep some sticking yeah it's definitely got a vegetal aroma as well asparagus some spinach it's got a slight savory kind of chicken broth II kind of aroma that's the umami that's the theanine in the T so the joy of green tea is having something which is very light very pure but at the same time having an intensity of aroma and fragrance which is as I said dancing it it's fleeting it comes it goes you breathe out through your nose and now I'm getting I'm getting some rocking minerality a little bit of the of the slate enos that comes from good Long Jing pistachio nuts it's also a kind of pistachio green but pistachio nuts that kind of savory nutty and creamy together and then vegetal spinach asparagus and a little hint of orchid a little hint of flower and this it's disbalance this has beautiful balance of flavors which makes this a great gateway tea this is one that will open up your eyes if you haven't tried a good green tea before and anybody who's a tea head out there you know about this too you're ready and it is a great tea that opens people's eyes to what green tea should taste like it's the perfect jumping-off point to launch yourself into the world of green teas to explore Chinese green teas and then explore the difference between Chinese and Japanese or Korean green teas etc but longing is where I think everybody should start so that's your first tea okay let's move on to our second T the second tea is that entire Eastern Beauty another classic Eastern Beauty also known as oriental Beauty also known as by our long dong Fang Mei Ren Braga's t5 color tea there's lots of names for this tea is another very very very famous tea classic I got again lots of different grades so make sure you pick a good grade tea and it's very close to my heart and everybody at Mei leaves because it's such an incredibly fragrant fruity and rich tea and the reasons why I've picked this as a good gateway tea well the first reason is because it's dark it's a little bit richer it's a little bit stronger so for those people that want that more robust flavor the people that may be here they've been drinking black tea already and there are customs - black tea then this is a great great gateway tea into more speciality fine teas the second reason is because this is super super fragrant I've done another video on this before I'll put a link in the description below I've done a full video on the terpenes in Eastern Beauty the terpenes being these very very volatile and powerful aromatic compounds which are given off by the plant and if you get a good Eastern Beauty if you get a good oriental Beauty then hopefully it's also insects bitten and if it's insects bitten then that raises the game further it ramps up those terpenes so you get more terpenes you get more honey notes you get more of that hot tree and old terpenes which is very classic for insect fit and tea so that's the second reason why I picked this tea very very fragrant and the third reason is simply you may sound like marketing but it's a great story right a lot of tea sellers use this as their gateway tea because it's a great story if it genuinely is insect pick teas and every tea seller says that there T is insect bitten not all of them are but if it is insect bit and then it's a great story to tell people right this is bitten by insects and that increases the terpene content and you know it's a nice story that engages people into the tea so those are the three reasons why I picked this tea this is not a black tea this is an oolong tea but it's been but it's been oxidized for a very long time and so it's got that darker flavor and color and is closer to a black tea then a green tea okay let's get tasting it is always a treat when I get to taste Eastern Beauty this is one of my favorite favorite teas if you get a good one it's unforgettable so 5 colors you can see there's white that yellow there's red there's black there's some greens there's lots of colors here you're looking for some hairy bugs there so some of these very delicate fluffy buds but a whole mixture of leaves and colors and textures very very interesting tea but really the only way if you know it's a good one is by taste so lets them get some water in here I'm brewing with slightly hotter water here this was about 90 degrees which is 185 Fahrenheit I find it just increasing the temperature a Brit a bit bring out brings out a little bit more of those Basie woody notes which I think provides a good balance to the tea okay let's give it a sniff ah heavenly heavenly honey but also citrus some citrus peel I would say grapefruit lemons it's got a lot of flowers as well and this would enos a really nice dry wood enos to it that gives it that bass note again a perfectly balanced tea this is why I've picked it as a gateway tea I think it's full of flavor full of terpenes lots of aroma but very very balanced okay let's give it a quick rinse get rid of any of the excessively small broken leaves in this teeth and then we'll quickly scope the tea before we taste it okay quick smell of the wet leaf bringing out more of the wood enos now the wood is wet incredible fruitiness like elderflower some light key and the classic muscatel which is this desert wine grapes that Muscat grape smell okay so let's scope this tea season summer this is one of the very few teas which are picked in summer because it's summer in summer I should say the insects arrived and that's when the insects bite the leaf and then that that action the biting of the leaf brings about reaction in the plant which increases terpenes which have a very kind of honeyed and dessert wine aroma the cultivar there are many cultivars are used to make oriental Beauty or Eastern Beauty chin chin is my favorite so this is the chin chin cultivar this comes from Taiwan's the Taiwanese tea from Hsinchu County but in one leaf and it's a five hundred meter elevation so there's your scope analysis for the tea again if you want to find out a lot more detail about this tea then go check out the other video that I did let me pour this away into the gongfu guru and let's brew up our first infusion for those of you thinking that I'm throwing away the leaves after doing this believe me I'm not there are so many infusions that I'm going to be getting out of these it's a Saturday in London and I've got the whole day to drink these teas so that's a good good day for me okay let's pour this lovely liqueur beautiful kind of green orange and brown liquor beautiful okay cheers everyone texture is nice medium bodies texture with a very clean finish so you know it's not going to challenge anybody's taste buds any anybody in terms of texture in terms of astringency or in terms of dryness but it's got a nice a medium to thick body but the flavor is incredible I'm getting lots of floral notes though zesty notes of a good rose like zesty lemony roses I'm also getting the zestiness of state uranium's so those more citrusy floral notes and then there's the fruit so I'm getting the rose and then that's combined with fruit which is again like great like dried dried desert wine grapes over ripe grapes light cheese some elderflower in there as well I love this too and if you brew it cooler it'll give you all of those notes but what I like is if you brew it at about 90 degrees it just seems to bring out those bass notes a little bit more I'm getting a little bit more woods a little bit more forest e notes a little bit more antique wood actually not just fresh wood but antique wood getting the honey the warmth of the honey as well which comes from the bug bitten effect so the hot tree and all terpenes are they're really lovely full tea but still light still not something which is going to be overly challenging which is going to cost too much dryness and astringency a perfect perfect gateway tea and anybody there knows tea all UT has out there I'm sure you've tried many versions of this make sure you get yourself a good one bad ones are always the biggest disappointment when it's just woodsy woodsy with a little bit of flowers and not much else it's a real disappointment but you want that honey you want that geranium you want those fruits those must get fruits those desert wine grapes a wonderful tea I want to keep drinking keep drinking keep drinking however I know that we have to move on to our third tea so final final in the empty cup more cream cream and honey beautiful okay final tea the final tea in our top three teas for newbies is oz mansis along osmanthus along less of a classic some people may be raising their eyebrow right now because I've picked a scented tea but this is not artificially centered this is centered with osmanthus flowers now a lot of people know jasmine tea we all have heard of jasmine tea most people have tried jasmine tea and there are again varying qualities in jasmine tea and I do like jasmine to in fact I love a lot of good jasmine tea however sometimes jasmine can be a bit too sweet a bit too heavy you know it's that that kind of very rich heavy sweetness and sometimes you want that but osmanthus Wow osmanthus for me is one of the most intoxicating smells it's such a wonderful smell it's so so strong and powerful it's very very sweet and floral but it's also got this kind of brightness to it it's got this kind of apricot notes to it tropical fruit notes is kind of brighter more vibrant than this kind of heavy kind of sedating Jasmine aroma so osmanthus too long is a great great tea the reason I picked it is because a lot of people are used to drinking sensitives either jasmine tea or those artificially sensitives I've done videos about that and why I dislike them so much I'll put a link in the description below so a lot of people are used to this very powerful aroma and flavor especially on the nose and so it's more difficult to get them involved into more delicate teas like silver needles like Hong Kong I like the yellow teas which require you to have kind of develop your palate a little bit into the more delicate areas of tea tasting now I'm making generalizations here but this is generally the case and so what we want to do is provide them with a tea which is true tea is naturally scented but it has that rich very vibrant very bold aroma and this is it and it also introduces it introduces people to the creaminess of an oolong tea because most sensitive that they try will be Jasmine green tea so this introduces people to the world of Hunan teas now I know a lot of people a lot of people's gateway tea is chair Guanyin or iron goddess because it's this very floral ulong tea and i absolutely agree that's was i was toying between them but i actually think that if you just ramped up the aroma a little bit more really bring out those aroma notes you're going to get more people involved get more people excited about tea and then hopefully move into more pure teas so those are the reasons why i picked us manthis oolong let's get tasting so take a look at this susanti what you can see is it's a ball rolled oolong and it's got these little yellow tiny little yellow flowers and those are the is mantis flowers they are so so small but they pack such a punch in terms of aroma let's quickly scope this tea this is a spring pick tea it's made from the same cultivar is ta guanine so it's a big one Yin cultivar it's from an XI County the same area as a Chegg wanyan so it's exactly the same area exactly the same cultivar it's long so it's up to the third or fourth leaf and the altitude is not so high it's about 500 meters that's pretty standard altitude so and she County which produces their finest tea a grunion or iron goddess along I can really smell the osmanthus just after opening the pack I can smell this osmanthus and I love love this smell in fact I was so every time I go to China and it's Oz mantis season I end up kind of following the following my nose and finding the osmanthus trees and just spending some time smelling because it's such an intoxicating smell it became so obsessive for me that I actually I shouldn't say this on camera but I actually broke the law and smuggled in a small osmanthus plant into the UK and I've got enough Mathers plant in my home and it's incredible because every time it flowers the whole house is filled with this smell which I will try to describe to you I get apricots it's like dried apricots that that is really the Pradhan smell so it's sweet but it's got that acidity it's got that sourness tried apricots some tropical fruit then I'm picking up the smell of the along which is creamy it's got those honeysuckle floral notes that come from good ta Guanyin okay the temperature that we've got here is again a bit hotter this is 95 degree which is about 205 Fahrenheit just going to give it a quick rinse again get rid of any extraneous maybe some leaves have broken up there's a bit of tea dust in there you want to get rid of those just because it will potentially make the tea a little bit more bitter than it needs to be ah almonds almonds it's got a bit of grassiness but the osmanthus that apricot smell now it's more like fresh apricot than dried apricot okay let's give this a groove we're going to leave this for about 20 seconds 15 20 seconds to open up ball roll do lungs just take a little bit longer because you just want them to open up having said that this should be enough so if you like jasmine teas if you are somebody that's coming to tea and you've been drinking mostly teas which have been centered then give this tea try this is a great tea to really introduce you to to high quality tea because the oolong in there is high quality you're going to taste that along and you're going to taste that lovely marriage between flowers and tea ok enough talking let's taste in fact I just want to have a sniff of this wetly well there's a smell coming out of here which is taking me off guard a little bit trying to work it out they're with me I might get it I might not it's a it's a very high high note that's quite spicy it's like a seed of some sort caraway caraway that's what it is caraway you know if you bite a caraway seed it's got this quite a nice sweetness to it that's there as well but then I've got mango definite mango the tropical fruit is coming out of the apricot has become even sweet even more tropical mango mango almonds and butter Cheers texture is light with scented teas like this the smell is more powerful than the so the the smell that you get this very bright fruity aroma is going to be less on the taste and more on the nose but with high quality center two teas it should still be in the mouth as well and when you breathe out through the nose it should still be there and it is so I'm getting that mango I'm getting raw almond I'm getting frangipane that kind of raw dough the marzipan and and and and ground almonds slight butteriness and then that subside and then it comes back with grass and it comes back with mango mango and grass ah real mango tasters I always describe this tea with apricot but this amazing the mango I'm getting yeah it starts off buttery and creamy and comes back fresh grassy and fruity great wonderful combination and it's that again balance that I'm looking for every time I'm selecting teas it's all about that balance how it the character the event the the experience in the mouth so it starts off light and then moves into this great fresh fruity aroma breathe out through your nose you're really going to get a lot of that as well and go let's smell the empty cup pretty simple but again I'm getting that caraway I'm getting the caraway slight medicinal herb enos to it as well caraway maybe a bit of them hmm what's that a little bit of mint a little bit of mint and caraway and this another medicinal herb herbiness accouting which you may or may not know coding is a is a beautiful very bright Chinese herb which has a kind of a nice sweetness to it as well a wonderful wonderful tea and fitting finale to my top three teas for newbies please let me know in the comment

quesadillas we made them in skillets and i only had six burners to cook everything in my part of the kitchen with when groups would come in and order four quests and some other dishes and i would get yelled at because i took longer than the 15-minute window we were given drove me mad sometimes yes they are easy to make just they take up too much space and cause a backup of tickets when they come in bunches i like this comment i've often been in the frame of mind it's just x it doesn't take long at all but i didn't even consider that perhaps the kitchen just ran out of room to cook stuff very insightful fresh pasta blows but that's what prep cooks are for cleaning steaks is only fun and relaxing if you have time to chill for a half hour otherwise it feels like it takes forever also frick muscle nights my old exec chef would punish people by making them clean the chain from the tenderloin if you couldn't get more than two three ounces of decent size bites you got chewed on a bit i used to hate cooking fresh lobsters at red lobster i would have to get it out of the tank and stab it in its freaking neck rip its stomach open and cook it which by the way it gets cooked in a microwave on steroids unless you order it grilled my grandfather cooked at the theme building at lax in the late 50s early 60s he said he used to rub their bellies and it would knock them out before he had to kill them not sure how true that is but worth a try sugar work i actually really like sugar work in a quiet empty setting but this never exists in a commercial kitchen i guess i wasn't so passionate to do much in my home kitchen so my experience was always dangerous and crazed the last kitchen i worked at the pastry area didn't have a stove top by it so you would literally have to dodge line cooks to claim a burner then stand there and watch we didn't use candy thermometers and at a certain level of experience it's not necessary anyhow you can see when it turns everything is about timing precision and cleanliness special pots kept separate from the savory side dang near killed an intern who used one of our pots to make some crappy broken sauce when it was at that point you'd grab it off the burner and sprint back to your station and work frantically away too far gone and it was ruined you've wasted precious prep time before service sugar burns are terrible grabs onto your skin and sticks liquid sugar is basically napalm frick that stuff when i worked at panera everyone hated making the roasted turkey avocado blt it was on the smallest bread and would always fall apart a sandwich with six different types of bacon a maple bacon glaze and bacon aioli it is an absolute mess and the glaze burns on the tray is super easy once it's put in the salamander i'm a catering cook and we have a number of things that are rather annoying any sort of past puff because pat air q chucks is a pain in the butt squeezing 500 dabs of it genuinely hurts roasted veg 15 hotels pans of raw veg just gets boring to make fruit displays they take a while to prep and no one eats them prosciutto wrapped blue cheese filled dates yes they are delicious but i have to make 400 for your 200 guests and a lot of people don't eat dates or blue cheese anything skewered again a lot of labor i'm sick of spring mix goat cheese apple cider vine salads can we get a new trend no one wants to be the first person to disassemble a fruit display i promise next time i am at a function that has won i will dig in i work the overnight shift in a bakery to this day i don't even like to eat donut holes let alone make them we had this giant stainless steel gadget that i was supposed to fill then crank so it dispensed small bits of batter into the deep fryer but it was messy time consuming and really a two-person job if only for purposes of basic kitchen safety also they never really trained me on how to use that thing a buddy of mine was a short-order cook at a diner and his pet hate was having to poach eggs but poached eggs are like eggs 101 just to cook here but i hate making chicago dogs i work at a mom and pop ice cream and sandwich shop and the sheer amount of things i have to pile on one hot dog and try and make it presentable annoys the crap out of me there are a lot more labor-intensive items but nothing annoys me like that dang dog also i hate chicago dogs anyway so maybe just a built-in bias i don't think anyone getting a chicago dog is concerned with presentation and to the customers don't refuse to order something just because you find that cooks don't like to make it after all it's our job and we are supposed to cook what you order i appreciate your comment but i'm still going to try to remember the big offenders here most of the time i can't make up my mind and knowing something is frustrating to make can help me narrow down my list used to work out an independent family restaurant in canada and they used to have a tower of poutine it was a terrible burden for the cooks to prepare and the servers could never get it to the table in one piece [Music] cobb salad i guess really it's not that bad though just a lot of crap or a salad that has the potential to make a mess on my station the cobb salad is an interesting piece of culinary history they wanted a salad and said take lettuce then just throw a bunch of crap on it when you think it's excessive keep going hard cream cheese on a fresh cinnamon sugar bagel i work at brooker's bagels and that is the one single thing that i hate making in case you don't know how new york style bagels are made you have to boil kettle them before you put them in the oven so that they get that nice outer shell cinnamon sugar bagels however don't get cuttled because for some reason cinnamon sugar bagels taste better soft this means they are a bee to prepare straight out of the oven though first you have to try to slice an extremely squishy sticky hot bagel by hand then if the costumer wants anything besides a whipped cream cheese you have to try to evenly spread it onto the bagel without completely flattening at all while the cream cheese instantly melts upon contact with the bagel so if you ever order cream cheese on a hot cinnamon sugar bagel at burgers don't be surprised when it's mangled and hideous take a portion of the cheese and bullet with an ice cream scoop squash it evenly between two pieces of parchment to the size of the bagels refrigerate when you get an order just unwrap it and drop it on the bagel done no killing your bagel saves time and is consistent i've heard eggs benedict is an awful dish to cook between the time it takes to make poached eggs well and the time it takes to hollandaise sauce well this makes me feel awful because i love me some bennies a proper eggs benedict is a great test of a cook methu [ __ ] poached eggs let me tell you a story it's sunday you went hard last night so did everyone else on your crew you're all running on four hours of sleep on the sixth day of your shift because monday is the day the restaurant is closed last month the owner decided brunch was a good idea so that that fat bastard and his friends could come in and drink mimosas all day you put on two pots of water and add just the right amount of vinegar to them keeping one just warm and the other in front of it just under boiling you know two isn't enough for service but you don't have space for any more it's like seeing that your car doesn't have any brakes but driving towards a cliff anyways but what can you do it's service time ordering three benny four frittata two lobster grits one fruit platter ten muesli the day begins the water of pot one starts getting cloudy from the first six eggs dropped for the benedicts two hours pass pot one is now only half full looks like milk with bits in it you can smell the vinegar in its searing on the sides of the pot that's one down you run it to dish put a rush on it but you know the dishwasher is backed up one pot left three more hours pass as the poached egg orders keep coming and the water gets worse you start adding an extra eggs to compensate for the ones you break trying to get them out it's 11 30 order eight benny sos4 hard poached two that's the moment that's the [ __ ] moment the water shoots the bed the mass of egg white on the bottom and the opacity of the water makes putting in 16 eggs impossible let alone the 18 20 you need to actually get the order done the first pot doesn't even have water in it your head is still freaking throbbing and why the frick do you even have to deal with this crapola sunday holy crap we still have dinner service freaking kill emi jose just slit my freaking throat now jose i can't freaking take i.t this ladies and gentlemen is why i hate making poached eggs okay obligatory not a chef in fact right now i don't even cook professionally but i do work in food service as a cake decorator at a grocery store and i am so freaking sick of doing the poor patrol cake it uses every frosting color and has infinite detail and every freaking kid wants it for their birthday i enjoy the fun of what i do but i'm over it i will throw a party the day they discontinue that design former pizza cook we had red sauce pies and white sauce pies white was olive oil ricotta and garlic red was normal marinara some people just had to have a half white half red pizza it took twice as long and ended up cooking funny because the white side would be done first then they'd be when the price was higher than a normal pizza that honestly doesn't sound appetizing either [Music] triple decker clubs i hate making those they take the longest to make and when you're busy with like 30 orders you ain't got time for that crap these and placemate preset that crap not a chef but cook out a pizza chain basically anything not pizza not that making anyone side was a pain it was more the people that would order only sides like hey let's get pizza chain okay everything but pizza and the palm bites took as long to make as anything else and was just half a double with a little bit of cheese for like six bucks geez domino's palm bites are 2.99 and i love them i also always order wings i am deeply sorry pizzas at a concession stand at a low-end movie theater are a pain for everyone involved also when people ask for layered butter when there already isn't popcorn and the popper not a cook but i'm an expo for a busy restaurant and i freaking hate soup it sloshes everywhere when i move the bowl and servers hate to run it i would much rather do your six step fajitas over a bowl of soup any day frick soup this makes me sad because i love soup i make soup all the time at home a huge variety of them especially during winter my roommate clothed making nachos of a specific style in the kitchen he worked at they slowed down the whole process of the line i never told him that if anyone was asking for restaurant suggestions i'd suggest where he worked and said they made great nachos po boys anytime they get put on the menu i prayed no one would order it it takes up both halves of the fryer buttermilk gets everywhere the buns had to steal space from kitchen 2 on the flat top and it all had to be assembled on time and if you had to make anything else for the same order glhf former sandwich artist here i cursed anyone who ordered all toppings and more than two sauces on their sub it's disgusting and dang near impossible to close when someone wants something gluten-free not enough people order gluten-free so we don't prep it beforehand and gluten-free pizza basis take ages to cook as opposed to normal just slows you down when it's busy i also always wonder if the person is actually a celiac or just decided to go gluten-free because it's the thing to do now people in la are deathly afraid of gluten i swear to god you could rob a liquor store in this city with a bagel ryan reynolds hard fried crab no question if you don't know what it is let me explain to using this step-by-step guide one first you have to grab a crab from the freezer crack the crab open and take the insides out of it two next you have to grab a crab cake and put it on top of the crab you just broke up in step one three put all of that in batter without the crab cake falling off or breaking up otherwise you have to start over and throw away crab cake wonderful four next put it in the fryer also big enough to take up half of one fryer very inconvenient for other orders and wait for 10-12 minutes five while the hard crab is cooking you need to grab two big paper bags and stuff one in the other afterwards you have to stuff the second bag with lots of wax paper to prevent the crab from burning through the bag at six ding ding congratulations your hard crab is officially done now you've got to take the hard crab out and let the krabby sit for two minutes outside of the fryer seven last but not least you have to put the hard crab in the bag without the claws ripping the bag or the crab cake shell breaking that's all there is to it now try to imagine having seven of those in one order colon d okay but that sounds delicious i worked at a place that made homemade doughnuts and then pre pepper doughnuts people will get vicious over the maple bar i could put out trays and trays of them and still at the end of the day when i'm closing bakery side some person will make a big stink about how we don't have a maple bar in the case tip sunday mornings are huge for older people and they would come in and get donuts by the dozen for after church if you come in at 12 expecting a full doughnut display yeah you missed out i was the seuss at a high-end hotel i once had to do 850 tuxedo strawberries each one had to have a bow tie and three buttons the process is a pain in the butt you first have to dip them in white chocolate let them dry then roll them in dark chocolate but leaving enough white chocolate to resemble the undershirt once both layers are dry then you pipe on the bow tie and buttons took me all freaking day also was the chef the cuisine at a fine dining farm to table restaurant every one of our entrees were a four to five pan pickup so on extremely busy nights you hated life not a chef but as a dishwasher my least favorite dish to clean it definitely any vegan vegetarian dish because they use large chunks of onion and peppers which get stuck in my dishwasher trap edit dishwashers excellent current hate cleaning cheese off of plates also cake cleaning cake off the top and bottom of a plate sucks this is going to sound super pretentious but as a chef my number one job is to love everything i have to do if you do not put equal passion and honor and love for each dish and each customer who orders some difficult to make or custom order where they ask for everything on the side and well done you simply should not be cooking if a perfect night for me was only cooking the dishes i like to cook the way i liked them i would never have a perfect night i try to push myself to constantly love the crap i hate peeling veggies butchering massive amounts of slimy product shucking noise ears until my hands are numb heck even mopping this business has a huge rate of turnover burnouts and frankly a scholarly that is totally a side effect of a chef's clockwork ability to learn a couple of advanced techniques and disciplines and then suddenly assume that they are god's gift to cooking and that everybody else should kiss their butt read their minds and only order what makes the night easy the amount of psychological abuse a chef does to themselves and others on a nightly basis is totally avoidable it really is a shame because it is the service industry and it should be about serving people i have a motto i learned from my first mentor every manic clarification i try to love it all it does not always work some dishes are unavoidably time consuming finicky or a pain in the bus with their pickup and mad respect to any chef because what i mean to say is i t all sucks it is all extremely hard and way more work than anyone could ever be compensated for but that is my bruce banner secret i hate it all and love it all equally but also it is never stapling or sucking dong it's food it's fun nah not pretentious that's why cooking is called an art an artist is an artist no matter the medium and subjects he is presented with but rather how he approaches his creation then again not everyone who wields a paintbrush is an artist i wouldn't really call it a dish but it is a food item that annoys the heck out of me to make barbecue prime rib sandwich it's bread cheddar prime rib dipped in orc just bbq tomatoes and used to have mayo until my boss decided it was too complicated to change a sign that didn't say it had it on there so now we don't add it there's nothing inherently wrong with it it's a simple sandwich and by all accounts it tastes good but to dip the prime rib without making a mess adds precious time to a sandwich that has to be out in less than three one stroke two minutes and when it comes up as the eighth sandwich and two minutes you're almost certain to get bitched at then whenever i go on break and someone orders it i come back to a station that is completely stained in that nasty buttholes just because people don't know how to use a pair of tongs and a pan at the same time pastry chef cannell's bordeaux frick i hated making those little finicky freaking things heat the molds heat the bees butter mixture of beeswax and butter heat that pour out said bees butter while sweating and scalding and burning your fingertips off pour the base into the molds try not to spill them over bake rotate drop temp tap them out of the molds more burning and scolding if you were lucky you got most to come out perfectly brown and caramelized private dinner parties sometimes five ten rounds of these foo frick tapas they take a lot of little crappy ingredients i have to go all around the kitchen to get and arrange in a pleasing way and because it's not a high seller it's not feasible to prep them frick dishes with lots of tiny things that's because you're doing tapas in a non-tarpish restaurant [Music] not a chef but used to be friendly with the staff at one of my favorite restaurants it's a burgers pizzas and awesome complex salad place where a lot of detail goes into ingredients picked etc annoyed the frick out of them to make the classic caesar salad like they have all these amazing things and you just want lettuce and dressing not a chef but whenever someone orders the hot tea and i have to put it together most drinks can be made in 30 seconds or less but hot tea takes for freaking ever and has so many little steps each of which is in a different part of the restaurant that it can absolutely throw off my whole timing rotation for the rest of the night depending on how demanding an evening it is you have to grab a mug and take it up to the kitchen and fill it with hot water set it aside run back to the stand for a plate a creamer jug in the box of tea options set them aside run to the bar for lemons bring back to the stand and arrange pleasantly on a plate set them aside run back up to the kitchen dump the now warmish water from the mug and refill with hot water grab a teapot and fill with hot water run hot mug and teapot back to stand arrange nicely on tray with lemons cream sweeten a basket tea box teapot and mug bring whole thing out to table wait three minutes while customer debates the merits of english breakfast versus citrus black two hours later throw away and touch lemons and creamer in three stroke fourth pot of lukewarm water or spend the rest of the night running up to the kitchen to refill teapot and replace lemons cream tea bags further wasting time i will only ever order hot tea when i know it takes three or fewer steps to prepare anymore sorry for the rant tl dr frick prepping hot tea for a table sounds like prepping tea trees should be a part of your side work i used to cook at a mongolian grill and hated meals that had an absurd amount of sesame oil and poppy seeds the poppy seeds would become a million tiny missiles short order cook here i work in a fast-paced cafeteria style restaurant and every time someone orders a buffalo burger they take eight minutes to cook compared to everything else which is around three four minutes we have a seafood tower at work and it is the biggest pain in the butt it has two bowls that go on a stand full of shaved ice then dependent on how many it's for there's two four shucked oysters two four boiled shrimp chilled lobster tails and two king crab legs plus cocktail sauce and lemons without fail we will get slammed and at least half the crap isn't prepped or we have to shave ice at least three times a night it's little stuff but when you have 30 tickets up and you're waiting on shrimp rice for 10 towers it's a pain plus these things take up my entire tiny butt window so i'm constantly calling for servers to run this crap so i can put plates up of course i get ignored so now i'm trying to find room to make the rest of my stuff as all this seafood is dying in the window obligatory not a chef but i am often the sole person behind the counter at a coffee shop that also serves ice cream now a scoop of ice cream is no problem it's quick and i'm good at making it look pretty even if the ice cream is hard as heck but milkshakes frick you first of all for walking into a coffee shop and ordering a milkshake a second now i have to get 12 ounces of hard ice cream into a cup which is going to take forever a third the guy behind you heard milkshake and now he wants one but there's only one blender so now i have to dismantle and wash it while the line builds and make another while the line builds just to have the guy behind him order a small coffee which i'm now going to give to him for free because he's been waiting 10 minutes for a small freaking coffee all because you had to have a freaking pumpkin chai milkshake and this is why i often tell people oh we just ran out of ice cream sir i i i like almost everyone else on the thread not a chef but when i was a line cook at this one place the new chef introduced not one but two dishes with a source reduction nothing like being busy as freaking then having to wait for a sauce to reduce it was like watching paint dry in the middle of a fire fight well this may not be exactly what op is asking but easily it's anything for fellow employees like some punk bart server who decides to order dinner for themselves five minutes before close after you have been there for 10 hours no no no i shut that down for me it has to be sore brighten no matter how good or authentic the recipe it still tastes like crap and looks like a literal pile of crap on the plate thank you the best solar britain is when you throw the whole thing out and just make pot roast i do cooking and prepping your culvers fast food chain and it's always a pain in the butt to prepare fish dinners because of how long it takes to fry the fish oysters place i used to work at off at 50 cent oysters on the half shell or all you can eat for 30 dollars i can still hear the chit machine printing my heck shuck one dozen shuck three i used to collect the tiny oyster crabs each shift and me and the other cooks would each pick one and race them to see who was buying the first round each night when i used to work at burger king the way to pee everyone off during the lunch rush was i want an order of fresh french fries or give me a salad but i want you to leave some stuff off it fresh fries equals thanks you just screwed up hour drive through times a specially made salad equal someone has to go in the back and make an entire salad just for one customer when i worked at a bar i hated making fish and chips the gooey batter got everywhere and it was a pain in the butt to clean the fryer after fish and chips night [Music] if you are new to the channel you can subscribe i publish new videos every day until then check another video [Music] bye for now", "uz6S-UlxU-U": "hello today I'm gonna do an awareness ribbon so what I started with I have a t-shirt that's been soaked in so - it's been spun out so it's just slightly damp and I have centered the tee and pulled just the front forward so this here is the back of the tee back here we're just folding the front today and I do have a video on centering a tee if you need to go back and watch that one but what I do for my ribbons I went ahead and made a cut out of a half of ribbon so I use that to draw mine on here I usually will Center not Center I will place it about three or four fingers down from the collar so that puts it right nicely on the chest and use a washable marker to draw the outline on and then we'll start folding just to make things easier what I usually will do is fold this over so I'm basically lining up these lines if I can zoom in just a little bit lining up the the lines on the tail right here you can see that those are just about even so if you kind of position that then you can redraw that line on there on this outer part and I can kind of see through the shirt here so I know where that line is if you need to you can lift it up and that just makes for fuzzy easier because then I can just do one straight fold here instead of trying to go up and around that whole tail there so let's see if we can zoom in a little bit see the folding I just do accordion folding on this and I usually will start up at the top and I do maybe know I guess that's about somewhere between a quarter and a half inch fold there and then I'm gonna just lay that fold right down that's the easiest way to get it lined up and pick up the next one so that your lines are kind of touching here in between so you just have to be kind of precise with your folding you want the lines to continue to line up straight across the top here so just keep folding it down and I keep adjusting so that the next part of the line that I'm going to line up is kind of straight with this here and whether you lay that down or you reach out and you pinch it just a little bit there let's see if I can do it the other hand so if I pinched a little bit of that one of the main things I mean I'm trying to do is keep the height of my folds the same so this here is fairly even there and then the only other thing is trying to make sure that that's a nice straight line across there this one here I'm not gonna worry about until we're done but you can see that it's already starting to kind of fold itself up there so we'll just keep folding this see if I can keep my hands out of the way and the other thing is you get close here you want to make sure that this here stays nice and flat the part where you folded your tail up you don't want to pull the t-shirt out from underneath there and make your line go funny you wanna make sure that as you're pulling on that that the whole thing that's coming not just the under part and once you get to that last part then I fold that up and then I just kind of have to kind of work it around I do a little bit of a twist here to fold that down so that this line goes straight down and lines up with all the rest of them now of course this one here is gonna be thicker because we have two layers in there so you just let it be careful that you keep those folds in there once I get that initial fold done then the rest of them are easy you're just gonna keep on folding that up all the way and then this last one I fold that up kind of at an angle so that I can line that same line up nice and flat and then I fold the last bit of it down now this here is where the tricky part comes in I like to try to straighten my lines out here this hairs fairly straight across there but I still like to try to even it out a little bit so I kind of just the t-shirt but you're also working with a different thickness so that makes it harder to line it up perfectly but that should be close enough there and then I'm gonna use my string you can use rubber bands if that's what you're comfortable with or you can lightly tie it with sinew or if you want to have a white line around it you can wrap it with sinew and pull it tight but I like to have just a light did a tie in there I don't need a white line around my ribbon but that's just personal preference so once I get that tied up then I'll go and this here is the center part so I'll kind of straighten straighten that out and then do the folds on yet all right and I do another tie on it wrap I just usually wrapped around a couple times just to hold it and then tie it off and there's your ribbon like I say now for the rest of the tea what I'll usually do is scrunch it up and so where this here was folded over I'll go ahead and flatten that out a little bit I've taken both of the same back out here I've taken the two sleeves and stuffed one inside the other when I did the centering on the shirt here so I'll lay that down and I'm just gonna do just a basic scrunch on this but one of the things you can do and I can say this here is all preference now and how you want to dye it you can gather it up all the way with these folds and you can make rings around your thing but I prefer to do a scrunch so that's all personal preference and then it's a matter of picking the color for your ribbon each color represents a different disease that they're drained to bring awareness to so make sure that when you're making these if somebody specifically is requested it I check to see what color they want the ribbon to be so you can put the appropriate color on and let's see well straighten this out a little bit I'll put a couple twists on this here just to keep it nice and flat so that all so that it doesn't pull the way round on me and then this here is ready for die no and the other thing you might want to take your marker should be fairly easy to tell but since I do have just a little bit my lanes nut is not completely straight you can see that there's just a little bit of a V to it so when I draw on the back side I'm gonna do the same thing put just that little bit of a V on the back side okay and now for dyeing this what we're gonna do is die just in between the two lines that will be the actual ribbon so I'm using one of my little bottles here this here's one of the bottles I got off of Dharma if you do a search for metal tip bottles you'll find these they come in quite handy when you're trying to do a little work like this so this here is my actual ribbon that I'm dyeing and then I'm gonna dye the rest of the shirt in a light blue then I'll probably put a dark with blue over top just for some contrast and you want to make sure you squeeze just a little bit of extra dye into this part here this here is where I fold the tail episode it's got double the amount of fabric there so I usually will make sure to add just a little bit of extra dye there so that you get a nice consistent ribbon all right there's the ribbon now this here is the center of the ribbon it will drip some dye on there and then on the rest of it and this is something that I'll put dye on and I'll leave just a little bit of a space there and let the dye spread on its own and then I'll come back later and add some more dye in there if it hasn't spread all the way but if you put both of them right up to the line then you risk having them both of them spread into each other and that just makes for a mess you all right so that's gonna be the ribbon tea after I get this washed up and everything a couple days then I'll put the picture at the start of the video but that's how you do the ribbon thank you for watching please give my videos a thumbs up if you're liking them", "I7rLQJxczL0": "[Music] hi welcome to mr. Otter studio today I'm going to show you four ways to tie-dye I'm going to show you the bullseye method the swirl method the hombre method and the stripes method before you figure out which one you want to do it's nice to see the effect that it has to do tie-dye you just need some basic supplies you need whatever you're going to tie-dye I like to wear gloves when I'm doing it you can wrap it in a plastic bag or some plastic wrap after we're finished dining it some rubber bands are nice to create the different effects and you need some dye so I just got this kit from my local craft store this is made by tulip but you can also just make your own dye and put it in squirt bottles I'll probably just keep these bottles and then make my own dye inside of them later it's really easy to make dye and it's cheap to buy from the store but make sure you have in a squirt bottle so that it's easy for you to use you can use a paintbrush if you want to use it for the ombre effect so the first step is going to be to wash whatever you're going to be tie-dyeing if it's something that's new you need to wash it because there's something on it called sizing and that will get rid of it so that the dyes cling to the fabric if you want your tie-dyed to spread and kind of mix into each other then you want to start with this kind of damp so to start out with make sure you have whatever you're going to tie-dye if you want it to blend to make sure it's wet if you don't want it to blend that it can be dry your rubber bands and your dye you can use gloves they're optional but the dye will get on your hands method number one is the bullseye method first I'm going to show you a 1 bullseye and then I'll show you multiple bull's-eyes whatever your dyeing lay it flat down on a surface I covered my north plastic just so it doesn't get ruined you want to just pinch the middle and pull it up so you just grab the middle wherever you want the middle of the bullseye ativy and pinched it and then we're going to put rubber bands along it you can do these as far apart as close together as you want the rubber band creates those cool transitions alright once you have put your rubber bands on you're ready to add your dye and add whatever colors you want so I'm just going to with yellow flip it over get some on this side if it blended into some green come into the blue and then I want that blue to fade into a really dark blue this is like an indigo it's really pretty and that's it wrap this in a plastic bag and let it sit for six to eight hours this is what it looks like after I've rinsed it and washed it and this is what the bullseye method looks like when you use multiple bull's-eyes to add multiple bull's-eyes all you're going to do is gather the shirt in a few different spots so if you want one up on the shoulder and then one maybe down here you're just gonna do the same thing you did before so I'm just gathering it and maybe I'll just do two this time instead of three rubber bands so you're just pinching it and gathering it to make the bullseye and then you're adding the elastics and then if you end up you know having these different pieces like this you can choose to create another bullseye inside of those or you can just add the dye to that and make it one color I might just create a separate bullseye with those ones so I'm just gonna gather those pieces and then add your dye and you'll notice when the colors mix you'll get some really cool secondary colors wrap it in plastic let it sit for six to eight hours rinse and then wash it and this is what this one looks like all right the second method I'm going to show you is the swirl method this one looks awesome and this always is what reminds me of tie-dye shirts this is that classic tie-dye look and it's really easy to create whatever you're dyeing lay it flat then you want to pinch the middle of it and start twisting so do you see how it's starting to swirl I'll zoom in you want to kind of keep it flat and then kind of use your hands to help that surrounding area so you've kind of created like a swirl and then you want to secure it with your rubber bands especially to keep these sites from coming off just make sure you don't let it fold over or you're not gonna be able to dye these parts so try to still keep it flat I would secure it with five rubber bands maybe just as long as none of these pieces are falling completely off it will be fine and it'll work so kind of flatten it out make sure you can see the middle then you're gonna use your and you're gonna die each one of these slices flip it over and add your die to the other side put it in a plastic bag let it sit for six to eight hours rinse and then wash it and this is what that looks like and you can use as many colors as you want with this you could just use two colors you could just use one color this is the swirl method just using two colors and this is what that one looks this is what it looks like when you just use two colors the third way I'm going to show you is stripes this one is the easiest and it's cool I really like this this technique you can use as many colors as you would want and all you're going to do is a fan fold the shirt so we're just gonna start from the side span fold it so I'm not folding it I'm not rolling it over each other no I'm folding it like a fan so you go one side lift it up place it over I'm just lifting it so in these long stripes then you take your rubber bands and you can make the stripes and put as many stripes as you want on this all right after you put the rubber bands on then you want to take your dye and just go ahead use as many colors as you want I'm just going to be using two colors skip every other one turn it over wrap it in plastic let it sit for six to eight hours rinse it off and wash it and this is what the Striped method looks like the last technique I'm going to show you is the ombre technique so that's where one color fades into another color or fades into white and this is the technique you might want to use a paintbrush for just to mix the colors and you might need a container with water in it as well so if you're doing it with one color you would just put that color either on the top or the bottom and then you just use your paintbrush to brush it up I'm gonna show you what it would look like if you'd started at the top and then move to the bottom just gonna start with some green on the top when you use our paintbrush it's number one just make sure that it gets on the shirt and then I'm just pulling the paint down with my paintbrush and you want to saturate it even more than I have so you shouldn't have any white on the top so just get plenty of dye on it for this technique then you're just taking your paintbrush and you're just painting it down flip it over and then we're gonna fade it into this blue color so I'm just making sure I have enough I don't want white in there use your paintbrush and again I just have water on my paintbrush and then as I'm moving up into the green you'll see it's just creating a really nice blend flip it over do the same thing on this side and then on the bottom it needs to be pretty saturated this technique is pretty forgiving so luckily the dye went through I think enough on the back so this is the multiple color ombre so after you're finished to let this one dry I'm just gonna fold it over itself and keep it together like this and then put the plastic wrap over it cover it in plastic wrap leave it for six to eight hours rinse it out wash it and this is what that looks like in the end so this is what it looks like with one color I'm just getting a lot of it down at the bottom and then as you can see it's already starting to blend its way up do you want to take your paintbrush start in the color and move it up you're just fading it with your brush so really really simple turn it over do the same thing on the back and when you're folding this one up you just want to start just overlap the same colors just make sure you're probably gonna get dye on your gloves while you're doing this just make sure you clean off your gloves before you touch this top part there is a lot more techniques you can do with tie-dye these are just a few have fun with this project this is really fun to do in the summertime remember you can make your own dyes you

two months and to be honest I did kind of give up but now that I have a little bit more time I realize that I actually enjoy making videos and I'm gonna get back on to it so after my exams are done and when next semester starts I will definitely be making some more videos so now when I'm back from my hiatus I don't even know what that's called hiatus how you just I don't know anyways now that I'm back I figured it's a perfect time to start making videos again because christmas is coming Hanukkah is coming Black Friday just happened so for this video I figured I would share with you guys some of the deals I got on Black Friday and what I thought now in no way am i bragging about anything I just really wanted to share with you guys like what sales there were and some are still going on so make sure to check those out a lot of these also were gifts for people so like I just kind of went Black Friday shopping to get gifts for Christmas Hanukkah whatever and then I got some stuff for myself obviously so I will get started now make sure to subscribe to this video before you watch because I'm gonna be posting so many more fun videos in the upcoming month and months in 2018 I'm going away at Christmas time so I'm gonna be making a vlog of my trip and I'm gonna be doing just a bunch of cute fun videos so make sure to subscribe for Black Friday some of the stuff that I got hasn't actually arrived yet because I did show up online the first thing I got I should get my phone I don't even know what I got [Music] okay well the first thing I got was this Christmas tree and I've never actually had a Christmas tree before because I do not celebrate Christmas but now that I live on my own I decided that it was time that I could get at Christmas tree so it's actually called a Hanukkah bush because I celebrate Hanukkah yeah I got blue and silver ornaments so it's like very Hanukkah themed and it's four feet tall I got this at Michael's and it was on sale for $35 which is a pretty good sale so I don't know I was really happy I got it and then I ordered my ornaments on Amazon Prime and they came within a day you could see them they're really cute okay well I've got these little ornaments that came in a 4-pack they have this one put that back on oh there's these really cute sparkly blue ones like this I don't think you're even gonna be able to see it but and then there's just two other patterns but I'm a little bit lazy so I'll put all the links to everything that I got down below so you could shop it too and if there's still a sale that would be great so the thing I was probably most excited about getting was my soul cycle attire so if you're familiar with soul cycle a lot of celebrities go there in New York and Los Angeles and they have them all over the US the spinning studio it's very like inspirational but also very expensive so the classes are like $30 it's really ridiculous but it's an amazing workout and I love soul cycle so the other part about soul cycle is that they have workout gear well I always want to buy the workout gear but it's so expensive and on Black Friday they had an online sale of up to like 65 70 percent off some things so I decided to get a two tank tops and a pair of leggings so from SoulCycle I got the heart wheels soul repeat capri leggings and they were originally 86 US dollars and then I got them for 66 Canadian so that was a pretty good deal and then I got the wheel B / o crop drop sleeve tank but it was regularly 56 US dollars which is like 70 Canadian and I ended up getting it for 28 Canadian so that was a really good deal it's just like a classic SoulCycle tank and then the last tank top I got is right here and it's a Lululemon it's like a Lululemon Razorback shirt it just white and it says SoulCycle across it but those shirts are normally $100 and I got it for 41 okay well oh I got these a little bit before Thanksgiving whatever you call it Black Friday so yeah I got a bunch of stickers from my laptop they're actually really cute let me see here so I got Miley one Lizzie McGuire in New York I wrote my name SoulCycle Beyonce I sorry Blair Waldorf Disney Selene just some basic cute things all the stickers were like two or three dollars I ordered them from red bubble they come pretty fast and I love them so I'm very happy with that the next thing I ordered online was from my sister for her Hanukkah gift Hayley you're gonna see this sorry I'm ruining it for you but I got her a bunch of stuff so I ordered online from garage and I got her these chenille black little mitts they're really cute and I figured cheap everyone needs a pair of mitts so through those ends and then I got her this cute little dress I don't think they have it in stores because it looks very summery but it's like kind of a corset dress and it's just like flowery and it's cute I'll attach a picture right here of what it looked like online I think the whole store was 40% off so garage had a good sale they might still have some of a sale definitely check out garage on blue I like garage okay then I went to Hot Topic I did get my sister a pair of rookie more I got her a pair of Rick and Morty socks they are so funny and they were having a sale if you buy two things you get one free so that was pretty good oh and then I got my Lizzie McGuire shirt okay I think this was actually the best piece of my entire Black Friday shopping it is oh this is gonna be a really long video I talk a lot I'm sorry okay this shirt is everything it was $15 normally 30 I think it's just the best shirt I own if you watch Lizzie McGuire it's just the best thing ever they also have like that's a raven and other fun Disney shows then okay lush did not have any Black Friday sales so I was pretty upset but I did get my sister this really fun snow fairy bar it comes with like three different colors oh can you see comes with three different colors and apparently you can mold it so you can make like kind of playdough stuff with it and then you can use it as a bubble bar so it makes bubbles in your bath you could also use it as I think she said body wash I don't know it was really cute so I figured she could have fun with that that was for Haley and now for me I went on Kylie cosmetics when she was having free worldwide shipping I ended up getting her cotton candy cream highlighter posted right here it's like the middle tone I have no idea if I'm gonna like it or not but the reviews online were pretty positive so I wanted to try it out and it was free shipping I figured why not what else did I get ooh I went to Sephora there is no sale at Sephora but a girl's got to go to Sapporo and a girl's got to go to Sephora so I used two of the things already so I cannot show you but I got the avocado that's on how I say avocado avocado eye mask and it's actually really good it just like a little strip and you put it here for like 15 minutes and it really rehydrates your face and then I also got the avocado sleeping mask and they say it's one use but honestly I've already used it twice and I resealed it I'm gonna get a 30 you said of it really good for like six bucks and then I got this clay mask purple clay mask I mean they're just fun I don't really know purple clay masks help but I just I couldn't help myself okay now I go a lot more than I realized then at forever 21 they had a sale of twenty-one percent off everything and then select items I think we're even more than that but for this shirt I got twenty one percent off and it's a really cute shirt just like MTV classic but I don't know it's really nice to pair with some jeans or like even leggings on a casual day oh this was a really good sale okay so this is a really cute Jersey like supersoft bathrobe from Airy us actually eyeing it for a while and then the whole area collection went forty percent off so I got I was like okay you need to get it now so this was actually only $35 and then it were 35 or 40 something like that but it was regularly I took up a tag he was like regular at least $60 I think so that's a lot for a bathrobe but this was a decent deal and has a cute hood and it's perfect but for when you're getting ready for a night out or you're getting out of the shower and you're too lazy deponent pajamas so that was really good so every year I really like to get the Victoria's Secret thermal pajamas and this year's collection has a really cute band I got this really sweet dark gray and pink pattern comes with the matching top this was regularly $72 but you also did get these cute slippers I got black but they had them in a bunch of different colors it ended up going on sale online for like $30 less but that sale was not in stores it was only online and then finally I actually went on to sample I've heard very mixed reviews about sample but I actually had ordered two bathing suits before Black Friday and they successfully came the bottoms were a bit cheeky but the tops are really cute so I decided to take advantage of their Black Friday sale and all the bathing suits were literally like seven to nine dollars they were so cheap and between me and my sister we ordered seven bathing suits so the first one they ordered was this one right here it's a high-waisted black bikini but that's cute embroidery on it and then I also got that for my sister and I have it in green well she hasn't in green so that's right there then I got a really cute blue velour bathing suit just like a triangle bikini it was it was seven dollars so I was like okay you know what even if it's not waterproof I will try it out then I got a fake triangle neoprene one right here and I have one of this style before so I like how it fits and then what else did I get I got oh I got this cute one right here that's like black and white stripes and it's a tube top and then the other two I got off is awful I just tell you for fun is I got this tie-dye one and then I got this red ruched one I forgot to tell you guys before that a few days before bug Friday bath and Bodyworks had a really good sale and somehow I just caught it I was in the mall but basically they had a sale going on that it was buy one three with candles get the other one free so on top of that they had a wheel that you could spin outside and $20 off a $50 purchase so basically I got four candles for the price of one because I am obsessed with candles literally if someone wants to buy me candles for life I will take them so I got this one that's my least favorite it's called cinnamon pretzel twist spice it up then my second I don't know why I'm going from least favorite but like the one that I use second least is this one called let it snow it's really nice yeah so it's called let it snow it's a very nice like vanilla peppermint smell now this is my top favorite I think it's just simple vanilla bean but the trick is to get the white barn vanilla bean because I find that it's a lot stronger of a smell than the bath and Bodyworks vanilla noel I think that's what it's called anyways this one's really good this one is currently lit because I love the way it smells and it makes my room smell perfect so this one I don't know this probably won't focus because it has like fire coming out of it but this one is so pretty it's like marble if you can tell on the outside I've already used half a candle and I didn't even know you could use like finish candles but I literally light it in my room every day it's called cinnamon spice vanilla and it's oh it's just perfect so thank you guys so much for watching my Black Friday haul I hope you enjoyed and make sure to check out all the links if you want any of my sample products I have specific links down in the bio that will help you get a sale I believe if you have any ideas for me to do any DIY is any holiday this that make sure to let me know and I can't wait to start making videos for you guys again so thanks [Music]", "mIgwh8mX2dQ": "[Music] [Music]

who's uh uh we're gonna be doing another unboxing video unboxing video yay i'm pretty sure my cat's peed in this box that one no one right there yeah you yes that's right we're back with another unboxing video what's it gonna be this time is it gonna be something interesting or another thing of whiteclaw today we've got something special the embargo has finally lifted on this uh this new bits of information i've been silent i've been keeping keeping my my head to the ground just being like i don't see anything i don't see don't ask me i don't know anything about it uh because of course i've been as as your your favorite white club personality i've of course been embargoed on the new information about white claws yes the uh the codes just came in for review we've got a review copy right here of the new white claw variety plaque ice tea edition oh my goodness they finally did it on arnold palmer that's right four brand new flavors one is still mango can you believe that the third thing with mango in it i might still be under embargo [ __ ] shoot you didn't hear anything but the very least uh it doesn't have raspberry there's raspberry tea makes sense mango tea makes sense we've got a coarse peach tea and lemon lemon's also not a new flavor so peach peach is are new flavor it's incredible there's so many possible flavors of tea and the we've done through the same ones we're going to be trying out this new this new era of white claw flavor i have a cat hair in my mouth moves from the box that i put myself into 100 calories of always gluten free classic made pure but one gram of sugar what are you trying to do to me white claw what in the world one gram of sugar that's crazy uh made with sustainably sourced brewed tea i would actually like to know more about this sustainably sourced tea does uh do they have any more information about that crafted using our unique pure brew process sustainably sourced brewed tea and the finest flavor to deliver a surge of pure refreshment like no other white claw hard seltzer iced tea made pure let's get this box open i've i've been working out i can hold the box and open at the same time now it's very uh it's very uh it's a new me right now i felt a dip i felt it dip hard okay i'm gonna put that down there classic can design as always aluminum i think tin no aluminum they've got a new color streak there's two color streaks on here now usually there's only one i think that's it you can hang out there all day it's fine you do get the views up you get another i'm getting the lemon waft i'm it doesn't smell like white claw is what i would say it's almost like something different and i don't necessarily know if it's tea but it's something but yeah iced iced tea lemon bone apple tea oh man wow you can really taste the tea you can really taste the tea that's crazy and it's not that crazy it's it's tea it's it's very powerful taste it's not much you could do to get rid of it but it really is teeth it's very it's very different definitely gives you a summary kind of southern vibe i guess sweet tea that's a thing right um it's definitely not a green tea or a uh an earl grey it definitely feels like more of like a lipton probably not lipton though [Music] it's a ton of flavor on these lips though these are the jokes um but as someone who's never really had heart tea a long island iced tea or anything like that i wanted to make sure i had a good comparison to make sure i'm you know as a reviewer i want to make sure i'm making good call have all the information you wouldn't go to you wouldn't go to uh like a a car review from someone who's never driven a car before right so of course you never go to a tea review a hard tea review a hard lemon tea review a hard little parmo seltzer review with someone who's never had any other hard tea seltzer before right of course of course you wouldn't to the best of my ability i was able to obtain a comparable product uh and i brewed myself some green tea warm very warm it's very green two two bags i like my tea very strong uh happy thor's day everyone uh i didn't have any lemonade or anything like that so i found some lemon juice in the fridge it's been there for a while now that's expired you know you know it's good lemon juice when the cap stuck ooh that there's some sediment on there oh lemony i somehow managed to avoid blasting lemon juice into my microphone which is a very good thing um didn't have much in the way of alcohol but i have some amsterdam of course how do you make how do you divide if you have percentages that obviously want to match the percentage of alcohol so i guess five percent should be [ __ ] [ __ ] that seems right and then of course you have to get that seltzer flavor i didn't have anything carbonated in the house except for white claw surprisingly enough i don't have any soda i don't have any lacroix or any other seltzer and then of course no other seltzer heart seltzer's in this household besides white cloth uh and i don't feel right pouring white claw in there cause i would bury down the bread um so i got the next best friend uh i got some soda bread uh happy st patrick's day everybody delicious terrible jokes now obviously i said it was st patrick's day but it's not actually saint patrick's day it's actually the day after st patrick's day so if you're wondering that i'm not wearing any green it's okay don't no no please no please this is the most delicious thing i've ever seen that's my light that fell hmm looks looks yummy oh my gosh oh god like like i said i'm you can trust my opinion here white cloth vastly better than this other option for hard lemon arnold palmer hard all know palmer tea seltzer this this is not a no don't don't do that like i don't know if there's any other brands of flavors out there for a hard hard altered hard arnold palmer seltzer hard arnold palmer seltzer see this is why villager joe doesn't let me do videos anymore let's get some of that peach tea out of here obviously if we're doing the seltzer review we definitely want to have the uh the the the new flavor in this as well obviously it's got to be complete review of course i gotta think of tom tablets because it could be a long night for me golden pop top that's new that one smells a lot more like peach you get that flavor you get that sense and flavor immediately there's a lot less tea in that one compared to the lemon oh yeah huh the peach one a lot more like a sweet tea in a sense like this is more like like like a lipton tea with lemon this is more like a southern sweet sweet peach tea uh so let's do a review um it's lemon was obviously very very tea flavored peach much more like a sweet tea um peach is great flavor i definitely taste the peach and the lemon is classic um as far as rating it from in a in a tea perspective like a hard tea perspective definitely definitely better than this uh for sure it's not the best thing it's not my favorite thing in the world as far as like a hard tea is concerned like i think you're we might be combining too many things here as far as flavors like got the tea got the alcohol got the seltzer and the lemon that's like there's a lot going on with that and the tea definitely sticks out here and i think this is probably better than the peach as far as like a tea flavor goes like if you were looking for that hard tea it's right here in the lemon uh this is just kind of peach white claw in comparison to a classic you know classic variety pack of white cloth this is a great alternative i think this is not quite on par with those with the the classics definitely better than the 70 calorie ones uh as those are just kind of you know they are what they are it's a fun time uh definitely feels like a fall or spring vibe even depending on what your what your take is we've obviously got some mango and some raspberry here as well uh i've no doubt that those probably feel similar to the the lemon and yeah gonna give these a 7.5 out of 10. there you go i think there's some inconsistency there in terms of the tea amount and the flavoring is pretty great for both peaches there lemon's there tea is there it's definitely there in the peach it's just a lot more subtle so yeah definitely with the lemon is you get that tea that tea is there it's distinct and with the peach that's a different flavor entirely it's it feels it feels a little bit different than white club but still feels like you're getting i don't feel like i'm getting gypped out of the the peach flavor of white cloth we've got ourselves four brand new white claws it's a new day a new era a new year 2020 is gone 2021 has begun and the future is looking bright why claw iced tea so that is the review of the white claw hard seltzer iced tea peach and lemon i'll leave the raspberry and the mango up to you to discover for yourself because i'm sure that'll be exciting for you the viewer in this white claw review as always i've been carbon based bander uh the guy who does the vlog videos instead of the video game stuff you can see villager bander do plenty of fun video gaming stuff for nerds because he's a big bill nerd he's quite small actually he's not really big i wouldn't call him big whoops whoops whoops whoops hang on hang on hold the phone here i've made a discovery almost a horrible mistake here hang on holy cow i did not realize this the it's not a clear it's not clear it it's unclear the claw it's unclear you see normally when you drink a white claw it's very clear and this it's not clear it's very it's it's golden it looks like apple juice that's that's different it's unclear it's the raspberry one which we didn't try on the other one by the way holy that is that is pungent that is a very pungent smell well now it's clear to me what this review should be is now this is this is a very different product you're you're you're looking to color those ribs there they dissect yeah they're on the this very grim and then dissect you on the uh the cadet cadaver table your ribs are going to be colored in the the golden amber of white claw iced tea someone's trying to snapchat call me ignore sorry for the so sorry for the light intrusion here but just wanted to make sure that we were clear on this on this review didn't want to have any false advocacies what's uh what's the white cloth slogan uh step into the shade excuse me excuse me team how do you feel about this lemon flavoring ooh ooh don't like that at all not happy with that would you like some soda bread out not carbonated they like it", "IfBHUYZQAK4": "Well hey everybody! Welcome back to the channel. Today we're going to talk about warts and I know that warts are not the most fun or attractive thing to talk about. Especially since we're still over one month away from Halloween where they warts and moles are in vogue. But, in all seriousness it's really important that they be cured. That you get rid of them because they can cause infections, they can be contagious, so if you're looking for an all-natural painless safe and very fast way to remove warts then you have come to the right place so keep on watching! Well, we know warts are caused by viruses like HPV in fact a whole lot of different viruses in fact this is such a big problem I actually wrote a book on this topic and I'll put the link to this book of the video description box but they are very difficult for a lot of people that can be in places that are very painful they can cause infections and again they're created by all kinds of viruses and there are so many of them that we would be here all day just to talk about that the mechanism of how warts happen or basically they are a virus that gets down into the skin it gets in to the skin cells actually invades them and begins to grow and multiply and there you have a bump or a ward it's really an area of dead skin that's surrounding a live virus so that's what award is that's how they happen viruses are contagious especially HPV virus which leads to all sorts of problems you get genital warts from those not a again a pleasant subject but it is a human condition that we're gonna try to help you fix today so with that said what can we do about them well I'm gonna share with you the way that I have gotten rid of warts in the past I used to have a landscaping business way back today I had my hands in the soil a whole lot and I used to get them on a fairly regular basis which is how I discovered this remedy that I'm about to give you now this works it worked for me it works for my clients so I am 100% confident that it can help you it's very simple you need two items well actually you need three things but two ingredients and that is half a tablespoon of baking soda and half a tablespoon of cast oil and what you're gonna do is mix those two items together and they're gonna make a paste it needs to be the consistency of toothpaste so if it's a little bit too liquidy or or wet add a little more baking soda if it's too crumbly or dry out a little more castor oil to get it to the right consistency and by the way you can keep this in an airtight container for two or three days and it will work very very well the next thing that you're gonna do before you apply this mixture to the wort is you're going to take a needle sterilize your needle first please and you're going to scratch the surface just lightly you're gonna make it bleed but just lightly scratch the surface of the mold what this does is open up that tough layer of dead skin that's protecting the virus so that these ingredients can actually get down into the wart itself and kill the virus the mechanism of the virus as I just went over is that it is inside your skin cells and it's multiplying which is the bump or callus by changing the pH which is what the baking soda does held in place by the castor oil which doesn't evaporate you actually suffocate and kill that virus so the skin cells that are dead begin to absorb the castor oil and the high pH baking soda which kills the wart so over a matter of days the ward is dead your skin begins to heal and it falls off it's that simple painless no bleeding no cutting no burning no freezing none of that stuff super home remedy super easy castor oil is super easy to find by the way I'll put a link to that in the video description box for you as well now the next thing you're going to do is make sure that you massage this the next thing you're gonna make sure that you do is massage the mixture into the ward for about a minute not hard you just want to kind of massage it down into that skin that you just scratched open with the needle you're going to apply a band-aid to that overnight keep that changed out a couple of times a day band-aid needs to stay on it all the time so that that it's mixture is held in place on top of the wart and I promise you the warts going to begin to change and one day you're gonna notice that it begins to kind of swell up becomes kind of moist moisturized and then what's going to happen is the virus is going to die and then the war it will fall off and you'll be scar free so we just figured out a way to take a nasty subject to talk about a big problem that a lot of people have and make it easy to fix and by the way this also works on moles and I did a video on that you can check out and I'll put the link to that in the video description box also for more videos on how to treat skin conditions naturally with natural approaches and things that you have known I'm in a couple of videos right over here so do me a great big favor if this is helpful to you smash that like button hit the notification bell and I'll see you over on the next one", "Q6CZt0dmsZc": "okay well everyone thank you very much for joining us on monday evening and taking time to to be with us i i appreciate it and i'm going to try to make it worth your while and share some things that might uh be practical for you in the future so the uh this this one this session will be a little bit different than the others in that the other one's kind of centered around types of alcohol that was was kind of the brainchild or the idea of more boston it was a good way to organize this series by types of alcohol so we did vodka in the first one whiskey and the second one gin and the third this one is going to focus more on uh party prep and tail and the sp and especially tailgate prep and uh that uh is kind of we're in the the heart of the season although this is an unusual year so hopefully this will help you going forward whenever things do get back to normal so uh that's that's going to be the theme of this one so we will make some drinks but if the uh the intent of this is more about some techniques and tricks that that we might be able to leverage to help us whenever to take the stress off and to help us to get ready for these these types of events when we've got people to entertain and we want to make them drinks or we want to take our drinks with us to entertain people when we're at a football game or other things as we'll learn this evening so i have a couple couple uh surprises that that you might not think about where you might be able to use this um but we'll uh we'll see if it helps you with any any ideas going forward so as as always just want to start off real real quick because safety is important so just keep in mind a lot of these drinks tonight are going to be more than than one standard serving of alcohol some of them might be two or even three standard servings of alcohol and most people can metabolize one standard serving of alcohol per hour and after that you're you are effectively legally intoxicated so you should be driving but beyond that you know even as you rack up more and more uh with within a short amount of time that's where you can get the undesirable effects of alcohol so keep that in mind with your guests the standard serving sizes are 12 ounces of beer four ounces of wine and one and a quarter ounce of 80 proof liquor which most of the liquors we deal with or 80 proof or 40 alcohol or one ounce of 100 proof liquor so if you're mixing two or three of those portions as we will be with a lot of these drinks tonight keep in mind you're already in two two and a half maybe even three standard servings and so that that's going to put you potentially over the edge for for being legally intoxicated and will also go towards your your tolerance so i always like to start with safety and the previous sessions that we have some of them have been recorded and i believe they're out on on vimeo you will not there's no prior knowledge required you haven't if you're joining this one is your first one that's not a problem you could always go back and look at some of the topics uh we will try to go uh and cover everything in a way that if you missed some of them it won't it won't impact your your ability to learn here and if you have questions as we go along please interrupt me shout over me get carrie's attention or if you have questions please stop me it's always better if it's interactive this is i have it set up so i can lecture i have probably more than an hour's worth of material but uh if if you uh it's better if you if you stop me and get your questions answered uh because you can learn as more or more uh doing it that way so uh please don't hesitate to to stop us but just a quick quick review of what we went through the most each time we try to cover a couple important points so in the first session which focused on vodka the uh the important points were number one safety which we always review that at the start of each session number two the the fundamentals of bartending so the the the uh uh five clears so we call them the five clears and they're missing from this table and we'll find out why in a minute why the five clears are usually five clicks plus whiskey are usually up here when we start uh you'll see why in a few minutes why they're not here but the five clears are gin rum tequila triple sec vodka and those are the five and then whiskey and those those six lickers will give you you can do dozens of drinks with those basic liquors and uh that's that's why they they are important and that's part of the fundamentals in less than one we reviewed some common bar wear you know what a martini glasses versus what collins glasses that type of thing uh and we reviewed free pouring technique which we will do a real quick brush on that as we get into the lesson today but those are some of the common themes uh that are those are the were the important points from from session one on on vodka episode two was whiskey and so we had a couple interesting things there number one the spelling itself w h w-h-i-s-k-e-y versus w-i-s-k-y we talked about that why that is an actual point of distinction and a difference uh we talked about the fact that the most important ingredient in making whiskey is actually time not necessarily a physical ingredient although physical ingredients and geography also factor into whiskey making so whiskey is one of the most complicated liquors that there are because there are so many rules about how you have to make it in terms of ingredients the amount of time it needs to age the geography where it needs to be distilled and bottled and aged and so much so that we actually during that lesson if you remember we had we made a venn diagram of whiskey because it's such a complicated topic so we had that during the lesson uh because there's there's so many crossovers with the different types um episode three we went over gin and probably the most important point in that one is that the uh the most important ingredient in gin is juniper berries and in fact that's the only thing that's required it's far less complicated to make gin there's far less rules and regulations there's almost no geographical restrictions no ingredient restrictions other than the fact that in order to be called gin it should have at least some amount of juniper berries in the distilled uh liquor after after you steep it in the liquid after it's after it's distilled so because it's much more simpler it's much it's a much more simple set of uh liquors the biggest lion's share of it that you will see on store shelves and really worldwide is london androgen so because it's it's so simple and there's such a critical mass around that instead of a venn diagram we ended up with the gin solar system where london dry gin is the sun and all the other types of then are like little tiny planets orbiting the london dry gin sun and so that's basically the the top or the uh the critical point that we talked about uh in the gin episode and so that brings us to today's episode so today's episode on party and tailgating bartending uh the the things the important two important things that that i want to bring to focus today are that when you're dealing with tailgate and party these are the two constraints that you have time and space and this actually this this is also a factor for commercial bartenders especially time because they got to be able to produce drinks quickly so you know dozens or you know maybe a hundred drinks an hour in some commercial bartending settings they have less constraint on space and their space is optimized and to to do that but in certain scenarios that we're going to go over today you have very little of both of these or you may be constrained on more so on one than the other so we're going to talk about how to deal with those so bartenders lean on their training in order to negotiate and get around these two constraints but we'll also give you some tools here that will enable you to uh to help uh alleviate these and it will eliminate your stress it'll increase the amount of time that you have to spend with guests and friends and it will also uh increase the enjoyment that you get that you get out of your party so in terms of time so and i'll keep an eye on on that myself today uh the number one thing you can do uh to to make sure that you're that you're you have uh enough time when you're at your event whether it be a party at your house or a tailgate is you gotta make sure you have everything you need in advance so think about it think about put yourself in game day you're you're at the tailgate and you're making drinks you're making that first drink for for the person think about what you're actually going to do and you might want to practice it memorize the ingredients you don't want to be thumbing through your phone or sheets of paper trying to get the proportions you want to know that in advance i you want to prepare your drinks in advance if you if you can and we'll show you a couple ways to do that make pre-made portions of pre-made drinks you just kind of pour out uh if you are still mixing some drinks on the fly which you might be certainly in a party scenario you want to use shortcuts so we've talked about some shortcuts in the past so you've got drink mixers you don't you do not have to make your drinks from scratch or the classic way some of the drinks will make the classic way just to show you what's in them but you don't need to stick to that and you just still get a tasty drink out of it so you want to use shortcuts you want to use pre-made mixes things like that to to help you out you want to limit your menu so you don't want to have to you don't want to be able to come with like two dozen drinks uh where if you do make sure you know how to do that effectively with maybe a half dozen ingredients so some of that again is the training and the experience that you might have but the other the other way especially as you're building that repertoire and that knowledge is just limit the menu people will drink what you offer and if not they they just weren't gonna do it anyway they'll find something something else to drink um practice your recipes in advance so if you if you're going to make something new it's just like anything else if you're going to cook something new for dinner you're probably going to try it out and see how it tastes before you make it for a bunch of your friends same thing with same thing with tricks make it at home before you before you try to serve it to someone that'll also get you get you into knowing what the timing is or the ingredients or how to physically how to make it and how to present it so that it looks nice and um we'll also talk a little bit about disposable bar wear which can save you both time both before and after in the cleanup and you know where to get some of that stuff and how to use it where to use it and and how that can help you um with really both time and space management so when we get into the space and uh that is why instead of all the bottles we have a small cooler in front of us this evening as we get into this discussion so uh with space number one thing you can do is practice fitting everything that you need into a small cooler and start with a smart small cooler so uh limit yourself to this and then when you move up the scale a little bit and that's what we'll do a couple minutes from now when you move up the scale to a bigger cooler you've got a lot more real estate to work with but if you know what you're doing here you can definitely scale that up to here very easily and and that will uh improve and it will increase what you can offer so uh the this is a six quart core and so let's just open it up and see what we might even be able to fit in okay so first of all you're you're usually gonna have ice packs in it so what i can recommend this is a gel ice pack so you can see this thing is very flexible it squishes and so it's helpful because you you can conform it around what whatever else you have in your cooler versus if you have a rigid ice pack like something like this or sometimes they're like cute like this these way they freeze that's the only way they're gonna fit in here so if you can fit it in great but if not you're gonna be you're gonna have to work around whatever ice packs you have so that's that's one thing that i could recommend is find some some gel ice packs and these can you can get these uh you can get these at sporting goods stores uh this these ones actually came i think from the schwann man so we must have had some schwan's food delivered at some point and these were in the the uh the food and so we saved them because their hand so also in here just happen to have if you if you have a couple beers you can put that in there or what you might want to have if you're mixing things is some soda water or some lemon lime soda or coke if you're doing ramen cokes or something like that um so we've got room for that we have a one quart bottle in here and we'll see later if we have time uh how you can scale up your drink mixes so and remember how we talked about pre-made drinks this is where they'll go and a double thing that you want to do both with this depending on the type of drink that you're making and what you're going to see in the next size up cooler freeze deer alcohol if you if if you can because what that will do is that's almost like having built-in ice ice bags in your cooler if you make a drink that is strong enough it will not freeze or at worst it'll freeze in kind of like a slushy state and it'll thaw very quickly and you can you can pour it out now there's certain drinks you don't want to if you pre-mix them you don't want to freeze them because they will freeze solid if the alcohol content is high enough and depending on the setting that your freezer is at you will be able to freeze that and still have a liquid or at least a slushy form and then it almost doubles as an ice pack in your cooler so not only are you not so instead of this this gel ice pack you could put a one quart bag of ice cubes and not have the ice and not have your drinks suck all the heat out of your ice cubes so that you're left with a puddle you may actually have some ice cubes that you could use to serve your drinks with afterwards so i mean we got some other things in here we got some straws we've got fruit we've got shot glass toothpicks you know there's a way depending on how you pack your cooler depending on what you need maybe you need a knife for your fruit put that in there a can opener a wine wine key uh anything you need and here is the one that what this is going to become very important during the lesson so this is a four ounce these are mini ball jars i found these and this is what it looks like these are walmart it's like about four dollars for this and they are there's four of them and they're around they're about four ounces that's what it looks like so that's sitting in the bottom of our core and we'll find out next why why this little guy is important or can be important if you want to make single fair drinks on the go so that's yours that's your six quart cooler so this is more like this is kind of like a one bedroom apartment all right now we're going to go to more like a 2 000 square foot branch this is not so this is not even the size of a lot of coolers that you'd see out there like yeti's it's not a fancy cooler this is just the [ __ ] this was actually i got this when i was up in rochester wegmans but they're probably you could probably get them at you know like fourth of july uh at giant eagle or dicks i'm sure they have have some it's a 30 quart cooler but let's see what we have in here all right so we didn't have our five clears sitting out at the start of the discussion because guess why we got them all in here so here's our rum here's our gin here's our tequila here's our vodka here is all right now we've got this blue liquid in here and this is going to be another important part of the discussion later on today uh since his eaters are these are irish uh themed drinks we're gonna need blue curacao instead of triple sec it's almost the same thing so instead of that we got that we even have a couple drink mixers in here we've got our sweet and sour mix we've got a a mix that we could use for uh this is this is um ginger beer and lime this is for making mules so mules have gotten very popular in the last couple years and you can make a bunch of different types of drinks so you can make bourbon-based vodka-based even tequila-based or or i'll mention today irish whiskey-based a uh an irish mule out of this mixer that you have in your cooler and we we've got our whiskey too so you have an entire bar in here and i didn't show you there was a lot of space in there that there was still still available so you could have ice in there so when you're going to the tailgate you try to freeze your own ice but what i'd actually recommend it's very inexpensive bag ice like this is about two dollars this is a seven pound bag i think sheet sells it in similar size in about an eight pound bag but it fits very easily into here you can fit probably two bags of ice in here and still fit not all of these but most of these depending on what you want what you need if you're really gonna need a lot of ice you can fit that in there as well or you can just put all your stuff in there including all your mixers and all of your tools in there and just have your ice in a separate board now when you get a bag of ice like this i'm sure most people have seen sometimes they're hard to deal with at first they have a tendency when you get them from the store they're frozen into solid mass so what you're going to want to probably do while you're still home and you've got clean smooth surfaces you're going to want to drop it a couple times on your kitchen table or if it's really frozen solid drop it on the on a clean floor or something like that to get it loosened up now the other thing about these is they all they always come crimped with like these metal things and you can't even use pliers to get that metal thing off so you got to kind of work it off and i would recommend doing this ahead of time because otherwise if you're like me what you end up doing you get to where you're going you're excited it's game day we end up doing inevitably you rip the bag open and the ice is sometimes it gets contained sometimes it's not sometimes it gets contaminated so which what you want to do loosen it up don't drop it on like pavement or concrete because what that is when it drops and if it drops on pavement or concrete it puts little pin holes in the bag so the bag will leak when when it gets water when it gets melted and it it could allow contamination in so you want to keep the bag as intact as possible take that crimp off you gotta kind of just work it regularly it only takes a minute but do it ahead of time and then substitute a twisty tie with it because then throughout your tailgate or your party you've got a relatively clean vessel you can use a scoop to get that in and keep it sanitary this is the ice you want to be using to mix your drinks with you might have ice in there that's just for cooling if you don't have a bunch of cooler packs or you don't freeze your alcohol into you know kind of self-made ice packs you may have ice in there but you may not want to be using that ice if it's you know if it's contaminated or dirty or you know you don't want to be putting your hands in it so that's how to that's how to kind of keep your eyes relatively clean and have a dedicated bag of device you're going to use to serve if you pack your cooler efficiently you can get a whole lot of stuff in there and you end up with something that's this is really not that much space so you know there's two reasons you may want to do that number one you probably don't want to be carrying this all the way across campus or you know even if you have a vehicle that's not the only thing you're going to pack when you're going to a game you've got luggage and all kinds of other stuff so you may not want to use a whole you know 120 court yeti taking up space in your trunk or you know you may need another cooler for food or you could take half of this and put your you know your your um bar in half of it food and the other half but this this this gives you a lot of a lot of space if you if you think about it ahead of time so that's some ideas about how to to get around the the space constraint that you might have in a a tailgate or a party because if you think about maybe even like your kitchen you haven't you're having people over that your bar is not your own the only thing you have you may have in your kitchen you've got a whole bunch of food uh you may have only so much space that you can dedicate to your bar so you're still gonna have space constraints they may not be the same as they are at a tailgate but you're always going to have some level of space constraints so think about how to organize your things uh effectively so that so it alleviates that okay i want to spend real quick we're about halfway through the hour i want to spend a real quick a few minutes on disposable bar wear that you that you can use when you're specifically for tailgates or at a party where it'll make cleanup a lot easier for you and uh that's you don't have to worry as much about contamination um when you've got disposable so the other thing is just because you're at a tailgate doesn't mean that presentation isn't important so you're going to take the time to make drinks maybe make them nice nicely presented color them right mix them right and if what you're going to end up doing is put it putting them in the equivalent like the 16 ounce equivalent of this you know the solo cup which there's definitely nothing wrong with the solo cup but for the same effectually effect effectively the same effort you could have a margarita and put it in like an actual margarita glass or a martini and put it in what looks like a martini glass so these things come in packs like this i used to get them at party city and i'm not exactly sure i don't know well i haven't seen them at walmart because i haven't bought them in a while but they come in bags of 20 like this so you they are stacked like this you can get them you put them together and then you can have a uh martini glass or margaret glass or any other kind of glass that you want the other thing you you can see out there is you can use these these shot glass cups or at the dollar store they have these they're nice clear shot glasses so if you're if you're making a shot or cordial that has some nice color to it or you want to show that off you can have these glasses that are that looks like they might be nice glass bar wear so i mean same thing uh and at the end of the day it's it's it's the convenience of it but just know that you do not have to sacrifice your presentation just because you need the uh the flexibility or the safety of something that's not gonna break if it drops during the during the game or out on your out on your porch um there's there's you don't have to sacrifice uh sacrifice that uh presentation aspect of it uh just because you're you need to be portable or disposable so uh that's that's with that so um these are these are also ones that that i found that are kind of a nice upgrade so this is a nine ounce glass what you would typically see in a nine ounce glass something that looks like this this is kind of just a tall and skinny but it's like it's cloudy so this is the same thing this looks like more like a cocktail glass it looks like an actual glass even though it's plastic so same thing 9-ounce glasses but and for roughly the same price these are maybe a little more expensive per per unit but it still gives you uh still gives you an option okay so let's get let's transition into couple of drinks then so let me let me pause there for a minute and just see if there are any questions up to this point yeah if anybody has any questions just ask john because i inadvertently cancelled the chat so there's no chatting going on so uh feel free just to yell it out john will gladly answer your questions yeah shout over me but i'll pause and shut up for just a few seconds here i'll kind of take some room and uh if anyone has anything let me know i just want to know if you're going to have a party at your house soon so you can be a bartender for the rest of us you just because you have everything like ready to go that's a really good idea we could do that we could do that at some point that would that would actually be kind of fun i don't know when the guidance when the university is going to allow for that but that would be fun it would be fun all right i'll let you go john yeah um okay so the first the first drink that we're going to make today we're actually going to circle back and cover something that we we kind of ran out of time during the whiskey session and i really felt remiss about it so it is the manhattan because the manhattan is probably the most quintessential whiskey drink that exists it's the martini of uh it's the martini of of whiskeys so you can make it with a bunch of different you make it a bunch of different ways we're just going to kind of make a stock manhattan today but we're going to put a little twist on it it's going to be a golf cart manhattan so and we'll get to that in a few minutes so when you're when you're golfing remember we talked about talk about constraints you have both time and space constraints when you're golfing so usually best best you could hope for is you bring your cooler with you and that's about all you get so that's why this six inch this six uh quart cooler is is a good demonstration item because that's about all you can take with you if you want to bring it in with your with your golf cart and usually most people just bring some cans of beer but let's paint this picture for you all right it's the second hole and you're already like four over and there's already people behind you that are like wanting to play through and this is only the second hole of 18 so you really need a manhattan you really need one but you can't have one or can you so we'll we'll find out how to make that happen and uh with our with our golf cart manhattan here so which first first thing you need you need to know how to make a manhattan first so we'll make it kind of the regular way and we'll start out start with your shaker and we're gonna get some ice here and here's our portable scooper these are also i found these at the dollar store they're like a it's like a two pack you get like a small one and a large one in the in the two pack and this one's perfect because it's like travel size so this is a good find and good to put with your your travel kit so we'll not be doing this from the golf course by the way because we already talked about the fact that you know you have neither time nor space for this so but this is just to demonstrate how to make it happen and because we didn't get to when we did start off with that and we're gonna so manhattan's if you if you do it straight up so we're gonna do this one straight up as opposed to on the rocks so we'll use our martini glass we've got our ice in manhattan you can use any kind of whiskey that that you that you want and you'll use about two ounces of whiskey so our free pour technique for those of you who remember it's a four count and that that gets you one ounce of alcohol so manhattan we're going to do two ounces of alcohol a half ounce of sweet vermouth and then a little bit of bitters and a little bit of cherry juice in this in this particular recipe so we'll start off we're going to put a uh eight count because that's two ounces of whiskey one two three four five six seven eight and then we're going to add one half ounce of sweet vermouth and this particular one is antiqua formula this i would definitely recommend this over it is pricey versus the other uh vermouth that are out there but it's actually worth it you could drink this stuff straight or i've even put it over ice cream before it's very it's very tasty it's i i don't often go for the like the higher ended with liquors but this is worth the price so you're going to put a half ounce which is just a two count so one two of the sweet remover and then some people like a little bit of cherry juice from the maraschino cherry go real light on it half a teaspoon at most so i just do a quick splash of the of the cherry juice and then you're going to while you got it you put your cherry maraschino cherry in your glass here for your garnish on your manhattan and what is this substantive spill and the other uh ingredient that is in a classic manhattan is bitters so the most common type is angostura bitters and go real easy with this stuff two dashes three at absolute most you'll ruin your drink pretty quickly with this stuff it's very very powerful very very bitter this is not the only type of bitters that are out there there's been like a bitters explosion in the last decade or so different companies have gotten into it there's like all kinds of fruit flavors all kinds of crazy spices and you name it they have a bitter sport but this is the original this is like 150 years old basically has uh citrus peel in it is the prevalent taste it's like it's like an orange like a bitter orange and so two dashes in a manhattan one two more if you if you really if you're really into it but definitely for most people no more than two or even one dash if you want to go conservative so take that up pour that out and this is your classic manhattan now we already said earlier do not you're obviously not going to attempt this while you're golfing don't even attempt this anywhere else if you especially if you're going to make these kind of importable single stick servings so that is when you factor in the ice melt a little over three ounces you got two ounces of liquid uh a half ounce of the sweet vermouth and a little bit of ice melt off so you've got five volume a little over three ounces here so you're going to take your four ounce jar and you're just going to transfer this in here and i'm going to do it over this thing back here just in case there's still somewhere and you transfer the cherry and all into there and voila you now have a manhattan but that's not it so when you go to when you go to serve it if you want to even make it even make the presentation better so you've got it you now have these you can and i mean you can fit a lot of these in a six quart cooler i mean you can fit dozens of these so if you want to have one or one or two rounds for a for an 18 round you you can have manhattans all day long so one way to to kind of make the presentation yet you might want to start with a cocktail napkin and since we're since we're celebrating notre dame the irish you've got cupcake you can use cupcake holders this this one's like a green tint but i've got golden um golden blue ones so you kind of just put it in there put your cocktail napkin give them a straw hand it to them and away you go and that's how you get manhattan on a golf course and uh that's uh one way to become portable and defeat time and the space factor and yet still have a nice uh nicely presented drink and by the way this will not freeze so you can put this in there in a the coldest freezer setting you have and then just the night or the morning up just transfer it into your cooler and this will be as cold as temperature in your freezer below freezing for hours now i will warn you the the cherry itself will be solid so don't slug it and chomp into the cherry because the cherry will be frozen when it's that cold but it will still be liquid so that's that's uh our number one drink uh now uh the second drink we're gonna make so now we're gonna try to get into the notre dame and irish themed drinks so this is more like the tailgate portion of the uh of it um so two drinks we're gonna make are the south bend iced tea and leprechaun lemonade and these are not these are not uh original drinks these are shameless uh these are shameless rip-offs of classic drinks uh the south bend iced tea being long long island iced tea and leprechaun lemonade is actually lynchburn lemonade but in both cases we're going to do a critical substitution so remember i mentioned earlier that [Music] your five clears one of your five clears is triple sec which is a an orange flavored uh look uh liqueur it's like a schnapps it's like 30 proof so it's really 15 alcohol so it's about it's like about the the strength of a strong wine this will freeze uh but but none of the other liquor liquors will so the substitution that you're going to have is blue curacao so blue curacao is it's almost exactly the same thing as triple sec it's an orange flavored liqueur it has has low proof and it's very sweet so when you add it to drinks it makes me sweet but the key difference is it's blue now why is that important for our drinks today because long island iced teas are brown because you splash the last ingredient that you splash them with is coca-cola and that just gives the illusion of its iced tea and it does a little taste a little bit like iced tea but that's mostly because of the sweet and sour mix that you're putting into it in combination with the flavor of the liquors the brown gives it that optical illusion and so because we drink with our eyes before we even drink with our our taste buds that gives it even more of an illusion that it tastes like iced tea well south bend iced tea still tastes a little bit like iced tea but it's green and why is it green because instead of putting coke as our last ingredient and using triple sec we substitute blue curacao and when you mix that with yellow this is our shortcut by the way this is the uh the sweet and sour sour mix this is yellow so when you mix the yellow and the blue you get green but i'll warn you this uh depending on the brand you get some of them are more powerful or more have more blue dye in them than others this one seems to have a lot of blue dye in it so when i'm mixing it i'm having to mix a lot more of the sweet and sour mix in order to get the color to balance to a nice green one way to get around that and if you don't have blue curacao or if you don't really want to keep blue curacao and triple sec around you can just keep triple sec and just add a little tiny bit of blue food dive if you've got it to your end end result and that actually may be an easier way to achieve the result because then you can mix it with clears you don't have to worry as much about the strength of the of the blue dye and the blue curacao so and then you can just drip in the uh the blue food coloring into the uh into the triple sec it'll give you the same result so we're going to uh mix up a uh mix up one of these and so long island iced teas are made of equal parts of your five clears so gin rum vodka triple sec and what in this gym gin rum vodka triple sec uh tequila tequila yes thank you so your five clears very good thank you so i'll oh so you're going to mix all five in equal parts and then the balance is going to be roughly roughly equal part of this of the sweet and sour mix and then with it with a again with the uh um long island iced tea the finishing effect is that splash of of coke that gives it the brown um the brown uh color so in this case the we're going to substitute this for your fifth ingredient so here is a parlor trick that i'll show you real quick that some bartenders use to get on that time okay and because this is irish we're going to use an irish coffee mug to perfect so let's go around with ice as well and i don't know if you can kind of see that the go irish sign maybe i'll just kind of take this down for a minute slide it to the side okay so there is our irish coffee mug here is our here is our mixing vessel and the trick so i think it might have been last last time someone had asked about the poor stalkers and i had said yeah you can you can get these my favorite ones are the plastic ones these these can be had for 99 cents i did look into that at the fine line just the state liquor stores so they're they're pretty universal these ones happen to be red usually they're black but um the trick that you can try and i would advise you to practice this ahead of time if you're going to try it maybe have a little safety net is what some bartenders will do when they're making a long island iced tea is to do the shortcut and to save themselves time they'll grab four they'll break four out of the five bottles or some of them will even attempt to grab all five at the same time and this is it's a half the recipe is a half ounce of each of the five clears so you're gonna do so for half ounce two seconds so two seconds for all four of these into the glass one two and so there should now be two ounces of fluid in this in the uh the pour or in the mixing glass and then i did i'm doing this separately just to show you like the the uh this would normally be triple sec but you're going to use two ounces or half ounce or two uh two seconds of the blue curacao so one two all right and you're going to mix this up and with the ice melt up you're going to get i'm going to show you real quick here's our three ounce mark did you do it right you should get close to three ounces of fluid with the ice melt off on this and we're pretty close there three ounces so we'll transfer this into our our glass normally just take it straight from the sacrum port right into there and the balance of it is going to be sweet and sour so you're going to fill that good a good part of the way up all the way up really and then you can splash it if you want to have a little bit of fizz on it splash it with some soda because and we'll give it a little bit of fizz then because this is south bend iced tea instead of long island iced tea we of course are going to use a lime instead of a lemon to finish it off and garnish and there we go we've got y yeah that's awesome john so we've got stop bend ice tea nice right so now we we are we're definitely not gonna have time what i thought about doing is showing you okay and this is just this is just math if you want to do this this this drink especially if you're a little heavy on the the alcohol and you and you don't need as much of the uh because what your limiting factor is going to be is that this sweet and sour mix doesn't have so if you if you mix this and attempt to freeze it ahead of time it will not freeze solid it'll get a little bit slushy but you can mix this up in your proportion so what i would do is this is a one quart container you can get these at walmart and these you know you can fit about four of them into something like this you can fit a lot of them in a bigger in a bigger cooler but if you freeze them they'll stay cold and you'll have uh you'll have pre-made drinks or whatever so not just soft and iced tea you can you can mix up anything that you want margaritas uh anything ahead of time um just be be aware of whether you could freeze it or not based on the alcohol content of whatever you're mixing so where did i go with okay so you're going to want to use one of these and so for this particular recipe this is a 32 ounce so this is this is a one quart 32 ounces so take a little bit of a shortcut do five ounces each of each of the clears so if you're doing long islands do you know triple sec you're doing south end iced teas use the use the blue curacao or like i told you the trick you could still use the triple sec but then finish it off with the blue food dye but do five five ounces of of each of these in of each liquor and that will give you 25 ounces of alcohol and then finish off the rest of it fill it up all the way to the top almost as high as you can go with sweet and sour mix and that will give you a good mix you can freeze it and then you'll be ready to go with uh with your south and nice tea and i mean this stuff will keep in your freezer forever so you can keep this till this coming saint patty's day or the next st patty's day and you'll still have it and it will not go bad and you won't lose any you won't lose a lot of it to alcohol evaporation because it's so cold in your freezer so that's the uh that's south bend iced tea so the next one we're gonna do is leprechaun lemonade which again is shameless filled for from lynchburg lemonade but this is a pretty simple drink same idea here we're going to use a irish coffee mug this one's a little different variety in there and with this with this drink it's a little simpler recipe when i started making this drink i was a little worried that because it's made with whiskey that it would throw the color off but it really doesn't because there's not as much alcohol in this drink so the color of the whiskey does not impact the color of the drink as much as you would anticipate so lynchburg lemonade is one ounce of one ounce of whiskey a half ounce of triple sec and then you fill the rest with a mix and you can kind of do it to your taste of you can use all sweet and sour mix you can you need at least some sweet and sour mix especially to make the color right and give you the lemonade flavor to it but most most of the recipes you see out there will call for like a sprite or some sort of lemon lime soda but you can go 100 of the sweet and sour mix and you could just splash it with with some either some sprite or if you don't have sprite but you could use soda water and it'll give the fizziness effect but you'll still get the taste even if you use 100 sweet and sour so if you don't want to be dragging cans with you or vice versa if you if you want to skip the sweet and sour because you don't have room in your cooler just but you have sprite with you uh you could use that as as the prevailing ingredient so but again taste it beforehand so that you know what your how you're making it but just kind of a regular recipe of this would be one ounce of this which is four counts one two three four of whiskey and then you're going to use again because this is leprechaun lemonade instead of lynchburg lemonade we're going to swap in our blue curacao and so instead of half ounce of triple sec half ounce of blue curacao one two count and that's we're gonna mix that up there is our irish coffee mug here is our okay you get a new sweet and sour mix here's the yellow that's going to turn green and again in most recipes that you see out there you're going to add some sprite to it and you can stir that and again this is a little bluer than it probably should be so uh you'll you'll have to you have to balance that out either by cutting back a little bit on the blue curacao and adding more of the sweet sweet and sour mix that'll make it a little bit greener this one is a little bluish but again the whiskey i was worried when i was when i was practicing making these that they would turn out browner because of the whiskey but they're really not and again with your uh garnish instead of a lemon with lynchburg lemonade which you typically see a lemon sliver slice you cut your cut your lime crosswise like this and get a lime disk and there is your leprechaun lemonade yeah that's awesome john okay so the we are seven o'clock and i've got two other real quick drink uh drinks that i'll i'll do pretty quickly um this next one is actually an original as far as i can so this one is called the steelertini so now we're switching from uh so now we're switching from notre dame tailgates into more like a household party so this one originated at a super bowl party that i had at my house back in 2009 i think when they were playing the arizona cardinals remember the james harrison 100 yard touchdown that was the game where this where this came from so it's very simple drink all it is in my freezer chocolate vodka vanilla vodka and i am actually going to borrow a pour stop red pour stock from this vodka and a black pork stock for the vanilla vodka and start with your shaker because these are frozen you don't even really need ice for this because these were right out of the freezer now flavored vodkas are typically slightly lower in alcohol content than uh so these are these are 70 proof 35 but they still will not freeze they're still very liquid so this proves that you can you can go down to around 30 percent alcohol content before it starts to freeze slushy so you don't even really need ice but if you want to put some light through here like if you don't have it frozen whenever you go to make this or if you if you want it even colder or you want to dilute it a little bit with a little bit of water so that it's not so stiff because this drink tastes very tastes very good it tastes like candy but it will hit you like a ton of bricks because it's essentially all vodka so it's a three ounce string so it's essentially a six count so six counts two and do both at the same time double fisting one two three four five six there's my cap okay so here is our let me rinse up my martini glass now you're tempted to say well that's no big deal it's just chocolate and vanilla vodka mixed together right and free up and to give you three ounces of vodka and glass but here's where here's where it makes the difference peanut m ms you gotta get you gotta cherry pick the right colors so you gotta get red blue and yellow for the steeler hypocycloids those are your olives in your steelertini and there's your straw and if you're concerned about peanut allergies back in 2009 i don't think they had a solution for this yet but nowadays they've got caramel m m's that are the same size as peanut m m's they've got pretzel m ms they've got mint m m's that are the that are the right size olive sized or many olive sized so you can make your hypocycloid steeler martini in any flavor that you want steak steer clear nut allergies if they're an issue i will warn you so this this these colors will bleed in about 10 minutes or so it'll kind of you'll kind of get a nice red yellow and blue effect however if you let it for like 20 minutes or a half hour those colors start to mix and so it ends up starting to be brown so that's the only thing is that these colors from the from the m m's will bleed but that's a festive steel or themed party drink that you can uh you can use and as far as i can tell that one isn't original um the last one and i know it's 705 that i wanted to mention because it's super easy or it can be made super easy again here's your shortcut for a mule this is owen's craft mixers these are about six dollars at uh the state stores or the fine wine and food or fine wine and liquor stores uh owens craft mixers ginger beer and lime so instead of making your your own uh mule mix which is not tremendously difficult to do all it is is lime juice so you can try to use fresh lime or you can use roses lime juice and ginger beer and sometimes you you'll see people use actual some some grated ginger to make it even sharper but the thing with that is number one that's a little labor intensive you might not want to drag all that stuff with you if you're going somewhere so there's your shortcut and with that thing you gotta experiment with that to make sure you get your flavor balance right this makes it right every time when you open this it's carbonated so it's a perfect thing for to make a it gives you the right mule every time all you got to do is adjust how much alcohol and you can use any type of alcohol you can use whiskey in it called a bourbon call it a montana mule you can use vodka call it a moscow mule you can use tequila call it a mexican mule or if you're irish you can use jameson or bushmills and call it an meal and that's a pretty easy one to to end on so i will write 706 so i will leave it open for any questions that anyone has hey john i have a question for you so where do you get the owens uh ginger beer and lime this is just at the uh at the state liquor store so i don't i haven't seen this they may have it at giant eagle i haven't seen it there but i have definitely seen it at all of those like called fine wine and and liquor spirits yeah spine wine and spirits they're in awesome so this is this is one again i don't i'm usually not tremendously name-brand conscious but this is worth six bucks because it will get you the right flavor every single time instead of screwing around with trying to balance the the lime and the ginger and the ginger beer and everything so great all right thanks i have a second question john so when you're when you're popping those straws in those glasses are those just the little uh drink stirring straws yes these i'm not sure i think you could probably get them at that fine line here you can usually get them in the grocery store i think you can get the dollar store as well it's just i mean there's all kinds of different ones there's ones that are like you know they have like blue and red striped down the side that's all it is got it thank you so much john one additional question how many four ounce manhattans have you gotten into a cooler at one time well the the last time the particular golf outing that this was i i did uh manhattan's was like front nine and i think the back nine we i did a second one i can't i'm trying to remember what i did for the back nine it was it was a different drink but i had like eight little eight little jars and they weren't even these nice ones they were like i think they were like like i had like two or three baby food jars and like a couple of them were plastic so they weren't real fancy now one thing i forgot to mention is that there's another couple options if you don't want to go glass if you want to get a disposable route you can get these at walmart so these are five ounce glasses with with tops on them so and this is about i think it's like two dollars or three dollars so there's 25 of them so it's a pretty cost uh it's pretty cheap alternative now i'll say that it's not quite as secure so if you think about what you're going to be doing if you're if you're on a golf cart you're going to be rattling around you're going to sit in your cup holder you're going to be riding the cart on a tilt like this and you know all this so that's why those screw tops are nice these are not quite as secure these are almost like food leftover things but these are five cups but they have tops so they will they don't have straw holes in them so they they'll they'll they'll provide a reasonable amount of spill protection if you want more still protect and this is also you know kind of disposable so you don't have to worry about dragging us home with you um these i i assume john with two uh manhattan's nobody shot park no no well that was not gonna happen no matter what in fact there there's a point of there's a point in which you know like there's like any curve like there's a point of diminishing return so there's a point when the manhattans help you and then when you go beyond that it hurts you so if you limit yourself to one manhattan per nine that seems there's your alternative if you if you want still some kind of security of a lid that snaps on pretty tight in about a four ounce serving there's like these rubbermaid plastic jars that are they're like kind of little tupperware containers and that gives you about the right size so that's that's yet another alternative that you could think you could use for for your golf cart manhattan or whatever i mean it's not that that's just one way to use it but you could do it you could do anything with that you could do martinis with that you could do any kind of mixed drink that you can come up with and package it that way put it in a cooler it doesn't have to be for a golf ball it could be for for anything so um", "6bA54PyCMk0": "[Music] so [Music] so [Music] good morning and thank you for joining me this is laurie of laura's heirloom sewing and today i'm going to do a little video on a couple of things so i don't know if you have a set of these or if you've wondered what they are or if you've wanted a set but didn't really know well could i use them or not use them or just i have no idea what those are why do you have them so they help you make binding and this was a set that all of all of these right here were in one set so the way they work is they they're interesting this one i don't have much luck using it because it doesn't have a channel through which i can stick a pin to pull fabric through now i think in theory it's supposed to just go and i i don't know i've i've really not i've tried to use it once and didn't have much luck so we're going to try it again i'm going to cut a small piece basically what you're doing is you're cutting strips of fabric now you can cut on grain and what you will get a trim like we have over there on that vase that i just did or you can cut it on the bias and one of the really cool things about cutting your fabric on the bias is that you can shape it using your iron as it is being released from this device trim maker i think is what they're called something something along those lines um i will try to link oh i might have bought well i might be able to find them i think i bought mine actually in joanne with a coupon long time ago this may be too thin but the basic idea is that you push it through i might be able to get a pin on the end down there and you're looking for it to come out here and usually what i do is i take a straight pin on these it's a lot easier i push this through and while this looks like that's a device for your thumb to do something it doesn't really other than maybe you know help hold and the whole idea is that you do this at the iron and you don't get burned and i will reinsert it and if you have used one and you've used this little teeny one this is uh um oh do you guys realize i just saw on the bottom is my slot right there what do you know i think i think that's what that's for i believe so look at that okay and you see as it's coming out of this little binder maker it is folding it on top of itself and with one this small it would be impossible to do at the ironing board but i'm going to demo that as well so we might as well use this one and let me okay and the reason excuse my hand the reason that i brought this up is um there are a lot of really good things that you can do with this trim they all they're not all necessary to sewing crafting is is one of the best uses of this trim and with the holidays coming up um it's a great way to use up some of your extra fabric your cabbage and make ribbon trim okay so what i do is i just put my iron here and then i'm trying to get it where i can see what i'm doing and see if you can see what i'm doing i don't know if it's working let's see right there and then you just pull with this little handle using your iron to just i don't know if you can see that's the only thing let's try some more now this this little bitty one is um a little bit harder to manipulate but it's definitely easier than trying to do this with without the help maybe this is better here like this [Music] foreign okay and you can just turn your iron sideways [Music] like this and then just pull because this can take the heat so i don't know if that's showing up but i'm pulling the trim out on the other side yeah i think it's showing up of my iron and that's why they're metal okay and so here we have this is still hot this is what just came out from under the iron but so you can see it is pretty much perfectly formed and it's really tiny and it would be great um you know just to stitch it down you could do a zigzag stitch right across that and then you have a nice little piece of ribbon trim i use these to tie around vases if you want some quick and easy you know gifts that are super appreciated i mean trust me they really are um bases from you know jars that you've saved um with a ribbon tied around they look so cute be aware that the one that you were just using will be hot but they do they look really cute you can take them take anyone fresh flowers from your own garden stop at the grocery store and put some fresh flowers so if you have these or you have wanted tech to get them and didn't know if they would be useful i know they're great for quilters a whole lot of other projects do super super well with each of these and all of these sizes and honestly this was the first time i'd ever used this one because until today i'm i kid you not i did not know that that had the little slot on the bottom um i plan to cut fabric for each one of these sizes and we'll just see how how it looks all right so i have this fabric i have this beautiful fabric and of course the pink fabric so we've already used the green i will put this here i think the yellow i will do this lovely vintage rose i'm not really sure if that's what it's called and as far as choosing the size i just kind of go based on this i have no idea if this is right but it's the way i do it based on this opening on the back slightly bigger but not too much bigger because as it folds in you want it to meet in the middle like that right there so let's just give this a quick measure oops so here is the fabric and it looks like the fabric is just like a hair bigger but not by much so you honestly could just measure it based on that measurement right there just the width of this to end up with a perfectly aligned where the center is exactly matching up with the fold like that okay so i just kind of take this and a marking pin and i just mark it close to the where i want to start cutting the fabric and again there's probably you know 100 other better ways to do this okay and i don't have my cutting mat available to me at the moment so i'm just going to tear oh i'm going i'm going the wrong way so we'll do it this way so i need to press this since i did tear and then we'll run it through the yellow let me get you set up over there okay remember on the larger sizes like this yellow we have um that slot is on the front so you'll need a pin and we'll just push that through and then i just take a straight pin any any straight pin will do and you'll be able to see that you can hold you know grab onto that fabric and just and then it just comes right out through that opening right there all right now i'm going to turn this so that this point is facing my iron like that now with the alyssa unless i take off the eye touch i can keep my iron down if i turn that off and then all i have to do is just pull and press and when the fabric starts to emerge from this other side over here i can just pull that and i'm not pulling it real fast i'm just kind of slowly slowly letting it come through and there we go so now we have this size and that's just so simple and easy i'm i could really do this almost all day and just create ribbon after ribbon after ribbon and move the iron oops i just find that it works a little bit better for me if i just set the iron here and then oh i forgot to turn off my eye touch and then just pull on the fabric and then i get a nice tape or ribbon it's definitely a little bit smaller than i had intended however that is still great and that starch really did give it some good body okay and then the final larger one is the blue just a slight little amount just kind of pull it that'll help kind of get that first fold in the right place okay so i really love the way this works it's just great for trim making i have not burned myself once and if i would be doing this for any other project my fingers would just be blistered by now okay i forgot to turn this back on and scorch my ironing board cover over there and here is the pink daffodil which is just precious i love these i think they're they're a great use of cabbage okay guys so i have the little blue bow and as you can see i used kind of a contrasting kind of a contrasting thread so i've also done this and i kind of did a wavy zigzag so i was going back and forth like this and now i'm going to do a really large um straight stitch and i'll show you why in just a minute it's going to pull this up and kind of ruffle it so you'll see what that looks like okay so the other thing i wanted to point out is when you're doing something like this if you want it roughly just hold your finger behind your presser foot and it will kind of push it up like that now i need to pull on the bobbin thread if i pull on the needle thread it will lock my stitches and that's not what i want see how it's gathering [Music] right so now if i want to i can take this little blue bow that i made and attach it by stitching it or hot glue if i chose to a little green and i have a unique but cute bow for a package and the same thing you know with the pink you could do a pink bow if you wanted to or you could tie this around a jar like we did earlier for a gift of flowers okay so you might remember this is my button jar and at one time this was a flower vessel that i used to send flowers over with my youngest daughter this ribbon has not been folded like this or this fabric this was just a little piece of flannel that i tied into a knot and kind of frayed these edges but look how simple these are to switch out so if i wanted to i could add this and have like a matching set or i could do something completely different i would have to fold this down to get it to fit around the neck or i could do a little roughly which i think i like this is too cute the pink and just slip it behind like i did on that on the earlier vase entire bow moving on so these i need to put back i am going to do a garden tour today uh but i'm kind of waiting for the weather to decide what it's going to do when i first started out my day it was very cloudy and then it went into bright full sunshine i mean the sky was blue i didn't see any clouds and i was out there walking around and i thought there's too many shadows it wouldn't work well right now so then i took bam bam for a walk around the block and got the mail that i haven't picked up for a couple days and came back home got settled in went outside um gathered up these and decided oh it's perfect for a garden tour right now came inside to get the camera and this is what has happened see it's all cloudy and yucky so we're just going to do a little bit more laurie's heirloom sewing side and then as the day progresses if we lose these clouds or the cloud cover burns off then we'll do a three acre lake discussion and then the garden tour of shabby versailles and if that wasn't confusing oh you're way better off than i am all right so i finally finished apple butter that i was working on so it's finally done i'm really happy with the way it turned out and i am going to press it i just took it out of the hoop a few minutes ago so the next one in line is the sweet tea which is right here which i wrote up the other day the only thing i'm not too thrilled about is the fact that there's one lemon and i need like a glass of tea or maybe a there's no lemon in fact i'm going to take the lemon off there's no lemon in sweet tea that's silly okay so this one is done i need to oh come up with some kind of a sweet tea design let's think about this sweet tea doesn't normally come served in a tea cup it is generally in a glass with ice um [Music] i don't know i'm gonna have to think for a little while okay so one idea is a um a little dish of sugar cubes and i think i will tr uh put a a glass right here with with perhaps tea we'll see what it looks like and there's my sugar cubes okay so while we're on the topic of this the other one is going to be biscuits [Laughter] [Music] okay guys so this is the september garden tour it's going to be kind of noisy because you know we have airplanes flying overhead but we'll just have to do the best we can so this is blueberry manor we've been working i'm sure you can tell we've been working out here this mum has like tripled in size from last year it was just a small little clump and i don't know what happened i think i plan i planted it over here in blueberry manor and everything always does well in this area i don't think it suffers from any kind of soil issues i mean look at the cosmos they have trunks i'm kind of taming back the lamia that had completely filled in this area i wanted it to kind of go more this way and less this way so i'm down to a small little section and it'll just keep going so i'm not too worried about it this is mrs tingley the camellia that we had in the front she's been kind of recovering um the front has verticillium bacteria in the soil and it's a real problem because of the over abundance of watering that is done out in that area so she suffered from chlorosis and the reason for that is if the soil if the ph of the soil is not adjusted properly the plant root system cannot absorb the nutrients namely iron from the soil because it is bound up in that ph so taking her out of that soil and amending the soil that she was in in the pot and making sure that her water was regulated hopefully i mean as you can see we have a whole bunch of buds and new growth look at that new growth right there and typically this variety blooms in november so we're hoping really hoping and then you can see that this we have started working on this area right here and we're hoping to turn this into a cut flower bed we have a pumpkin [Applause] right here [Applause] if i can see i'm kind of blinded by the sun but there's that pumpkin right there and the vine is growing right up into and out of the roadie right there [Applause] okay and then i really can't see but i'm just gonna kind of point out this is red prairie fire grass it is a perennial and i'm not to be honest i don't know what this is it was part of the wildflower collection that my oldest daughter sent to me for mother's day and it hasn't bloomed the leaves kind of smell like mint so i don't know but i'm gonna i'm just gonna let it stay this right here is the pot that was as tingly the camellia was in i have a couple surprises over here in shade palace so let me see if i can get this camera okay so this is bells of ireland i planted that from seed these are little petite gladiolas that have come up and look look at this right here i have a lupine finally after all this foliage growth there's an actual bud right there there may be more i don't know that's the only one i have found so far and here we have the i may have i did do a video on the uh sort of the uplift refacing of a couple of things that my youngest daughter who lives in this area did for me this was one of them it was black and she kind of gave it a light dusting that made it look a little bit more like concrete and that is really more my style so i'm happy with that here's another clump of lupine i don't know if i have any buds in this or not but it's very healthy it's growing like crazy and this is more red prairie fire and then we have the tall gladiolus right here that one apparently will be yellow i have no idea that looks like it might also be a yellow there's a couple more hidden throughout here's one right here honestly i can't remember how many of these bulbs i planted it might have been 10. the calla lily has really taken off and i love the variegation on those leaves i think it's really pretty the mandevilla has just taken off there's lots of new buds and healthy healthy green leaves there's an airplane so the lavender is a recent addition i like it right there and it will kind of hang out there a little while after the day lily kind of goes back to bed okay and over here oh i was gonna show you wait a minute here is a viburnum that is just starting to fill out with these beautiful red berries i do need to do a little bit of pruning on this that's my plan and of course there's the way way way over my head limelight that desperately needs fertilizer i've got to get after that that's where i've been working okay ponytail grass has decided to just kind of really do well and there's that viburnum i was talking about earlier it has a different fall growth pattern rather than little tiny red berries it looks like something i'm not really familiar with we'll see what that turns out to be oh and i did plant the recovered begonias i had some begonias that just were struggling due to the way too much water way too much sun which we really didn't have a lot of sun but begonias don't like it so once i got those sorted out i put them in this pot and these are tigridia i'm kind of waiting for them to die back and then i'm going to pull those bulbs store them in the garage probably until november i mean out here in the pacific northwest that's what you do and then i'll plant them probably in the front and here is some more lupine and again i don't know there might be some flower buds in here the one thing about lupin you can always tell oh i feel something you can always tell because of the leaf pattern it's very very unique there's the gara this gara happens to really love this spot this was two plants [Music] it just took off the canes are very healthy looking it has put out new growth like almost every day i see something new so i'm really happy with that and when i get around here this is the new newest and if you don't know this is edelweiss this was one of my mother's all-time favorite it's so unique sorry about the airplanes there's nothing i can do [Music] harley hates them so okay anyway i just kind of tucked it in right here next to the heather which is in front of a linton rose the linton rose is in front of a bleeding heart that is hiding behind this acer maple tree and then over here of course we have monkey flower which again i just adore monkey flower i think it has to be one of my favorites i like the fact that it's kind of a ground cover and it has such a vibrant flower and then in the pot still i have some bacopa that is a perennial here and i don't know what the zone is but whatever zone we are bacopa does do really well that's the white and then of course these are fuchsia and a very specific type of fuchsia there's like you can see there's some new growth right there it will just keep producing until it just can't so it's too cold so do you guys remember when this was just a tomato that i had stuck in the ground it's quite large now i'm very pleased so i don't know if it's going to show yeah i have a tomato right here i have a little cluster of tomatoes and that doesn't look like it's showing right here and then i have some flowers forming here and they're also up there but the main thing i wanted to point out is i've been pruning pretty heavily um i don't want the poor thing to feel like it needs to push growth when you know it's so late in the year and having propagated this from a tomato not seeds but a tomato it's it's amazing to me that it's gotten this far and that it's actually producing fruit but i'm gonna just keep moving you around i don't know if this will show right you know hang on so right here i have what is commonly referred to as a sucker it's growing between two main parts of the tomato so i'm just gonna break that off and i did a pretty heavy prune on it a couple days ago so i'm not really going to prune anymore but anyway i thought i'd show you that and then we'll move on so these two little guys right here are lemon i planted from a lemon seed they're not even considered saplings at this point because they don't have a trunk they basically just have like a little stem but they're doing quite well it will be interesting to see if they form thorns so i don't know and of course these are my other herbs i have um my goodness rosemary and uh parsley and chives and basil is growing underneath the rosemary all right i'm gonna move you to shade palace so this morning when i came out here the fuchsia in this hanging basket looked great several hours later and it looks like i haven't watered it in two weeks and i watered it yesterday hey as well right okay so the japanese hydrangea here has spent blooms and i kind of want to clean it up a little bit it is not a true hydrangea it's a vine so [Music] you can kind of just cut i can see where the new is is the new blooms are coming out or the new buds are coming out if i can get that up where you can see so you do kind of want to be mindful of that and generally all you're doing is just deadheading just kind of clean it up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is a service berry tree and it's got chlorosis chlorosis chlorosis the reason for that is way too much water happens in this area either people water too much or it rains and then they continue to water but anytime you see leaves that have lost their color like those did with a dark green vein down the center that means you're dealing with fluorosis that you have to treat with iron you can kind of tell looks like a lot of leaf curl too that can also be from um earwigs earwigs are real bad about causing that problem um the leaf curl anyway so i may have to treat that one with something i don't like to use chemicals but if i'm gonna you know save the tree i may have to but you can also take off the damaged branches they'll grow back a new branch or two see that discoloration and that dark green vein right down the middle it's kind of funny how things respond i uh i moved a rose and it has just flourished back here and it's in a place that most roses would just absolutely hate but not this one it's doing just fine i'll give you a peek at it there you go okay so before i really end the tour a couple things i wanted to point out if you have a shady spot in your yard where you can provide fresh clean water i do change that water out every day and then once a week i kind of scrub it out with a very mild baking soda and water mixture to keep it clean and every day at least that i'm aware of every day we um my husband and i have our lunch and sometimes dinner out on the deck which is behind me and we get to watch several birds come they love to just sit in this clean cool water sometimes they'll fluff their wings around they just love it and i like the fact that the water is cool it's in the shade almost all day and it's clean i know that they're not getting exposed to chemicals every single solitary day the water is refreshed for them and um on a hot day i might even cool it you know take take a little bit of that water out and put some cooler water in there and then they kind of what they do for me for providing this is they hop around and they take care of the insect population in this area so if i had my druthers i would love to have more bird-friendly features in the different gardens because that's what they do they fly into the big daddy mop head they take care of the insects there they hop around down here i haven't had any problems down here this little acer right sorry i'm trying to hold my gloves under my arm so that little weeping acer i've never had a single issue with it this hanging basket of fuchsias absolutely no problems no white flies no leaf hoppers nothing and the same thing goes true for the bacopa which i was having problems with on the deck it was getting just eaten alive it is on the ground i don't know if you can see that it's in a pot but it's on the ground and the birds just hop around in there and they just literally take care of the problem i have not had a single solitary issue i would love to have more happy birds in my garden for that reason so it's just a thought something people should maybe consider to be good to our little bird friends and with that oh there's one right behind me oh hey sweetheart i'm i'm moving just hang on just a minute that could be a problem okay so anyway with that i will oh did you see it it just flew right by um i will say goodbye and um i will see you in the next video which of course will be tomorrow which is thursday september 3rd i appreciate each and every one of you i hope you have a wonderful day thanks by the way apparently the bees like it too [Music] do [Music] you", "Ddm2gsRUuxM": "I'll even myself

weapon in Mario Kart it may come as a surprise to you but banana peels are one of the best fertilizers out there in fact they're a rich source of nutrients and contain loads of minerals such as potassium phosphorus and calcium that are essential for your plants health there are a couple of methods you can try to see what works best first of all mix some banana peels into your compost pile and they'll add the necessary potassium and phosphorus to promote root development brewing a sort of compost tea is also a great option just drop a few peels into a bucket full of water and let it sit for a couple of days then mix one part banana peel tea with five parts fresh water and water your plants with this mixture once a week if you want something quick and easy then make a banana peel spray this time you'll need a few other ingredients as well apart from the banana peels you'll need some eggshells Epsom salt and water dry the banana peels and eggshells and once they're all dried up grind them together put them in a spray bottle along with the absum salt and fill the sprayer with water make sure to spray the mixture on your plants once a week finally you can make a banana peel vinegar that's great for blueberries and other acid loving plants put the peels in a mason jar and submerge them with water then cover the jar with a cloth and rubber band or a loosely fitting lid let the mixture sit for a week to unlock the nutrients in the peel after a week remove the peels and allow the water to sit covered until the mixture ferments into a vinegar if the mixture seems especially potent dilute it with water right before using so you don't accidentally burn your plants and here are a couple of other reasons why you should keep your banana peels get rid of acne banana peels contain lots of important skin boosting elements and minerals that help reduce inflammation fight off the appearance of pimples and fade acne scarring start by washing your face and then gently rub the inside of the peel all over your skin for about five to ten minutes leave the banana paste on your face for another ten minutes to make sure your skin absorbs all the necessary nutrients you can then wash it off with cold water use this treatment once or twice a week and you'll notice a visible improvement in your complexion you can also add lemon juice to the mix since it's great at brightening the skin and fading scars to do this mash up some banana peels beforehand and then combine 1 tablespoon of mashed peels with one tablespoon of lemon juice use the final mixture as a spot treatment and leave it on your troublesome areas for about 10 to 15 minutes then rinse it off with warm water repeat this once or twice a week as well and these aren't the only banana peel recipes for

residue and dry them with a clean cloth you'll immediately notice the silver will look shiny and bright again this effect will last for a long time but once it starts to fade you can simply repeat the procedure and bring the shine right back to your silver possessions again reduce eye puffiness pretty much all of us these days lead a hectic lifestyle of constant work or study that doesn't leave

bright side of life so you won't miss a thing you you", "G6gZrlaKTg8": "hi guys I don't know what it's like where you live but we went straight from winter to summer like that we had maybe a week of spring but that was it so now it's hot and it's humid and my husband works out of doors and he walks some 14 to 20 miles a day and he needs lots of hydration I like a little variety in the summer as well in the winter I'm okay with just drinking water and my hot teas but in the summer I like a little variety and so does he so I thought I would show you some of our favorite beverages um I start with just glass pictures of water and these are teas but I don't hot to brew my tea I cold brew my tea which is why you'll see I've got two pictures of just cold water and what I do is I just put my ingredients in and I stick them in the fridge and by end of day just stir it up and we've got a really good refreshing beverage that tastes pretty good as well so there's two different ones I'm gonna make because those are our staples and that's what we like the best and so the first one I start with a Lipton tea bag and this is the peach flavor and I know Lipton isn't favored by a lot of people but um I use it for that peach flavor you can use real peaches if you'd like and just some regular black tea your favorite but I'm just showing you what I do in my house so I take one bag of this peach flavored tea and then I take four bags of an organic green tea sorry about the glare and just whatever brand you like this is the one that I find easily at the Walmart it's Organic and I trust it tastes good and so I just take four of the bags and I put them in the water and then I take half of a line that I have just sliced up and then just kind of squeeze it a little so that the juice comes out easily and then I take half a cup of sugar and if you like your tea unsweetened by all means do it unsweetened I use the organic fair trade sugar that I get from Aldi and I just choose 1/2 cup of that down in the water and then I'll give it a little stir just to stir up the sugar into the water and then I stick it straight into the fridge and like I said by end of day we have a nice refreshing drink now if you HOT brew you will get a stronger flavor of tea but since I cold brew it's very light and very refreshing let me explain in case this is your first go around with me my husband is British so tea is a staple in our house and in our family however iced tea wasn't and it took a little convincing for him to see the beauty of an iced tea and now he really really loves ethnic he enjoys taking it to work in his recycle book bottles and the second tea that I make is a hibiscus and I get these bags and I get them from Amazon and I am actually on auto delivery and their front teeth frontier coop and that is a name that I have trusted for years and years and I used to get a catalog from them and order from them directly and because we now have prime and prime means free shipping also I can get on the auto delivery I have this bag sent and this is one pound I have this sent about one bag every two months and we use it for the summer now hibiscus tea is one of the things that I researched and found that it helps lower blood pressure so once I discovered that hibiscus tea became a staple in our house and I will drink it hot really strong especially in the winter but I like it nice and cool and refreshing in the summer and I like it iced and all I do and if you're not familiar with hibiscus tea it's just the hibiscus flowers okay and I just take those and this is just a regular coffee filter and I just put enough to where I can seal that up with a bread tie so I've never measured it it's just how much will fit in here and only a small amount will fit and that's just a couple tablespoons really and then I just plop it in the water and then I will take some lemon juice now you can squeeze fresh lemons if you're so inclined but I don't I just take concentrate from the store and I put about 1/4 cup of that lemon juice in and then here's my other half of the line put that in with 1/2 cup of our organic sugar and again if you are completely sugar free leave that out there's nothing wrong according to dr. mcdougal with adding a little sugar or salt to our foods on occasion this is the only actual sugar that I ever ever have and that I might drink two to three glasses of this in a day and and of course the rest of what I drink is either my my hot tea or my water I've always got my bottle of water and this will turn a nice fuchsia red color and again I just put it in the fridge and I let it sit and by end of day I've got two really nice refreshing drinks so try these out if you'd like if you want something a little jazzed up with your water and let me know what you think okay have a good day guys", "yqP01zLn-Mk": "[Music] tonight quick little shave gonna be using the above the tiny part of one plate again and the last use on

jalapeno lemonade here at the center club", "qskoT0KPNis": "hey guys it's gonna then welcome back to my channel date we were doing something that I'm so excited about and this is something that influencer sent me it's from Maybelline New York and it is their new eliminated crazed palette I am so so excited to work with this palette and I'm excited for you all to see just how this all works is what I'm wearing on my eyes today let's go ahead and get into this go ahead and get into this they have the eye shadow palette and bubble wraps one thing I will say is this was a lot bigger than I was expecting it to be I was actually expecting something more like in this realm but the colors are really pretty again this is called eliminated craze and it also is shade number 100 the packaging is actually really cute it seems sturdy just the hard plastic and it has this orangish yellow I'd say more orange color lining it's like neon on the back of house directions of how to do like smoky eyes as well as the names listed back here and that's on front so I don't know why the Navy listen in the back but well but I'm going to go ahead and try to create an eye look with this there are some fun pops of color so thing I'm going to try to work with some of those as well okay so I'm going to start with this shade right here sherbert and I'm gonna use that to set my eyes looks like a very nice nude shade I'm gonna go into this shade sweet to you and work that into my crease actually I'm gonna take a little bit of this lemonade craze on the same brush work that in the crease to just to have some fun yellow shade I want to incorporate that but have it be a little bit more subtle look you can't really see it that well and I've built up two layers I mean you can but it's a light pastel shade so let me take this smaller crease brush go into the shade coral punch I'm gonna work out my outer crease [Music] so it's actually hoping for that to be a little bit darker so I think now I'm going to go into ice pop it's more hot pink and work of that in the outer corner so good you can see that color that colors a bit more fun I wanted to do an all-over shimmer color I'm gonna try strawberry lemonade and that's not dark enough we'll go into a sugar-coated but right now I'm gonna try strawberry lemonade these pant sizes are really small it's hard for me as you can see it's really hard for me to get my brush [Music] okay there's a lot of fallout with this oh this shimmer is gorgeous I did go a little bit crazy with it so I'm just going to try to add a little bit more dimension back to my eyes I'm just blending out the edges probably adds more of that Brown sweet tea that's small eye crease brush again and add some more of that pink on the outside I'm going to take the same smaller crease brush I'm gonna take a little bit of old-fashioned it's this darker Brown I'm gonna work that my outer crease just to give it a little bit more darkness I'm just going to run a little bit under my lash line I'm awesome are just gonna take sweet tea under I'm gonna take this color right here Sunny's this matte white shade and we're gonna run that under the brow bone lastly with my finger I'm gonna take may Annette squeeze this really pretty gold champagne color and just put that in the inner corner alright so I am back I definitely thrown a lot more makeup on and if you're curious what the lip color I'm wearing it is a pretty vulgar metallic lip and my lips are sealed I know this may look a little crazy to some but I thought this was a beautiful color and I never really knew what to wear with but I think it's pretty fun with this really summery eye color the next and last thing that came in the influencer box is this Maybelline a lasting drama matte automatic pencil in the shade 860 jet black and I thought it would be cool to tightline with this because this is what I use a crayon liners for look at all that it's looking crazy whoa that is really dark this should be fun alright so I'm gonna go ahead and tie line a tight line grosses you out look away for a second all right I think that actually looks are really gonna apply that super smooth it's very very creamy formula I'm also gonna add a little bit of my lower lashes which I never really do honestly I am liking the look how it looks right now but I think I'm gonna go ahead and put some in the bottom lash line just so we can see a little bit more of the product well this is a really really fun look I'm liking it um so final recap on on cleanser I send me the maybelline lemon lemonade craze palette which is what you see in my eyes as well as the maybelline lasting drama matte automatic pencil in jet black yeah packaging says waterproof favorite that up kind of aggressively so hopefully this will stay in my waterline I really like this I think it's super creamy it's right here as a swatch I think it's really dark and bold which is what I like it feels comfortable on my eye I'm also really really impressed with this palette the only thing I think maybe a con but it could be a pro for others so it's more of a personal con is the colors aren't that bowl to begin with you really have to build up some of these matte colors which is a little bit frustrating and it's only frustrating because it's a little bit more time consuming but the bonus to that is that means it's very very beginner friendly you can take your time build it up to a darker color if you want they are very blendable which I would prefer it be something had to build up and blendable over a really harsh color so we used every shadow in here except for those two but the two shimmers I did use were amazing I have to say the shimmers are my favorite thing about this palette I also like just all the fun colors I think this is a great summer palette another thing with the con of them being light that can also be a pro is this is great for if you want to get those summer vibes going but you don't want to go into somewhere looking kind of crazy with these crazy makeup I mean I do have a lot of dark eyeliner right now but you could definitely make this wearable for just a fun you know summer even spring type look for work or school I don't think you necessarily need to rule it out but I think this is a great everyday summer palette it's fun but you still stay in a little bit of a neutral zone like you're going out with these pops of coral and pink and yellow but they're so subtle that you're not looking crazy you can really build them up to be something more or just wear them subtle and come off a little bit more like pastel shades so I have to say this is probably one of my favorite influenced your boxes I've received I'm going to receive some pretty cool products but I think these I would get the most wear out of these and like I can already tell you that if this eyeliner lasts throughout the day this will be something I use every single day because I usually like to tightline this is fun I'm so excited to keep this do so much with this palette I can't stress how much I actually really really like these again if they were not long wearing you will know when the description box down below hey guys that's it for this video I hope you guys liked it I also hope you like home and subscribe down below and I will see you in my next video bye Oh", "SnOyOo5fNj0": "today I want to share with you my beginner's guide to kombucha making I'm gonna walk you through step by step from beginning to end plus we'll do a second ferment with food and will diagnose common problems you may run into and I'll share with you how to fix them hi sweet friends I'm Mary and welcome to Mary's Nest where I teach traditional cooking skills for making nutrient-dense foods like sourdough bone broth ferments and more so if you enjoy learning about those things consider subscribing to my channel and don't forget to click on the little notification bell below that'll let you know every time I upload a new video so what exactly is kombucha all it is is a fermented tea and it's usually a fermented black tea and it's fermented with something called a Scobie and Scobie stands for symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast it's that simple now this Scobie this symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast has adapted over the years that it's been around to survive on the caffeine among other things that's in black tea and that's why making kombucha with black tea often works the best and that's what I recommend that you start with if you're a beginner yes if you get a strong enough Scobie over time you can adapt it to making it with green tea some people have even had success using herb tea but for a beginner I highly recommend that you start with black tea and this is just organic black tea now what you're going to need to make kombucha is a gallon sized jar any gallon sized jar this is a glass jar you're gonna want eight as I said black tea bags you're gonna need your Scobie and you're also gonna want a cup of sugar and you're also going to want two cups of previously made kombucha now don't worry about this previously made kombucha because you may be saying I'm a beginner this is my first batch that I'm making I don't have any previously made kombucha it's not a problem now when you get your Scobie if maybe if someone gave it to you or if you bought it you may be able to get some kombucha just the plain regular kombucha with it sometimes a friend who maybe gave you the scoby can give you some or when you buy ask OB online sometimes they also send you enough kombucha to use to make your first batch but if all you have is the scoby don't worry the reason that we're using this previously made kombucha is to help give the new batch the correct level of acidity but in a pinch if you don't have that and this is your first time that you're making kombucha you can use two tablespoons of vinegar but you want to use a distilled white vinegar and the reason is if you try to use an apple cider vinegar or a raw apple cider vinegar especially that can have vinegar eels in it now they're not really eels their little nematodes and there's no harm to humans however they may eat your Scobie so if you add vinegar to it because you need to get this to the right level of acidity that the scoby will be happy in use a white distilled vinegar now a lot of purists really don't like you to use vinegar kombucha purist filmmakers don't like the idea of adding vinegar but if you have absolutely no ability to get a previous made batch of just plain kombucha then i really think it's okay to use especially to get your kombucha going and the final thing that you're going to need is just a little bit of clean fabric and a rubber band or some kitchen twine that's what we're going to use to cover our jar here with already well we're going to get started and we're going to fill this with three quarts of water that we heat up well I've got my water heated up and I like to bring it up to a boil just if you were making tea just as if you were making a proper cup of tea now it does have to cool down to a certain temperature after we brew the tea before we can proceed but I really do like to bring the water up to a boil I know some people don't but I think that if you were brewing as I said a proper cup of tea you would bring the water up to a boil let it cool a little bit put in your tea bag and proceed and that's supposed to make the best cup of tea so I feel that we should in order to guarantee that we get the best taste in kombucha we should start with a process that makes the best cup of tea so I'm gonna pour my first two quarts of water into this measuring cup put this back down that's heavy and we'll pour this into our jar and you want to make sure it's a clean jar that's a very important thing not only working with kombucha or any ferment you want to make sure you keep everything very clean because you don't want to introduce bad bacteria and give it the potential to proliferate over the good bacteria and the good yeast and now we'll get that final quart of water all right in here goes our final court to bring this up to a total of three quarts of hot water and the reason not only it's interesting because we're heating this water so that the sugar will dissolve in it but as I said we're also making tea so we need to have some nice hot water now what I like to do is take a piece of string and tie my teabags together and for this size gallon jar we're going to use eight teabags as I said this is black caffeinated tea the reason I like to tie these together it just makes it easier to get them in and out now we could go ahead and just put the teabags in right like that but just in case they were to slide in I wouldn't want the little pieces here of paper to go also down into the water so what I find easy to do is as I said I tied these all together to keep them together and then I just like to pull off these little pieces of paper that are on top of the tea bag strings alrighty and we'll just go and submerge our teabags into here and let them steep now we're going to let them steep for about 10 minutes and that's really all you want to do technically if you were just making a cup of black tea you might just steep your cup of tea for three to five minutes but the scoby really likes the caffeine so we will steep this for about ten minutes but you don't want to steep it for much longer than that because what can happen is the tea can get too strong and then it can have an off flavor when you go to finally make your kombucha well we'll let that steep for ten minutes and then we'll remove the teabags and I'll show you how to remove them well we let these teabags steep for ten minutes now we'll go ahead and we'll remove them and I'll show you what you want to do as you remove these do not squeeze them or press the teabags against the side of the jar just get a plate to catch all of the drippings you can let a little bit drip out like that and then just remove them one two three you don't want to squeeze these because you don't want to release too much of the tannic acid that can give your kombucha your end product kombucha a very strong flavor so just steep it for ten minutes and then gently remove your teabags now you want to go ahead and add your cup of sugar this is one cup of white sugar this is an organic white sugar but it is white sugar that works the best as a beginner I completely recommend that you do it this way and the yeast and bacteria are going to eat up a lot of the sugar yes this is a sweetened beverage it still will have and have a very tangy taste to it if you've ever tasted store-bought kombucha almost vinegary and effervesce but with just a touch of sweetness because the scoby the yeast and bacteria in the scoby will feed on some of the sugar but not all of it so I know that is a concern for people who are trying to avoid sweetened beverages and in that case I recommend that for good probiotics you rely more on your fermented vegetables as opposed to these fermented drinks that do require adding sugar then we'll just help the sugar along to dissolve in this hot water but it should dissolve pretty quickly and then we're just gonna let this cool we want this to cool down to somewhere between 68 and about 85 degrees we don't want it as hot as it is now because that'll hurt the scoby but this heat will help the sugar dissolve and then we'll allow it to cool down no I usually just let mine cool down naturally and then I go about doing other things in my home but if you are in a bit of a rush you can always put this you can pick up this jar and put it in a bit it's a little hot so you may want to use pot holders and place it into a little water ice bath if you have a little bucket little dish bucket like oh I have one in my sink there and put a little ice water some ice and some water make a little ice water bath and then you can lift this up and put it down into there to help it cool off quicker but as I said I usually just let it cool naturally well I've let this cool down and I use to clean thermometer food thermometer to check it and it's under 80 degrees then red maybe around 77 and 78 degrees right around there so it's perfect and we can get ready to proceed with the next step but before we do that I just wanted to explain to you what I was mentioning earlier if you need to cool this down quickly what you can do is take your jar of the tea put it into a bin like this this is what I was talking about this is my my little wash bin in the sink but you can put it in a bin like this fill it with cold water and you know just up to about the height of the the that's in the jar and let it sit in there in the cool water you can add some ice cubes and let it cool that way and it'll cool a little quicker now don't worry if you don't have a food thermometer you can definitely check this by telling that it's room temperature that's what you're looking for 68 to 85 degrees it's a nice broad range liquid of that temperature feels cool to the touch not even really this is as I said it's somewhere between 77 78 degrees you can take a clean straw like this you can take a little out just put it on your wrist like how they used to check the baby's formula in the old days and it just feels comfortable so then you'll know just a nice comfortable temperature you could easily put your hand in there and that's a proper room temperature now we're going to go ahead and add in our kombucha from a previous batch and we're just going to go ahead and pour that in and now if you don't have this don't worry you'll just go ahead I'm just gonna swizzle that around a little to get every little last bit don't worry if you don't have this as I said you can just go ahead and add the two tablespoons of white vinegar distilled white vinegar that has been pasteurized so that you have no worry about the vinegar yields that can damage your Scobie and you can add a little extra filtered water well I'm gonna go wash my hands before I even touch the scoby I've got it sitting here on the plate in some kombucha and I'll get ready to pick that up and we're gonna put this into the jar with very clean hands it's very important okay my hands are nice and clean and dry and we'll get ready to put this Scobie into this jar but before i do i just want to mention that if you don't have a Scobie if you've not been able to get one from a friend and you have to purchase one I'll put a link below to where you can order these there's many places you can order them from you can even get them on Amazon and but if you live in an area where there may be a small little sort of boutique brewery that makes kombucha they may actually sell them so that's something to look into as well now when you go to pick it up you're gonna find that it's very flexible and it you know feels somewhat jelly-like and it may be like this where it had it's got a little bit of a layer in it and that's fine this is a very nice healthy thick Scobie and we'll go ahead and we'll put that right down into our jar perfect now don't worry if it floats don't worry if it sinks either way is fine now we're gonna let this ferment for at least seven days and at seven days we'll take a taste and we'll see how we like it some people like the way it tastes at seven days some people prefer it maybe a ten days or fourteen days I like it nice and tangy so if you like it nice and tangy you're probably going to be more inclined to go 10 or 14 days if you like it a little sweeter then seven days is probably gonna be good but when you get ready to test it what you want to do is you get another clean straw we'll use that one to test the temperature and the scobie's don't like metal now it's not the end of the world if you put a little teaspoon in there but but generally they just don't like metal so the best way to take a little taste is to just put your straw in take out a little bit and then give it a taste and if you like the way it is then we'll be ready to move on to the next step but for now we're just gonna let this sit for seven days we'll take a taste at that point and if we like it great if not we'll go 10 or 14 days so what we want to do at this point is take our cloth that we talked about earlier nice clean cloth and cloth works well for this the coffee filters may not fit fully that you've seen me use and some of other ferments like making vinegar and also - if you have any problem at all in your house with fruit flies and that type of thing having a nice thick cloth really helps prevent them being able to get into the kombucha so now what we want to do is just keep this in a warm you know room temperature warm as I said 68 to 85 degrees area in your home out of direct sunlight so you can put this in a cupboard and then just go ahead and check on it in seven days well it's been 14 days now and I check this at 7 days but it's still a little too sweet for me and now I checked it at 14 days took a little taste and it's perfect just the way I like it now if you taste your kombucha at 14 days and you still feel it's a little sweeter than you'd like you can let it go a little longer some people let it go up to about 20 days now what I want to show you is this is the original Scobie that we started with and I'll overlay a picture and when you go to put this in as we did in the beginning when we were originally making our kombucha is it may float at the top a little it may sink down to the bottom it may float up to the top again all of that's completely normal what you're going to notice though over those seven to fourteen or maybe even twenty days if you let it go a little longer if you like it more tangy is that you're going to start to grow another Scobie right here on top now I'm gonna give my hands a good wash and dry before I go in there and we're gonna take out these scobie's and then I'll show you what you're gonna do next now what you want to do is get some sort of Bowl or even another jar like this will be fine and you'll just want to get both of those scobie's out of there sometimes they'll be connected sometimes they will have separated it really depends now this was our original one and this is our new one that's on top now with the original one this is one that you can give away to a friend if you have somebody who would like to make some kombucha if so you can give this to them and give them some of the starter tea and they'll be all set to make another batch now there are a lot of different things that you can do with this Scobie I've heard some people will chop it up and throw it into their garden as fertilizer other people like to put it into their compost pile and I've even heard that some people will cut this up and dehydrate it and make like a Scobie jerky now I've not tried that but that's very intriguing now if you do want to give this to someone and you don't have the ability to give it to them right away don't refrigerate it a lot of people make that mistake asko me doesn't like to be cold and if you make it cold it can actually develop mold and it can be very difficult to then get it to make good quality kombucha and even if it doesn't develop mold because the cold weakens it it can make a weaker kombucha instead what you want to do is create a Scobie hotel where you keep your scobie's at room temperature and the scoby hotel can really be any type of container even a jar like this where you just put your scobie's in put a little bit of the kombucha tea with them and then just keep them at room temperature now this one in the bowl here is our baby Scobie and this is our new Scobie and sometimes it'll be a little lighter on top where it was the most exposed to the air and then underneath you'll see it looks very similar to the mamas Coby and you may even find that it has layers like this and that's completely normal now when you go to ferment another batch of tea and turn it into kombucha you can go ahead and use this new Scobie now you kombucha at this point is all ready to drink however if you want to make it fizzy then you'll need to do a second ferment now before you do anything you want to give this a good stir so that you get all of the good bacteria nicely spread throughout the entire amount of liquid here there's even some effervescence to it already and then the next thing you want to do is pour off two cups and this is very important now with this two cups you want to keep this aside for making your next batch of tea or your next batch of fermented tea kombucha so you just want to go ahead and pour that over your scobie's and now you're all set those can go into your Scobie Motel hotel until you're ready to make your next batch of of kombucha and just to clarify this is a 2 cup measuring cup so it's 2 measured cups of the kombucha tea that you want to reserve and set aside for making your next batch of kombucha tea now when it comes to making the second ferment you have a couple of options you can use different types of bottles I like to just put it in a bottle like this that has a screw top and some people like to put them this is a small version but some people like to put them in these bottles that have the swing top and the reason is these will really hold the carbonation but as I've shared with you in the past I really don't like putting anything that's fermented and becomes effervescent in these swing top bottles they can break so if you do decide that you want to do the second ferment and something like this I would recommend that you do burp this every day or every other day if you decide to keep this in your fridge for a while just to make sure that it doesn't become overly carbonated and as a second measure of prevention I would recommend putting these into some sort of plastic container that has a lid so the in the event that they break and they do break sometimes at least you have it all contained in your plastic container and another point I want to make about swing top bottles if you do decide to do the second ferment in this type of bottle make sure that you're using a bottle that is made for effervescent beverages you'll often see them sold by home brewery type companies where people are making beer at home and so on and so forth so that you have a bottle that's specifically made to withstand the carbonation but my attitude about kombucha is that this is made with sugar and although the scoby eats up a lot of the sugar there is still some sugar remaining so it is a sweetened fermented beverage and if you are watching your sugar as I mentioned earlier you'll really want to use fermented vegetables as your main source for probiotics and I have a whole playlist where I make all different types of fermented vegetables and I'll link to that in the I cards and in the description below but the reason I don't do a second ferment in a bottle like this is it's not necessary for me to maintain the carbonation for a long time I feel the kombucha just like many of the fermented beverages that you sugar like the fermented sodas and that I've made with the ginger bug and so on and so forth in the past really are more of a treat and so I'm fine making them in the screw-top bottles they'll hold the carbonation for a day or two and we'll drink it within a day or two and then I don't have to worry about it now when you proceed with a second ferment that's when you add your flavorings you can make a ginger kombucha you can make a lemon kombucha you can make any kind of fruit kombucha I've got strawberries here berries are great for making flavored kombucha really any mix you want and that's what's so nice about making homemade kombucha because you can make the flavor you want you can even mix all three of these you could have a ginger lemon berry kombucha you can really use any fruit that's in season and the natural sugars that are in fruit will help to feed the kombucha and will cause the fizziness they'll be feeding the back the good bacteria and that releases co2 and that's what causes the fizz now that said if you decide you just want to do a ginger kombucha or you just want to do a lemon kombucha and this is a Meyer lemon if you can find these when they're in season it they're very nice the little sweeter than a traditional lemon but either way if you do something like this that doesn't especially the ginger that doesn't have a lot of you know natural sugars in it in order to get a really nice fizz you may at this point want to add in a little sweetener that'll help feed the good bacteria you could add a little raw sugar you could just add plain white organic cane sugar or you could use the raw sugar the you dried you know you often you see it as rapid aura or soo can add things like that it's just the dried cane juice whatever type of real natural sweetener that you want that would feed the good bacteria and that will help in the case of like a lemon or ginger that doesn't have a lot of the natural fruit sugars like your berries or other fruits you'd use in season melon is very nice pear can be very nice there's a lot of different things that you can do in terms of flavoring them now let's talk about how we're going to flavor this if you want to make a lemon kombucha you just want to put some of the lemon juice from the lemon into your bottle and really it's it's at this point it's trial and error you're going to want to experiment with how much you like but maybe a half of the juice of this lemon maybe make two bottles of lemon and put the juice of half a lemon in each bottle with a little bit of a natural sweetener the same with ginger again about a one-inch knob chopped up and put into your bottle a little natural sweetener that'll be lovely now if you go ahead and use a lemon juice that's perfect because you're really not going to need to strain anything before serving it if you have the little pieces of ginger in it you may want you don't have to you know it's basically going to float to the bottom you don't have to strain it but you may want to another option is to puree the ginger or grate it really really fine where it's basically a puree and then it'll just be kind of floating down on the bottom and you don't need to worry about it if it is in little pieces because of the natural fizz that's going to be created in the second for men it may float to the top so then when you go to drink it you'd have those little piece of ginger in your mouth so you may want to strain it and the same goes for any type of fruit that you want to use you just want to cut it up put it into your jar just a little bit down here on the bottom and then you're gonna pour in your fermented tea and then you're going to let it ferment but again when you go to drink it if you've just put in pieces of fruit when the fruit make it come out of the jar our out of the bottle so you may want to strain it however just as I mentioned with grating the ginger very fine to the point where it's a puree I really prefer to puree the fruit and especially if there's any seeds and whatnot get all of that out and just have a nice little bit of puree and put some of that down at the bottom of the jar or at the bottom of the of the bottle and that way it's going to make a lovely second ferment and when you go to drink it there's just some puree you know you don't shake kombucha too much because it can be a little a little effervescent before you open it but after you open it and you swirl it around a little that puree is just going to mix in with the rest of your your fermented tea your kombucha and it's very pleasant so the choice is really up to you but today what I thought we'd do is make a nice strawberry kombucha now what I've done is just wash and slice up about a cup or so of strawberries that's all you need for a bottle that's about 16 ounces and I removed the stems wash them up slice them and now I'm just going to send them for a world to puree them that just took about 30 seconds and now at this point if you don't mind the little strawberry seeds you can go ahead and pour this right into your jar but what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take a second step and I'm going to send this through a little fine mesh strainer just to get out those seeds and have the strawberry puree nice and smooth alrighty now I've got this all beautifully pureed and I've removed those little strawberry seeds and I'm just going to use a funnel here to get this into my bottle now because this was basically a cup of strawberries before we pureed it there is probably enough fruit sugar in here to give this a nice flavor and to give enough food to the kombucha to the good bacteria in the kombucha to create some effervescence but if you want to sweeten this up a bit this point you certainly can you can add a little honey you can add a little maple syrup you can add as we said with the ginger and the lemon you can add a little organic white cane sugar or a little bit of the dried cane juice whatever you want now before we get ready to put this into the measuring cup to pour just to make it easy to pour into the bottle we want to give this another good stir because this is a problem that a lot of people can run into they sell my kombucha didn't come out very good it didn't become very effervescent it didn't taste very good whatever the case may be and that can be because they didn't give the mother here the main kombucha tea a good stir to distribute that good bacteria really well throughout the entire liquid so make sure you give that a good stir all righty yeah see this is even a little naturally effervescent itself and I'm just gonna go ahead and pour about two cups as I said this is my two cup measuring cup and then we'll just go ahead now and pour this right into our bottle now as we get closer to the top we want to make sure that we leave at least an inch or so I'm sure with my thumb that an inch of head space to allow for the carbonation then I've got another clean spoon here with the clean handle and I'm just gonna give this a stir to help incorporate all of that strawberry puree you can also use you've seen me I often when I make the homemade vinegar I use a wooden chopstick which works really well and what a one of you you shared with me that Mary you can also just use the handle of the wooden spoon and I thought that's great of course so as you'll see the tea itself was quite effervescent all on its own but now adding this puree and that fruit sugar that's in there is really going to help it become effervescent now what you want to do is just put the cap on tighten it and you want to put this in a room-temperature place anywhere you know in your kitchen and pantry whatever the case may be out of direct sunlight and you're going to want to leave it for about three to five days it may even become to the level of effervescence you like after two days if you're doing this in very warm weather and your kitchen is very warm but generally about three to five days we'll get it being nice and effervescent and I do recommend after the second day coming by and giving it a little burp so that it doesn't build up too much co2 too much of that carbon dioxide and create any problems for you so after the second day just come and burp it and after three to five days when it looks nice and effervescent and you're happy with the appearance of it you can refrigerate it at that point and once it's cool enjoy it or you can enjoy it at room temperature or you can pour it over ice and enjoy it whatever way you like now a little tip I want to share with you I highly recommend you put your jar and I always tell you this when we make any kind of ferment you may want to put it in a jar because this is not you know a 100 percent tight seal and as the now granted we've did leave the 1 inch of head space but as it ferments sometimes a little bit can actually come out through the lid and down the sides and this way by having this in a bowl you can keep your counter neat and clean or if you have it in your pantry keep everything neat and clean and the other reason that's nice to have it in a bowl like this is when you do go to burp it sometimes you can get a little bit of overflow and again this will just keep everything neat and clean now after the 3 to 5 days when you get to the level of carbonation that you like and you go ahead and put this in your refrigerator to cool it down if you're going to drink it that same day it'll probably be very effervescent given that this is not a swing top bottle so it's not super-tight that after a couple of days this is going to start to lose some of its carbonation so if you are interested in keeping it highly carbonated then you would want to use the swing top bottle instead of these screw top bottles because after a few days this will start to lose a carbonation but as I said this is more of a treat I say cool it down enjoy it pretty quickly and you don't have to worry about dealing with the swinged of bottles and now with the rest of this kombucha tea you can go ahead and do a second ferment like we did here you can do more strawberry different flavors or you can just drink this straight the way it is whatever the case may be it's totally up to you now I want to talk about diagnosing some problems that you may experience as a new kombucha maker if you're Scobie has little tendrils coming down off of it as you see it during the seven 14 20 day process and I'll overlay a picture so you can see what I'm talking about don't worry that's very normal so if you see that happening that's not a problem and the next thing I want to mention is that if someone has given you a Scobie or you've purchased a Scobie then keep it at room temperature in the kombucha tea that was given to you that came with the one you purchased or that a friend gave to you do not put this in the refrigerator as I mentioned earlier because that will make it more difficult for you to make kombucha with it now when you get your Scobie whether you purchase it or whether someone gave it to you and you're ready to make your first batch of kombucha or you're ready now to make your second batch of kombucha now that you've made your first here with me don't rinse the scoby it never rinse your Scobie with water or anything like that you want to just have it sitting in its tea and be ready for it to make your kombucha and whether you're making a batch of kombucha or you're maintaining your Scobie in a Scobie hotel don't let it be in direct sunlight keep it at room temperature but keep it out of direct sunlight and the reason you don't want to have it in direct sunlight like with any ferment the rise and fall in different temperatures can create a very unhospitable environment for the yeast and bacteria so that's why you always want to have it out of direct sunlight in room temperature now say you find yourself drinking a lot of kombucha and you're making kombucha every day and it suddenly seems very weak and like it's not it's not doing a very good job but turning into that nice tangy effervescent beverage that you're used to the reason is you generally want to wait about seven days so this batch now that we've made and we've taken out the two cups and we have our kombucha sitting in our kombucha hotel or Scobie hotel in that tea you want to wait - or you want to wait to know if it's good to say two weeks you want to wait one week seven days for this particular next batch of the kombucha starter tea the these two cups to develop some strength before you use that as the starter to make your next batch so always try to wait about seven days between making each batch of kombucha so after seven days you start with a clean jar you brew your tea you add your sugar and then you add your new Scobie your baby Scobie that you grew and that's your fresh Scobie you put that in your jar you add your two cups of your starter tea that's now a mature starter tea because it's been sitting in here for seven days and you put that in and then you start the whole process all over again and that should make a nice batch of kombucha now a few other things I had discussed throughout the process of making this batch of kombucha in this video but I just want to review again remember don't over brew the tea and don't squeeze the tea bags because the tannins will give an off flavor to your final product and something that I want to stress is that if you want a flavor kombucha as we did here that's a two-step process you have your first fermentation and your second fermentation do not add flavorings to in the initial first ferment when you have your Scobie in this jar and you're fermenting the tea you want to do that in two steps if you add the flavorings to your initial batch you can create problems what can go wrong is that the different flavorings that you may add whether it's fruit ginger lemon lemon other fruits other herbs and spices it can actually inhibit the growth of your Scobie so that's why we do two ferments the scoby just wants to be in black tea sweetened with sugar and another problem i mentioned previously and i just want to stress again is before you start the second ferment be sure to give your Scobie a good stir give it a good stir the first time when you take out your two cups of starter tea to reserve with your Scobie for preparing to make another batch in the future and then give it another good stir before you pour it into the jar or into the bottle where you're doing your second ferment that's very important because you really want to distribute that good bacteria and the next tip I want to share with you that will help prevent a lot of problems and I get a lot of questions about this can I use a non-caloric you can say that would non-caloric sweetener no it doesn't work well what happens is the scoby needs the sugar the to eat the yeast and the bacteria that have this symbiotic relationship in the scoby need that sugar to eat and so you really don't want to use a non-caloric sweetener it's not going to work well you need to give the scoby food and that food is the sweetener so as i said earlier if you want to avoid sugar then best to use fermented vegetables for your probiotic source as opposed to these fermented beverages so I hope you'll give

"2MxhV3yBn4Y": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to cook at home with Derek today is the 31st episode and we're making a blueberry mint iced and hot tea so I made enough for hot and iced tea now I know I made a trailer for my homemade roasted curry powder but I'm not going to do that today because I want to make it fresh for a Saturday so I'll save that video for Saturday as well as a few so for this recipe only team blueberry mint syrup and cold water and some ice so if you don't know how to make the blueberry mint syrup then go ahead and watch this next clip so here we're just gonna make the blueberry syrup sauce you're going to need it about two cups of sugar 1 2 depends on hospital okay that's half a cup so I'm going to go with a cup that should be good 1 tablespoon of mint and I'm going to go ahead and do two I use peppermint and spearmint which you want put a tablespoon of lemon juice I just throw the whole lemon in there you can do that if you choose it can like just um get a whole bunch of the lemon flavors but we're just going to stick with the juice and you lastly not that you'll need the blue bit so just do that add some water [Music] give it a mix a pretty raw mate and you want your boiler until the blueberries are basically nothing anymore so we'll be back when that is done let me grab all right I'll see you and that is done so I'm about to show you what this looks like you can't see it let me turn my light the blueberries have really cooked down so if you can take one up against the side and mash it so this is a zero so that's how you do the blueberry part next for the disease hero put something and you're safe like that have a strainer and I'm gonna do a little bit at a time you're going to want to mash and you're going to mash it until there's like nothing in the schoener but the mint and blueberry peeler skin so like that and get the rest of your you can have a water and again just mash move this over and that's how you do it now that you've watched that clip if you don't know how to make tea which should be pretty simple go ahead and watch that this next clip okay so for the tea I'm going to eat two pounds then you can green and black go ahead and do two tablespoons of the black what's going a hat I'm making it stronger and the gray tea before this is just pain green teas and to help me out with this a little bit I'm going to take them like this okay and tie them and do that and water and bring it - okay so I did have the question come up of what tea do I use like the tea video I made yesterday and I'll leave a link down below um I use I only get one bag every time I go to the store because I go to this door like every two weeks it's leaf tea and it's a not an English the only thing in English is leaf tea and the like wait it's black tea and it is a really unique Indian flavor so pitcher cold water take your cold water before dump that in there okay this is going to be like a base alright zero I'd say that was a cup at least cold water alright um you'll also need sugar depending on how sweet you want it and I will be right back okay so now take some ice and your tea and do a little bit more this remember hot tea so combine the rest of yours here up with the tea and I will be right after so it hasn't fully chilled but we're going to go ahead and give it a taste anyway so make sure to give it a good we're going to take each tea that's like the perfect sweetness right at my line it's not bitter and it's not over sweet so for about a fourth we'll say about a half a cup of frozen blueberries tablespoon of lemon juice and a cup of sugar this is like the perfect sweetness I'm a fan of the hot one better maybe it's because I like I feel like the sweetness sticks out in this so I hope you all enjoyed this recipe and I'll see you next time on cooking over there to subscribe and see you next time [Music]", "Mzrl_4J-4mI": "recipe table coos logarithm eros mono RESPA develop green tea a latte achaya chewed

scroll it down just a little bit so people know it does it something to talk them to little bits here hello everybody what's up Kristin yeah we're representing the hot guys back there it's sports night beer none what goes better with beer then sports that we can't go watch right now Kyle's sporting the Stanford I got Texas Rangers cuz they gave me this killer Jersey with my name on the back Lou got the Washington Nationals in the cap we got the hawk eyes on the suit of armor it's total sports all night long sports ball so butch its butch night here it beer nice juice for sports bar we even got pretzels cuz that's what you eat with beer yep okay what are we making all right so it is beer night surprisingly you can also make cocktails with beer you don't have to just drink it by itself so tonight is about the cocktails you can make with beer now there are a couple that are pretty simple we're not gonna feature them tonight because you can just do it whenever you want for example does Shandy pretty much a Shandy you might see a lighting kugel Shandy you can buy at the store already done but a Shandy is pretty much fruit juice most the time the lemonade mixed with beer it's like the Arnold Palmer of iced tea and lemonade but it's beer and lemonade you can do it with grapefruit juice if you want could do it with whatever but yeah and if you want to make a Bloody Mary with beer you end up with what that's called a michelada usually you make it with cool motto which if you don't know what Clamato is it's a funny type of tomato juice with clam juice in it it's actually really good it is if you're into that I'm not into playing Marys but yeah you pretty much sub out tequila if it was bloody Maria or the vodka if it's a Bloody Mary for beer for beer and you won't get drunk as fast so for all you people quarantined at home starting drinking early during the day if you don't want to be completely hammered by lunch there you go yeah yeah all right we're starting with none other than the king the Elvis here we go hello hello the Elvis tonight by the way I pre-prepared our glasses with ice so you won't hear any clinking that's right cause and I each have two well we do have a lot of fans joining us a lot of fans talking about their favorite sports teams of course folks from Iowa folks from California hello folks from Texas Wow okay says go Texas you know I'm not from Texas but they give me this Jersey so whatever yeah cool good Iowa reppin reppin back there too all right here we go be honest we start with grapefruit juice three ounces of it we measure yeah three ounces so we talked about this before the last win section it's kind of worn out I don't know if you can see the the lines on there can you see it not really any way it has in an ounce this whole thing is four ounces so it's nice if you're making big batches of cocktails anyway three ounces of grapefruit juice [Music] better make one for me too you might need a bigger glass for you yeah I was gonna say are we gonna get it all in there maybe we should make okay now we're gonna put an ounce and a half of gin gin doo-doo-doo before when you use the two outside and just not fill it all the way little gin I mean cuz what's better honestly they're mixing beer gin fruit juice we need saint-germain so I'm gonna pull it off of this fabulous st. Germain bicycle that we have here yes it's true which has anything just slip it out bone little hole statistic that yeah it has its own little holster so that you can go riding in the French countryside and have a picnic with your Saint Germain it was true you want to tell the story of how we got that yeah we go to a charity auction every year it's very important charity I want you to know it happens around Christmastime it is a black-tie gala and it raises money for scholarships for bartenders 1/4 of an ounce of st. Germain so just just a splash and I don't mean for bartenders to go to college and do other things I mean for people to become bartenders and since we use their services so often we like to support scholarships for them so we go to this auction every year and one year I mean it's brilliant really because they get you're tipsy on these cocktails all night long and then they have a silent auction so yes we bid on and won a st. Germain bicycle which we've never written but we just remember putting on I put together Kyle fills the tires with air occasionally so he not sure I tried to get him to buy a second one so he could have his and his Saint Germain bicycles okay I got shut down we have a small enough apartment as it is we don't need a second bicycle we don't ride ok st. Germain if you don't know is it's a French liqueur made from elder flowers so it's got a lovely lovely floral scent and it's very sweet almost perfume me so yeah it's very sweet so that's why you only put a little bit in there well the other great thing about st. Germain is if you just want to like step up mimosa or just plain old champagne you can throw like a little shot of st. Germain into it and give it a little elderflower goodness and some extra sugary sweetness yeah all right now beer now beer remember beer is ingredient in every cocktail we're making tonight this is a this is the bells official hazy IPA and IPA is India Pale Ale so the iock stands for and an IPA is gonna be that you know the most hoppy as they call it some would say bitter beer it's gonna have that bite to it which I think will go nice with this yeah the floral notes of the gin I'm gonna balance it out here so we've made everything else in there on our ice we top it with IPA you are gonna garnish it with some fresh mint lovely should I give that a little stir I think you can if you'd like no you just will just drink it like it is so we got our nice little mint garnish on there we're good to go grow this mint ourselves in our arrow garden thanks our friends James and Joe Frank arrow carajo cheers Cheers oh I forgot to look you in the eye Oh cheers Cheers we do this every time mmm that is great yeah isn't it that's lovely again we'll post these recipes online later but wow that one is really good yeah I'm not gonna lie you could drink this all summer long if you if you don't know what an arat AeroGarden is it's amazing it's a hydroponic garden which means that it grows plants only in water and it's this little machine look it up AER o garden and we have two types of basil some thyme some dill mint and parsley in it right now and those things are growing like wild flowers we have to go pick them speaking of time okay for the next drink we're at labin it's up to you I'm just telling folks what they need to know all right next if you'll remember last week we had night with Aperol and Campari those bright red Italian liqueurs that was on our Italian Riviera and I we're coming back to Aperol tonight because who knew also goes with beer so we're gonna do the Aperol mist yeah we'll just make one of these so we've got our ice in our glass already we're doing an ounce of Aperol why don't you do the honors am i pouring yeah go ahead okay so we get an ounce of Aperol in this one we get one ounce of lemon juice I see how this is I'm the one who has to make the cocktail so that you can sit there and drink yours now you're catching on it's only taking you three weeks and six episodes oh right after all ounce of a Perl ounce of lemon juice amounts of lemon juice here we go bouncing lemon juice this stuff is really good you might think it's the lazy way outside it's not and on this one we're going with a wheat beer so we picked one from Port City which is here in Northern Virginia and Alexandria Virginia but you take a wheat beer and now we're doing the same thing we did with the other one we're topping it the rest of the way in the glass and you get this nice pretty pink color out of this one you'll kind of get that herbal this we're gonna squeeze a lemon in for the garnish all right I'll try it let me see how it is this one's called the Aperol mist not to be used with arborist good lord these are amazing cocktails we might like beer night could become a thing that's really good oh oh that's very nice we've got a pretty lineup going on so far look at this what's a nice Admiral it's great for for the summer that's yeah that's that's yummy that's a delicious beverage quite like a Shandy like you described it yeah it's not that different it has the lemon juice just like we said a Shandy would be lemonade you know and shandies the great thing about him too you can turn them into anything you want could put lemonade in with raspberry you could put some syrups in got other fruits and flavors so yeah all right we got one more for you a brad says he'll take two all right you know next jet plane will be on after quarantine sandy sandy from London is on with us tonight Wow days late there but hello welcome hope you're drinking or been drinking senility oh she probably has a glass of wine in her hand or something cheers to that Cheers okay you make this one mist all right bee's knees this one we decided to go with this one because it also keeps us in the kind of lemony theme but it gives us a different beer we're gonna use a lager in this one we picked Sam Adams very very basic lager so we're starting with lemon juice go one ounce of lemon juice mm-hmm we've we've come up with a new technical setup tonight so let us know how you feel this is going are you are you hearing us all right are you seeing us better worse let us know what you think two ounces of gin we're sticking with gin is our liquor to go with the beer tonight we are also following up with our videos with captions so some of you may know that I I work with deaf people in my normal everyday life no I am NOT a Facebook live celebrity everyone all the time so we wanted to make sure that that my deaf friends and deaf people all over the place could access these videos so unfortunately Facebook live doesn't let us do it live it takes it takes a minute to get them you know figure it out but they should that all the videos should have captions within 24 hours of them going up yes okay sorry so I added a teaspoon of honey so we're it an ounce of lemon juice two ounces of gin a teaspoon of honey and now we're going for blogger little Sam Adams a logger yes this was made by one of your family members right yeah why's my cousin been made that it was a Christmas gift from my mom thanks and that lovely probably beer opener to keep that in the drawer and giving this a little stir to get that honey mixed in a bit don't want to get it too sweet but now here we go adding the lager again a great color this one we made a little lemon juice we're also gonna garnish it with lemon I like to squeeze them in because you know what's the point of just leaving it there on the side of the glass looking pretty and hit me in the nose every time you drink do you like to try this one first yeah thanks Wow our diet gentlemen Oh for once in my life oh yeah good stuff that one's that one's very different than the other one the other ones had a lot more tartness to them this one had the honey gives it the nice sweet ya mood hence the name is nice yeah pick that only bad going on but you definitely taste it it's not it's not overwhelmingly sweet but the honey gives it that good godliness that you really want now look at this beautiful lineup we've made tonight friends yep the Elvis the Aperol mist the bee's knees little bit of everything there we go three strikes see what we're doing here tonight Bronx boy sorry couldn't resist no you're actually I mean you're wearing baseball I know but this is Heisman right Oh so shall we talk about shopping local sure but do you have anything else you want to talk about with these cocktails first no I just like to drink them really I'm really far behind normally by the time we're done with this show I've already drink like one or two so you know breweries are big in America right now so you probably have one near you over five or five of them you might have a friend brewing in his basement or garage well better yet but if you if you want to support a local business get one of these babies these are called growlers and they're they're just bigger there's 64 fluid ounces for beer and you film with beer I hear in some states like the great state of Iowa you can get these filled and gas stations damn right yeah we do it right but but go to your local brewery maybe a bar if your state allows you and grab a growler this one is from one here in Fauquier County Virginia it doesn't matter if you bought it at one brewery and you bring it to another to fill up they don't care for the most part so yeah should cost you just ten fifteen bucks or so as much as buy a bottle and Linda I'm glad you have a per all you got to make one of these they are really so good I promise you loving it yeah all righty folks wow these are great cocktails I'm not gonna line it's not because we made them it's because you're here is our company it's really all about you all right we'll be back next week uh Tuesday night Tuesdays and Thursdays it's our thing Tuesdays and Thursdays until we decide hey we might get a little tropical next week also if there's stuff that you want to see us do then let us know or if there's like something liquor you're curious about or yes a mixer or something we'll do it don't worry we'll do all the research for you will make three cocktails it'll be great yeah we might whip out the blender a night next week and do some frozen drinks like who doesn't love a good pina colada or something like that and it's about time to just start feeling tropical as we're all caged up in our houses right yeah so let's do it so send us send us suggestions we live for those if they're things you really liked let us know there's things you didn't like keep it to yourself write it in the comments and then hit delete before you hit Send and invite others to come along you know this is a big this is a big way for us to relax at the end of a day at a time where you know the world is stressing out and just have fun together yeah over it sometimes cocktails that's what it's all about share this with friends telenovelas Brad in Iowa suggests nothing but shots next week oh well that very favorable those recipes are pretty easy to find Brad oh we love it all right all righty thanks to everybody take care everyone till next time a residual shade of you to say farewell goodbye adios", "3KrtTirqWXo": "[Music] hi everyone today i would like to dedicate my final ultimate video

I'm addicted to both of them. But in this hot weather, drinking hot tea becomes a little bit of a task Which is why i prefer, Iced Tea! Today we'll be making homemade Iced Tea which is both delicious and refreshing so lets make homemade iced tea, lets get started!", "pX4yVDgr7Iw": "hello mr. tie-dye so I've been doing videos for about two years now and have I think just over 200 videos on my channel so if you're new to the channel you can explore all those for anybody else that's been around my channel for a while you know that there's a lot of information that's kind of scattered around in all of the videos but I've had lots of requests for doing a video that has all of the tips and stuff all in one place so we're gonna take a little journey with this t-shirt and follow it all the way through from the t-shirt prep to the dye prep to the batching to the washing process so what I'm gonna do is I'm starting with a hundred percent cotton t-shirt and that's going to give you the best results when you're using fiber reactive Procyon dyes which is that's what I'm using here I haven't used any of the kits so I'm not real familiar with those but I know some of those kits do have the the fiber reactive dyes and one of the things with the fiber reactive dyes you need is soda ash so I have a video on this here I'm gonna splice it in here soon but the reason for using soda ash is it raises the pH level of the t-shirt and then that causes the dye to bond with it so you need these three things to do a decent tight IT you need the the cotton you need the soda ash to raise the pH and then dye to color it so we're gonna discuss all of those things so to start with once you get your t-shirt it's recommended that you do a pre wash on it anytime you buy them from the stores there's possibility that they have some sort of a treatment on a mustaine resist well that stain resist all so resist the dyes so it's a good idea to do a pre wash on them and then you soak it in soda ash and make sure that it's thoroughly coated if it's not completely coated then it will show up as dark patches so let me set up and show you what I mean by that okay so this here is a t-shirt what I've done here is just set up pointing this here towards the window so that you can have the light behind the t-shirt so I just hold the t-shirt up and I look to see if it's an even color and this one here you can look at that and see it's a fairly even color here which means that that has been fully saturated with the soda ash this tea here I intentionally wadded it up and stuck it down in the bucket and these darker areas here so these patches here that are making this weird little pattern on there those are dry spots on the tea so you just flip this around and you can see that on both sides there that t-shirt has not been soaked soda ash well enough so these darker spots here they don't have any soda ash on them so they're not going to take dye most likely or the dye is going to be more faded in those areas so then the way that I like to get most of the soda ash out of my t-shirt is by putting it into the washing machine and put it in it just on the spin cycle and then I turn it on and that will spin the excess out so I'll usually go ahead by hand I can squeeze out most of the excess because I don't want to waste the soda ash because the soda ash can be reused so I just put it back into a bottle with the lid on it and then you can just keep on using that and when it gets low you just make more and that will be shown in the soda ash portion here coming up soon as well as the spin out process so you can see just how you get it because I'd like to have the t-shirt just barely damp when I'm folding it that makes it easier for your folding because when you start folding things up the being damp just helps it stay together because sometimes you have to kind of let go of one part to fold another part and when it's dry it doesn't want to stay together so I like to fold them damp and then also when I put my dies on most of the time depending on what design but on the simpler designs I'll do all of that with the t-shirt just barely damp if you have too much liquid in during the dyeing process then you'll have problems with saturation because that excess soda ash inside the t-shirt is going to inhibit the dye from coming in so a teacher can only hold so much liquid and if part of that liquid is the soda ash then it's not going to be a whole to die so hope that makes sense for you so anyways soda ash is just a white powdery substance you can buy it directly from Dharma or whatever dye house that you buy from but you can also buy it from a pool supply store so I have some from both places and what I'm gonna do is show various ways of how I mix it and then the other thing some people have asked about baking soda baking soda is not soda ash the technical term for this the baking their soda ash is sodium carbonate baking soda is sodium bicarbonate so it's close but it's not the same but you can keep this in the oven and turn it into soda ash so what I'm gonna do is do kind of a test on the other two soda ashes and on the baked soda ash here so what I have I measured out two cups and I got myself a baking pan and I'm just following the directions of what I read on the Pomo Bert's site and it said just to spread this out in the baking sheet here and then bake it in the oven at 400 degrees for just one hour so I'm gonna go ahead and get this baking and then I'm gonna get back and show you how I mix these other ones and then talk a little bit more about it so I'll be right back okay so that's in the oven now so what I'm gonna do is kind of talk a little bit about it so soda ash is what we use to activate the fiber reactive Procyon dyes and you can buy those at various places here so this is from Dharma mrs. Rocha and I this is from custom colors Procyon dye and this is from grateful dyes they're all Procyon dyes so you can buy this for many places but the soda ash actually activates the dyes there's also the one-step kits that you can buy in the stores I don't know the ins and outs of all of them but typically if it's a one step most likely that means that the so - has been mixed in with the dye so you have your dye powder and your soda ash mixed together so when you pour it into one of your bottles and pour water in there then your soda ash is already mixed in but what that also means the soon as a soda ash and the dye come in contact with water then the dye is active so it's gonna need to be used quickly so if you're using one of the one-step kits I would recommend not mixing your dyes until you're ready to actually put them on your t-shirts but if you want better colors I would still recommend that you get some soda ash and do a pre-soak because personally I haven't used the kits but I've heard from other people and they get the results that are the t-shirts so just look faded so you want to use soda ash if you're using any kind of Procyon dyes so with that being said there's a couple ways that I mix them up so if I'm going to do use a blender what I would do is just pour my water and I use hot water the soda ash and to blend that faster the dissolve faster in hot water so I just got a gallon of hot water here and then what I'm gonna do is pour in the soda ash and start blending it immediately so I have one of these hand blenders here and don't worry I'll show another method in case you don't have a hand blender but you want to start active start blending as soon as the so - hits the water because if so - goes in and sits for very long it will just kind of turn it into a big solid chunk and I haven't had any luck breaking those up I think you'd have to use a hammer or something to chip those back down into powder again so anyways we're gonna blend this up right now [Music] okay so there is my soda ash from the pool supply store we're gonna set that aside now another way that you can do it is use it one of these bottles what I'm gonna do I have a gallon of water here but I'm gonna for half of it out into my tub here just to give me room to shake the the jug here so once again you want to be fast-acting with this so you want to make sure if there's no chunks or whatever in your thing that's gonna clog your funnel here so you can quickly pour it in put the cap on and then start shaking because once again if you leave it set for too long which I have I've poured it in and walked off and talked on the phone and came back and there was just a big solid chunk down in the bottom here so I tend to pour this thing quickly I just shake my funnel to get it to go in and this is one cup to one gallon ultimately you want to have your soda ash the pH at a number between ten point six and eleven so it usually dissolves it pretty quickly I can fold it up to light here and see that there's no chunks floating around in there there's just a little bit of powder room with that that's fine so once I get that all shook up then I can pour it in here with the rest of this water so this is one cup of the powder to one gallon of water and we're gonna use that after big-hair - so now the only thing that we're waiting on is the other so - that still has to bake for a while but I'll come back to that and then what I'm gonna do is do a test on all three of the soda ashes here I have my little pH strips here so we're gonna test to see what what we have here with the pH so I'll be right back okay and to a another name another place you can get the sodium carbonate at like I say if you go into the pool supply store that you can either tell them soda ash or sodium carbonate the main thing you want to make sure is you don't get the sodium bicarbonate or you'll have to bake it like what we're doing here it's much easier if you can just get sodium carbonate to get that you can also get washing soda which I haven't used that either but that's in the laundry Department and that's typically just the soda ash and you can look on the label usually and see the words so - ash or sodium carbonate but all of them you should be able to mix them about one cup to one gallon I have my test strips here and they this here I don't know these test strips are old so they might not be accurate but I have I tested both of these and they're measuring right about 13 so what we're gonna do is soak a t-shirt in each one of these so when I'm doing the the soda ash soak I'll soak these in here for 20 minutes and I make sure that I kind of slosh it around and get all the air bubbles out so that you get completely coated there so I'm gonna soak ezel so while we're baking our baking soda will be soaking our t-shirts here and then we'll get in I'm gonna do some tie-dye videos it's time to do Halloween designs so in other videos coming up soon I'll be doing some of those with these t-shirts so okay so it's been 20 minutes the teachers soaking in the soda ash so what I do next is just I start out by wringing it out by hand and I'm doing mostly squeezing I don't want to do too much twisting because if you twist too much across one of these seams you could stretch that and break some of those threads in there so I tried to just mostly squeeze with my hands and then what I'm gonna do is spin these out in the washer so the other thing that you can do is hang them to dry the one thing you don't want to do is put a soda ash soaked tea in the dryer I haven't had had it happened to me but back in the day I guess a Dyer had done that so often did a lot of the dry soda ash and dust has built up in the dryer and then that caught fire so don't put soda ash soap teas in the dryer you either need to this here for me is is too wet now I could spend more time squeezing and getting more of that out but I don't want to wreck my hands so you can hang these up until they're just barely damp or like you say you can spin them out in the wash machine and I'll show you how I do that okay so here we are at the washing machine so what I do is I just take my t-shirts that I've rung out by hand just to get most of the soda ash out of them because I don't want to waste a bunch of soda ash with it going down the drain with this spin out process the other thing you can do if you want is disconnect your hose back here have it go right into a bucket then when you spin it out you're saving all your soda ash but I'm not gonna mess with that right now the other thing you want to make sure of before you start doing your spin out is that your washer does not spray water during the spin out cycle some of them do right at the beginning of the cycle an easy way to test that is to toss a couple dry t-shirts in to your washer put it on the spin cycle and turned on most of the time you should be able to hear it but sometimes it's just a little bit of water which is enough to dilute the soda ash so spin it for a little bit turn it off open it up if your t-shirts are wet then it's spinning spitting water the other thing you can do is go back here to your spin cycle and maybe set it towards the end of the cycle instead of at the beginning of the cycle so I know mine doesn't spit water so I'll put it at the beginning of the cycle here and then I just close the washer and turn that on okay after about a minute then they're just barely damp and that's that's my preferred method for folding these is just to have them barely damp so pull these back out and we'll go do some videos here okay so I finished up baking my baking soda to turn it into soda ash and then I use just 1 cups remember I mixed up baked up 2 cups and that was because I wasn't sure if the same amount of soda ash homemade soda ash was gonna be the same so anyways I started with 1 cup mix it into 1 gallon and then I did my test strip and it tested the same as the other well let's let's just do it here so the way these test strips work is it's gonna turn a color here depending on what the thing is and for the optimum it should be somewhere between 10 and 11 down here my staff has been testing around 13 now that might be due to the fact that this is older test strips I've had it for several years so when I hold this color up here maybe that's yeah it goes at about 12 here so I'm just going to assume that my test strips are just a little bit off but the fact that all three the soda ash from Dharma the soda ash from the pool supply and my homemade soda ash all three of them tests the same here right around 12 I'm going to assume that my strips are a little bit off but that they are all of my soda ashes are gonna be the same so anyways I'm gonna put this in with the rest of my soda ash and the same thing with this excess powder here I'll just mix that in with my other so - powder and we'll call it good so anyways that's that's what you use soda ash for your you're using it for your Procyon dies and mix one cup to one gallon I pre-soaked my t-shirts for 20 minutes in them and then I wring them out by hand and then I spit him out in the washer until they're barely damp so whenever I start a video and I say that my t-shirts been soaked and spun out and barely damp that's because I've gone through this whole process with the soda ash and then the soda ash also you can keep this this doesn't go bad so you can just put it back in a jug put a lid on it if you have a five-gallon bucket with the lid you can just put that on there and I never pour my soda ash out I just continue to add and make more so when my five-gallon bucket starts to get load then I'll just make up another gallon or two a soda ash poured in and I just keep using it sometimes it'll be discolored just a little bit and that's not bad if you're doing some over dyes where your reso 'king a dyed t-shirt I won't drop it into my whole five-gallon bucket I'll put maybe like a half gallon in a little pail and soak my t-shirt in there because some of that dye will kind of leach out and discolor your soda ash and I don't know if that will go back into the t-shirts or not but just to stay on the safe side I don't Reece oak and already dyed t-shirt in my brand new soda ash I do that in a separate bucket so I can just pour the excess out okay so once you have your t-shirt completely soaked in the soda ash then the next thing you're gonna do is wring it out and you can either wring it out by hand just by squeezing it you don't want to do too much twisting on the t-shirt you can do just a little bit of a twist but if you do too much of a twist you might rip some of the threads in here they they can break in the seams here and then those themes will come apart the other thing that I do when I'm doing tie-dye is I turned my t-shirts inside out and there's a couple reasons for that sometimes I'm using a pencil or a washable marker to draw a design on now the washable markers almost always wash out but the artist pencils and I don't have one here they don't always wash all the way out of the t-shirt so if I'm gonna have a stray mark that's left on the t-shirt I'd rather it be on the inside the other thing is sometimes on some of the colors like the the Reds the Browns sometimes even the purples the dye will not dissolve all the way there will be just the really minuscule bits of powder left floating in the water that don't die up and they'll pass through the filter guy always pour mine through a really fine mesh filter but that doesn't always stop all of those little fine bits well when you put that on to the t-shirt then sometimes those little tiny bits will stay on the t-shirt and then they'll die extra dark making tiny little spots most of the time those tight these little spots are just on whatever side that you have it on so if you're dying on the inside then those tiny little spots will be on the inside of the t-shirt instead of the outside so those are the main reasons for turning the t-shirt inside out the other thing then is what I'm centering the tee I can grab the the armpits here I can see the the seams easily because I would like to flatten this out make sure it's nice and straight when I'm doing my folding if I'm going to fold a t-shirt in half then I'll tuck one side in the other and for that the reason that I do that is if you fold the t-shirt just straight in half then the two halves of the front of the t-shirt have two layers of fabric in between them it would be the back of the t-shirt so when you're putting your dies on they're not always going to be nice and symmetrical because of that so if I'm folding a t-shirt in half I always like to fold it in half by tucking one sleeve into the other sleeve and once I have the two sleeves in there together I'll take these these this bottom hem here on both of the sleeves line that up and then I just line up the rest of the hem all the way around on the t-shirt here or the armhole and then you can just kind of give that a shake and that will usually line things up pretty nicely and then I'll reach in between the t-shirt the front the back here and I'm just reaching and lining up this shoulder seam on top of itself so then you can grab this neckline here and just make sure that that shoulder seam is lined up front and back and then you can give it another shake and then when I lay it down I can usually go ahead and pick up the center of the front and the bottom shake it one more time and lay it down and then I can pick up the whole t-shirt front and back pinched in there and lay it out and then my t-shirt is all nice and folded in half and then that way when I'm doing any of my dying here any my folding when I put my dies on the two parts of the front are right next to each other in the two parts the back are right next to each other so then the die is going to be more even it might not be exactly the same front to back but it's at least going to be the same side to side which is what you're gonna see you're gonna see the front or you're gonna see the back of the tee okay so let's get on to folding this thing so since I already have it folded in half here design now I'm gonna demonstrate in this video is what I call the spider and I do have a few other videos on that but we're going to do another one just because so for a spider what I'm going to do I have it folded in half with the front and the back separate so that's going to allow better side-to-side symmetric symmetry so the way I like to tie a spider's I go across from the armpit out and that puts the design main part of the design right on the center of your chest and I'm gonna pinch it right there and then I twist going down the t-shirt and that's going to put the spider on in the direction that I want if you twist going up the t-shirt the other direction then that's just going to turn the dirt the design upside down or right side up if that's the way that you prefer to do it so you can try it both ways and see which way that you like it but I'm gonna twist this one up and then like I say we're gonna follow this t-shirt all the way through the whole process so I like to just kind of smooth things out flatten this out and I try to work with my creases getting these creases to lay nice and flat instead of having ones that lay over top of each other if they lay over top of each other then you're not going to get good dye saturation there so I like to make sure that my creases line up next to each other here so I'll kind of take the extra amount of time to just work those creases in create them as these long folds and then lay them right down alongside the side here because when we do the spider design the actual spider part of the design is the top parts of all these creases that's where we get the shape from in our t-shirt so it pays to spend the extra time making sure that your creases are nice and even so what I'll do is pull the edges out here and create the creases and sometimes you can reach in there and pinch just to make extra ones but then slowly incorporate them into your design here and I just keep working switching back and forth between my hands here oh and it's also recommended you wear gloves I usually don't do it for the so - portion but some people can develop allergies to the soda ash it does dry your hands out I make sure I wash mine really well I haven't had any issues with the soda ash but it is something that you want to be aware of if you're going to do a lot of tight item but we will put gloves on for the dying portion so we don't color our hands so once I get this tied up just how I want it then you have a couple options you can either use rubber bands or what my preference is is to use kite string so that's what I'm gonna use I buy kite string I get it from Ace Hardware all right guess it's called kite twine so that's what it looks like and I buy it at Ace Hardware and it works really nice if I can't get that then the other thing I bought I can find it is embroidery string or actually cross-strait crochet thread so that you can probably find it any type of craft store Michaels or Joanne's or something it's not as strong as the kite string but it does work if you can't find the kite string and it's not too bulky some of the strings out they're more bulky than what I want and I do have a video on how I use the kite string I'll put a link to that down in the description box but basically I want to tie this up nice and tight just to hold everything together okay so there's my spider design and I have a cuticle pusher I bought this just in the nail department at any department store used for pushing cuticles or whatever but it has a nice smooth edge on it so I like to use it if I need to adjust any of my folds a little bit I can get in there and kind of push things down in there I check to see if I have any of my creases any my folds that are laying over top of one another so I can kind of push in there and just adjust things and not worry about tearing a hole in it because that's that's the one thing sometimes if you something has to sharp of an edge and you push down in there you can tear a little hole without realizing it so a cuticle pusher is a good tool or just anything with a nice smooth edge on it and then it comes down to picking your your dies out and coloring it so for the spider there's several ways of coloring it you can just use two colors put one color on one side flip it over put another color on the other side and that would give you a nice spider design that's kind of similar to the one that I'm wearing this one here is green and purple and I think I met a little bit of black over top of it and well it already had this double image on it but you can see the spider design there the other way that you can do it is by putting PI shapes on there so I'll do three lines on here creating six pieces of Pi and I cross them all right here in the center and then what I'm gonna do is dye these in the rainbow color on one side and then I'm going to put a solid color on the other side of the t-shirt and the solid color then will be the spider design and these here are going to create I guess the closest thing I can think to is like a peacock feather type shape on the t-shirt and of course you'll see that at the end of the video here so I'm going to use rainbow colors for this so let me get some gloves on I'll be right back okay so we're back to put some color on this so what I'm going to do now is color inside these little triangles here and I'm just going to color each one of the triangles a different color and I'm going to go in the rainbow pattern here or the color wheel pattern so I'm just making sure that I saturate everything here and just because you have color on the top doesn't mean that it's soaked all the way down inside so if you take a peek down in here you can see that that white is resting just below the surface so that's one of the things that you're gonna have to practice is getting just the right amount of dye on there and that's going to come from experience of just putting on and checking your results at the end but you can improve that by checking ultimately you want the dye to soak about halfway into the t-shirt because the other side you're gonna get the other half so just by applying your dye and just getting the feel for it the more that you do the better you're gonna have a feel for how much dye needs to go on the t-shirt so and one of the tips when I'm doing the rainbow design I will typically put just the primary colors so that being the red or the fuchsia the yellow and the blue or the turquoise those three colors I'll color all the way up to the point of the triangle and then the other colors I'll just color up to the white spot and what that's going to do is help cut down on having too much dye there in the center because that middle part is only you know that big around and if you've got six colors in that spot it's possible that you're gonna have brown form in the middle there where all six colors ran together so just to try to keep minimize how much color mixing you have if you put just your primaries which you're gonna mix nice and evenly up there in the middle and that just saves you from having too much color mazing go on I don't know if that made sense sorry I'm just rambling sometimes so here's my blue this is a sirillium blue I'm using normally I use turquoise but I like to mix up the rainbow so you can use any shades you want for each one of the colors the main thing is just putting them on in the correct order and so just following the color wheel basically is what we're doing here so between the yellow and the blue you're gonna put green so you can pick whatever shade of green you want to go in that space and then like I say I'm only going up to just where the white is instead of all the way up to the exact center which is green and the yellow and the blue already mixed there in the middle so there will be a little bit of a different color green there in the middle so then my purple I'm gonna put that on between the blue and the red colors here and once again you can put a light shade of purple or a dark shade this one here is called plum and it's a Dharma dye so this one here is fuchsia which is a primary and this is lemon yellow which is another primary color so and I just kind of watch and see how the dye soaks in and I kind of can get a feel for how much dye needs to go on there and just because I've been doing it for so long but you'll want to open those cracks up and check that just so you can get your dye saturation down and then this last color here is called deep orange and that one is also a Dharma color all of these are from darm except for this really surreal Ian blue that one is from grateful dyes and the other company that I'll buy from is custom colors so those are the three dye houses Dharma grateful dyes and custom colors the three places that I bought from but I'm sure there's many more places that you can buy these fiber reactive protein dies I know jacquard makes dyes those ones you might even bill find in craft stores so the Procyon dyes are the ones that I've used for the whole time I've been doing tie-dye and they provide me some excellent colors so that's what I've just stuck with this whole time okay so now I'm gonna flip it over and I'm going to dye the other side all one color so I'm gonna use blue violet this one here is also from Dharma so it should be kind of a brighter lighter color of purple so that will give me well look a little bit dark but we'll see it's at least a different shade than the plum here I like to try out new colors and see if I can find new favorites so I just keep exploring so this year color I'm going to just apply it one coat the whole thing instead of dying into triangles so this basically I'm dyeing these all of these creases here and this here is what's going to give me my actual spider shape as this one color on here and like I say you can do just two colors one on each side and get these same type of results only you'll have just the de spider shape instead of the peacock looking shape on there the peacock feather so next to the orange here I'm just kind of leaving a little bit of white space let that dye spread on its own some so that I don't create Brown right there and then the same thing with the yellow so I'll go back and touch those up a little bit with my other colors so whenever I'm putting colors on that don't blend well and if you get yourself a color wheel you can look at those any ones that are on one side of the color wheel those if they're touching another color that means they're going to blend well by putting them all together but some of these other colors like orange and purple they don't blend well they'll make more of a brown color so if you put your darker color on first and let it spread a little bit then you can kind of touch up with the orange and not create as much Brown so leaving a little bit of white space is helpful in those cases and then that way you can go back and touch that up just a little bit as needed and where needed but the dye will spread on its own over time so most of the time I'll put the dark color on first and let it get it all of its spreading done okay so now that I have this dyed all the way I can take a quick peek and make sure that it looks like I have enough color in there and when I look down inside I see just a little bit of white but not a lot so I know that the the dye is going to spread a little bit more on its own I'm gonna add just a tiny bit more on here but then from there the dye should spread you don't need to get it to the point of no white or you might have a lot of extra color mixing that you don't want so once I get this point now it's ready to batch and what batching is is letting the dye actually react with the cotton fibers and that's what the so - does it activates the dyes so that they can start bonding and they need time to do that and they need a little bit of heat not a lot of heat just 70 degrees is good enough if it's less than that then you might have a problem with your dyes bonding enough if you have more than that then that's gonna help encourage it even more but a 70 degree Fahrenheit is the minimum where I like to batch my my dyes at and I'll leave mine set for a minimum of 24 hours to give the dyes time to react but I prefer to leave mine for 48 hours and that does a couple things it gives the dyes more time to bond with the fibers and also the dyes will be pretty much spent meaning they are no longer active after 48 or longer period of time so when you're doing your wash out then you have less of a problem with back staining sometimes you put all your stuff in the washer and wash it and then the whites come out looking great well that's because you have back staining going on from some of the active dye in your shirt your shirts so letting them sit for longer is going to cut down on that and I'm gonna move this right now but I'll show you in just a second how I do my batching here so I'll be right back okay so this is my preferred method for batching so I have these plastic tubs these are ones that fit I believe they're meant for storage like under the bed space or whatever they're about 6 or 7 inches tall and then I went to the closet department in Home Depot and I found these big long racks for your closet and then I just cut them to length with a dremel tool and they fit right in here they do have a lip on one side and no lip on the other side so I cut some PVC the 3/4 inch PVC pipe and I set those down in there and that just equalizes my rack so that it sits level so what this does setting them on the rack allows any excess dyes if you put too much dye on the excess dyes can drip through into the bottom of the container here if you put them in a plastic bag or you batch them like this on a flat table like this here if there's any excess dyes then they might puddle underneath and then it will give you black lines if all of the colors have mixed together into one color then you'll have black lines show up if you're doing a spider with a dark color on the bottom like this here it's not going to matter as much but if you're doing a rainbow like this here and you don't the dark colors then you don't want the dye peddling up underneath the other thing when I'm doing ones like this here with the rainbow on one side in the dark color I always batch with the dark color going on the bottom side so any of that excess dye is going to go down rather than into my rainbow colors here and I'll put a lid on this which that is going to then keep this moist because the t-shirt needs to stay wet for the dyes to batch if the t-shirt dries out then the dyes are no longer active so you can leave it sit for a week but if it's dry it's not going to do anything else for you so you want to keep it wet for the whole time while it's batching so that's why I put a lid on these and then in the summertime I can pick these up I can have two or three t-shirts depending on how they're folded I can easily move them outside I'll set them out on the roof in the Sun and that helps increase the heat in here in the winter time I can stack these if they're stackable and I'll have them stacked you know five or six high right next to a heater vent and the heater vent then will help provide the extra heat that I need for the batching temperature and then after that we'll do the washout and I'll be back and show you that when it's time so 48 hours ok I'm back now mr. tie-dye here so I'm going to be doing my washout so these have been batching for 48 hours so one of the things I like to see is this little bit of condensation built up here in the lid I don't know if they seen in the video but to me that means that I've got some nice heat on my tie ties here so they've been batching for 48 hours 24 hours is a minimum that I'll go but I prefer 48 hours because it just allows more time for the dyes to set up also the dyes are pretty much spent by the time I get around to washing them so the back staining that happens in the washer sometimes is much less with this and these here are still damp in here so the lid has done its job of keeping them moist but also has allowed the heat to build up in the container which is evident by the moisture and stuff on the so anyways what we're gonna do first is drop one of these in the sink and get it rinsing so let me get set up here okay so to start out with when I'm doing my wash up process the first thing I do is put these in sink and just run cold water over top of them the cold water is going to rinse away any of the soda ash that's left here the tea which of course there's gonna be a lot of it but the soda ash is what activates the dyes so before I open this up and start releasing more of the the excess dyes and this t-shirt I want to make sure that all of the soda ash is gone because I don't want that died being reactivated and then bonding that's where the the vac steaming happens in the washing machine is just the dyes that are still semis there which like say after 48 hours there's not many of them but it's still a possibility so if I rinse away all that soda ash and then in the washing machine I'm going to use a pH neutral soap called Center Paul I buy it from Dharma I know a lot of other dyers they use what they use blue Dawn dish soap which is another pH neutral soap a lot of detergents that you buy in the store they will have soda ash in them because so to act is a washing agent so that's why you don't want to wash your tides when you're doing your initial rinse and wash on them you don't want to use regular detergents since the Paul or blue dawn or even just no detergent at all if you don't have it and can't get it it's better to use nothing than to use a detergent that has soda ash in it because that's just going to encourage the back staining in the washing machine so anyways I'll do a about a minute long rinse on the t-shirt just to rinse away the snow to ash once that's done then I feel like I can kind of stack them up a little bit and let the water run down over the whole pile here so that way I'm utilizing my water so when that happens and I can throw another one in this other sink here and do the rinse out on it get the soda ash gone and then I can put it on the bottom of the pile also so now I'm just gonna rinse these one-by-one I'm going to turn the water up to about warm here and I'll continue to do my wash out the warm water is going to encourage more of the excess dye scum out so that's why you see in the darker water here that's because the warm to hot water will help release the excess dyes that are not bound to the cotton fibers so I'm gonna let this run for just a little bit here that I'm gonna pull these bands off the while I'm doing this I'm gonna go back and start my washing machine and I usually will fill it up about halfway with hot water and I add just a little bit of Center Paul just enough to make some suds and that way when I'm done rinsing these they can go right into the soda at the center Paul hot water bath there in the washer so I'll be back in a second okay so here I am filling the water up and I'm going to you a quick squirt well actually with the first watch I'll do a longer squirt of the simple fall just because there's gonna be more of the inactive die so really what I like to see is just to have some suds form on the top of the water when the water the water is going in so that's here that's looking pretty good right there so I'm gonna finish filling this up and I'm gonna go out and start rinsing okay so here's the spider that we tied up so get the strings cut off of there and then open this up so you see the colors so this is the one I did the rainbow on one side and the purplish color on the other side so you can see my spider design show up there with the rainbow colors through it and that will open this up remember I have one sleeve tucked inside the other which that helps the side-to-side cement cemetry of the design here so there's my spider design rainbow spider so that's the same fret back I mean it's a little bit different there was more the purple on the backside but that's because the backside is where I applied the purple and the front side is where I applied the rainbow colors but the site the side is what we're going for to make sure that that's fairly even the only place that I see just a little bit of difference is in this leg here and this leg here those and it just gets a little bit right there but the side-to-side is pretty good on this one here so we're gonna toss that in and then I'll complete this video have the results of everything at the very end thank you for watching okay here we are I got I didn't get back here in time to to show you the water after the first wash the first wash it's really dark this one here I can still see some color in there the first watch wash I will go ahead and let it run all the way through the wash cycle and then through the rinse cycle but for the next two I usually will stop it after the wash cycle and fast-forward it spin it out and if anything I might spray a little bit of water in there to do it rinse but then I fill it right back up with hot water again and so on the third one I'll come back here and check this water and it usually will be fairly well clear and if not then I'll go ahead and run it through one more hot wash cycle and I have just a little bit of suds that's kind of like how I like it I don't need you know big bubble bath but as long as there's just a little bit of suds that tells me that I have a little bit of soda ash in there or not so to ask excuse me I have a little bit of synth appall in the water and I know that I'm not going to have any back steam in it so we're gonna go ahead and let this sit and if I manage to stop the washer before it goes into the spin for the last cycle I'll show you how clear the water is and then of course I'll have all the results at the end of this video thank you you", "cEwUC58tMbY": "chapter 16 of etiquette this is a librivox recording all librivox recordings are in the public

Saturday October 2nd at 1 o'clock and hope that you and your husband and any guests who may be staying with you will come very Sincerely Yours Alice top lofty gilding golden hall September 27th a personal note always exacts a reply which may however be telephoned unless the invitation was worded in the formal third person a written answer is more polite if the hostess is somewhat of a stranger to you the formal luncheon of today luncheon being a daylight function is never so formidable as a dinner even though it may be every bit as formal and differ from the latter in minor details only luncheons are generally given by and for ladies but it is not unusual especially in summer places or in town on Saturday or Sunday to include an equal number of gentlemen but no matter how large or formal luncheon may be there is rarely a chauffeur on the sidewalk or a carpet or an awning the hostess instead of receiving at the door sits usually in the center of the room in some place that has an unobstructed approach from the door each guest coming into the rooms preceded by the butler to within a short speaking distance of the hostess where he announces the new arrivals name and then stands aside where there is a waitress instead of a butler guests greet the hostess unannounced the hostess Rises or if standing takes a step forward shakes hands says I'm so glad to see you or I'm delighted to see you or how do you do she then waits for a second or two to see if the guest who has just come in speaks to anyone if not she makes the necessary introduction when the butler or waitress has counted heads and knows the guests have arrived he or she enters the room Faust the hostess and says luncheon is served if there is a guest of honor the hostess leads the way to the dining room walking beside her otherwise the guests go in twos or threes or even singly just as they happen to come except that the very young make way for their elders and gentlemen stroll in with those they happen to be talking to or if alone fill in the rear the gentlemen never offer their arms to ladies and going into a luncheon unless there should be an elderly guest of honor who might be taken in by the host as at a dinner but the others follow informally the table candles have no place on a lunch or breakfast table and are used only where a dining room is unfortunately without daylight also a plain damask tablecloth which must always be put on top of a thick table felt is correct for dinner but not for luncheon the traditional lunch table is bare which does not mean actually bare at all but that it has a centerpiece either round or rectangular or square with placemats to match made in literally unrestricted varieties of linen needlework and lace the centerpiece is anywhere from 30 inches to a yard and a half square on a square or round table and from half a yard to a yard wide by length in proportion to the length of a rectangular table the placemats are round or square or rectangular to match and are put at the places or if the table is a refractory one instead of centerpiece and doilies the table is set with a runner not reaching to the edge at the side but falling over both ends or there may be a tablecloth made to fit the top of the table to within an inch or two of its edge occasionally there is a real cloth that hangs over like a dinner cloth but it always has lace or openwork and is made of fine linen so that the table shows through the decorations of the table are practically the same as for dinner flowers or a silver ornament or a penny in the center and flower dishes or compote chairs or patents filled with ornamental fruit or candy at the corners if the table is very large and rather bare without candles for vases or silver bowls of flowers or ornamental figures are added if the center ornament is of porcelain for porcelain figures to match have at least a logical reason for their presence or a bisque garden set of vases and ballast rods with small flowers and vines put in the vases to look as though they were growing follows out the decoration most people however like a sparsely ornamented table the places are set as for dinner with a place plate three forks two knives and a small spoon the lunch napkin which should match the table linen is much smaller than the dinner napkin and is not folded quite the same it is folded like a handkerchief in only four folds four thicknesses the square is laid on the place plate diagonally with the monogrammed or embroidered corner pointing down toward the edge of the table the upper corner is then turned sharply under in a flat crease for about a quarter of its diagonal length then the two sides are rolled loosely under making a sort of pillow effect laid sideways with a straight top edge and appointed lower edge and the monogram displayed in the center another feature of luncheon service which is always omitted at dinner is the bread and butter plate the bread and butter plate the butter plate has been entirely dispossessed by the bread and butter plate which is part of the luncheon service always as well as of breakfast and supper it is a very small plate about five and a half to six and a half inches in diameter in this putt at the left side of each place just beyond the forks butter is sometimes put on the plate by the servant as in a restaurant but usually it is past hot breads are an important feature of every luncheon hot crescents soda biscuits bread biscuits dinner rolls or corn bread the latter baked in small pans like pie plates four inches in diameter very thin bread that is roasted in the oven until it is curled and light brown exactly like a large Saratoga chip is often made for those who don't eat butter and is also suitable for dinner this double baked bread toast and one or two of the above varieties are all put in an old-fashioned silver cake basket or actual basket of wicker and passed as often as necessary butter is also passed or helped throughout the meal until the table is cleared for dessert bread and butter plates are always removed with the salt and pepper potts the service of luncheon the service is identical with that of dinner carving is done in the kitchen and no food set on the table except ornamental dishes of fruit candy and nuts the plate service is also the same as at dinner the places are never left plateless excepting after salad when the table is cleared and crumbed for dessert the dessert plates and finger bowls are arranged as for dinner flowers are usually put in the finger bowls a little spray of any sweet scented flower but corsage bouquets laid at the places with flower pins complete are in very bad taste the luncheon menu 5 courses at most not counting the passing of a dish of candy or after-dinner coffee as a course or more usually for actual courses are thought sufficient in the smartest houses not even at the world leaves or the gilding x' will you ever see a longer menu then one fruit or soup in cups two eggs three meat and vegetables for salad five dessert or one fruit two soup three meat and vegetables for salad five dessert or one fruit two soup three eggs for fowl or tame game with salad five dessert an informal lunch menu is seldom more than four courses and would eliminate either number one or number two or number five the most popular fruit course is a Macedonia or mixture of fresh orange grapefruit Malaga grapes banana and perhaps a peach or a little pineapple in fact any sort of fruit cut into very small pieces with sugar and maraschino or rum for flavor or nothing but sugar served in special bowl shaped glasses that fit into long stemmed and much larger ones with a space for crushed ice between or it can just as well be put in champagne or any Bowl shaped glasses after being kept as cold as possible in the ice box until sent to the table if the first course is grapefruit it is cut across in half the sections cut free in all dividing skin and seeds taken out with a sharp vegetable knife and sugar put in it and left standing for an hour or so a slice of melon is served plain soup at luncheon or at a wedding breakfast or a ball supper is never served in soup plates but in two handled cups and is eaten with a teaspoon or a bullion spoon it is limited to a few varieties either chicken or clam broth with a spoonful of whipped cream on top or bullion or green turtle or strained chicken or tomato broth or in summer cold bouillon or broth lunch party egg dishes must number a hundred varieties see any cookbook eggs that are substantial and rich such as Eggs Benedict or stuffed with potato foie gras and a mushroom sauce should then be balanced by a simple meat such as broiled chicken and salad combining meat and salad courses in one on the other hand should you have a light egg course like eggs surprise you could have meat and vegetables and plain salad or an elaborate salad and no dessert or with fruit and omit eggs especially if there is to be in aspic with salad the menu of an informal luncheon if it does not leave out a course at least chooses simpler dishes a bouillon or broth shirred eggs or an omelet or scrambled eggs on toast which has first been spread with a pate or meat puree then chicken or a chop with vegetables a salad of plain lettuce with crackers and cheese and a pudding or pie or any other family dessert or broiled chicken chicken croquettes or an aspect is served with the salad in very hot weather while cold food is both appropriate and palatable no meal should ever be chosen without at least one course of hot food many people dislike cold food and it disagrees with others but if you offer your guests soup or even tea or chocolate it would then do to have the rest of the meal cold luncheon beverages it is an American custom especially in communities where the five o'clock tea habit is neither so strong nor so Universal as in New York for the lady of a house to have the tea set put before her at the table not only when alone but when having friends lunching informally with her and to pour tea coffee or chocolate and there is certainly not the slightest reason why if she is used to these beverages and would feel their omission she should not pour out what she chooses in fact although tea is never served hot at formal New York luncheons iced tea is customary in all country houses in summer and chocolate not poured by the hostess but brought in from the pantry and put down at the right of each plate is by no means unusual at informal lunch parties iced tea at lunch in summer is poured at the table by a servant from a glass pitcher and is prepared like a cup with lemon and sugar and sometimes cut up fresh fruit and a little squeezed fruit juice plain cold tea may be passed in glasses and lemon and sugar separately at an informal luncheon cold coffee instead of tea is passed around in a glass pitcher on a tray that also holds a bowl of powdered sugar and a pitcher of cold milk and another as of thick as possible cream the guests pour their coffee to suit themselves into tall glasses half full of broken ice and furnished with very long handled spoons if tea or coffee or chocolate are not served during the meal there is always a cup of some sort grape or orange juice in these days with sugar and mint leaves and ginger ale or carbonic water if dessert is a hot pudding or pastry the hotel service of dessert plates should be used the glass plate is particularly suitable for ice cream or any cold dessert but is apt to crack if intensely hot food is put on it details of etiquette at luncheons gentlemen leave their coats hats sticks in the hall ladies leave heavy outer wraps in the hall or dressing room but always go into the drawing-room with their hats and gloves on they wear their fur neck pieces and carry their muffs in their hands if they choose or they leave them in the hall or dressing room but fashionable ladies never take off their hats even the hostess herself almost invariably wears a hat at a formal luncheon in her own house though there is no reason why she should not be hapless if she prefers or if she thinks she is prettier without guests however do not take off their hats at a lunch party even in the country they take off their gloves at the table or sooner if they choose and either remove or turn up their veils the hostess does not wear gloves ever it is also very unsuitable for a hostess to wear a face veil in her own house unless there's something the matter with her face that must not be subjected to view a hostess in a veil does not give her guests the impression of veiled beauty but the contrary guests on the other hand may with perfect fitness keep their veils on throughout the meal merely fastening the lower edge up over their noses they must not allow a veil to hang loose and carry food under and behind it nor must they eat with gloves on a veil kept persistently over the face and gloves kept persistently over the hands means one thing ugliness behind so unless you have to don't the wearing of elaborate dresses at luncheons has gone entirely out of fashion and yet one does once in a while see an occasional lady rarely a New Yorker who outshines a bird of paradise and a jewelers window but New York Women of Distinction wear rather simple clothes simple meaning untrimmed not inexpensive very conspicuous clothes are chosen either by the new rich to assure themselves of their own elegance which is utterly lacking or by the muttons dressed lam fashion to assure themselves of their own youth which alas is gone gentlemen at luncheon in town on a Sunday where cutaway coats in other words what they wear to church on a Saturday they wear their business suits sack coat with either stiff or pleated bosom shirts and a starched collar in the country they wear country clothes what the servants wear a butler wears his morning clothes cutaway coat gray striped trousers high black waistcoat black tie a hired waiter wears a dress suit but never a butler in a smart house he does not put on his evening clothes until after 6 o'clock in a smart house the footmen wear their dress liveries and a waitress and other maids were their best uniforms the guests leave the usual lunch hour is half past one by a quarter to three the last guest is invariably gone unless of course it is a bridge luncheon or for some other reason they are staying longer from half an hour to three quarters at the table and from twenty minutes to half an hour's conversation afterwards means that by half past two if lunch was prompt guests begin leaving once in a while especially at a mixed lunch where perhaps talented people are persuaded to become entertainers the audience stays on for hours but such parties are so out of the usual that they have nothing to do with the ordinary procedure which is to leave about twenty minutes after the end of the meal the details for leaving are also the sames for dinners one lady rises and says goodbye the hostess rises and shakes hands and rings a bell if necessary for the servant to be in the hall to open the door when one guest gets up to go the others invariably follow they say goodbye and thank you so much or at a little luncheon intimate friends often stay on indefinitely but when lunching with an acquaintance one should never stay a moment longer than the other guests the guest who sits on and on unless earnestly pressed to do so who is wanting in tact and social sense if a hostess invites a stranger who might by any chance prove a barnacle she can provide for the contingency by instructing her butler or waitress to tell her when her cars at the door she then says I had to have the car announced because I have an appointment at the doctor's do wait while I put on my things I shall be only a moment and I can take you wherever you want to go this expedient should not be used when a hostess has leisure to sit at home but on the other hand a guest should never create an awkward situation for her hostess by staying too long in the country where people live miles apart they naturally stay somewhat longer than in town or two or three intimate friends who perhaps especially in the country come to spend the day are not bound by rules of etiquette but by the rules of their own and their hostesses personal preference they take off their hats or not as they choose and they bring their sewing or knitting and sit all day or they go out and play games and in other ways behave as houseguests rather than visitors at luncheon the only rule about such an informal gathering as this is that no one should ever go and spend the day and make herself at home unless she is in the house of a really very intimate friend or relative or unless she has been especially and specifically invited to do that very thing the stand-up luncheon this is nothing more nor less than a buffet lunch it is popular because it is a very informal and jolly sort of party an indoor picnic really and never attempted except among people who know each other well the food is all put on the dining table and everyone helps himself there is always bullion or oyster stew or clam chowder the most informal dishes are suitable for this sort of a meal as for a picnic there are two hot dishes and a salad and the dessert which may be but seldom is ice cream stand-up luncheons are very practical for hostesses who have medium-sized houses or when an elastic number of guests are expected at the time of a ball game or other event the congregates a great many people a hunt breakfast is usually a stand-up luncheon it is a breakfast by courtesy of half an hour in time at 12:30 it is breakfast at 1 o'clock it is lunch regular weekly stand-up luncheons are given by hospitable people who have big places in the country and encourage their friends to drive over on some a special day when they are at home Saturdays or Sundays generally and intimate friends drop in uninvited but always prepared for on such occasions luncheon is made a little more comfortable by providing innumerable individual tables to which people can carry the plates glasses or cups and sit down in comfort suppers supper is the most intimate meal there is and since none but family or closest friends are ever included invitations are invariably by word of mouth the atmosphere of a luncheon is often formal but informal luncheons and suppers differ in nothing except day and evening lights and close strangers are occasionally invited to informal luncheons but only intimate friends are bidden to supper the supper table the table is set as two places and napery exactly like the lunch table with the addition of candlesticks or candelabra as a dinner where Supper differs from the usual lunch table is that in front of the hostess is a big silver tea tray with full silver service for tea or cocoa or chocolate or breakfast coffee most often chocolate or cocoa and either tea or coffee at the hosts end of the table there is perhaps a chafing dish that is if the host fancies himself a cook a number of people whose establishments are not very large have very informal Sunday night suppers on their servants Sundays out and forage for themselves the table is left set a cold dish of something in salad are left in the icebox the ingredients for one or two chafing dish specialties are also left ready at supper time a member of the family and possibly an intimate friend or to carry the dishes to the table and make hot toast on a toaster this kind of supper is in fact as well as spirit an indoor picnic thought to be the greatest fun by the kind hearts but little appreciated by the gilding z' which brings it down with so many other social customs to a mere matter of personal taste end of chapter 16 you", "KrsLyP4ArlM": "[ Telephone rings ] -Hello? -Hello, Mr. Halpert?

good and it's so quick it's so simple honey and I'm taking something so quick we gonna call this Minuteman pasta okay let's get to it y'all so I'm gonna start out with just boiling my stock here so I cook the pasta and as you guys know in this channel baby we don't just be using those salt baby but how we use some chicken stock so I'm gonna add my chicken boo-yan cuz I like to use the chicken but younger set of chicken stock because guess what it's more concentrated salt to show alleles and so I'm gonna add that to my water and then I'm going to also add a little bit of old bay to the water and if you want to add a bay leaf to this you totally can but baby um Oh Bay and the chicken bullion was good enough for me so fast later boy you're probably bring your water to a boil y'all is to put the lid on and just leave it alone come to a boil faster all right so I got my fresh garlic here now you know we don't use a whole lot of garlic on this channel ladies you know why okay cuz you know come out some other areas but today we're gonna make an exception okay just like eating asparagus one time of year gotta be careful with that too I'll be seeing y'all out there now hmm no she stopped doing but that's alright we're gonna use garlic today we're gonna be using about eight cloves of garlic don't be alarmed okay because until he's gonna cook down and it's not gonna be really really powerful like you think it is but if you don't want to use garlic you can use garlic powder or if you don't wanna use fresh garlic you just use garlic powder or the garlic paste that I typically use but I found that fresh garlic in this recipe was really good so I'm gonna just grate it with my dollar cheese grater here and I'm just going to just take my time suck your fingers back cuz don't nobody want to see you holding up the west side okay from grating garlic we don't need that over here we want to get food on the table okay not you to the hospital so make sure you protect yourself all right so I'm gonna chop up my scallions here that I love I found that Salyers in this truck so it's really really good or you can use fresh chives in this but just chop them up really really fine honey I mean fine it's cat hell okay fine as a man walking across the street baby that you don't look good and smell good no I would be looking at him like better I know he smells good I want him fine like that okay really really fine and just make sure that you just take your time and do this and just chop them up okay chopping is actually therapeutic if you got a good knife so make sure they look like this right here and just set them to the side now look at that beautiful water see don't using just that startup in their water you're gonna be something make sure you season at water okay and as you know in my macaroni cheese video that seat that chicken stop made that flavor good up in a macaroni okay so you know I'm leading you wrong here now I'm gonna be putting my spaghetti down I'm used to forgetting cuz that's the only thing I had on deck but you can use fettuccine or you can use linguine I wouldn't recommend using like a bow tie or a penne pasta I don't know I just feel like rubbing the pasta around that sauce get a nice sock dude I don't know I think the other pastas wouldn't work with this but you could try it on and let me know alright so today I'm gonna be working with scallops I love scallops now if you cook scallops right I'm tell you they are so good so I'm gonna Pat the scallops try and let the scallops to the sit out for about an hour so because you never want to cook your protein right out of the pan you know why it cooks the outside first and not the inside that's why I'm chicken breast y'all be making be dry as a nun's vagina don't need that okay make sure you always sit your protein out and let it come to like room temperature if you can okay so the top of the scallop is this right here you see it leaning over that is the top of the scallop and then we want to put that side down first okay so the side that's leaning that's the side that's the top of the scallop alright so I'm gonna be using truffle salt here from beautiful briny sea calm I love them so much I make sure to link their website down below so make sure you guys check them out love their selves gonna be using truffle salt today then I'm going to sprinkle it on my scallops with the truffle salt and also they're magic unicorn salt and then we're gonna just sit them to the side now the pasta is cooking so what I want to do while the pasta is cooking I want to preserve before we strain the pasta I want to preserve one cup of the pasta stock okay it has those beautiful thick starches in there from the pasta that we want okay we're gonna use that to make our sauce alright so now we're going to go ahead and sear our stylist off you guys want to show you a really easy trick to let you know when your styles are ready so we're going to just start out with adding oil and also our butter to the pan okay we're gonna get that nice and melted maybe take about two minutes or so and then we're gonna bring our heat up to medium-high heat we want the pan slightly smoking okay just like Uncle Joe gonna be smoking them cigarettes out there before Friday fish okay we want to spit the pan to be slightly smoked skin before we add our scallops okay once you see that the pan is slightly smoking like this right here I love you do that competencia we're gonna add our scallops in leaning side down that it's a top 5 speed you see you want to add your scallops in and put them in there a little bit at a time don't cook a lot at a time guys cuz we want to make sure the scallops are nice and sear and have that nice crisp on the top okay so this is how you know the scallops are ready it tastes scallops really about 1 to 2 minute per side but when they easily release from the pan then they are ready to flip okay when you ain't got the touch Adam okay like your man was cooking at you ladies on Valentine's Day and stuff how you threw them in the middle tonight you gotta forget it it's gonna easily release from the pan you want to do the same technique when cooking shrimp when it easily released from the pan then you just flip it over it's gonna let you know when it's ready baby and then you're gonna just cook the next side for about one to two minutes okay and once it easily released from the pan so you guys know that it is ready to take those scallops out I'm telling you that's the easiest way to cook them my dad my dad's gonna teach me to cook scallops for a very long time cuz he loves them and so that's the easiest way that I'd know okay see release from the pan very easily you ain't got a tug at it and you set them to the side y'all and I'm telling you they I'm melt-in-your-mouth D lid shuts okay really really really good so now that we were moving our scallops on the pan we're gonna use that same scallop juice okay residue and we're gonna make our sauce so I'm gonna be deglazing the pan with some white wine here I'm just gonna be using Chardonnay don't use no Moscato baby okay you know y'all a little bit shot I just don't use a sweet round I would I would definitely use like a some of your block or a Chardonnay or any type of dry white wine okay but don't use a sweet wine you don't want that so we're just gonna deglaze the pan with the white wine and we're just gonna just let that cook for about a minute or so once it's starting to kind of reduce a little bit then add in your fresh garlic or your garlic paste at this point you can't use about four tablespoons of garlic powder but yeah I'm telling you the fresh garlic just make it so delicious and so good and for Christ's sake for Christ's sake we're cooking scallops here get a little bougie go ahead and grate that garlic up okay so we're just gonna let that cook for about two minutes or so to get the garlic nice and cooked out okay we don't want that garlic like strong taste that you sometimes can give some garlic a you want to just kind of cook it a little bit and then once it starts to look like this after about two minutes or so y'all then we're gonna add in our butter as you can see the sauce is fine as I'm sorry the sauce is kind of thickening up okay and this is emulsifying and that's what we want okay so now that our butter is kind of melted into the sauce after we cooked it for about a minute then you're gonna add in your pasta water that stock that we got from the pasta that's what you're gonna add in right there to kind of loosen it on up you don't want it too tight okay this ain't no virgin pasta where you want to look you look some you know little loosey goosey okay so put that pasta man get it's up to it okay so we wanted to swirl that around just like that okay and you can see we're gonna let this cook for about two minutes or so I'm on medium heat now and now I'm gonna season it up at this cook down a little bit for about two minutes I'm gonna season it up with my truffle salt and also some fresh lemon juice and you can just catch the seeds in your hands like I'm doing here if you just let it just hang over your hand and squeeze the lemon juice it's gonna you'll be able to just catch the seeds like I'm doing and just discard the C's C so easy swirl that around just like this right here and just let it cook for about 30 seconds or so I wanted more lemon juice because we like the lemonade over here when I knit snap okay so I add a little bit of more lemon juice and I tasted it and I was like oh God it needs some more salt so season and you go okay taste and season okay add more what you want and what you don't want you know don't add another there now we're gonna add in our chopped scallions that we had on deck oh yeah we're done with the sauce this literally took less than ten minutes to make your sauce TIA okay we're gonna add our chopped scallions to that and y'all will just swirl them around in our pan here and let them cook for about 30 seconds just shake your pan and make you look like you fancy like they do on MasterChef and I'll let you shake the pan a little bit like idea and then add sure your uh your pasta to the pan like this right here I'm just laying my pasta down in there and we're just gonna toss it in that beautiful sauce you guys this is so good it's a very light pastas not too heavy and it is absolutely delicious I love this pasta and so does my daughter we love it love it make it all the time right so now this is done done we toss the puss around get a nice and sucked up and now we're going to add in our grated Parmesan I said Parmesan Lord Parmesan help me Jesus and then we're gonna grate our parmesan on top of the pot so I'm using freshly grated Parmesan because I like the fresh grater but if you want to use pregrated hey I ain't judgin nobody do whatever is convenient for you put that parmesan on top of that baby and let me tell you guys we done you can eat this right now okay just speak a little bit of parsley on there aka food glass and it's gonna be nice and beautiful for Instagram okay and you can either just like this but we ain't done we gotta add our scallops and I'm playing my beautiful stylist on top of the pasta y'all you can add shrimp at this point you can add grilled chicken it is delicious with salmon or any type of other fish you want to use get create of y'all this is so dark I mean it's a nice and light pasta it's perfect for the springtime too and you can just pair it with some garlic bread or a biscuit or

a question it's kind of embarrassing it's a pain you know where hemorrhoids um I've had three kids many bouts of this issue with hemorrhoids um 30 years going on now what can I do is there any way to get rid of them and never have them again or do I just have to live with this yeah comment through that's a great question yeah multiple kids absolutely this is actually there are a lot of reasons Rachel to be nice to your mom oh this is actually at the top of the list because you're right you know this is one of those inevitable battle scars of pregnancy and really hemorrhoids come down to one thing we have a demo here it really comes down to pressure so during pregnancy obviously our bellies are getting bigger we're straining we're pushing during childbirth and even another issue which is in the third trimester many women who are pregnant will have constipation all those things conspire to increase pressure in the belly and so what happens is we have a little demonstration any increased pressure is going to be transmitted to the vessels at the end of our rectum and Hemel has come in two flavors they come in internal and external hemorrhoids and both of these can occur during pregnancy they can occur after childbirth the good news there's good news and bad news and these good news is almost always hemorrhoids are going to get better after delivery and in the years thereafter she's been suffering with running off for 30 years is the bad news is they're never gonna go away completely unless yes the only way to get rid of hemorrhoids completely is with a surgical procedure which usually most people won't need so external hemorrhoids those are the ones that are causing your trouble causing burning irritation discomfort even pain so the easiest fix for that we all want fewer hemorrhoids right Fe W fiber exercise and water it's the first step soft bowel movements no straining that hopefully can cause hemorrhoids to go into remission but every now and then they're going to flare up so over-the-counter hemorrhoidal creams are great for those intermittent sort of every now and then symptoms if your symptoms don't get better in about a week or they come back every other week every month you're having symptoms that's really when you have to have an intervention see a physician see a surgeon who can take you might need surgery I'm sorry I wish that was better news bike well you're you meeting area so I'm a co-captain see ya any time the other thing which is interesting is that they did a research study recently so ninety percent of us use our phones on the toilet I know I do I'm not gonna ask you Rachel's personal but people that read and are on their phones on the toilet spend more time on the toilet and that actually worsens hemorrhage so leave your phone the book magazines outside the bathroom take care of business and move on that kind of made me wish [Applause]", "xMWJgYSKaUA": "hi everyone this is going to be my semi annual sale haul part 1 this part is going to be everything except for the candles just because I didn't want to make it too long so hopefully i'll post part 2 shortly after this video is up ok so let's get started the first thing that I got was rubra coconut shower gel body lotion and I was really glad that they brought this back because one of my friends had it last year and I really like the smell but when I went back to the store they were already out for the season the next thing is new are for men tune one hair and body wash and then sweet on Paris body lotion which also smells really good and I was also going to go get the shower gel of that they didn't have it the first time I went and the second time I got distracted of candles forgot to get it ok so moving on the next things that I got were foaming hand soaps first one is aspen autumn day winter cranberry which is an old packaging and then candy cane bliss I wasn't supposed to buy him or soaps but there were only like a dollar 38 with the seventy-five percent off so hey might as well we always use soap and then I accidentally bought these because I thought that they were um they didn't accidentally bought them I bought them because I thought they were the moisturizing hand soaps until I got home and realized they were actually lotion but they were really cheap to their seventy-five percent off so that's okay I really like the smell in the triple moisture cream but this one is not as strong but again it's okay it wasn't that bad for the price and the next two things that I got were these two fine fragrance mist when is frosted Snowberry and one is purse and more I was so happy to see the frosted Snowberry because I don't have that one and it was the last one left sitting in the seventy-five percent off been so that was a great time for me um the next thing that I got was um a few travel sized products I got this coconut water chill body mist and also the body lotion and as you can see this has been used to have a little I didn't notice if I brought it home but that's okay that was seventy-five percent off to then I got this secret wonder line shower gel love love love body lotion sweet cinnamon pumpkin body lotion Vermont honey apple body mist and not the autumn blackberry body mist I'll just give you a close up on those this one actually smells really really good none the sweet cinnamon pumpkin of course is always good and love love love I've never seen this one before I do not know when this is from secret wonder then they only had the shower gels really hoping to find the body lotion too but they didn't have it and then coconut water chill the next thing that I got were these three two sprays and I got them in mahogany teak wood and fresh balsam which are my all time favorite scents so I'm glad I got those and then I got a few pocket backs these are all fifty cents each the first one is island margarita Apple wreath fresh balsam iced injure Brad another fresh balsam and then this one's really pretty it's the japanese cherry blossom so when there's one more Mary marshmallow kiss and then I got this pocket back holder which was fifty cents and then there was some percent off but I don't remember how much it was okay um take these down and then the wallflower plugins and bulbs for three four five dollars mix and match and I think it's the best price they could ever be so I got three Wallflower plugins here's one and then there's this one and then another snowflake one I already bought this one by think i'm going to give this one away as a gift and then I got one sweet cinnamon pumpkin lip gloss and then I got one two three four five six seven eight nine Wallflower ball the first one is sweater weather then cranberry pear Bellini autumn snowed in twisted peppermint fresh linen sweet clementine pluck time and marshmallow fireside I was really hoping they have fresh balsam but they had none left in any of the stores that I went to I think that's the strongest scent in the wall flower bulbs or any other form of product at Bath & Body Works the fresh balsam is always a really strong one and also there's a few of the floral spring ones that are really good in the bulbs to this is all that I've gotten so far from the sale besides the candles I may go back to get a few more fragrance bulbs and plugins because they're so cheap right now you can't beat that price three four five I think in the states they had like 250 each yeah so thanks for watching and I'll post the candle hall soon after this video", "11AxzzVHyCs": "okay so i've seen a lot of people make amazing diy garden bars but are your drinks up to the same standard no worries i mean that's why i clicked on this video and i'm going to show you how to make these super easy garden cocktails that will impress all of your guests so we're going to start off with the mighty strawberry mojito you can use any container you want from this um you want to start off by spanking your mint because it's been very naughty but seriously spank your mint to get those flavors out add one strawberry and i'm going to use a muddler if you don't have that you can use a rolling pin or anything you find in your kitchen that can crush so you want to crush those strawberry and mint together until the strawberries pureed add some ice you want to add some ray nephew because that's the best rum out there but i'm jamaican so unbiased but anyone will do then you want to add some sugar syrups and some more ice and then stir together until fully combined so you want to add even more crushed ice and fill it up to the top and then you want to finish off with some sparkling water or as the americans call it club soda i used a small mint branch and strawberry for presentation you don't have to do this but it definitely makes your cocktails look a lot better moving on to the next cocktail this was definitely the most eye-catching because i use a secret ingredient well it's not secret because i'm going to tell you what it is and it's commonly used in the cocktail industry i use a blue butterfly pea flower which is basically a natural flower that changes the color of any liquid that is added to it the link will be in the description so now that we have all our ingredients let's make the cocktail spank your mint leaves and add some ice two thirds of the way you want to add some simple syrup and some rum you may notice that the color of the rum has changed due to the blue pea flower you want to stir that together and you want to add some more crushed ice i made this the day before this also has changed color because i also use the blue pea flower to make the ice cubes you want to finish it all off with some lime juice so we're going to move on to the gin based cocktails and we're going to start it off with the fresh berry bramble you want to add three blackberries and lightly crush them i use the cocktail shaker for the bramble if you do not have a shaker you can just use a bottle or a jar that has a lid add some lime juice some simple syrup gin and a small amount of crushed ice now all you got to do is shake for about 15 seconds and then add it to your fresh berries fill it all the way up with crushed ice and decorate with a lemon wedge and a fresh blackberry if this ain't making you thirsty then i don't know what will the final cocktail i made was the floradora which is a combination of sugar syrup lime juice raspberries and gin add a little bit of crushed ice and shake well for 15 seconds pour in your mixture and add crushed ice all the way up to the top this is optional i decorated it using a cocktail stick a lime wheel and fresh raspberry but you can decorate it how you like all measurements and ingredients will be in the description below there's not much

as the popularity of the tea obviously as we all know is the most popular beverage in India in fact not only in India across the world and also the largest drunk beverage off the water around the world so before we start let me introduce myself my name is the dance shoe I am actually published trainer by profession I have been training for more than 20 years now in the area of wine spirits tea and also beers so and decently I mean about few months back I drank a this company called s GW g so T W G's is a luxury brand of handcrafted teas from Singapore and I had the trainings and tastings for TWG here in India so if I talk about TW just to give you a little idea what twg is all about so TW g we have actually we did in both the variants we have loose teas as well as we have got some tea bags and the best part is we offer the largest penis in the world with more than 800 teas in our portfolio these that we use are only the orthodox teas that is basically the whole leaf is which is known to be the best grade of these when you talk about these there are certain grades of these right I'm sure you must have all come across these grades like the bullies or say the broken or could be the CTC grade or would be the dust grade so whole leaf or say no one locks these are considered to be the biggest size of the leaf has also the best in quality so what are tea bags as well as for a loose tea we use only the bully please so TWG journey 3 side the year 2008 when this company was formed back in Singapore and currently if you see the societies from single-spaced we also saw some exclusive plans and some seasonal trees from all the 4060 producing countries of the world and then you see these teas go to our headquarter our main manufacturing unit in Singapore where we process them we package them and we used to be across 42 countries including India so yes that was that was the bit about what TWG is all about and are these the case and also available in India for almost three to four years now in fact I have a cup of tea WGT one of my favorites while we talk I'll also keep sitting on my Dao I hope you all have a cup of tea with you in North not probably can just quickly go and grab a cup of tea so I did it it cost with teens Asian coffee which is based in Calcutta so they have different causes so I went through a week-long program which actually gives you a good insight in what T is all about the history the origin how to taste differently is or differentiate between teas but again if I see if you see P is a is a vast subject that is a lot to learn and more something which I have learnt is obviously through reading going through books or say through searching on Google's and our online courses are also available nowadays if you see like would\u00edve me offers an online course as far as I know that in fact they have no online courses available nowadays but yes if you were actually looking to become a deeper professional or at least some made a lot of Institute's or one of them as I said in popularization school of tea in India the students in sri lanka also which offers tea surveyor program and a couple of institutes and in Canada and us if you search them if you google will come across these tea Institute's but s I believe we use more about learning through experience through reading books and the more you taste seem like wise how you improve your palate and your knowledge is by tasting by by reading so that is how I also run in fact I would say I'm just learning about these it's a vast subject coming to our topic now today's topic the history and origin of tea so if I talk about now if you go back to the history of feet or so if you see the history of tea is as vivid and fascinating as the beverage itself so there are many stories behind these some of them will actually talk about some of them probably would be more realistic if you go through google or probably if you go through book some story that would towards the fictional side but here's one story which a lot of historians a lot of the experts believe is true is the story of the Emperor Shennong from China so China obviously is the place where he was discovered or probably was founded he can say almost 5000 years ago 2737 BC was the year when he was discovered and it was discovered by chance so there's a very interesting story behind the discovery of P so like I said this person Shen Gong he was the Emperor of China and he was also herbalist by profession so when you say how pleased he took keen interest in experimenting with herbs also making some medicines using the natural herbs and botanicals so what happened was one fine day he was sitting under a tree and he's having a cup of hot water because since I said it was 2700 BC the people in those days used to bring hot water warm water to keep themself immune from diseases so this person was having a cup of hot water and suddenly blown by the wind few dried leaves from the tree fell into his cup of hot water and to his surprise he saw that the color of the water started changing and it was some interesting aroma as we started coming out of that cup so he thought of taking a sip and the moment he took the sip of that particular beverage he found it very relaxing very soothing it was he felt like it this particular thing was just checking on in figuring his entire body and immediately the name char came from his mind from his mouth so char basically in Chinese means to check or to investigate because he found that this particular privilege is distinguished investigating us checking his entire body and then this is how the first name was given by Emperor Shennong was charming we'll also talk with you later about the nomenclature and how Shah became shy or say the it all depends basically on the route through which or the journey which he took to reach different countries different places and that's how the name kept changing so we'll I'll talk later about that so so like I said 2007 did BC every state was founded and if you see by the 300 ad which was basically the rule of the the Tang Dynasty in China he became quite popular because the Tang Dynasty which was basically the tang rulers they actually felt that we use a very beneficial beverage not only for help they were using it for medicines but people can also enjoy this particular drink on the regular places as a because of daily as a daily beverage or a daily drink and that is how the key started getting more popular and by the end of the 3rd century he became the National Bank of China so that is how widespread you can say the tea drinking culture in China became but yes the Chinese only thought of trading this particular commodity or say tea by the beginning of the 8th century so 8th century China started trading with the Arabs in the West with the talks and also through the Silk Route with Macedonia which was now basically Greece and that's how the tea culture started spreading and it was the same time today essentially if you see the Japanese also learned about the benefits of this particular drink and it was through the Buddhist monks because Buddhist monks also played a very important role in taking the tea culture or say this particular beverage to various countries because in those days the Buddhist monks they used to travel used to go on long journeys and they used to meditate and to keep themselves awake they always used to carry some tea with them or probably can say some stock of tea along with them whenever they used to feel sleepy or tired they always used to have a good cup of tea in fact there is another story I said in the beginning there are multiple stories you will find about tea so there is a other story which is moved towards the fictional side it's about the Indian monk called wat either man sure he must have all heard what bodies among was very popular Indian Wang so both either one he traveled to China he he went into a nine-year long and during the same period where he was meditating he fell really sleepy and for a few seconds he just closed his eyes and moment he realized this he immediately cut off his eyelids and the place on the ground where his eyelids fell tea bush sprouted from the earth so I'm I know this will sound little more fictional but yes there are such stories also if you see so but I'm not sure that this story was true or not but this is true that the what these with this long they played a very important role especially in picking P to the northeast in countries like the ruble Taiwan Vietnam for example even Japan cliff like I said came to know about tea only because of the contacts between to put these moms of these two countries so and Japanese still if you see for every traditional tea culture like the Japanese tea green tea ceremony and all these things and coming back to now China so like I said they started trade with these countries like the Arabs are say with with Turkey and Macedonia but still one major part of the world which was still unknown about this beverage was basically Europe and th still hasn't reached Europe so there was one difficulty in sending peoples in those days most of these these used to travel through ships so water was the only way of transporting and the ship journeys or the water journey is used to be very long journeys which means that these sometime used to the Tauri ate or dead spoil and most of teas which china was making at that time was only green things black teas came into picture much later say around the 13th century when china actually realized that they need to make some kind of peace which can stand long journeys and also if you see the credit of making or say manufacturing these threes the black piece goes to put this monks because they had already discovered this then say by chance because on the long journey is when they used to carry tea with them that he used to come say in contact with different letters could be could be arranged would be a hard summer or could be a winter and obviously when these are is exposed to different temperatures different climate the TV's the rain leaves used to get oxidized naturally and the use of turn into black so basically the oxidation process used to happen and when these books with this mom notice that the P has turned black in color they thought of just sipping it and checking it what exactly will taste like and it will and they found that it was much more stimulating give them a more stimulating effect compared to a green tea and it was like basically acting faster on their bodies so that is how they realize that this could also be a form of P and then the same the same secret was later on disclosed by the Buddhist monks and the Chinese people came to know and they immediately started producing black bees because the major target market was obviously Europe where they wanted to send out there but again QC till the 16th century there was no trade with Europe the trade only started because the Xhosa being between the small story ban how the trade between Europe and China the tea trade in Europe and China started so the great Italian merchants Marco Polo he actually traveled to China on his journey in the year basically towards the end of the 12th century Rockwell's 171 he was in China and that is where he meant another question guy called by the name of muhammad who had already known about that chinese people in certain province of china the sichuan province of china we are making basically growing a hub which they are using to make medicines for something like doubt which is like an arthritis and also for stomachache and but then they will be journey obviously Marco Polo is not disclosed this to anyone but after he came back obviously he told that if he discovered something called chai or char on his journey to China and this was actually published by an Italian writer and author almost 250 years later around mid of 15th century in a book in Scripture that Marco Polo had a particular which is going in China to use for different purposes like medicines for stomachache and Goward and all these things and that is when the Dutch people somehow came across this book the scripture they read it and that we're really smart because Dutch we're already that's how basically the residents of Holland also known as needle and that's really smart because they were only trading with China different other products at that part of time which is basically the beginning of the sixteenth century so immediately the set of a port in Java which is Indonesia who start trading these basically just to pick up sort of peas from China and import them straight for Europe and the first consignment of Chinese teas which landed in euro was said in Amsterdam to be exact was in the Year 1606 and that is how he finally is Europe and a master diamond Holland was the first country to receive the Chinese consignment yes if you go by the history yes it was it was Greece first who received it to the Silk Route but it was more of a green tea but we talk about the black tea was the first black keith and sangmin reached amsterdam in europe and from there obviously later on if you see by the middle of the 16th century they interest among the wealthy upper class of europe started going for this particular beverage because it was an expensive commodity no doubt it is the Dutch we're importing it from China and then again they'll be exporting it to countries like France Germany and Portugal so there were heavy duties taxes imposed on T which making it an expensive beverage at least for the Europeans and then what happened was the people in Portugal especially the royal court of Portugal all the people of the royal families in Portugal they found P very very interesting and they started enjoying this particular beverage and at the at the same time the princes of Portugal have her name was Catherine of Braganza and she became an avid fan of this particular beverage specially the black tea and in the same year towards the end of the same year in 1662 she got married to King Charles who was the King of England and the interesting part was this lady was so fond of tea that she brought an entire cast black pieces dowdy along with her to England and that is how the black piece started and she started this culture of serving black bees in the port of England and the royal families and she used to invite those people from the royal families as her guest her French used to come to the court of England and they all used to enjoy this black tea and then slowly and steadily this tea culture especially the black tea culture in the European upper class before I go visit the British upper class people started growing and that is when the Singlish breakfast tea also it became really popular I'm sure you must have all heard about the English breakfast tea so English breakfast tea or if you see is a very popularity not only saying Lynne but all over the world now and the English people they usually have by every means elaborate kind of breakfast is called the English breakfast which sometimes could have seven to eight different courses and to accompany this English breakfast the Queen Catherine of Braganza she also added the black tea has one of the main courses to the English breakfast and that is how to be also got its name English breakfast tea because it is supposed to be hired by the English people in the breakfast and usually all English breakfast tea that you see our blinds of some the best black teas which are from Assam chania and also from serum or what we also known to recall as Sri Lanka so that's basically the composition of English breakfast and most of the British people they always love to having a strong cup of black teas either the little amount of milk or maybe also some sugar but yes this became like a proper tradition in England on the British people drink black beans and the demand that we started growing slowly in in England for other for black beans but like I said since it was an expensive commodity for them every class of people cannot afford it but yes by if you see by the end of the 17th century Europe especially the the English people the East India Company was formed and East company decided of trading directly with China without involving Dutch people or the Dutch East India Company because they were reporting it and were selling these in England at a higher cost they thought of trading directly with China and that's what actually happened so the treat which China directly started the taxes went down he became much more affordable commodity but unfortunately in the year 1840 the British declared a war on China and China retaliated by imposing a ban on the export to England which means there was no key coming from China to Europe to England and England was obviously depending completely on China but the best thing was by that time the British gone teas or tea plantations were almost ready in in Assam so what I'm trying to say is basically now I'm coming to the history of TNN they are how the EPS released India so again three if you see the trade of introducing tea to India goes to the British and there's a person called Robert Bruce who's known to a pioneer of tea in India so he was a British guy he was sent to Assam in the year around 1823 on a mission and that is where he found these tea plants or tea saplings growing wild on the foothills of place called gram food which is was then the capital of Assam and he immediately recognized that this is something similar to tea and this would be from the tea family now he actually if you see come from one party all these come from one particular plant and the botanical name is camellia Sciences so camellia is the family and then there are two species which is camellia Sciences Sciences which is the china tea and there is camellia sinensis assamica which is basically a native tea to us and so this was tea that we found was actually camellia sinensis assamica new completely new species of chameleon senses but nobody was confirmed at that time so unfortunately Robert Bruce died the very same year on his mission but he gave the responsibility to his brother to pick up some saplings and Thomas CP seeds from run food and Assam and send them to the botanical garden in Calcutta to get them tested and verified if this is coming from the same camellia family and his brother did the same thing in 1824 he went all the way to the uncle picked up few these sapling seeds send them all the way to the Calcutta Botanical Garden and the botanical garden confirmed that this is will this belongs to the commedia family but they were not sure if this is the same camellia Sciences which is going in China this is a different species altogether and then since obviously like I said the British the love-40 the Britishers were very keen I'm going some tea in India because they are not getting any consignment from China so immediately in 1840 Lord William Bentinck who was the governor the governor-general of India at that time he gave it this order to form the committee and basically the whole of the tea committee was to pick up these these saplings seeds get them tested in the lab and confirm that or probably up went they also in fact approached China they got them tested to China to confirm this is the camellia and this is basically a different species and by the 1836 commercial bee plantations finally started in Assam and the first chests of Indian made Assam black tea was saying to London auctions in the year 1839 and it was accepted in fact very well accepted which you see the British respected English people they locked the Assam be much better than the Chinese black tea and that is how the Assam black teas became much more popular and gained much more popularity till then if you see the petitions of people in England this they prefer have some black tea over any other black piece because that's the tradition that they have been following since that time of drinking the black piece so that is how he got introduced to India now if you see India I mean so the tea drinking habit was introduced by the British but like most of the things like the Indians are usually found off or if you can say we have a habit of giving our own twist for everything right so whenever we is we come across something new we always try to give it like it like nice Indian tartar to it and in simple words if I have to say like to example the Chinese food I mean I'm sure you most of you are for easier the the street Chinese food that we get here in India so we actually believe that that is actually not authentic Chinese but we call it a different cuisine all together it's called ginger because even because we give basically a Chinese food cook with some Punjabi taka correct me if I'm wrong but I think that is something which is I won't waste to give and the Chinese perspective these roadside Chinese stalls which the kind of Chinese food that they make with lot of spices and lot of masalas and all right so that is how he also got its own twist to it and by the time if you see generous doses of cardamom sugar milk ginger being added and instead of growing we Indians we started cooking and boiling out these so the tea when the British introduced the tea culture it was actually supposed to be brewed or infused right so I didn't even you when you infuse are you a cup of tea you're supposed to takes about 2.5 grams of people example have taken a tea cup so this tea bag contains 2.5 grams so you see in key back three major inputs but even if you are not using a tea by using a loose tea you can always take a teaspoon full of tea and threw it at about say 150 to 200 ml of water which is ideal to brew it or say infuse it and then the British always used to add a little hint of say milk to it something used to bring black or very little milk just to top it up and some out of sugar but in India like I said we never like that way of drinking tea because we wanted something different and we gave it our own Indian twist by adding or say making a masala chai by just cooking so I still feel that in India we never brought these we always to Gardens which is - and it is all this is the fact accepted all across the one and that is how we actually like that again anything wrong in that but yes certainties example if you are thinking a very good say green tea or maybe a white tea or something then you're not supposed to cook it idea what a temperature should be little less than hundred degrees and you can always infuse it so nice a 100 degrees I'm not saying you need to take a thermometer pull it up in your water and check every time he says that you need to take your pan of water coughs say before few seconds before it comes but each is to a boiling point because you read these wipe the very one second oolong tea is a very very delicate so the moment you use boiling hot water first of all it also kills the water because water is supposed to have certain mineral contents water has it going on taste and characters secondly when you pour such hot boiling water on your tea leaves especially if you are using a good quality tea it also kills the leaves and you don't get the kind of aroma flavor character that we are expecting but yes so in India if you see most of these black teas they are very popular and they were all CPC variety but we also known as the fact their ankle so cutting tearing and curling is a process so mostly all the things that you use at home your Indians use at home is called the CTC chai or it's the cutting pairing and curling process hence it is called CTC or from bloke I was going you know both in that I got a child so that is our child any any brand that you usually use at home would be society they're not anything they're all basically CT CTS so they undergo a process called cutting tearing and curling wearing you cut the leaves the tear it and they curl it to a machine called the rotor vane and most of these P manufacturing units so talking about not coming back to the India's rethinking culture from that time how it avoided if you see so like I said you already gave the arrow twist misawa chai became very popular so a cup of tea on the busy streets of Mumbai very soon became a cutting child right and then slowly and steadily you see and as as we see them the diversity of flower land itself the tea drinking culture the peeping methods also changed every hundred kilo and there are many such examples of this example if you talk about the petting chai from Mumbai the recently invented and which I from from Pune I'm sure you must have heard about it and which I've just getting are very popular nowadays so this was this tea brewing house in Pune who actually introduced it called the China and now love sealer thought these thoughts across India they are all making them to each other but if you go to Hyderabad it's more about Iran each other you go to Kashmir it's about carve out the pink chai of the gulab each ad that they call it you go to Calcutta cooler chair with little cases so cooler tie is something which is very very popular all around India it's not only so once one for nighttime cooler which I was supposed to be referring people in the north of India especially in Delhi and you piano tarantula but nowadays you see you find cool dead child ghosts everywhere and with a new twist to it maybe they don't twist so the example cubes will try to pull their child in Calcutta it will be with few strands of case' sprinkled on top and most of the people in in thought that I enjoy with catch or ease of it some hot Jala bees the same cooler chai the day I've seen I think a few these stalls in CP 100 who saw cooler child a lot of these food items like the sign which is again samosas and all these things things up so every place you see has its own body salam but there is a more very important way of making tea called the na gori chat so now goodies basically muslim community from rajasthan and now every child very popular in cities like Bombay also that actually the Nagar each I came from there so Naga which is nothing but basically making the child with thickened milk you so basically they allow the milk to boil over a slow flame until it gets thick and it's like a full cream milk which they use which is then say very very thick and rich kind of tea with lots of sugar so this is how basically the pea drinking culture in India has been taken over by different states if every place has a new way of making peace and then a few years back obviously the coffee culture starter certainly growing and I thought that the tea drinking might just go down and coffee is going to dominate especially with the Maneri oats with a new century or the new generation drinking coffee a lot of coffee chains coming up in India or the sea CDs or say the Starbucks but the last couple of years have been seen that there's again a resurgence of tea in India with a lot of these peak a few chains now again coming up whether it is the chives or the other tougher each I and there are many more such examples and they're all basic or example in Maharashtra in Mumbai or burrata we have a local tea chain called the affiliate which is basically again making some very rich teas with thickened milk with lots of sugar and some ginger and I some brutally became really really popular and a lot of different outfits of amphiphilic a mile across Maharashtra so and so which actually and I actually felt good that yes the pee drinking culture is back again and people still locked be more over coffee and there are obviously reasons for it and so that is how he became more popular and again if you go back to the history so that was the time when when the tea drinking culture started growing people started making different types of teas infused with masalas or say different spices of media the ingredients and so I can see that the the country found its new addiction apart from fighting for the freedom it was basically the tea which was the new addiction of the people of India and it still continues hopefully like so not talking about how these are teas are say different from each other like I was talking about in the beginning say the green peas or the black teas so it all depends on basically on the the manufacturing process how you manufacture your teas so like black tea is the undergo process called oxidation wearing the teas are first so I will explain it in a very simple mix there are basically a sixth step or a Six stage process for making things first when the leaves are plucked or harvested second they go for a bit drink process of the also known as a drying process where in some hot here a plus passed through the we used to have natural sunlight under which the TV's leaves used to dry this is just to reduce the moisture content in the leaves to about 60 to 70 percent and then the third stage is basically the rolling of the leaves so the reefs are also road especially for making a black tea or like a CDC teeth and the scoring process is very very important in green peas and say that in white peas ruling is not required this green tea is they just dried either by pan frying or could be a steeping process so that is where the difference in different these styles are so black tea is my view see the green peas usually doing for health reasons type in fact the team drinking one when I is when I said when feeding once again became popular couple of years ago in India it was a green tea which also started dominating the market lot of people switch to green teas but people were health conscious they are very conscious of the weight conscious they all started to drink green tea or even doctors strategizing doing things so now why green tea is better for health though some people have also seen who are used to taking the normal cook child or say the boiled chai at home the masala chai sometimes they don't like even like the taste of the green teas but they just drink it as a medicine so now is the green tea is much more rich in say antioxidants it is not processed so processing I mean when you roll the leaves and then you again allow the leaf to oxidize or basically undergoing oxidation process which is done under certain temperature somewhere between 26 to 28 degree celsius and humidity level is also maintained and that is where because when you roll the leaves obviously the leaves break the cell walls break and there are certain compounds which are present certain proteins which are present which start converting into different compounds like for example certain attachments polyphenols which are present they convert into something called a sea of levels of flavonoids which give flavor and color to the teas and as well as when you talk about the certain proteins which are present which break up into amino acids and that is also the the caffeine content the theme content starts increasing in your tea and that is well and that is the reason why when you think of black coffee cup to talk of say a black tea compared to a cup of green tea you get an instant kick all you get stimulated very quickly because black tea has more thin content so no way I'm saying this word clean because team is very different from caffeine so caffeine is also in I know I said we're and team is also the same thing but empty there are two different things found this theme in this 3:11 so three is very similar then say to Kathleen gives you the same effect but the only difference is caffeine have an instant effect on your body because caffeine is absorbed much more quickly by our body and hence when you have a cup of black coffee you get an instant kick you better understand you feel instantly energetic whereas he takes time it has the most soothing and relaxing effect on your body initially and then it slowly we spooky stores your energy this is because of something called as the Thea fragrance or theanine which is also there so she I mean again is a kind of mine oyster which is known to give you a more soothing and relaxing effect compared to what testing gives see so this is the major difference rod first thing that he also has tapping so there's nothing wrong in saying it happened was thin and laughing they have a similar if you see chemical molecular structure it's only that and like I said in caffeine the molecular structure is quite loose the menu sip with the molecules are absorbed by your body immediately whereas thin has a much more complex structure hence it takes time for a body or blood to absorb Keenan has a slow effect on the body and I think we already talked about the booing time and the temperature so depending on what tea which tea you are using you can always refer to you so I think this end should be a 1 tea spoon full of people you doing a good cup of say power 200 ml of tea or it could be the tea bag so we usually have these cotton tea bags indeed abusive yourself silicon tea bags and we pack about exactly 2.5 grams of tea in these tea bags and you can brew it in about 200 ml of water then temperature is very important especially if you're doing a black tea like I said it should be about 90 95 degree Celsius maximum coming talking about white please drink ease it should be slightly thank you probably about 75 to 80 degrees Celsius which means you just need to keep you you don't need to just boil your water or even if you have heated it up to a certain extent try to allow it to stand for some time before you put it in your teas because like I said 70 suddenly is a very delicate so they might just ruin the flavor with the character of the teas and also talking about so we already spoke about Assam things like this like I said no Assam was the first place where the commercial tea plantations were were set up by the Britishers in the year 1836 and the tottering plantations actually took little time so dodging tea plantations because they went once Assam was successful they also tried growing the tea saplings and in Darjeeling but darkening since the climate is very different if you see the edging has a much cooler climate Assam has a much hotter or you can say moderate kind of climate so again the climate the soil the place where you are growing your tea plants has a very very important role to play as far as what flavor what that coyote is going to be this is very much like wines when when you make wines with a particular trait the character of the wine will depend on where that particular grape is going whether it is going France or this is going in India and that is how the grape is going to give flavor say character to your wine same way it's with the tea leaves also so that Lee Crimea actually was more suitable for the Chinese variety which I said victim alias analysis so some Chinese variety sapling and these links we're especially brought from China and planted androgyny in fact there were some hybrid varieties also developed which were especially for dodging which the development attack touted a botanical garden which were basically one more third variety of tea called the time area Sciences Cambodia which is actually a local variety in Cambodia not very popular as a beverage itself because a lot of combo dean camellias answers varieties goes basically in plants so the cambodian variety was actually blended with the chinese variety and then that's how the tides the Darjeeling tea plantations started growing and that thing obviously became much more popular because of the flavor the character the delicate nature of the piece so like I said when you enjoy a cup of Assam tea it's it's strong enough it has a nice color to it rather nice malty piece just like a nice red burgundy wine whereas if you taste a tea from Darjeeling which is much more lighter in color or probably could have a nice delicate taste and flavor to it because of the climatic conditions because actually you see most of these plantation on the foothills they receive maternal spells of rainfall the climate is not very hot they have good winters so all these things also decide the flavor and the tactics of the teas like I said some of the black beans coming from some of these protocol countries like Assam sorry like India or say Ceylon Sri Lanka and then Kania because they have hot climates have these countries are known for producing black because black teas when oxidation they need quite a good temperature and lot of humidity is required so so that's what that was all about how we differentiate these how do we how can we basically brew these these now also coming about talking about the storage of the teas I think the lot of people ask me something how to store these usually these enough are not really foresee in terms of storage yes you need to keep them at a cool dry dark place in the airtight watertight containers and ensure that you keep them in a place which is away from the sunlight or direct heat and yes you also need to ensure that the tea is not exposed to any kind of moisture because moisture or air can easily spoil your teas so maybe in a display cabinet or in a shelf somewhere you can keep your tea safely and teas can easily stand in temperature between 26 to 30 degree such as anything above 30 degrees could be a problem for these then basically make the teas do toreador spoil quickly otherwise there is no such harm in storage or storing these but if so I have a question from Spanish she says how do you taste these now again it depends on what kind of tease you are drinking or you think you go to the tea gardens of the three states you will see that there are professionals tasting is with teaspoons and they will have certain tea bowls and they will have different things and also the tea leaves the boot leaves displayed in front of them they are going to smell the leaves they're going to smell the brew and they will take it seep up the teeth keep it in your mouth for some time just swirl it around like how you taste your wines and then they will spread it out and that is how you differentiate but again for that you need to have a trained palate it's not really easy to differentiate initially but you see a because I remember I had in my previous company when I was working I had a chance to visit the manufacturing unit with the blending unit of morality which is in Calcutta and that is where I saw these professional blind girls having 15 to 20 years of tasting experience and every day they taste about 100 to 150 different teas because again if you see most of these the commercial team units they take these from different P Gardens and then their job is to basically blend these teas and blending again obviously depends on until you taste you cannot understand what should be going in that the same like are you blend your whiskey's or blend your scotches same like blending teas you need to understand the flavor profile or the character profile of that particular teas so yes it's texting teas is I believe is it's a job which you comes through more of explained in the more these you taste the more you sell them the more you understand about these teas and how to blend them and this tannins also play a very important role so like I said initially most of us when we drink green teas we find them initially when you start drinking green tea if you say example somebody who's switching from a black theatre normal masala chai a green tea you will not like the flavor of the taste of the game team and initially I'm sure you're going to add a lot of honey or sugar to it just to dilute that bitterness return is in green peas or even save oolong teas is very natural and natural because he also has a component called tandem stance supposed to be sometimes a drying effect came out and also give you that with a thing but yes if you want for health reasons then you should keep your taste profile aside and start drinking green teas and again when you drink green beans it's not that only drinking green teas will help you lose weight a lot of people have this myth that I have started using green tea now start losing weight or correctly I be more slim more it's also should be accompanied I believe firstly be complete by regular exercise and also anything controlled on your diet and then I'm sure the green teas can work wonders for you it's not only about the weight loss we tea has many many more health benefits so if you I mean this actually reminds me of very beautiful words which the former Prime Minister mr. William Gladstone of England once upon a time he said that if you are cold he is going to volume and if you are warm it's going to pull you if you are depressed is going to cheer you so this is these are basically the words of the British prime minister and these actually do mean indicates the health benefits of tea and how beneficial with the could be as a beverage it's not only about the weight loss but yes we have certain phytochemicals which help the body to find five certain radicals certain free cells in our body could be cancer causing cells and also the cottage cheese which are basically the kind of can say qualifying out which are natural representing please help us help our body to reduce the or inhibit the growth of LDL LDL B is basically nothing but in technical terms the doctors called a radial it is called low-density lipoproteins or in layman's language you call it bad cholesterol basically so bad cholesterol is something which leads to a lot of heart disease hypertension obesity or could be a way in so the antioxidants the tea usually in a pit leg which means they reduce the blend so bad cholesterol in our blood and increase the good cholesterol level and others thanks and obviously antioxidants are maximum in your green tea use of ICTs or even Ceylon teas compared to black teas and he also is the natural source of fluoride there are people sometimes have seen have medicines to maintain the flow rate levels blurring something is essential for bones are not put enamel to remain healthy okay so T is a natural source of that and also in certain countries teal also known to be special the green is also known as the beauty P any idea have you have heard about this why you buy these green tea is called the beauty P so the answer to this is lot of spas or these thinning skin treatment clinics in different countries they also use green peas to apply on the skins because green tea is known to open the pores of your skin and all the skin to retain probably also grow in fact what females have seen times they apply the matcha tea face back on the watch is actually a kind of tea from Japan which is actually a powdered green tea which is a fine powder of 3 which is very popular in the Japanese green tea ceremony so the Japanese people they use a wooden whisk and they take a bowl you wish to put to matcha powder pour some hot water angry with the tea until it Frost's and then they drink it along with that so there is no straining of the leaves occurred because it's the powder from tea just drink it straight with hot water so that's the gun and much also very useful for the skin so a lot of times you might see of people applying mature skin face packs on the phone so these are some of the health benefits of tea at the best part is tea also boosts up your immune system that is something which is very very important actually in the current situation if you see we should be drinking out of team commit 19 and everything going around to to build up our natural immune system it's very important again to drink lots of tea alright so I think most of things have already covered in this session but this drug there is a lot to know about the and show some of you might have more questions but we can schedule another session where anything can talk more about the the brewing of the uh probably the use of tea in cooking use different times because I'm singer of chefs nowadays using the in fact in TWG also we have some tea infused confectionery items so the neck some macaroons we make some tea cakes which are actually flavoured with some of our teas and basically he concoctions and yes he is something which cannot drink in every season it does it minute what people think that now it is summer so the peer inking should go down this tea is not supposed to protect in summer but there's nothing like it can always make some nice beautiful iced teas using teas at home you can just make some whole cold decoctions so make some cool decoctions keep in the fridge cool it and then you can just blend it with anything that you have at home some natural increase could be a watermelon juice or probably you can just make a normal simple lemon ice tea and so there are different ways what we enjoy your tea and in summer of this winter's obviously be like sipping tea so inside in rainy season we link our teas with Paco - but yes summer sometimes I've seen sometimes the pea consumption goes down other people think that tea Mike do you think you not might not be good in some ways but yes you can always make some iced teas in fact you can also follow our page on Instagram which is called the tea WGT India or you can also follow my personal handle which is going to Italy but in we keep hosting a lot of tea recipes and in case given the lock down if you have managed to spare some alcohol at home you can also try these nice cocktails with things so for these recipes you can always check for recipes some nice videos and pictures on our Instagram handle which is GW GT India and in fact you can also send me your any queries any questions on my human ID which is the very tip Yan Xiu after a gmail.com or you can just DM me on my insta handle or my facebook handle so until then until we meet again thank you very much all of you stay safe stay home stay together take good care of yourself and your loved ones and yes to drink lots of tea to keep yourself Jimmy thank so let me sign off thank you very much", "mjB3DJFIP_M": "hi guys in today's video I'm gonna show you the complete guide to cleaning your sink and disposal without using any chemicals or you're going to need is baking soda white vinegar in a sponge in a toothbrush carvanha start by mixing 5 tbsp of baking soda with one cup of vinegar and be careful because it is going to react [Music] [Music] and over here I have one cup of white vinegar in 1 tablespoon of down dishwasher soap you don't need the down dishwasher soap but I already had it for a shower project cleaning project so it if you don't have the down it's fine and I will just spray the entire thing [Music] I will let it sit for about 10 minutes so I'm gonna start scrubbing these chips with my toothbrush you can see already how shiny it is and I'm just gonna set it aside and then I'll take this one and you can actually take it apart and then use my toothbrush to clean the the inside edges that it's hard to clean [Music] next I'm gonna scoop some of the baking soda from the bottom of the tray and start scrubbing the sink and I am not pushing hard because it has already been soaking with the vinegar for about 15 or 20 minutes [Music] and now that your sink is completely clean you also have to clean the blades in your disposal and you can do this by closing some ice in the disposal and running it and that will clean the blades are normally when I eat lemons limes oranges I would store those little ends that are basically useless and so right now there are like a little ice cubes because I keep them in the freezer and I will toss them out there so at the same time they will clean my disposal and make my sink smell nice too and you got yourself a brand new freshly smelling and shiny sink ee organic no chemicals no poisons and it was done in about 20 minutes [Music] [Music]", "ikiVEH4L-34": "Coffee drinks are made by brewing hot water\n(or much less commonly, cold water) with ground coffee beans. The brewing is either done slowly by drip\nor filter, French press or cafeti\u00e8re, percolator, etc., or done very quickly under pressure\nby an espresso machine, where the coffee is termed \"espresso\"\u2014slow-brewed coffees are\ngenerally called simply \"coffee\". All coffee drinks are based on either coffee\nor espresso, in different strengths; some drinks have milk or cream added, some use\nsteamed milk, cream, plant based milk, or foamed milk, some have flavorings or sweeteners,\nsome have alcoholic liqueurs added, some are combinations of coffee with espresso or tea.With\nthe invention of the Gaggia machine, espresso, and espresso with milk such as cappuccino\nand latte, spread in popularity from Italy to the UK in the 1950s, then to America, and\nwith the rise in popularity of the Italian coffee culture in the 1980s it began to spread\nworldwide via coffeehouses and coffeehouse chains.The caffeine content in coffee beans\nmay be reduced via one of several decaffeination processes to produce decaffeinated coffee\n(sometimes known as \"decaf\" coffee), which may be drunk as regular, espresso or instant\ncoffee. == Infused == === \nDrip or filtered === Drip-brewed, or filtered, coffee is brewed\nby hot water passing slowly over roasted, ground coffee beans contained in a filter. Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing\nits oils, flavours and essences, solely under gravity, then passes through the bottom of\nthe filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the\nfilter with the liquid falling (dripping) into a collecting vessel such as a carafe\nor pot. Paper coffee filters were invented in Germany\nby Melitta Bentz in 1908. To reduce waste, some coffee drinkers use\nfine wire mesh filters, which can be re-used for years. Many countries in Latin America and Africa\ntraditionally prepare drip coffee using a small reusable bag made of cotton or other\ncloth. === French press or cafeti\u00e8re === A French press, also known as a press pot,\ncoffee press, coffee plunger, cafeti\u00e8re (UK) or cafeti\u00e8re \u00e0 piston, is a coffee brewing\ndevice patented by Italian designer Attilio Calimani in 1929. A French press requires coffee of a coarser\ngrind than does a drip brew coffee filter, as finer grounds will seep through the press\nfilter and into the coffee.Coffee is brewed by placing the ground coffee in the empty\nbeaker and adding hot (93-96 degrees Celsius, 200-205 degrees Fahrenheit) water, in proportions\nof about 28 grams (1 ounce) of coffee to 450 ml (15 fluid ounces) of water, more or less\nto taste. After approximately four minutes the plunger\nis pressed to separate the grounds and hold them at the bottom of the beaker, then the\ncoffee is poured. Coffee press users have different preferences\nfor how long to wait before pressing the plunger, with some enthusiasts preferring to wait longer\nthan four minutes. === Cold brew === Cold brewing, also called cold water extraction\nor cold pressing, is the process of steeping coffee grounds in water at cool temperatures\nfor an extended period. Coarse-ground beans are soaked in water for\na prolonged period of time, for 12 to 24 hours. The water is normally kept at room temperature,\nbut chilled water is also used. The grounds are filtered out of the water\nafter they have been steeped using a paper coffee filter, a fine metal sieve, a French\npress, or felt, in the case of the \"Toddy\" brewing system. The result is a coffee concentrate that is\ndiluted with water or milk, and is served hot, over ice, or blended with ice and other\ningredients such as chocolate. Slow-drip cold brew, also known as Kyoto-style,\nor as Dutch coffee in East Asia, refers to a process in which water is dripped through\ncoffee grounds at room temperature over the course of many hours. Cold brew can be infused with nitrogen to\nmake nitro cold brew coffee. Because the ground coffee beans in cold-brewed\ncoffee never come into contact with heated water, the process of leaching flavor from\nthe beans produces a chemical profile different from conventional brewing methods. Coffee beans contain a number of constituent\nparts that are more soluble at higher temperatures, such as caffeine, oils and fatty acids. Brewing at a lower temperature results in\nlower acidity and lower caffeine content when brewed in equal volume. It is around 65 to 70 percent less acidic\nthan hot drip coffee or espresso, per part. Although less caffeine is extracted with the\ncold brew method, a higher coffee-to-water ratio is often used, between 2 and 2 1/2 times. This may compensate for this difference in\nsolubility, resulting in a brew with equal, if not more, caffeine (although this is unlikely). == Boiled == === Percolated === A coffee percolator is a type of pot used\nto brew coffee by continually cycling the boiling or nearly-boiling brew through the\ngrounds using gravity until the required strength is reached. There are stove-top percolators and standalone\nunits which contain a built-in heating element. Percolators were popular until the 1970s,\nwhen they were widely replaced by drip coffee makers. By the mid-1970s, many companies ceased production\nof percolators. In the 2000s, old 1970s-era percolators can\noccasionally still be seen at church functions and community events. === Turkish coffee === Beans for Turkish coffee are ground to a fine\npowder. Preparation consists of immersing the coffee\ngrounds in water and heating until it just boils. This method produces the maximum amount of\nfoam. If the coffee is left to boil longer, less\nfoam remains. In the Middle East, four degrees of sweetness\nare used. The Turkish terms and approximate amounts\nare as follows: sade (plain; no sugar), az \u015fekerli (little sugar; half a level teaspoon\nof sugar), orta \u015fekerli (medium sugar; one level teaspoon), \u00e7ok \u015fekerli (a lot of sugar). Before boiling, the coffee and the desired\namount of sugar are stirred until all coffee sinks and the sugar is dissolved. Turkish coffee is an Intangible Cultural Heritage\nof Turkey confirmed by UNESCO. === Moka ===\nMoka coffee is coffee brewed with a moka pot, a stovetop coffee maker which produces coffee\nby passing hot water pressurized by steam through ground coffee at a lower pressure\nthan an espresso maker. The moka pot is an Italian invention, first\nproduced by Bialetti in the early 1930s. The flavor of moka pot coffee depends greatly\non bean variety, roast level, fineness of grind, and the level of heat used. Due to the higher-than-atmospheric pressure\ninvolved, the mixture of water and steam reaches temperatures well above 100 \u00b0C, causing a\nmore efficient extraction of caffeine and flavors from the grounds, and resulting in\na stronger brew than that obtained by drip brewing. == Vacuum coffee == A vacuum coffee maker brews coffee using two\nchambers where vapor pressure and vacuum produce coffee. This type of coffee maker is also known as\nvac pot, siphon or syphon coffee maker, and was invented by Loeff of Berlin in the 1830s. These devices have since been used for more\nthan a century in many parts of the world and more recently have been given a new use\nby molecular mixologists and chefs to make hot cocktails and broths. == Espresso == Espresso is brewed by using an espresso machine\nto force a small amount of nearly boiling water and steam \u2013 about 86 to 95 \u00b0C (187\nto 203 \u00b0F) \u2013 under pressure through finely ground and compacted coffee. The espresso machine was patented in 1901\nfrom an earlier 1884 machine, and developed in Italy; with the invention of the Gaggia\nmachine, espresso spread in popularity to the UK in the 1950s where it was more often\ndrunk with milk as cappuccino due to the influence of the British milk bars, then America in\nthe 1980s where again it was mainly drunk with milk, and then via coffeehouse chains\nit spread worldwide. Espresso is generally denser than coffee brewed\nby other methods, having a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids; it generally\nhas a creamy foam on top termed \"crema\". Espresso is the base for a number of other\ncoffee drinks, such as latte, cappuccino, macchiato, mocha, and Americano. Caff\u00e8 Americano Caff\u00e8 Americano or simply Americano (the\nname is also spelled with varying capitalization and use of diacritics: e.g. Caf\u00e9 Americano,\nCafe Americano, etc.) is a style of coffee prepared by adding hot water to espresso,\ngiving a similar strength to but different flavor from brewed coffee. The drink consists of a single or double-shot\nof espresso combined with between 1 and 16 fluid ounces (30\u2013470 ml) of hot water. The strength of an Americano varies with the\nnumber of shots of espresso added. In the United States, \"Americano\" is used\nbroadly to mean combining hot water and espresso in either order. Variations include long black and lungo. Cafe Lungo\nThe cafe lungo (or allong\u00e9 in French) is similar to a Caff\u00e8 Americano or a long black. However, instead of adding water to an espresso,\nall of the water is brewed. The lungo is generally smaller than an Americano\nor a long black. Caf\u00e9 Cubano\nCuban tradition is to drink coffee strong and sweet, often mixing the sugar with the\ncoffee beans before brewing. The traditional method of brewing coffee was\na filter method using a cloth cone; this has mostly been replaced with an aluminium cafetera\nor coffeemaker\u2014in tourist areas some caf\u00e9s will have an espresso machine, though espresso\nmachines are expensive, so espresso is not a common drink for most Cubans. Though quality coffee is grown in Cuba, it\nis expensive, so most Cubans drink coffee imported from Puerto Rico, and often mixed\nwith ground peas. The Cuban habit of brewing coffee with sugar\nhas spread to Miami, West Palm Beach, Tampa and the Keys, in Florida, US, where espresso\nis the preferred brewing method and an espresso brewed with sugar is termed Caf\u00e9 Cubano,\nCuban coffee, Cuban espresso, cafecito, Cuban pull, or Cuban shot. Sometimes demerara sugar is used, and sometimes\nthe sugar (white or brown) is not brewed with the coffee, but is placed in the cup as the\ncoffee is dripped into it, then stirred into a froth. Variations on the Miami caf\u00e9 Cubano are with\na splash of milk - cortadito; and with steamed milk - caf\u00e9 con leche. Caff\u00e8 crema\nCaff\u00e8 crema (Italian: cream coffee) refers to two different coffee drinks: an old name\nfor espresso (the 1940s and 1950s), and a long espresso drink primarily served in Germany,\nSwitzerland and Austria and northern Italy (the 1980s onwards), along the Italian/ Swiss\nand Italian/ Austrian border. As a term, it generally means \"espresso\",\nwhile in technical discussions, referring to the long drink, it may more narrowly be\nreferred to as Swiss caff\u00e8 crema. Variant terms include \"crema caff\u00e8\" and the\nhyperforeignism \"caf\u00e9 crema\" \u2013 \"caf\u00e9\" is French, while \"caff\u00e8\" and \"crema\" are\nItalian, thus \"caf\u00e9 crema\" mixes French and Italian. Cafe ZorroA Cafe Zorro is a double espresso\nor doppio, added to hot water with a 1:1 ratio. Doppio Doppio is a double shot, served in a demitasse\ncup. Espresso RomanoAn espresso Romano is a shot\nof espresso with a slice of lemon served on the side. The lemon can be run along the rim of the\ncup as a way to accentuate the espresso's sweetness. Despite the name, it has no link to Italy\nnor Rome. GuillermoOriginally one or two shots of hot\nespresso poured over slices of lime. It can also be served on ice, sometimes with\na touch of milk. Ristretto\nRistretto is traditionally a short shot of espresso made with the normal amount of ground\ncoffee but extracted with about half the amount of water. Since ristrettos are essentially the first\nhalf of a full-length extraction, the faster-to-extract compounds predominate in a ristretto. The opposite of a ristretto is a lungo, which\nis typically double the shot volume. Ristretto means \u201climited\u201d or \u201crestricted\u201d\nin Italian whereas lungo means \u201clong.\u201dStraight ristrettos\u2014shots that are traditionally\ndrunk from a demitasse and not diluted into a larger cup containing milk or water\u2014could\nbe described as bolder, fuller, with more body, and less bitterness, but with a higher\nconcentration of acidity. These characteristics are usually attributed\nto espresso in general but are more pronounced in a ristretto. Diluted into a cup of water (to make an Americano\nor long black) or milk (e.g. latte and cappuccino), ristrettos are less bitter and exhibit a more\nintense espresso character. == Combinations == === \nCoffee with milk === === \nCoffee with espresso === Regular coffee (slow brewed as with a filter\nor cafeti\u00e8re) is sometimes combined with espresso to increase either the intensity\nof the flavour or the caffeine content. This may be called a variety of names, most\ncommonly \"red eye,\" \"shot in the dark,\" and \"depth charge\" \u2013 though this last is a federally\nregistered trademark of a company, Caribou Coffee, so its usage is restricted. Coffeehouse chains may have their own names,\nsuch as \"turbo\" at Dunkin' Donuts. A double shot of espresso in the coffee may\nbe termed a \"black eye,\" and a triple shot a \"dead eye.\" \"Caff\u00e8 Tobio\" is a version with an equal\namount of coffee to espresso. === Coffee with tea ===\nBlack tie is a drink made by mixing traditional Thai iced tea, which is a spicy and sweet\nmixture of chilled black tea, orange blossom water, star anise, crushed tamarind, sugar\nand condensed milk or cream, with a double shot of espresso. Numerous houses use the term chai latte to\nindicate that the steamed milk of a normal caff\u00e8 latte is being flavoured with a spiced\ntea concentrate instead of with espresso. Add espresso shots for a dirty chai latte. Chai tea with a single shot of espresso. In addition, 1-2 tablespoons of instant espresso\nmay be brewed while simultaneously steeping chai in the same container; a small amount\nof a dairy or non-dairy drink of choice is usually added to complete the drink. Red tie is a drink made by mixing traditional\nThai iced tea, which is a spicy and sweet mixture of chilled black tea, orange blossom\nwater, star anise, crushed tamarind, sugar and condensed milk or cream, with a single\nshot of espresso. Yuenyeung (drink) is a popular drink in Hong\nKong, made of a mixture of coffee and Hong Kong-style milk tea. It was originally served at dai pai dangs\n(open space food vendors) and cha chaan tengs (cafe), but is now available in various types\nof restaurants. It can be served hot or cold. The name yuanyang, which refers to mandarin\nducks, is a symbol of conjugal love in Chinese culture, as the birds usually appear in pairs\nand the male and female look very different. This same connotation of \"pair\" of two unlike\nitems is used to name this drink. === Coffee with alcohol === A liqueur coffee, as its name suggests, is\na coffee brew with a 25 ml shot of liqueur. This brew is usually served in a clear liqueur\ncoffee glass with the coffee and cream separated for visual and taste effect. The liqueur of choice is added first with\na teaspoon of sugar mixed in. The glass is then filled to within an inch\nof the top with filtered coffee. Slightly whipped cream may then be poured\nover the back of a spoon, so that it floats on top of the coffee and liqueur mixture. The sugar is required in the coffee mixture\nto help the cream float. Irish Coffee (Irish Whiskey)\nCaff\u00e8 corretto (that is an Italian drink, consists of a shot of espresso \"corrected\"\nwith a shot of liquor, usually grappa, brandy or sambuca.) Coffee liqueurs (many brands)\nKarsk, kaffeg\u00f6k or svartkopp (coffee with moonshine)\nR\u00fcdesheimer Kaffee is an alcoholic coffee drink from R\u00fcdesheim in Germany invented\nin 1957 by Hans Karl Adam. It is made with Asbach Uralt brandy with coffee\nand sugar, and is topped with whipped cream. A Pharis\u00e4er (Danish: faris\u00e6er), meaning\na Pharisee, is an alcoholic coffee drink that is popular in the Nordfriesland district of\nGermany. It consists of a mug of black coffee, a double\nshot of rum, and a topping of whipped cream. In 1981, a court in Flensburg ruled that 2\ncentilitres (0.70 imp fl oz; 0.68 US fl oz) of rum were not sufficient for preparing a\ngenuine Pharis\u00e4er. Barraquito is an old drink from Tenerife combining\nespresso, condensed sweetened milk, foamed milk, lemon, cinnamon and Licor 43, which\nwas carried across the Atlantic in a later modified form as the Carajillo. A Carajillo is a Spanish drink combining coffee\nwith brandy, whisky, anisette, or rum. It is typical of Spain and according to folk\netymology, its origin dates to the Spanish occupation of Cuba. The troops combined coffee with rum to give\nthem courage (coraje in Spanish, hence \"corajillo\" and more recently \"carajillo\"). There are many different ways of making a\ncarajillo, ranging from black coffee with the spirit simply poured in to heating the\nspirit with lemon, sugar and cinnamon and adding the coffee last. A similar Italian drink is known as caff\u00e8\ncorretto. The American version of a Spanish Coffee uses\na heated sugar-rimmed Spanish coffee mug with 3/4 ounce of rum and 1/2 ounce of triple sec. The drink is then flamed to caramelize the\nsugar, with 2 ounces of coffee liqueur then added to put out the flame, and then topped\noff with 3 to 4 ounces of coffee, and whipped cream.The caffeine content of these coffee\ndrinks, to the extent that caffeine is present in them, will not prevent intoxication from\ntheir alcohol content. Instead, the caffeine may mask the true degree\nof ethanol-induced loss of coordination. == Flavoured ==\nMelyaMelya is coffee flavoured with cocoa powder and honey. Cream is sometimes added. Caff\u00e8 MarocchinoThe Marocchino is made from\nespresso, steamed milk, and a dusting of cocoa powder, similar to the espressino. Caf\u00e9 mielA caf\u00e9 miel has a shot of espresso,\nsteamed milk, cinnamon, and honey. The name comes from the French word for honey,\nmiel. Mocha or caf\u00e9 mocha or mochaccino\nA caf\u00e9 mocha is a variant of a caff\u00e8 latte. Like a latte, it is typically one third espresso\nand two thirds steamed milk, but a portion of chocolate is added, typically in the form\nof a chocolate syrup, although other vending systems use instant chocolate powder. Mochas can contain dark or milk chocolate. The term moccaccino is used in some regions\nof Europe and the Middle East to describe caff\u00e8 latte with cocoa or chocolate. In the U.S. it usually refers to a cappuccino\nmade with chocolate. A \"cafe borgia\" is a mocha with orange rind\nand sometimes orange flavoring added. Often served with whipped cream and topped\nwith cinnamon. Caf\u00e9 de ollaCaf\u00e9 de olla or pot coffee is\na traditional coffee-based drink prepared using earthen clay pots or jars in Mexico\nand other Latin American countries. It is flavored with cinnamon and piloncillo. Consumed primarily in colder weathers, usually\nwith the merienda meal, and accompanied with pan dulce pastries. Caf\u00e9 R\u00e1pido y SucioA Caf\u00e9 R\u00e1pido y Sucio\nor a Quick & Dirty Coffee, is simply three shots of espresso topped with chocolate or\nmocha syrup. Unlike a caf\u00e9 mocha which has milk added\nor an Americano which has water added, a Caf\u00e9 R\u00e1pido y Sucio or a Quick & Dirty Coffee\nis espresso and chocolate only. Any variation of this drink containing more\nthan three shots of espresso would be referred to as a Fast & Filthy Coffee. MiscellaneousSome coffeehouses provide flavoured\nsyrups which customers can have added to their coffee drinks. Some non-dairy creamers have flavoured versions,\nsuch as hazelnut flavour and Irish Cream flavour (the latter is non-alcoholic). == \nIced == === Frapp\u00e9 === Greek frapp\u00e9 (Caf\u00e9 frapp\u00e9) (Greek: \u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03ad\u03c2)\nis a foam-covered iced coffee drink made from spray-dried instant coffee. It is very popular in Greece especially during\nsummer, but has now spread on to other countries. There are numerous ways in which this coffee\ncan be tailored to the individual's taste such as: all water-no milk; half-half; all\nmilk and; varying levels of sweetness. Frappe is also extremely popular in the country\nof Cyprus where fresh milk is used as opposed to condensed. In French, when describing a drink, the word\nfrapp\u00e9 means shaken or chilled; however, in popular Greek culture, the word frapp\u00e9\nis predominantly taken to refer to the shaking associated with the preparation of a caf\u00e9\nfrapp\u00e9. === Greek Freddo preparations === ==== \nFreddo Espresso ==== Freddo Espresso is a foam-covered iced coffee\nmade from espresso. It is found in every caf\u00e9 and coffee shop\nin Greece. It is undoubtedly popular among the young\npeople during summer, or on hot days. Because of the very hot summers in Greece,\nand the need to escape from the heat, people began to make cold variations of the popular\ncoffee styles. It consists of two shots of espresso (30-50\nml), sugar, and ice (60-100 ml) 1:2 ( espresso shots:ice). The espresso is mixed with the sugar in a\nfrapi\u00e8ra (a drink mixer). The frapiera mixes the coffee with the sugar,\nproducing a foam from the oils of espresso, and lowers the temperature. The coffee is then poured over ice into its\nserving glass. The melting of the ice cubes dilutes the coffee\nand results in a desirable level of bitterness and strength. ==== Freddo Cappuccino ====\nFreddo Cappuccino is another variation of the original cappuccino. It is as popular as the freddo espresso. It follows the same process as the freddo\nespresso, but at the end foamed and creamed milk is added in ratio 1:2 (espresso shots:milk),\nand 1:2 ( espresso shots:ice). Recently the Coffee Island coffee shop (a\ncoffee shop franchise in Greece), established a new foam and cream trend in freddo cappuccino. They use plant based milk creamed in the frapi\u00e8ra. The result is a stiffer and sweeter cream. === Other ===\nMazagranMazagran (sometimes misspelled as Mazagrin) is a cold coffee drink that originated\nin Algeria. It is typically served in a tall glass, and\nis made with coffee and ice. Sometimes sugar, rum, lemon or water is added. Sometimes a fast version is achieved by pouring\na previously sweetened espresso in a cup with ice cubes and a slice of lemon. PalazzoA Palazzo is an iced coffee variant,\npopular in Southern California. It is two shots of espresso, chilled immediately\nafter brewing and mixed with sweetened cream. A Palazzo is typically made using a moka pot. Ice ShotOriginating in Australia and similar\nto the Mazagran, the minimal Ice Shot is a single shot of fresh espresso poured into\nan ordinary latt\u00e9 glass that has been filled with ice. The hot coffee, in melting some of the ice\nis diluted, re-freezing to a granita-like texture. The addition of a single scoop of ice-cream\non top is a popular variant. No milk, sugar, extra flavouring or cream\nare involved. ShakeratoShakerato is an iced coffee made\nby shaking espresso and ice cubes. == Instant coffee == Instant coffee is a drink derived from brewed\ncoffee beans. Through various manufacturing processes the\ncoffee is dehydrated into the form of powder or granules. These can be rehydrated with hot water to\nprovide a drink similar (though not identical) to conventional coffee. At least one brand of instant coffee, \"Camp\nCoffee,\" is also available in concentrated liquid form. Instant coffee brands include: UCC\nChock full o'Nuts Folgers\nKenco Maxwell House\nMoccona Mr. Brown Coffee\nNescaf\u00e9 Sanka == \nDecaffeination of coffee == A decaffeination process removes caffeine\nfrom coffee beans to lower their caffeine content. Four main methods are used to extract caffeine\nfrom coffee beans: The so-called \"Swiss\" water method, so called\nfrom allegedly having been developed in Switzerland, where the beans are soaked in water;\nthe ethyl acetate method, where the beans are washed in a solution of water and ethyl\nacetate; the carbon dioxide method, where either liquid\nor \"supercritical\" (between liquid and gas) carbon dioxide is applied to the beans at\nhigh pressure; or the dichloromethane method, where dichloromethane,\na solvent, is used to dissolve the caffeine.Decaffeinated coffee grew in popularity over the last half\nof the 20th century, mainly due to health concerns that arose regarding the over-consumption\nof caffeine. Decaffeinated coffee, sometimes known as \"decaf,\"\nmay be drunk as regular brewed coffee, instant, espresso, or as a mix of regular caffeine\nbeans and decaffeinated beans. == Other ==\nAffogato An affogato (Italian for \"drowned\") is a coffee-based\ndrink or dessert. \"Affogato style\", which refers to the act\nof topping a drink or dessert with espresso, may also incorporate caramel sauce or chocolate\nsauce. When ordered, an Affogato tends to be served\nwith scoops of ice cream with a shot (or 2) of espresso poured over the top, sometimes\nmixed with a liqueur. A white Affogato is the same as a regular\nAffogato, just with milk added. BotzA common and simple way of drinking coffee\nin Israel is known as \"Botz\" (translated as \"Mud\"). Finely ground Turkish style coffee is put\ninto a cup and boiling water poured onto it. After letting stand for a few minutes to cool\nand settle, the supernatant coffee is drunk, leaving the grounds behind in the cup. Caff\u00e8 MediciA Caff\u00e8 Medici is a doppio poured\nover chocolate syrup and orange peel, usually topped with whipped cream. The drink originated at Seattle's historic\nLast Exit on Brooklyn coffeehouse. Caf\u00e9 ToubaCaf\u00e9 Touba is the spiritual drink\nof Senegal, named after Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mback\u00e9 (known as Serigne Touba) and the holy\ncity of Touba in Senegal. During the roasting process, the coffee beans\nare mixed with grains of selim, and sometimes other spices, and ground into powder after\nroasting. The drink is prepared using a filter, similar\nto plain coffee. Sugar is often added before drinking. Canned coffeeCanned coffee is ubiquitous in\nJapan, with a large number of companies competing fiercely and offering various types for sale. Canned coffee is already brewed and ready\nto drink. It is available in supermarkets and convenience\nstores, with vast numbers of cans being sold in vending machines that offer heated cans\nin the autumn and winter, and cold cans in the warm months. Brands of canned coffee include these: UCC\nFolgers Mr. Brown CoffeeCoffee milk Coffee milk is sold in two ways: prepared\ncoffee milk and coffee syrup. It is a drink prepared or made by adding a\nsweetened coffee concentrate called coffee syrup to milk in a manner similar to chocolate\nmilk. It is the official state drink of Rhode Island\nin the United States. Coffee milk brands include: Farmers Union Iced Coffee\nAutocrat, LLCDouble DoubleThe \"double-double\" is a uniquely Canadian term that is strongly\nassociated with Tim Hortons. It consists of a cup of drip coffee with two\ncreams and two sugars (or double cream, double sugar). The Double-Double coffee will taste exactly\nthe same in any cup size, from the small 10oz cup to the extra large 24oz cup. The chain achieves flavor consistency across\ncup sizes by employing a pair of countertop vending machines, one dispensing cream and\nthe other dispensing sugar, with a button for each of the four cup sizes. The name \"double-double\" refers to the number\nof shots of each added, that is, two shots of cream and two shots of sugar. The terms \"single-single\" and \"triple-triple\",\nthough not as common as the \"double-double\", refer to coffee with one shot of sugar and\ncream and coffee with three shots of sugar and cream, respectively. The machines are calibrated regularly to ensure\nthey dispense a perfect shot of cream or sugar to exacting specifications. The coffee is always poured over the cream\nand sugar, important to achieve the correct flavor. It is brewed using the pour-over brewing method\nand the coffee maker used is manufactured by Bunn-o-Matic Corporation. Indian filter coffeeSouth Indian Coffee, also\nknown as Mysore Filter Coffee or Kaapi (South Indian phonetic rendering of \"coffee') is\na sweet milky coffee made from dark roasted coffee beans (70%\u201380%) and chicory (20%\u201330%),\nespecially popular in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil\nNadu. The most commonly used coffee beans are Koffeey\nArabica (Coffee Arabica grown from Arehalli Village) Peaberry (preferred), Arabica, Malabar\nand Robusta grown in the hills of Karnataka (Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru), Kerala (Malabar\nregion) and Tamil Nadu (Nilgiris District, Yercaud and Kodaikanal). PocilloA shot or small portion of unsweetened\ncoffee, now usually made either using an espresso machine or a moka pot, but traditionally made\nusing a cloth drip, usually served in cups made for the purpose, called \"tazitas de pocillo.\" It is widely drunk in Latin America, usually\nas an afternoon or after-dinner coffee. The defining feature is the size, usually\nhalf to a quarter the size of the usual ~8 US fluid ounces (240 ml) coffee cups. There are a number of small-sized drinks that\nuse tazitas de pocillo, including such sweetened varieties as caf\u00e9 cubano and caf\u00e9 cortado,\nbut these are usually not called a pocillo; rather, the Spanish diminutive suffix \"-ito\"\nis usually added to the name of the drink wanted in a pocillo size cup. For example, a pocillo-sized cortado is usually\ncalled a cortadito. == See also == List of coffee dishes\nCoffee substitute Coffee preparation and Presentation\nNon-dairy creamer", "wno_qUB02lM":

"exHgeD_oKdU": "um we'll kick off um i know i think i know all of you guys but i'm sarah glass with interface and my teammate christina wurtz is here with me as well i'll uh pass it off to mary beth and ashley hi everybody i'm mary beth with fuzzy space and hi hi guys you might not know me um it's really good to see you guys and ashley's gonna um start us off with um the setup and sort of the instructions of getting started so yes hi guys ashley i think i know everyone as well we just want to thank you for joining us for our second craft night um i know most of you guys did participate in the the tie-dye which was super fun so we're trying to like level up every time and it's it's hard to keep coming up with a better craft but um we felt like this one was really fun considering it's tuesday tea um and so we found these really cute mugs that you can create with alcohol inks so uh what is alcohol ink so alcohol ink is fast drying high pigmented ink that can be manipulated and kind of moved around with alcohol or rubbing alcohol typically you'll see a lot of people do this on yupo paper which is just kind of it's like this super shiny non-porous paper that the the ink can kind of move around organically on or ceramic tiles glassware there's just anything that's non-porous is a really good surface for alcohol ink um once the ink is dropped onto it it's really easy to manipulate it we sent you a couple of tools one of the easiest things you've got some really cool interface logo straws which is a really fun way to kind of manipulate and move the the ink um it's we'll go through a lot of the stuff and we're going to show you a cool video but um it's fast drying so it will kind of dry up pretty quickly um so you want to move sort of fast but the cool thing about alcohol ink is that all you have to do is add a little bit more rubbing alcohol hand sanitizer vodka whatever you're using um as kind of your base it will re-engage it and then you'll be able to maneuver it around a little bit more um you should have all gotten a teacup a saucer and a spoon to play with um and like mary beth said you're gonna have a lot of extra ink so um you know this hopefully this just kind of gives you guys some inspiration to do some more fun stuff in the future um we are going to start off by showing you this cool little it's just a minute and a half video of kind of how you work with alcohol inks um this is a designer that is on youtube and she's using the yupo paper for this but we will be using this on our um teacups i'm going to play that hello hello oh i need to grab my stuff sorry but that's okay but if you can hear me mirko says hi so you can really see how fluid it is um that was just a fun little video that kind of give you a little bit of an idea kind of how easily you can kind of manipulate and move the alcohol ink yes no we can we can go back to it as well so what you guys got in all of your packages um is all of the supplies that you're going to need to be able to do this so you've all gotten your teacups i hope everyone was able to find rubbing alcohol or some type of alcohol i know sarah is using hand sanitizer because she couldn't find any and i think somebody may be using alcohol or some some vodka but really anything with a high percent oh meredith has little whites um but anything with that percentage of alcohol is going to help manipulate um alcohol and if you don't have that it's just a very high pigmented color but this is going to help and then you should have all gotten paint brushes so we will need a couple of paint brushes one of them will be used for your actual um rubbing alcohol isotope or whatever alcohol you have you will be using one of them for that and then the other one you can use for the mod podge at the end um you all got some acetone so we have these fun little just acetone wipes acetone is really great for helping you remove it in areas if you mess up or you don't like what you did or you want to kind of move it from an area you can use the acetone to remove it so don't worry this isn't permanent until you kind of set it um you can always redo and rework it and then you finally you got your alcohol inks um there's just a couple of them if you haven't opened them i know mary beth had opened hers and she used the scissors to cut off the top now make sure you cut very close use it if you have one unless you want ink all over your scissors cleans up okay though yes if you have something sharp maybe poke the the hole at the top with some with that um pin or whatever to kind of open that um does anybody have any questions from this point i'm just going to give you a full beginning so i'm going to watch you guys okay okay does that have to have little like bowls to put like alcohol in you don't have to so when i do i'm gonna do a little demonstration for you where i'm literally just gonna use it from the bottle and just kind of put drops on it and then because i'll already have the alcohol rubbing alcohol on the thing it'll start to kind of blend and move and kind of fall where it wants to go here um are just some inspirational images of a couple of mugs that have been done there you can see one with the with the saucer which is really cute green and the instructions so this seems like a lot but it's really a very simple craft um it's not going to take you long um but what i want to do is just kind of do a quick demonstration i've done a couple of these and what i'm going to do is start with my actual alcohol rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer or whatever alcohol you have i am going to put mine into a little bowl can we use biscuit can i use whiskey actually so that it doesn't um let us know how it works but i am putting mine into a bowl because i um tend to dip my paintbrush back into it and i don't want that color to get into my full bottle of the very um sought after alcohol i guess it's hard to find these days i don't want to waste it but what i'm going to start is i'm going to just start on a portion of the cup because it dries really fast so i'm just going to use my paintbrush and i would recommend doing it from the bottom you don't really want the rubbing alcohol or anything at the mouth where you're going to be putting your lips um just i wouldn't recommend it unless you want it unless you want to taste that vodka that you're using um so put the rubbing alcohol directly onto the cup i'm gonna use blue just because it's really vibrant and hopefully you guys can see it better but i'm just going to put a couple of little drops at it and you can see how it starts to kind of move you can just move it with your hands you could start blowing using your straw a little bit more you see how it just kind of oh first then before putting the paint right what was that you put the alcohol first before get it gets dry then you add the paint right that is correct yep because the alcohol is what's gonna actually give it that um ability to move around um and it does dry fast so mine's already dry right now and if i wanted to add more i could add it on to here continue moving around but you could so it's really kind of intense in a couple of colors just add a little bit more alcohol or rubbing alcohol to it and it'll thin it out and it'll start to kind of manipulate and go into more directions so it's you really have to give up control the alcohol ink is going to kind of do what it wants um you can like i said use your straw to kind of blow it in different directions to kind of get it to what you want to do um but if you don't love what you do don't forget you can use the acetone wipes or if you have a whole bottle acetone you can use that and wipe it off and start over it's not you know it's really easy to kind of just play around the once you're done and you're like i love my design that's when you actually want to put it in the oven and let it set so you want it to be completely dry i put it in the oven for 30 minutes at 300 degrees almost like a kiln just kind of let it set um when you're done you can add mod mod podge to it to kind of help it set as well but it would be good to go um i definitely would not dishwash these and i wouldn't um scrub really hard on them so they're going to be you just want to be very careful but yeah any other questions would white wine work it might could you layer different colors you can blend the colors definitely um if you wanted to to blend the two colors to make a different color i would recommend doing that in maybe a different bowl or a dish and then using your paint brush maybe to add that color or you could take like i have pink here i'll just add it to i'm gonna try some bacardi i'll let you know if you don't have dropping alcohol what else can i use do you have liquid a sanitizer that'll work so that's what i'm doing right now okay what is the container you know the uh the white things inside you guys send it to that's modge podge so the little um the little cup that you guys have is with the little black cap so that's what you'll want at the very end oh i see that'll help set it into its place do you guys want to re-watch that video and kind of see how you can manipulate it or do you just want to kind of just get to it and see how it how it flows let me see the video one more time so again this is um an artist on in she's on youtube and she's using the yupo paper which is um a glossy type paper it's non-porous but it's the same concept she's using her little blending solution in her bottle is rubbing alcohol as well which is what help is helping her kind of dilute it and move it around a lot so i'll play this again my wow it's pretty cool pretty cool huh how's it going actually let's see your example okay well i actually so i cleaned off the first part that i did just because i didn't want the pink it didn't turn out the way i wanted so i'm starting over i just used the acetone to clean it off and then i'm just redoing the whole process where i'm going to add more i'm going to do the same thing because it turned out to something i didn't want i'm gonna clean it it's like a whiteboard you know yeah and the more alcohol you put on it the more transparent it is so if you guys want more of a you know loosen color it's just like watercolor of course it dilutes it and i have orange and mine turned out like coral which i didn't intend but i might just leave it because it's kind of cool i think mine's dry i i've got like a teal the plates like really fun so that looks great i love it i love how it's asymmetrical that's really fun yeah and you can you really can layer color colors i think that's like the cool thing about it i use blue and red it doesn't really show in the camera but it looks i already wiped quite a bit with the acetone i have blue all over my desk so alcohol should clean it right hopefully your colors are really saturated too tackley yeah i'm adding um the red is more brown i guess i thought it would turn out more pink once i found it yeah definitely try adding more alcohol so i had orange and i i did a bowl as practice but it's really cool because it turned out to be pink just because i actually ended up spraying it with alcohol so it really um made that orange more translucent and it gave it a really different it's definitely different than what i intended but that's okay because i like it um but yeah the ink if you don't put alcohol it's going to be really saturated which can be really nice too but while you guys are working um should we should we show some inspiration photos yeah yeah yes actually i'm sorry actually i'll wait for you to finish that again oh no no no here's like where i am guys oh that's gorgeous that looks so good very subtle it's really pretty i started over so you guys can too if you don't like it exactly it didn't turn out as pretty as yours i didn't i do very very small chunks at a time because um so then i can kind of blow it and not let it go too far um so try doing like smaller sections yeah i'm doing mine and mine is really chunky and i'm doing really small sections how much alcohol do you put on it um a very little drop i like almost don't even let a full drop do it like when i was doing this really kind of subtle area i did very very little um droplets do you brush it afterwards like i didn't once i put it on and i let it drip i quickly stopped it from dripping and then blowed it just with just using my breath i kind of stopped it from moving and dried it really quickly i'm getting some cool patterns what the heck i'm doing it look like a third grader's artwork okay maybe i'll just make this layer we'll see yeah you can use your acetone wipe and you can even if like you just want to just remove a little part of it you can just you know manipulate or remove it just from that area i'm going to remove it from around the top here it's funny but the rum adds brown tones to my i'm totally experimenting whatever is happening and i'm not even trying to do a method of anything and that is what it's all about so it's okay there's no commitment to these um while you guys are working i'm just going to flip through some inspiration images and kind of highlight some different artists maybe to help you guys get inspired and just different techniques i'm sure you're all learning these as you go um so i thought this quote was very appropriate for the method that we're using so this is a quote by picasso and it's i begin an idea and then it becomes something else so i think that this kind of captures alcohol ink because as ashley was saying you kind of have to like relinquish control and i think a lot of us might not be used to doing that with design or with our art so sometimes we kind of have to just let things have their own mind and their own energy and that is okay try to let your creation evolve and go with the flow all right so and hopefully you guys are that's really what this is all about so these are just some images i thought were really pretty these are some saucer inspirations and it just kind of shows how different you know you can create these to be so different textures different fluidity different colors kind of evoke different um styles so i really love the one in the middle just because it's like really subtle and sort of i guess unexpected with ink that's i love the colors in that one yeah so this one and that it's funny because that's probably just black and maybe some red that's really diluted down um so just really different and then um i just wanted to also share like interesting artists highlight some different art um that they do so ashley was talking about yupo paper so although we're doing these on mugs and you can do them on ceramics um there's of course a lot of alcohol art just on equal paper so this artist in particular i just really like her sort of fluid style and that um really like thin sort of appearance of the ink so this is joanna koskinen i think her name is it's just really it's more neutral really her palette but then you know she has a really broad color spectrum so these are some of her um artwork you know just in more vibrant reds and magentas and definitely gives it a different feel and then really pretty blues and again you can just see like all the depth when you start layering the ink and when it just kind of settles it's it's so pretty it's so fluid this one definitely reminds me of water okay and then this is a different artist and you can immediately tell she kind of has like a different way of how she moves the ink around and then blends it so it's definitely more like a tighter kind of wrinkle or like texture feel and then like more jewel tones so just really pretty and of course like the blending of the color so this is a more simple palette but again she someone was asking about sort of combining those inks together definitely you know you can it's just like any other paints almost where you can create your own colors by mixing them but i love this palette green yeah just green and gold and really warm and then this one i thought was really interesting just because it's very different but again it's just alcohol ink and um this artist um alexis oh my gosh what's her last name bonavita cola it was more like landscape sort of um styles with it so she like blends it more um i just think it's so beautiful so again very different style and again a very different vibe for these um this artist definitely does more intricate and sort of like you know botanic almost like plant sort of creations with the alcohol link so i just thought this was really interesting of course this would be very difficult i would imagine to capture on like a teacup but you book paper is a different story i've got to test it out and i can't wait i need to buy some so and i love this one too this is very different just because it's a much more subtle palette and the techniques are so different here of course like i think the artist probably used some sort of ring or something in that top left one um to kind of manipulate the ink so just you know different and then almost like a floral pattern in the right hand corner and this was really fun so um you know you can apply of course like alcohol ink prints to different items so i thought it was kind of fun just to take a look at different artists and how they of course have their originals and then you can apply it to different products like so this is from society6 that of course takes artists work and then you know printed on different products so this is cheating of course right aspiration goals yes yes but i just had to share and stay here so this artist this is her original artwork of course on yupo paper and then printed on mugs but just kind of fun to see the difference so hopefully even after this um craft you guys can you know scour your house and play around more and find glassware whatever you have um just to test out the ink another way is so get creative also very calming i don't know if you're having a stressful day i feel like this like makes you slow down and just kind of like let go a little bit yeah it's very zen yeah i think i just found my new hobby just for that everybody at christmas is going to get a alcohol ink card from cali absolutely cards i already found another thing on my desk i just happened to have this is like a a smelly thing like a smelly stick oh yeah diffuser oh that's pretty oh this is my cup i think i overdid it guys i don't know what to do one side is like that and then the other side is oh i like that side yeah i like this side the best too but do i take off all the the two tone on this height or no i like how it moves yeah i think that if you if it's too much on that one side start by adding some more alcohol rubbing alcohol to it with no color and trying to thin it out if you want to or you could completely scratch it by wiping it off with acetone but if you want to try and dilute it first yeah you could just add more rubbing alcohol which i don't have but i'm using sanitizer oh yeah perfect perfect that's all i need some purple alcohol [Laughter] we have some um we can take a side break ashley i know you're i feel so bad asking you i don't know but we do have some tea inspired cocktails you guys all receive some tea bags in your little kit so we thought it'd be fun to give you guys some fun um recipes to make some cocktails with your teeth and i'm gonna go ahead and demo this birds and the bees martini it's pretty easy so i actually used um herbal tea that i think some of you guys had in your bag so i made the simple syrup last night and i actually used it with agave instead of honey so you guys could do that too so i've got my little thing a simple syrup right here and i've got i'm gonna start off with some ice mommy you said no green i changed my mind this recipe calls for gin but if you guys aren't gin drinkers this would also be really good with vodka i'm a gin drinker so i'm going to go ahead and get that 47 monkeys out and two ounces of gin and then we're gonna do um an ounce of lemon so fresh squeezed lemon juice and then your tea infused simple syrup this is that classic making lemonade out of lemon and then i like to ice my glass before i like a nice frosted martini glass where do you live just in case i never had room in the freezer for that too many too many kids also send it your way but it's it's very good very easy to do um so you can experiment i know you guys have a lot of tea flavors in there too so um this one's actually pretty good i'm sure chamomile is good so whatever flavor you guys gravitate towards um and i know an ice cold drink right now it's so hot outside [Laughter] sounds really good and then we've got a couple more we can send these to you guys um the next one i think is a yeah hot chai toddy so i'm a big fan of um chai and i love a good hot toddy so if you guys end up going somewhere cold or maybe for christmas this would be a really good drink and pretty easy um just hot hot chai tea honey fresh lemon um and some bourbon or this could also be really good with rum um and then the last one is backboard back porch tea so this is so perfect right now it's so hot outside um so definitely um get your gin out or your vodka out and you could do the fruit infused iced tea um so they've got a couple options for you but you guys could use some of the um i think there's a fruit iced tea you guys have in your kitty kitties for that um a sliced white peach and top it off with some seltzer water um i'm a huge fan of topo chico right now so um you could get something like that or something similar but i love it just some fun ideas to use your teeth thank you sarah i made the back porch primary field super delish that's awesome oh that's so that's really beautiful color too i'm gonna go in and try the black i'm gonna leave the mug i don't know i like i love my cute i like this side i love it i don't love this so just remove that part try it and you guys feel free to share your progress because it's always fun if you like if you want don't be shy i know i really like what i did on one part of it but i am trying to replicate it around the other side not doing so well yeah the yellow is like a really dark like ochre it's like really pretty it's really pretty yeah and you're just using two and they blended together yeah those colors oh that's pretty calorie i like that blue that you're using it's just the green and yellow and i think that when they mix it becomes that actually it's turquoise you're right you're right it looks green in the bottle but it says turquoise i just started using round one this morning i liked how that one had turned out oh yeah definitely a coffee cup yeah yeah it looks really good so sarah are you using for you guys that have the spray are you spraying it because that's another really cool different technique if you spray i am spraying but it looks like the color is changing i haven't done that yet i've only done maybe i'll do it for this one i've been like adding it and then putting the ink on the bottom so like this is like my first like my little plate and then i did like a i'm not sure if i'm done with this yet i just kind of did like an asymmetrical drip cup but i might layer i might add a couple layers onto this but i should try the spray i like that idea i can't believe it different texture so it's kind of like a sand nice different tool it changes about every two seconds yeah but that's like you can't go anywhere you can't go wrong this is actually really fun i have my fan blowing and it helps me to move the paint oh yeah there you go that's really yeah that's cool yeah don't forget about your straws i didn't make a mess i know i was like running out of breath like and it's reusable and sustainable that's what that little humor is to go down the middle huh yes hold on wow [Music] no i had a white shirt on and i quickly realized that was a bad idea let me do the tie tie again you guys got me addicted just so you know it i've been buying on amazon this house i think i have like 50 of them and 50 masks and everything i have never done this i have too much fun i love it it's cool it really wasn't dick yeah i'm finding that if you just put the alcohol in like a little tiny thing the ink won't go anywhere the alcohol isn't so you can paint little oh shapes the alcohol first show yeah okay let's see okay let's try okay so i have a like why can't i see my own camera okay i have like this kind of blank area here and if i just paint not to get too much like right in that let's just do like a little dot and then i'm putting the ink onto like the table first instead of pouring with the little bottle because i feel like it's hard to get it but then oh i think i waited too long i like that hard to show you sorry but see it kind of stays i don't want to tilt it too much it stays in that spot because there's alcohol if i tip it a lot it will go i know i could probably like have an overhead camera right if we were doing this like legit i know yeah like the tick tock the tick tock creative like all the people painting on tick tock i'm like obsessed i just watch it for hours relaxing to watch yeah that's your project tick tock did she go away yeah what's up let's do that i need to get a red camera too that looks awesome am i the only person who's never used tick tock like i've seen i don't even know no i am like afraid of yet another thing to suck my time i just decided i'm too old well and yeah i can't dance so what am i gonna give to anybody you can learn a lot of fun tricks like they end up seeing it on facebook or instagram instagram just copied tick tock with reals so is this um toxic is it toxic a flammable liquid please keep away it says flammable yeah it does have the prop 65 um i need to wash my hands [Music] everyone is so quiet and that's good we're like universal mode i know this is such a good zen mode it's kind of like watercolors to some extent yeah yeah [Music] anybody got anything to share not yet here's what i'm starting to do oh that's nice too look at you i'm gonna i'm gonna build off of this did anyone else have the color red by any chance is it red red i tried it it looked a little scary so i'm gonna go it's kind of [Music] luckily i could just wipe it off so that was good i was hoping the blue i have cerulean that's inside it was something that cerulean in the bed would make purple but they don't uh more fun than i thought i forgot that we got the plate to do too this is kind of cool the problem with this is that i think we're all perfectionists and so we're like oh i can make it better oh i can make it this is never gonna stop great i just keep blending it that's okay i like like the bottom of it the most how do i get that onto the sides that's cool i bet i could do that on the plate though maybe do that okay this is the next progression of the plate oh hmm [Music] only that was black but i'm kind of painting on it to like make it like gray textural that's really cool that's really cool so you're you're literally like using your paintbrush and creating pattern yeah i'm using paintbrush and kind of feathering it and giving it some texture but it's also helping like make it gray instead of it was a pretty dark black that like dripped down and i was like oh yeah i don't know where can you feel that and i didn't see it it's cool oh it looks very dimensional awesome yeah it's turning out pretty cool cause i was like i didn't want like big black drips hey guys i made a set wow [Music] i really like the orange and blue yeah that's a nice summer color i mean i don't know if you keep going because it's like you less is more right yeah i know maybe less is maybe i think it is something you can overdo which i'm doing right now i'm absolutely overdoing it i'm not done nina come and see what mommy's doing oh wow you get like a ripple effect [Music] and a reminder when you are ready you want to put it in the oven to let it kind of cure you don't have to you don't have to do it right away but just before you start actually using it you want to do it um in the oven at 300 degrees for 30 minutes then it's probably best to hand wash it still right yeah definitely no scrubbing maybe maybe be very careful just debating on adding a different color to my saucer or if it should match i feel like that's the hardest i mean the great thing is that you can take it off but that's like true i like it the way it is now but what what is this [Music] just add this definitely looking like a galaxy or something i love the inspirational images i don't know how they did that but together professionals on a three-dimensional thing too versus paper but follow or um look at the hashtag like alcohol inks or something on instagram and you'll see a ton of just crazy awesome stuff so girls we have to put them in the avenue set for 30 minutes and 300 degrees and then put mod podge when they're cooled off yes okay ready [Music] it is adorable not the same if we don't get a kid [Music] some type of interruption from [Music] i think next time we do this with a sound bath zen out we probably should um consider doing like playlists or something for these in the future i don't know i think my mug's done but i could go on forever just layer for a long time eventually oh beautiful oh nice that's pretty that's so pretty that's right ryan did this part he did the saucer oh how pretty you are an artist ryan you can make another side business and get it additional to your income baja that looks awesome christina thank you let me see christina okay so here's the mug very saturated blue and purple yeah and then and then here i went really subtle with my my plate and do very i'm definitely gonna have dyed hands for a few days i like how this turned out i'm just gonna keep it and this one i actually use the straw this one like it was kind of cool i could see how that would be fun how those colors fade i feel like mine is a pattern from the 80s anybody have any um pandemic tips out there that's keeping them sane any secret spots or hiking spots or food things or what's kind of happening out there or not happening it's just not happening christina i would say invest i was the only one hiking i just recently invested a little more into my like work from home situation like my desk and it makes such a difference i gotta sit to stand desk [Music] and i feel like so much i don't know so much more productive all of a sudden because i'm like i have the tools now i can that is so important it's so hard right now it's best because we had our computer so much longer than before i feel like this is like everything is done on a computer yeah i just saw a really good article i think it was actually oh i forget which newspaper it was in but it was talking about kids and how important their setup is to since they're gonna be working from home and like just the little things like their feet being able to touch the ground and their computer being up high enough so they're not like bending over like we are and just like those like a light to the side of them and like not for the vanity reasons but for the reason that like the teacher should be able to see him and like i don't know it's just interesting because i didn't even think about that you know like we're so worried about us in our work situation but they're not used to sitting this much either no no there's no retouching like they have to create their own recess since i can't go to a spa i had one of those neck massagers ship in from amazon it's like 50 bucks and you put it around your neck yeah the best christine those are the absolute there's also another one that it's called it's like a gun and it has two settings you know where you're messed up because it will like on my piping muscles like in our forearms you'd be surprised like these areas here when you hit that with the massage gun my whole arm it's just like so tight yeah because we're constantly on a keyboard but i'm cheating christina on saturday my girlfriend from ojai is coming down to long beach and she's going to massage the four of us outside i love it she has been in would you call it covet whatever whatever promote so i feel safe enough hello for contact i live in ventura i'm only 25 minutes away from ojai that would be a dream oh yeah she did not have a commission because she had a it's too much information but she had a breast reduction that went bad and then she'd been out of work so she has not seen anyone so now she's going to start slowly so this is going to be good oh it's gonna be amazing you'll probably start crying i know just talk to so me all right ladies i do have to sign off thank you so much sarah very fast i emailed you photos and i'm gonna post some on social media what should i have yay yes please share photos hashtag tuesdaytla looks like thank you so much so much oh this tile is baby now bye guys thank you so much i'll post photos thank you thank you i'm going to head out too thank you guys thank you guys so much this is fun so much for joining yeah it was so fun thank you it was great i kept starting mine over a photo of everybody pieces yeah we do that yeah let's do that quick before we all go i feel like this one like the energy was so low because everyone's like i agree but i think it honestly was a good thing right because we were all in our moment if we're all in our zen oh i love you beautiful screen shots three [Music] okay cool thank you you all look so good you", "IG9lFFGPhNQ": "hi I'm miles E and today I'm going to show you guys how to do something I've been doing an awful lot lately and you've probably seen it on my Instagram or on my Facebook or other places but I've been dying a lot of fabric and I want to show you the way that I like to do it it's a technique called marble dye and basically it it's probably the simplest way of dyeing fabrics you don't have to spend a lot of time waiting for it you don't have to do really anything special to it and it's something that I actually kind of discovered by mistake once but I'm going to show you how to do it with both your powdered dye and your liquid and this is both a brand dye this has just been decanted into this thing and you'll basically just need a couple of different things you'll need your fabric obviously and you'll need something to put it in and I have a variety of things I can use I have a little blast bowl for smaller pieces of fabric I have a big plastic bowl which also works and since for the larger pieces of fabric and there's also a stove top method and I have a couple of little pots and pans that I use just for dyeing fabric and if you use something like this for dyeing fabric you want to make sure that's all it seized for you don't want to put food in these things even if you get them totally clean there might still be something in there especially if you use the powder dye and that is one thing about the powder guy that you will notice is that it will get caught on your bowl or whatever you're using tiny little particles and that will wind up on the next thing that you die so if you're doing powder dye you might want to have a special container just for that and expect that in the future so first we're going to use some powder dye and we want to do black because I don't have any black in 14 count and we want to take our bigger bowl because we're going to be using this big piece of fabric right here it's 35 36 inches and first for long to just fill up our bowl and I have this big thing over here I don't think you can see it it's just full of water so here we go now we have our little bowl of water and this water is salt water if the the stuff that I have mixed over here is pre-mixed with salt I just fill it up put about a cup of salt or salt thing to the entire jug and it's good to go but in this case when you fill up your boss your a bowl of water you'll just want to dump a little bit of salt in there and that helps to keep the dye from fading off of the fabric too much helps to actually fix it to the fabric and now we're going to take our dye and just pour some in felt like that and it's gonna make a big mess and we have our special mixing spoon that food does not touch I'm going to just going to mix that all happy just like that and there are some differences with the powdered dye and the liquid dyes that you'll see in one of those is that powder dyes tend to be made up of a bunch of different colors so you'll get flecks of other colors in here even if the bowl is brand new and has never been used so the next thing we're going to do is take our fabric and we're just going to scrunch it up as much as we can and get it as wrinkly and nasty as we can get it and into the bowl of fabrics it goes and we're going to get everything a little bit wet because this one will be going in the microwave and I'll be doing a stovetop one as well but one problem that you can get risk dying in the microwave is that sometimes you can actually burn the fabric so we want to make sure that the whole thing is wet and the SAVAK hasn't been washed it hasn't been pretreated and that is exactly what we want from it so there we go it's in here and it's all ready to go and now we just have to apply seat to it so I'm going to take it across the room and put it in the microwave for about four minutes okay and now we're back and it's fresh out of the microwave and I don't know how all you can see on here but there are some sex of orange and blue and a whole bunch of other different colors in here and that's just kind of how powdered dye works and you see it a lot in the blacks and in the Browns especially right now what we're going to do is I'm going to take this and go rinse it out and let it dry and in the meantime I will bring back the bowl and show you how to do the liquid which is pretty much the same but we're going to do it anyway okay that one is now rinsing out in the other room I don't think you can even hear it it's very quiet but we're going to do the same thing now only with some of the liquid dye and we have our Bowl down here that has a salt water mixture and yeah we're just going to pour a little bit in here and pretty much like anything you're dying the amount of dye you put in in proportion to the amount of water you're using will also determine how bright it's going to be and we're just going to give that a good stir and we're going to take our next piece of fabric it's a fan size of the other one and this one we're going to really twist them and you can twist it you can crumple it you can do pretty much whatever you want and no two pieces of fabric are ever going to look the same so that's good and twisted and that's going to look nice and we're just going to put it right in there just like that and get everything just a little bit wet so it doesn't burn in the microwave very guilty and the reason that we're doing this and not submerging the entire thing in is the pieces that are above the water line and the stuff that's caught down here in the wrinkles that's not going to be as bright or as deep as the flat edges that are down here that are under the water so we're going to go ahead and put this one in the microwave now for four minutes as well and then I'm going to show you how to do something else where you can do two colors or more with the same piece of fabric okay I don't know how well you can hear me over the microwave hopefully it's not too loud it's on the other side of the room but this is what the black that we look did looks like fresh out of the dryer and it's still damp because it didn't go into a tumble dryer it's just a spin thing that goes for about two or three minutes there's some fluff on it but you can see how the colors look and now we're just going to put this out there to be ironed and quartered up and then I'll show you what it looks like when it's done okay so one other thing I'm going to show you while the other one is rinsing is I want to show you how to take a bit of fabric I'm going to use a smaller one it's about half the size of what we've been doing and I'm going to show you how to use two different colors on it I've got this lemon yellow and the citrus orange and we're going to use those and we're going to do this a little bit differently and we're going to fill up our bolts full of water and we want our bowl about halfway full of water just like that put that about right there that looks better doesn't it now we're going to do the same thing we're going to go from pull up our fabric real small and we're going to put it in the water first just to dampen it because I could do this on the stove but frankly I don't want to and the reason I don't want to because it takes too long and you kind of have to babysit it so I'm going to put this in the microwave and I'm going to dampen it just to make sure that the tops don't burn because I don't want the whole thing to go into the water so now for some of the dye in here and you generally want to go from the lighter color first then to the darker one can cover up the lighter color you can't cover up the darker one so if we start with the light one we get it we get a good baseline of color and then we from there can go and put the dirt in as we need it so I'm going to push this in not all the way I'm going to leave some white just like that and now this one's going to go into the microwave again for a few minutes not sure how long it depends on how bright the yellow starts to look but let's go put this in the microwave okay now we're back we have our fabric it's still pretty wet but that's exactly what we want to be and there's some yellow there's some white there's a little bit of everything and we're just going to set that aside for right now and put in some of our orange and that goes beyond didn't quite turn out as bright as I would have liked but that's fine and now this time when we do the darker color we don't want it to be quite as full as halfway because we still want some of the yellow to be showing up so we're going to do the same thing here just kind of crumple it up and it's a little bit easier this time and and it goes and this time we're not going to dump it all in because it's still pretty wet I just rinsed it off I haven't dried it so now we have half of it orange and half of it yellow and now we're going to go put it in the microwave and just a few quick little things I want to mention before we go on to the next part when you're dealing with the microwave make sure you use something to protect your hands because the bowl will be hot and the same goes for the fabric when you pull it out that will be very hot as well so what I have found is the best way to get the fabric out of the roll is to place your bowl in the sink and pour some cold water on it until it gets cool enough for you to pull out make sure that you're rinsing when you rinse start off with warm water or even hot water afterwards and then gradually go down the cold water and that will help reduce bleed immensely in the future and then rinse now when you're rinsing it you want to make sure that the color comes completely out and that the water runs clear when you're rinsing it out and that's how you know when it's time to dry it and you can throw it into a tumble dryer you can use a spin dryer I don't recommend washing by hand unless you have some way to secure the edges my surging machine is broken right now and I hear you microwave put beeping at me so I don't wash it in the washing machine I do it completely by hand and it takes a little bit of time but it does get very eventually and then I spin dry it for about 2 or 3 minutes and that's when I finally iron it and cut it all up and iron it again so that's ready to come out where I'll go rinse that out and show you what it looks like ok and now we're done everything's been rinsed out in ironed as best as I can and first I'll show you the black one which here's some of it it's kind of it's folded up because of enormous and I don't want to wrestle with it too much but that's how the black one turned out a little bit more gray than black I probably could have put more dye in there but I always have a really hard time with the powdered guys kind of figuring out how they're going to go and this is the second one the one that we twist it up and use that a wine color on that one turned out really cool I think I don't know I like them all and on that last one that we did with the multiple colors there's threads everywhere and I'll keep those when I quarter these up after this one right here isn't that one cool and you could keep adding more and more colors to it we could have even has red if we wanted but I wasn't really in the mood to keep going it's very hot so I didn't spend a whole lot of time ironing these but as long as you keep crumpling it up differently and putting it in about a third maybe a quarter of the bowl full of water with dye you can get as many colors as you want I typically tend to stick around two or three they're what they turn out really cool and I'm probably going to do a few more of these I don't know maybe not right now it's very hot but thank you guys so much for watching I hope some of you found this helpful and I will see you in the next one bye so earlier I was saying that you want to make sure you're not using your bowls that you're using to die on food that you want to keep those completely separate we have a completely separate microwave that I use just for dyeing flosses and fabric we don't put food in this thing at all", "ewskanPB8JA": "we're getting so many inquiries about what are these these are the herb bundles that you're getting in your csa box we have one that is a culinary bundle and one that is a t herb bundle this doesn't mean you can't use the tea herbs for culinary purposes and the culinary herbs for tea purposes but i'm just gonna give you some ideas of what you can do and tell you what everything is i'm a chef i'm really into my herb garden so you get some epic herbs in your herb bundles in the box every single week so we're going to start with the tea bundle okay sometimes we have fennel in our tea bundle not fennel the part you eat the bottom but the fennel seeds this is good for digestion for stomach aches and just for going to sleep for calming you for going to sleep so it's an excellent thing to put in tea the next thing one of my favorite herbs is lemon verbena smells like lemon and it's these long pieces they look kind of like this and lemon verbena is an excellent herb for tea it by itself just this in boiling hot water it makes it epic tea um you can mix it with we do here at the farm we do citrus spilanthes and lemon verbena and pure all the time that's our favorite daytime snack tea but um the other thing it's really good in curries so chopping it up and putting it into curry is excellent people love it also fresh chopped on top of curry's in some sort of chutney and a chimichurro sauce so there's a lot of different uses for lemon verbena and it's healing in so many different ways i couldn't even begin google it and look at all the ways it heals you okay lemongrass so this usually comes in your tea bundle but obviously lemongrass is also a culinary herb so you can use it for tea the same as this you can boil water put this in tea and put whatever sweetener or no sweetener and it's just by itself is great you can put it with citrus which always comes in your box as well you can mix it with the lemon verbena and the fennel but you also can use this one for thai dishes for chinese dishes for curries for soups it's super healing this is known for um helping your immune system and also with digestion and helping sleeping so this one this is olive leaf olive leaf is antiviral antibacterial and has lots of good qualities and lots of people take it in capsules olive leaf ground up but you can just add this to the tea it doesn't have very much flavor olive leaf by itself so i recommend just putting this in the tea with your lemon grass or your lemon verbena or your mint and then this is one little sad piece of mint i have here hopefully your bundle comes with more mint than this but i think everybody knows what to do with mint obviously mint you can just boil water and put mint in it for mint tea you can mix it with these other herbs it's also great as a topping on savory dishes to chop it up and put it into chutneys or take the leaves off and put them into salad mint is useful in so many ways this is um this is peppermint but we also have spearmint and we have chocolate mint so you might get different versions of mint in your tea bundle so this is one version of a tea bundle that you may get in your box so enjoy i like to just um use my french press if you guys have a french press and put the fresh herbs there put boiling water on top of it and then you can pour it out already strained and you can pour boiling water over it three or four times and get um tea throughout the day out of it i love to do that with my um french press okay culinary herb bundle so i'd say this is the number one question what is this so we're going to start with this this is cuban oregano so it's also called mexican mint but we're going to stack stick with cuban oregano because it doesn't smell like mint or look like mint or taste like mint so we're gonna go with cuban oregano this is very strong um oregano it's really really really strong um oregano flavor so if you were making a big pot of pasta you'd only want to use like one leaf but this is really good if you're getting sick to do tea out of this also boil the water and breathing the steam is really really good for colds and flus and everything like that you can dry this if we send you too much you can dry it you can use it fresh you can put it in also chutneys and toppings and stuff like that this is much stronger than the italian oregano which we also send you um some time so this one you could use this whole thing in a pot of pasta and in this one you'd only want to use one piece in a pot of pasta you can dry them both crush them up and put them in a jar for later and you could even mix them together because they flavor profile have the same thing this one is the same you could make tea out of this if you're getting sick but oregano oil is very strong um the oils in the leaves so it's not necessarily tea that you want to drink but if you're wanting to heal yourself it's excellent this is sage so it's a lot of sage to cook with and especially if you're a vegetarian there's less things that you cook with sage sage is usually used with meat so you can always dry this and you can tie some string around it and then burn it to keep the bad spirits away and you can cook with it um sage leaf is used in lots of different things it's also an awesome garnish for cocktails in all the trendy cocktails these days there's sage lemonade cocktails and other cocktails where they're putting sage on it so this is really something that you can play with and do so many different things with or turn it upside down tie it with a string and dry it and use it for clearing bad spirits okay this is tarragon french tarragon smells kind of like i don't know like aniseed and licorice put together but this is awesome for tea tarragon can be awesome for tea and it's also an amazing cooking herb it's very mild in its flavor french tarragon is an awesome cooking herb it can be used for lots of different things you can use it for tea or you can use it in cooking it's not an overwhelming powerful flavor but it is different and it is outstanding and it leaves a different level so when you're cooking you always want there to be different levels of flavor that people are gonna um and it really is on its own like level that you'll taste it i even made a tarragon ice cream uh at sage before so it's really really multi-faceted um and it's delicious try it in tea try it in stir fries try it with in a soup try it in anything it's delicious um this is bay leaves do you guys know what bay leaves are usually they come dried in the store and so these you can dry them and use them forever like it's not they're not going to go bad just dry them and put them in a jar you can put them in soups in lentils in black beans um in lots of different things i i don't even think traditionally now almost any mexican restaurant in la you go to they put bay leaves in the mexican black beans but in mexico they don't use bay leaves in the black beans they use avocado leaf but i think that a long time ago when people immigrated here they couldn't get avocado leaf and so they put bay leaf so it's an american mexican thing to put bay leaf in your black beans um but it's really delicious in french lentil soup and any kind of soup any kind of broth that you're making and you don't eat it you take it out at the end of the cooking and so that's bay leaf okay what do we have here this is rosemary rosemary's such a versatile herb you could use it as a garnish on a cocktail chop it up with potatoes who doesn't love rosemary potatoes put it in your soups put it in kind of almost anything rosemary goes delicious on it so anything savory and the higher the fat the better rosemary tastes on it so rosemary this is thyme thyme is an excellent herb an excellent addition to so many different things a lot of things in our restaurant um start with oregano rosemary and thyme so these are a great combination together i hope that this oh one little last thing of majara majaram is very similar to oregano but it's a little bit different so it goes in with this bundle savory things delicious and many things start with these three things in our restaurant it's a great way to start any soup with your celery carrots onions and garlic and thyme oregano and rosemary and majaram if you haven't that's my herb bundles and i hope that you have some fun cooking please post it please tag me let me see what you're cooking with the herbs let me know how things are turning out and try something new", "diZoMmlvhgw": "hey y'all welcome back to my channel yep you see it your girl hasn't already got her production crew y'all have been talking about y'all want to see me in front of the camera and honey ladies and gentlemen girls and boys cats and rats honey i'm up in here today not only do i have my new production crew everybody say hey [Applause] [Music] guess what i have officially moved to los angeles honey you guessed it that's right your girl is trading in her georgia peach for an avocado so today y'all i want to welcome you to the new setup and also my new cooking show called socks up [Music] today i'm going to be making a highly requested recipe y'all everybody has been asking about this and i want to know let me know in the comments if this looks like a black folks thing or is this everybody's thing chicken alfredo for some reason everybody's been asking about this recipe and i remember like back in the day when you go like the red lipstick stuff because you know real losses like you know used to be the thing beyonce said it listen but we got a red lobster you would get the chicken alfredo or the shrimp alfredo and like a shrimp scampi with some garlic biscuits and you could not tell me and my crew that we went boujeto we was bougie and ghetto at the same time but that's what it was so i kind of consider this like the hood classic bougie pasta which is black and chicken alfredo so i got some roasted broccoli that i'm to start out with then we're going to make our chicken y'all and then we're going to make the cream sauce and the pasta super easy super simple but super soft dude okay so i'm going to start out with my broccoli first okay so i've got my oven preheated to 420 degrees you know y'all want to put everything on 350. don't do that okay your block gonna be soggy it's gonna be hanging like the end of a a t-shirt i could have said something else right there but i don't want to because i'm saved praise god but i put my oven on three 425 not 350 not 375 because we're gonna roast the broccoli so you want to roast it at a high temperature now this recipe is super easy on its own and you can eat it with rice and chicken or whatever you want to do you can throw it in pasta you can throw it in salads or you can just eat it on its own it's so good y'all but what i did was i went and got some fresh broccoli because you know how they do out here in california like everything fresh okay don't use the frozen because if you use the frozen you have to thaw it out it has a lot of water retention in there y'all and then it's going to be mushy and soggy and it won't roast and give you that nice crispy kind of like broccoli that you want so don't use that use fresh broccoli baby that's gonna cost you number six nine cent well i'm in california so it's like dollar nine cause you know they charge everything highs giraffe coochie out here i don't know why so you'll cut your ends off i got two stalks here you can use however much broccoli you wanna use your broccoli do what you want to do okay and then you cut it off and then it's so easy y'all we just take it i didn't cut enough we just take it or we just pull it apart just like this right here okay super easy and it's really good on its own we're gonna roast it and after you take it out of the oven y'all you can just put a little bit of parmesan cheese on top or whatever with some seasoning salt and it's so doggone good that is a snack on its own because you know i'm out here kyle queen now and everything is gluten free gluten free and booty free super easy just want to take a little bit of olive oil because i'm saying praise god it's gonna be saved and holy broccoli thank you jesus and pour that on there like that right there how much you want to now you ain't greasing your scalp with that blue magic so don't be doing that okay but you just want to lube it up a little bit so you don't you know have a little moisture to it now just a little bit of oil now check the the description box you know all the ingredients and and the measurements will be in there but just let the spirit lead you with that maybe about two capfuls is what i put in there now i got my own seasonings y'all know what i do okay my stopped up seasons now some people just like salt and pepper white people don't do that don't do that okay salt pepper paprika don't don't taste like nothing make sure you add your little garlic powder onion powder in there too okay and just put your little seasoning in there that's my three ancestor pond full put that in there like that and just toss it around okay like y'all been doing in quarantine i know y'all been tossing and bossing around up in the bed y'all nasty stuff i don't do that so i got my cast iron skillet here now i'm working with peaches today okay peach is about a 10 inch skin or so okay this mixed peaches okay we're gonna have her right here then we're just going to pour our uh broccoli in there listen don't overcrowd the pan because broccoli does have a little bit of moisture in there y'all okay so you can't overcrowd the pan okay you kind of need them the social distance a little bit okay so i put too many in there but you want them to kind of be spaced out like this right here because if you put them together what they gonna do glass they're gonna steam we don't need that okay we wanted them to have like crispy bottom which is why i am using a cast iron skillet cast iron skillet when you're roasting something on high temperature they give you a crispy bottom and a crispy top that's what we want okay we don't want mushy broccoli like we're getting it from wendy's or something okay we don't need that so i'm gonna put this in my oven on 425 for about 20 minutes and now i got my chicken breast so these are just organic high premium chicken breasts from a farmer's market down the street in california i'm just playing y'all these are regular chicken breasts from the store but you know how they do out here they try to make everything more than what it is honey it's just chick okay free range clothes range boo ranch i don't care just get you some good chicken breasts now if you don't like chicken breasts most people don't like it because this dries a nun's vagina sometimes i understand okay but i'm gonna teach you today how to make a soft duck most of the time your chicken breast is dry because you're overcooking it one of the things you always want to do with your protein if you can is let it hang out on the counter okay for about an hour so so that it comes to room temperature a lot of times people cook meat right out of the pack and it cooks on the outside don't cook in the inside so what you want to do is let it hang out on the counter like in the pack or whatever you want to do and let it kind of come slightly room temperature it'll cook evenly and it'll stay nice and juicy and the juices would evenly distribute when you let it rest a little bit okay so the first thing i did was take it out the pack remove that little food maxi pad that'd be on there y'all know what i'm talking about take that off throw that in the trash don't cook that that ain't gonna be good so what i'm gonna do is i washed it with my california lemons from a lemon tree wash it with a little lemon a little water get that grime and it's over there get that or get that off of there okay that nook if you book club get that off of there and then i'm going to pat it dry because we're removing the moisture because we want to give it a nice sear okay now another thing about cooking chicken breasts y'all is that you see how some of this is uneven like you know this part of the chicken breast went to dr miami this one got a bad job down in tijuana somewhere i don't know but you see how thick that is right there and then you have a little thin piece that's just hanging right there what i like to do is kind of evenly distribute the meat okay so what i'm going to do we're going to take a little pressing seal here i'm going to put that down just like that y'all super easy we're gonna take our chicken breasts now don't season them yet we took the moisture out you want to secure it real tight now you can put it in a ziploc bag if you want to but i just feel like it's a little bit more messy when you do that and we're going to flatten them out now this right here don't know them kids doing quarantine that's getting on your last nerve and all these conference calls and zoom calls and all that now's the time to take out all your frustrations batman you get to beat number [Music] [Music] just take it out right here okay black lives matter folks talk about all lives matter hell now just take it out right here no black lives matter right here you see what i'm saying act like your man you know how you like your man to do it do it like that okay me and take notes this is how we look okay praise god i'm gonna get my hands to watch because i don't need y'all to talk about me in the comments section telling my oh baby she would work with that chicken nice thing wash your hands okay so i got my chicken breast sitting right there hanging out we're gonna season them with the same thing we season the broccoli with because we want all the flavors to to kind of you know get to know each other okay you don't want them to clash and fight and then we're going to flip it over we're going to season both sides why because we eat both sides okay so you flip that over like that and then you season inside now i've got my cast iron skillet here i'm working with big candy today which is my biggest cast sign i think it's about a 12 inch or so okay now put my oil in my cast iron skillet i'm gonna let it get nice and hot i mean smoking when it scares you like you feel like your house is about to catch on fire that's when you want to put your chicken in okay so now that it's hollering like marvin gaye see what i'm saying screaming at you you wanna put your chicken down in there always put the food away from you okay because if you put it towards you guess what's gonna happen it's gonna matter on you so you don't want that you want to just put it away from you don't overcrowd it we're social dishes in our food okay so put that in there don't bother it i am on medium heat right now guys so i'm on medium heat gonna let that just hang out and cook for about two to three minutes i'm gonna flip it over and then i'll turn the heat down so that it kind of cooks all the way through okay look at that i flip the chicken over and i'm gonna put the lid on that don't match baby y'all know black rose liz don't be matching don't even go there don't try to act like you know oh she up here she got a new setup she gotta have good cookware i do i got a cast iron okay i got both irons cause you need them these this time of year okay what's going on out there put that lid on and let the cookie and let the chicken cook till it's done about seven minutes okay so now we got our angry boiling water pasta right there acting like a angry black woman that's mad that we don't get our equal rights amen okay so now you got your water boiling you want to salt it like to see okay just let the spear lead you put it in there okay throw it on in there like that so i am going to be dropping my pasta in there now i'm using fettuccine okay i like fettuccine you can use whatever pasta you want to my favorite brand to use is barilla okay i like barilla pasta it's really good kind of tastes a little bit like homemade even though it's store-bought so i use varilla but you can use whatever brand you would like to but i'm using fettuccine so if you have linguine you can do this with bow tie penne bukatani okay we prolab okay do all that honey just make sure you use a nice hearty pasta and then you just want to nestle it down in there honey like baby jesus in the main just wrapping sweating clothes put that down in there like that and just toss it around okay now what i also like to do sometimes is i add a little bit of oil to the water so the pasta don't stick but we're going to actually transfer this from the pot to the pan with the sauce so don't worry about that okay look at that chicken so a way to tell if your chicken breast is done is if you touch it like that and it's firm like a plastic booty then you know it's ready to go okay but if it's spring back like a little something got a little say light then you need to keep on cooking it but this is ready you see when i touch it there is no spring back at all so i'm going to take it out okay we did not reverse sear this chicken breast but nor did we sous vide it that something my girlfriend holly would do i'm gonna take it out and we're just gonna let it rest okay just hang out because you don't want to cut into it right now y'all because if you do the chicken juice is just going to run like flo jo baby we don't need them type of problems imma keep the same pan with all these good drippings in it up in here that sucked up we don't want to get rid of that okay so i'm gonna keep the same pan and while our pasta is cooking like i said we're gonna walk in two bubble gum at the same time baby we're gonna put our butter down in there now look look at what the california soul's got little sliver side kid size but okay we're gonna put that down in there cause that's just what i got so i got my butter in there we're gonna let it get nice and melanated okay and brown that's what we need okay just like that get nice and soft up running around up in the creases and the crevices of that pan baby get some juices up in there okay once that's melted now we're just gonna add our cream to that okay i'm gonna use some heavy cream put that up in there super easy all we're doing is making a really good cream sauce y'all empty all the way out you paid for all of it so you need all of it hey man we're just gonna stir that around like this right here but look at that it already looks like it got some seasoning because we use the drippings from the chicken so make sure you do not get rid of that you want all that to be sucked up and we're just going to bring it to a boil okay we're going to bring it to a boil for about two to three minutes so now that we got the the heavy cream is in there it is cooking y'all it came to a nice boil we want to season it too okay same seasonings you can change it up if you want to use a little garlic powder and just onion powder and salt and pepper if you want but that's what i like to use totally fine up to you bobby brown said it best it's mama wrong okay do whatever you want to do and you just stir that around notice i changed from my collard green spoon to my wooden spoon because i feel like when you're making like pasta stuff you need wooden spoons okay like a big old big bad italian i want a wooden spoon so i'm gonna stir that around take your time be careful to not drip it over like i did give my taste spoon taste it okay that's not good so i got that in there then i'm going to add a little bit of parmesan cheese now don't be using the one that's in the little jar to be having at the pizza places don't use that okay they're gonna be something what you want to do is use if you're gonna use some stuff i'll use a little sergento something like that and that's how you say it cytogenta share 14 month edge parmesan use that okay put the little parmesan in there y'all know i love parmesan okay we're gonna use a little caucasian cheese okay a little white cheese put that in there then we're just gonna stir it around so the cheese get nice and melted you can use grated parmesan but if you want to use grated parmesan please use if you can fresh grated parmesan or i don't want to be in a little container i think that's better than the one that's in the other container with the little green cap on there y'all know what i'm talking about don't use that so put your little parmesan stir that around like this right here y'all so easy then what we want to do take your little parsley you just want to chop it up you can use dry parsley if you want to that's all you got use a little parsley you know parsley always i call it food grass i always make you sound look like you didn't do something you ain't really did nothing this took you less than 20 minutes to make okay chop your look parsley like this right here run your knife through it through the parsley not through nobody else okay put that in there then i got me a little california lemon okay it's time to make my neck snap my mouth pop okay put that in there give it a little tang just like that and i put it in there with this with it this way so that the juice drips down into the sauce okay you don't want them seeds up in there you'll be choking on like a hairball like a cat you don't need that then we're going to add in the broccoli our roasted broccoli which is so amazing it's so good put that up in there like that look at that piece right there oh good now you want to taste that your dough just in case it's nasty you got to run on down to the pipelines of the church you can get yourself for your gift but it's good then we're going to just toss it around so that broccoli gets nice and soft too okay now this is good like if you just want to put this on top of a potato like a baked potato and stuff this is so good okay you want to make it vegan and don't use the chicken then you can use like vegan stuff so we're just going to take our pasta and transfer it to the cream sauce y'all you don't you want to keep a little the pasta water just in case you need a little bit more liquid okay because the pasta water has those little starches in there i guess that's what the people say on the internet but i ain't never seen no difference you can just use regular water you need a little something and then you just want to just stir it around in there you want to kind of cook your pasta al dente okay because it's going to start it's going to finish cooking in the sauce okay and you don't want it to be like mushy okay looking like i almost said something so bad i can't say it you just want to cut your chicken here get you a little bit look at that look at that juicy this uh huh sucked up okay so you just want to cut it now if you wanted to slice it into long pieces if you like it long or short fat or skinny either way it's going to be a then because you don't want people choking on your food i like to just cut it in like half like that okay it's kind of like that let me lay it across a bit of pasta let's just lay it across the bed you want to turn the pasta off because i just wanted the cream sauce to kind of thicken up y'all then we're just going to lay that chicken on top of there this can be served family style you can just take this whole thing and take it to the dining room table and enjoy it with your family or if you want to toss the chicken around in there it's totally fine but we ain't doing it today because we got to take a few pictures for instagram and so i need the chicken on top then i got my chicken in there y'all i'm just gonna put a little bit more parmesan on there make it look pretty more caucasian cheese put that on there like that okay super simple super easy y'all look what we didn't did in 20 minutes then we're going to top it off with just a little bit more food grass to make it look pretty yeah that was so quick so easy we are done look at that look what we did we got the roasted

again later bye y'all", "dy515YAIsak": "hi guys - welcome back to part 2 of my tie-dye shirts well as you can see here my kids decided to make some of their own and I think they look really awesome this orange in yellow with blue speckles blue and green speckles it looks pretty cool and then this other one it's just multi-coloured the fluted bleed a little bit off of one but that's okay it is tied I so it shouldn't matter so we have this one right here which is actually the one that we are focused on I do have to say that when they worked on these they used dry shirts and it was a lot more difficult for the color to be absorbed into the material so they actually had to use more of the dye and so I would recommend that you do use a damp t-shirt versus dry I mean unless you want that effect then that's that's a personal choice it was easier though when it was a dampened t-shirt so at this point all I'm gonna do is it's been three hours three and a half three hours three and a half hours I think since I last said this here to absorb so what I am gonna do now is I'm just gonna rinse it and sink here and once I rinse it I'm gonna go and put it in the dryer so I'm going to rinse and just squeeze out as much of it dye as I can't I should be wearing tools but it's okay I don't mind so hopefully it turns out well even if there is some color all right here we go so I'm going to just use lukewarm water okay simply because my hands get cold I do have a problem with body temperature [Laughter] [Laughter] [Laughter] and in the water next I'm going to put it in the wall but if you want an idea their patter light meter which is the daylight I'm gonna try to screw that as much of that dye as I can hello so I'm gonna go ahead and wash it by itself well if I have like really dark colors to wash it with probably for the most part I'm just gonna put it by itself so here's another look of what its gonna look like pretty cool so there it is this is actually the back of it so I shall return so this is what it looks like after it came out of the washer now I just got a must stick it in the dryer because I need it for tomorrow or not me but my my customer needs it for tomorrow but I think it looks pretty good this is the front of it so the bullseye is on off to the left of the shirt and this is the back has the same effect on the back so it's off to the right well actually it's the opposite right it's on the right in the front and the left hook back okay so stick getting into the ryr these guys are still working over here you're looking really well they're really good I like this this mix of colors and then the speckled part of it this is the other one good so here's the final result after taking it out of the dryer the color looks good she wanted to keep those dark colors there is a little bit of yellow staining here and I'm assuming from when we placed it next to that guy and that's okay if you ever wanted to fix that I'm sure you could take a dark color and just pour some on there you know and they wouldn't matter but I don't think it matters at this point so okay so ladies and gentlemen this is her outfit for tomorrow there's a theme every day this week at her school so tomorrow is where tie-dye so she wanted to go completely tie-dye so we made out you know we made the tie-dye tea and then these pants are brand new that I found at the thrift store this apparently came from Kmart I guess when they closed down the clothes that were passed over to the thrift store where we shopped and it worked out perfectly they were brand new with tags and they only cost me about $7 at the thrift store where originally they were $20 at Kmart they were a little bit big around the waist so I did have to adjust as you can see right here I made a slit on this side and this side and I put an elastic and then I sewed both ends it's very simple to do so now the waist fits her very well she wants to add contrasting color of shirt and therefore this was the whole idea and making her tie-dye shirt because she wanted to put a complete tie-dye outfit together for school tomorrow I hope she has a fun time I hope that you enjoyed my video that it taught you a little bit and that you use what I shared with you and make it your own like I always say alright so don't forget to Like comment and subscribe to my channel for more ideas on crafts I love to craft I love to do things like that so thanks for watching and we will see you soon", "iNjW3R4tffI": "hey guys it's Ali here I have scooter here helping me out because if I don't let scooter be in the video then she will scream in the background the whole time so I've been doing a lot of parties lately and I've noticed I have quite a few T newbies in these parties which is great I love introducing people to tea but I wanted to go over just some of the different infusing steeping options for teas the most basic option there is is this this is a fine mesh and fuser you'll hear many people call it a t-bolt where where are you going up there okay tea ball this is your basic table so you open it right there and put your leaves in close it up then you just set it down in your mug of hot water let it infuse and you're ready to go you have your team that's the simplest option the tea ball another easy option we offer is the bubble cup I love these this is doubled wall glass so even when you have like hot water in here it doesn't affect your hands like your hands will not burn on the glass because it's double walled it comes with this infuser which just sets down inside it and hangs on the lid this infuser I like a whole lot more than the tea ball because it's a much finer mesh here and with certainties some of the teas like the Roy vos teased or really fine-grained and so they can kind of escape the tea balls a little bit this is good for your general white teas black teas green teas but some of your herbal teas and your Roy boss will escape it so that's why I like this one a whole lot I use this all the time you you're just talking away over here aren't you use this one all the time and what I love is that the infuser for it can also set down inside a mug so even if you just wanted to use a regular coffee mug a tea cup you could still use that infuser and not have to use the bubble cup with it another great option and this is perfect if your the go a lot is the pop top tumbler this is the lid for it so this tumbler is made out of stainless steel it will keep the tea hot or cold for hours like I've tested it one time for eight hours after two or three hours it was still too hot for me to drink I had to leave the lid off of it for a little while so on the lid this is the inside of the lid and this is the infuser the infuser just real simply really simply locks into the lid like this and so then you can set it here and let your leaves inside of that infuser steep into the water I also love about these so the lids like there's really just popping open but you can also set this down and lock it and that way if it bangs against something then it's not going to come open it that is the pop top tumbler these come in all sorts of colors these are really awesome Christmas gift for people I love mine I use it all the time another option this is a great one if you want to make quite a bit of tea or if you really want to just come back later and steep those leaves again this is called the breezy this tea infuser so you can see inside of it it has this strainer right here it comes out to make it easy to clean set that inside there what you'll do is you'll just put your leaves in here you can do quite a bit of tea in this so if you want several cups for if you have guests over or something and you just want to make everyone a cup of tea this is wonderful put your leaves in here add your hot water and then when you're ready to get the tea out the bottom of this pushes up so what you do is you I don't have a mug here oh I should have had a mug ready but here's a mason jar so you would just set that on the lid of your mug or mason jars and what it does is it lets that tea strain out without the leaves coming through just set it there and let it go take it off when you're done and set this aside the breezy also comes with this great little tray that you can set it on so if you do still have a little bit of seepage out there usually it's just a drop or two you can set it right here on the tray and then you have no mess all over your counter also I've had people ask me about if these stay or not because I know sometimes the plastic can stain if you run into any stains at all I have discovered that baking soda is one of the best things for getting tea stains out another option if you need to do a lot of tea is a classic tea pot this holds so much I don't know what the exact amount is that it holds but I'm always impressed when I'm pouring my hot water and I'm like it's just it's still going there's still room in there like so it comes with a strainer that sits right here into the lid you can put a whole pot of tea leaves in there pour your water in set this here and just let that steep for several minutes then when you go to pour because of the strainer nothing comes out you just have your tea no leaves no floaties whatsoever and this is a really fine strainer - this is also great for the Roy boss teas now that was a teapot I know some people get a little bit confused because I honestly used to not know the difference a teapot is what you steep your tea in a tea kettle is just for heating your water this is a tea kettle so it usually comes open like that scared you didn't I scooter this you put on the stove heat your water in don't put tea leaves in this like please don't it's not made for that this is just made for heating the water that's a kettle side note you don't have to steep your tea hot you can actually steep tea cold as well for cold steeping especially if you want a large batch two of my favorite options I will show you this is the iced tea infusion jug and this is the sweet tea pitcher so the jug has if I can get it off has an infuser built into it like this this is wonderful it's plastic it's durable so the kids won't break it you can open up the lid here right there and put your tea leaves down in here this is also perfect if you just like maybe if you just like infusing your water and you want to put a bunch of fruit in there but lemons strawberries I don't know what people infuse their water with but this works great for it I will say that the strainer here it it works great for your normal teas and especially for fruits and garnishments it does however let some of the Roy vos teas through so just a heads up on that okay so you got it and then something made some Roy vos teams all floaties in your tea but it's still wonderful I love it the other one the sweet tea picture this is glass this holds two liters the lid to it has a built-in strainer so no matter what you put in here all your tea leaves and this is a really fine strainer it'll keep everything from coming out tea leaves garnishments anything you want you can put in this and then when you pour just the liquid comes out I love to make Sun tea which is in the summertime and in the wintertime it is perfect for steeping let's say winter sangria and some Moscato that's good right there steep your wine use that serve it to all your guests at your holiday parties they'll be impressed they'll love it so okay I think I have covered all the different types of steeping options no wait steeping sex these are also super simple to use these are great if you're on the go a lot these are just little sex that you put your tea in put your leaves down here set it in the water the water in the heat will make this sill up you don't have to worry about like trying to tie it off or anything just set it out let that drape over the lid of your mug and it's good to go these are also biodegradable so you don't have to worry about harming the environment if you want to throw it out these are also what you want to use for our latte tea mixes those are very very fine and so pretty much every infuser they will seep through so use steeping sex or your lattes or a tea press I will show you that about on that one I'll get me some time and show you guys the tea press sorry this was a longer video than usual but I wanted to show you everything and help get you help get you familiar with all the different ways to steep your tea thanks so much for watching please give my page a follow and let me know if you have any questions thanks guys scooter says bye", "nUT3cxE3SmM": "aloha folks welcome to spike's cooking show [Music] aloha folks welcome back to spike's breezeway cocktail hour it's been a while since we've had a guest and tonight's the night we have a guest and he has one of the premier barbecuing channels on youtube and you're like why are you bringing a barbecue guy on we have a plan i'd like to bring up my buddy greg from ballistic barbecue greg how you doing good man how are you doing i'm so glad that you could join me here oh yeah it's been a blast and so can we tell them what we're doing i think you have to tell them to explain why a barbecue guy is on your channel yeah i think you're probably your guy's a sexy shirt greg reached out to me and had ideas about helping boost the breezeway cocktail hour show and i was like well you have a zillion how many subscribers you uh like 340 350 something like that i don't know 300 something you entered some change lots so he was like i'd love to help you out and i was like i would love some help out so i i was like what there that doesn't make a whole lot of sense about doing barbecue with teak oh wait there does we found out a way trader vic not only put out a couple of incredible bartender's guides but he also wrote what's it called trader vic's tiki party yeah he had that one and then i think he also had a guide to food and drink and a couple other things there are some ribs that trader vic had in his recipe book menu yeah recipe [Music] and and so greg's going to be cooking those i thought we would do one of the oldest trader vic cocktails and then do the whole thing together let's do it so let's do it so the cocktail that we're gonna do shows up in the menu as trader vic's own punch it says fresh fruit find jamaican rum with a flip philip with a phillip of almond so i don't know what a phillip is but there is uh or jot in the drink so that must be what they're talking about when i went to research the cocktail i found it in trader vic's bartender's guide from 1972 and then i went deeper and it showed up in a little bit of a different version in the 1947 version we're gonna do the 1972 version because it's a little bit more refined so for this cocktail we will be using lemons oranges rock candy syrup or jot syrup hamilton white stash it's like a light puerto rican rum and greg brought me this incredible gift appleton 21 was it 21 years 21. that's a lot of years it's old enough to drink that's a dumb joke this is an incredible rum so thank you again for the kids welcome and let's drink it this is where i get hung up in some of trader vic's recipes i'll i'll make the drink and then in the description of how to make the drink uh he says some bizarre stuff like don't actually measure anything just squeeze it into the glass and you're like that goes against everything i've learned about tiki cocktails for this one he says what we're going to do is we're going to squeeze orange juice over some shaved ice then we're going to drop the shell in the glass then we're going to squeeze in lemon juice drop a shell on the glass so that's what we're gonna do we need a half an ounce of each of those so let's start with a lemon you know that you want me to get a real knife we're gonna use this little cheeser like what kind of knife this is like the night for the breezeway show what do you have i have a japanese shun yep you mind yeah i just like this is kind of the yeah i mean i you know i've always thought that the ceramic one was good enough no you need one of these but you know i may have to have to hook you up with one of these oh really yeah oh you got the connection oh wow that looks like something you'd fillet a fish with well this i mean i'll be honest with you this is a boning knife but so not usually meant for for cutting fruit but it will cut through little cup fruit i'm not giving him crap about his little knife i'm not i mean i i respect your knife but i i just like the way you're holding it delicately since you're making me do the cutting i'd rather use a tool that i'm familiar with how's that i think that makes sense okay because we don't want bloodshed right are you ready yeah half yeah yeah i guess that'll do it right tool for the right job see we have a couple of glasses here i have a trader vic's brand glass here and i have spikes breezeway cocktail hourglass i just ordered more of these so more of them are on the way but i'm going to give this to you once we're done so appreciate it certainly half an ounce of lemon juice and i have good eyesight except when it comes to things that are close so he's gonna hook me up with his eyes yeah all right you ready that's good right there glad you were here bro okay so it says that you're gonna pour that over ice in the glass so that's the way we're gonna do it we're gonna do they said half a scoop of ice and since we're using kind of a small scooper we'll do it like this this will go into mine can you get another half ounce out of that lemon i think i can make sure you totally keep going keep going keep going yeah right there is perfect now we're going to drop the empty shell in there i had to ask him what a shell was i was thinking like pecan shells or something yeah do i put it in there no well i it says it to to put the empty shell in the glass so we only have one and two drinks you want to cut this in half doesn't it feel like that's too much shell to put in it seems like it's ridiculous in my opinion but i'm not trader vic i'm not trader vic either it says squeeze the orange juice over half a scoop of shaved ice in a double old fashioned glass drop the shell in the glass this is a double old-fashioned double yeah it is okay squeeze in lemon juice drop in the shell so you heard him look can we cut it in half i can that's again i yeah that's a lot of women yeah use your uh super knife yeah so we'll put that in each glass that is just bizarre it is that's a lot of shell and then let's do the orange and we'll do the same thing we're going to cut this guy in half and we are going to do half an ounce in each cocktail and that is very efficient yes i'm telling you we'll get one for uh not nearly as adorable as mine though it's not you want to squeeze that you could probably hand squeeze that okay half an ounce yeah i'll let you know [Music] that's good right there and then we will pour that into here all right that's great right there okay another half an ounce right there why don't we cut that thing in half and then i guess we're gonna drop the shell into the glass and if you people out in internet land think that this is ridiculous and we're doing something wrong let me know but literally that's what it says in the bartender's guide okay it's a punch trader vic's own punch it calls for a dash and i want to make sure the dash is so when trader vixx talks about a dash that is not bitters he actually means a precise amount like a half of an ounce or order of an ounce quarter of an ounce so for the next ingredient we're going to do a dash of rock candy syrup and a dash of orja so let's start with the rock candy syrup rock candy syrup of course is three to one sugar to water so you can squeeze a little bit harder there who is it that's good right there who sing the song rock candy is it ufo was it i don't know another song yeah all right quarter ounce is that good yeah that's good right there quarter ounce of rock candy syrup in each glass okay now the urjot and of course is like an almond liqueur i know super good smells almond this one's from our friends at bg reynolds delicious delicious or jean thank you bg reynolds a quarter ounce go ahead that's good right there perfect okay quarter ounce here one more that's good right there perfect that's really perfect okay so we're getting the ingredients here now on to the fun stuff the rum we're gonna do one ounce of light rum yes yes and then one ounce of dark yes yeah tell me i think i see the one but i'm gonna go off of you okay a little more i'll keep going so you can use a hamilton white stash for this also i love bacardi eight for uh the light rum i'm looking no a little more a little more sorry i know it's nerve-wracking when you're like i don't know okay perfect no one's going to complain too much about an overpower anyway no not at all and now for the appleton 21 i'm sealed oh wow this should be a sponsored one by appleton look at how fancy come on appleton yeah appleton this is a cool bottle yeah super cool bottle and what is that a cork cork oh that smells good smells really good yeah it smells smooth what else keep going keep going keep going keep going there we go one ounce there [Music] that's perfect right there great okay so there's the drink now i would imagine that if they were making this at the bar at the restaurant bar or whatever they would make it like this and then they would move the contents into yeah i was going to ask you is it shaken or stewart or anything yeah it it is shaken most trader vic's cocktails are shaking and the most done the beachcomber cocktails are actually mixed with like a gotcha mixer i'm gonna put another scoop of ice into this i'm going to pour the contents into the shaker and i guess i'm going to shake them with the fruit in here too yeah i can smell the fruit yeah it smells good smells really good and then of course you want to shake horizontally look it won't work until the tin is nice and frosty and a quick little tap there goes whoa there it is nice wow okay looks nice kind of a peach color yeah let me put some ice into the tin and then you can do the same it seems like one scoop gets you close you ever done this before we've done it without but with two tins oh okay i've never done it with a glass okay now i'm gonna shake until the tin gets it's already frosty it's already done yeah baby there we go oh come on show off you made the fruit disappear oh there it goes have you ever been drinking with an iced like iced tea or something and all the ice comes into your face of course yeah it's pretty comical okay so we are going to uh top them off with ice of course that is super fancy ice from sonic and then we're gonna garnish with a fruit stick and a little dude and a fruit stick and a little dude of course that's the menehune that we learned about a couple episodes back and then a whole bunch of mint here's your mint you know what to do with that see professional do i just jam it in there or what do you do jam it in there like this oh i mean sorry manahuni [Music] all right and so from pre-1947 this is trader vic's own punch looks good totally does i think i did a good job with the mitt too yeah super good job cheers cheers interesting yeah it's good yeah very light it's very light i was expecting a little bit more kind of a medicinal punch you know what i mean yeah yeah you almost don't taste the alcohol you know that it's back there but it's it's a light cocktail there's kind of more orange than lemon i would say the thing i'm really loving it though is you're getting just so much in your face i mean you're smelling all this stuff yeah and that that's the intention for the mint it's awesome is it when you bring it up to your mouth the mint goes into your nose not digging on the two star little mini straws i'm telling you that what you don't like a little straws i'd rather have one decent sized straw oh you mean one from surf side sips a glass straw yes in fact i don't know i'm just being real with you though what i don't like these two stories you don't like the little straws no i don't that's what cocktails have i know but i'm it's gonna i'm gonna blow a gasket here yeah that but the great the great thing about this drink is it has these big pieces of fruit in it like a punch would you know if you had a big punch bowl it's got the mint that when you bring it up to your mouth you're smelling the mint you are you're you're gazing into the eyes of the little hawaiian what's his name again dude menehune manahuni yeah so the ribs should be done just about now yes so i'll tell you what let me grab my camera stuff so i'll have something to put on my channel yeah and then we can try it out okay cool we're going to do a simulcast does that work yeah let's do that all right so we have spent the last four plus hours creating an original trader vic's meal right right we did that for hours it was from trader vic's tiki party trader vic's tiki party he's looking down and smiling right now yeah i think probably laughing at the knife i think he'd be stoked at our two-person tiki party that we're having two persons and a dog yeah well can we try them let's do it brother all right which uh can i have whatever one you want okay that's the end one yeah is that good yeah i mean it will be a little bit crispier right here on the edge oh wow mhm this is good mm-hmm really good let's see what i mean though the ends always a little crispier the sauce i i think just has like a the spice to it it's really nice the sesame seeds and it just it has a that was the great thing about tiki is it's not only polynesian but it's also asian and parts of african it was an amalgamation of exotic cultures but that brings me back to dining at trader vic's in beverly hills it brings me back to dining at trader vic's in london never been there what london or trader vic's paul been to grass skirt in san diego yeah so how did you get into tiki my wife was into it a lot earlier than me i still have food in my mouth i'm sorry right now um i've always liked tikis and and the polynesian kind of works of art you know uh figures and such but um it's a it's her she she got me intro i mean she drugged me to a couple events and a couple tiki bars and i just really had a blast yeah you know it's funny i've always had worn hawaiian shirts of course when i was in junior high you know i had tiki shirts well southern california yeah it's so light it really is so like light and refreshing it's getting better now that they're that it's getting a little bit more watered down yeah and that's part of tiki drinks is like the the water really helps it's like an old passion right yeah water is part of the ingredients and that's why if you use you know not good tasting water it'll affect the taste of your old fashioned just like but it's it's actually easier to drink now too with these stupid straws so when did you start your channel your youtube channel oh i shot my first video september 2009 okay but i wasn't real serious about it at that point i i honestly thought that first video was going to be my last i just i mean i just shot it on a whim i know what you mean yeah now i'm trapped trapped forever doing these videos you get hooked and that's what happened to me i started uh from that one video i started noticing interaction from all over the world yeah and again this is a long time ago and youtube was still fairly new yeah and yeah it just became an addiction well i think my favorite thing about youtube is just like the the relationships and the friendships you end up well that's the best part of it it really is and and not only from viewers but also from people who want to collaborate and uh you know i don't think we would have ever met if had we not done this thing and and it was a it was a super fun afternoon yeah it really made it out we did have a good time well it was four plus hours like yeah it takes a long time to make these things happen yes it does got to meet your dog astro yep you know it was uh yeah it was good and you're right youtube's brought me many blessings my household many blessings but i always say this the best blessings have been this sounds so corny but the legitimate friends i've met over the years yeah um not just not just fellow creators but but also some of the my viewers you know become friends with and yeah i mean like really really good friends yeah yeah it's cool it is really cool and i've got friends people that i call friends all over i mean all over the world now yeah where where i mean there would have been no chance of meeting any of these people it's just really wacky sometimes i cannot believe it's real yeah well yeah i mean it doesn't seem like it should be a thing but if you do a good job on your show what has been your biggest accomplishment well it's brought me a lot of opportunities yeah you were telling me about nashville right yeah i was the official girl master at the 2017 country music television awards yeah and country south socal he was a metal head they didn't know it i snuck through the snook through the cracks yeah and country people know their barbecue yes they do that's in that's incredible so you were flown out to nashville yes paid a bunch to barbecue and that's not a bad deal my yeah my wife went with me and yeah and uh yeah that i've done a couple books that i never thought i mean in a million years i never would have thought i would say you'd write about author yeah i mean really my high school teachers are laughing yeah and then you have a new channel that is specifically for hamburgers right yes and what's that channel called so creative gray ballistic burgers ballistic burgers yes the interesting thing to me is one of the things that you do is you recreate popular hamburgers yes so in and out burgers or it's one of the things what a burger yeah what did you do what do water burp you did do a wooden burger between the two channels i have they're not all copycats i call them copycats yeah but i have probably 153 hamburger videos i've done and um 153 hamburgers yes and and i always do a call for action to hey give me suggestions and i have a list a mile long yeah and the cool thing is again so many of the requests are not just you know you think of america you think of hamburgers yeah but i mean i have requests i've done burgers from amsterdam wow you know great britain which that's kind of obvious but it's italy yeah japan i did i did a burger it was a it was a recreation of a japanese burger king burger and and the bun was jet black the cheese was jet black wow and the sauce was jet black wow that sounds disgusting it was well it was actually good yeah but it had crazy ingredients like i had to make the buns i had to make the cheese wow the american cheese yeah and i was using ingredients like uh cuttlefish ink you know uh-huh oh my god yeah it didn't even look real but it tastes just like a hamburger yeah yeah i'm sure a cool taste but but sometimes like part of food is visual so if you're looking at like a black hamburger a lot of food is visual oh yeah yeah yeah so when you i know that you did a version of an in-n-out burger and in and out happens to be my absolute favorite burger place did it taste like a nut burger yes i mean a homemade burger even though i i love in and out i mean honestly they're great because of just how fresh they are yeah all the ingredients are so fresh but i think any burger homemade is always going to taste have a little bit of an edge oh yeah better than in and out yeah i've uh but but i but i'm not taking away from a minute yeah i did um an old video where i did their animal style okay double double yeah and then i did a just a standard double double it's a newer video and so if we if we watch those videos can we learn how to make them ourselves yes you can oh man we were talking there's a debate about the fries i like them love them yeah yeah the key to the fries is eating them on site yeah you know you don't take them home because they degrade quickly right yeah well um unless you have anything else i think that's i think that'll do i really just want to i really want to shut off the cameras so we can finish this plate ribs because i am they're so good and i'm starving sounds like a plan brother all right let's do it so greg thank you so much for joining us on spike's breezeway cocktail hour thank you for being such a gracious host yeah yeah no problem and uh go go to his channel check out all the stuff subscribe

know yeah from uh i think the first war never second war yes i don't work the first yeah but the second war i think they had pamphlets on the uh the tables of the bali high saying that if you see anybody with binoculars looking across at the at the warships yeah to say something yeah the north islands literally right across the bay yeah and back in world war ii well the warships were around the corner and then all the that's the air base the naval air base so yeah they used to have all the sea planes faced there oh okay the seaplane ramps are still there wow i used to before before 911 when it not 911 changed a lot of security protocols there but i used to dive scuba dive underneath the um seaplane ramps for lobsters wow no way crazy lobsters oh really yeah wow you've been to bali high a bunch a bunch of times have you had their drinks oh yeah yeah they're good they're they're no they're good if you're trying to light something on fire or get super yes i'll say super drunk well yeah and the other i'm not an aficionado i'm trying to learn that's why i'm watching so i'm trying both thank you so much i went to that tiki event there oh yeah you said it was like a tiki marketplace or something yeah yeah i don't care what my wife would remember what it's called sure they were selling as a zombie it wasn't a zombie no i mean it was literally you know just a bunch of fruit juice yeah and then three different types of rums yeah and that's that's like what ends up happening with a lot of tiki drinks is they just kind of make up something and they called a zombie or they call it a mai tai and half the time mai tai isn't really a mai tai i had a my tie in catalina island yeah oh wait that at that tiki bar luau larry's or something yes and it was i was damn near hallucinating it was really strong it was probably pineapple juice and myers rum and orange juice and grenadine and this dog if you look at the historical cocktail recipes for the balihi and you make them like the mr bali high they're incredible drinks i've had that drink yeah i've had i've had a lot of them not at the bali high or or made it at home no at the belly high oh yeah they don't make it the right way i know you'd think it was their namesake dude you would think that they would make it that the way they made it for forever and ever but i don't know what happens to these drink programs and and i don't know maybe it's too complicated for them or you just forget yeah they just get set in their ways or whatever but if you can hear my dog right now we keep giving him pieces of red ribs and now he's hooked like a junkie and finish our conversation now he won't bark at us up here okay okay can you stop so we can have a conversation yes he's under the influence of spare ribs i know he's like whatever the hell that is i want more of it so yeah the thing about the bali high is is their drinks are aggressive yeah they are they're high acting yeah yeah high octane for sure but the building is gorgeous the food's great like and and those drinks are great when you're there as long as you don't have more than one or one some cool history there incredible history yeah the bali is it's a survivor it's a survivor i never want to talk poorly on vintage tiki bars restaurants because you never know how long they're going to be around yeah i feel like you know my wife and i we've really missed out on going to some we went to you know we were on a road trip and we swung by to try and hit on the beach camera but it was we just missed it it was a himalayan restaurant but there was still the big swordfish up there it was right it was heartbreaking you know yeah i know what you mean and for a long time oh i don't want to get into this but yeah for a long time there are a lot of people talking down on the beach palmer the sam seafood version and i just kept going you better stop it it's not going to be around forever it's not and it's gone now so we had a we had 10 great years there and uh you know now it's gone so there's more on the chopping block unfortunately yeah i think so too by doing this we're able to time travel and we're able to sit at beverly hills trader vics and uh enjoy some of these incredible ribs and some of these incredible drinks so yeah yeah thank god people wrote this stuff down can i put this dog down now i think he would love that all right i think we're done i think we're done thanks dude thank you brother yeah it's super fun it was really fun yeah are you gonna eat that one no if you want it yeah oh i love them [Applause] thank you for stopping by blessed barbecue and today's video i'm going to be cooking up sugar cured baby back ribs it's off the menu from the legendary trader vic's tiki bar so as you can see i'm not cooking at my house i'm cooking in this tiki layer just about an hour and a half north of where i live and i'm being hosted by my buddy spike from the hula girls channel come on in spike your house thank you yeah thank you so much for having me so spike we're doing a collaboration here he and i are going to cook these ribs together and then spike's going to treat all of us to i don't even know what cocktail you're making trader vic's punch trader mix punch traders we're going to be making trader vic's punch wait where's my book thank you so much for having me on your show at my house which is so weird to come like to my bar as a guest behind the bar it's really weird for me to be here actually because spike has a channel that my wife and i have fallen in love with it actually kind of helped us get through the very being of california you get it the very intense beginning of the lockdown you know we didn't have any place to go and we kind of immersed ourselves in youtube and we found spike's channel and we fell in love with it so thank you for that one of the things that that drew me to this channel to spike's channel is he's obsessed with the history of these drinks and you know he goes over the top finding the correct spirits to use the correct ingredients and a lot of these these cocktails were lost in history and they're just now finally you know being uncovered and i'm the same way when it comes to you know these really iconic historic hamburgers you know i go above and beyond i mean drives my wife crazy trying to replicate these recipes i'm digging it and this is why i'm here and i thought that that's why we were such a good good uh pairing is because i saw you doing the historic hamburgers and stuff and i was like oh man maybe if we could do a trader vic's meeting yes then it would make sense for my channel it makes sense for your channel it makes sense for america or wherever you are anywhere really my half of this collaboration is we're making the sugar cured on the menu it's spare ribs but i'm using baby backs because of the cooker i'm using it they'll fit easier but the sugar cured barbecue ribs i'm running off of the book uh trader vic's tiki party yeah and you're using i mean uh i'm using a barky loud dog so so the interesting thing to me that stands out right away is that already we're using demerara's here ah so the interesting thing to me is that right away i noticed that we're using demerara sugar and demerara sugar pops up a lot in tiki cocktails yes so this is a pretty healthy meal right oh it's very very healthy feels like benihana's you know what that is right ginger yeah you just had some drinks i uh ginger syrup yeah okay yeah did you uh did you like ginger or marianne better actually mary ann those little daisy dukes they really like mary actually where am i calling daisy dicks those pre-daisy dude they're i guess they should be calling them mary ants so let me let me just teach you the maybe the most important fact about trader vic bergeron he is credited with inventing the mai tai in 1944 wow okay that's cool okay wow yeah it smells peanutty yes it completely changes this would not be the sauce this is going to be without that wow so if you are allergic to peanuts can you still sesame seed it's not peanut oh yeah yeah science science this is pepper from vietnam it's a little uh region in vietnam supposedly the world's best pepper really amazon wait can i have some of that pepper that's way that is way more than i needed you said some yeah a little yeah it's just pepper i mean it tastes it's good honestly there's nothing crazy special about it but i've read somewhere he gots pepper i read somewhere it was the best in the world so don't do that [Music] you", "EjmO2PvRC1k": "hi to make paneer i have taken 2 liters of milk and 2 lemons i will transfer the milk into a vessel and turn on the flame i have placed the vessel on a low flame gradually i will increase it to medium it is about 10 minutes now since we started boiling milk so i will increase the flame to medium and give it a stir 10 more minutes of boiling at a medium flame i will stir the milk every five minutes we should stir it

lemon juice slowly into the milk and mix it like i pour a little of lemon juice into the milk and stir it gently like this i have added little lemon juice and stirred the milk now i'll add remaining juice and mix it well i kept stirring it in the same direction clockwise juice of two lemons wasn't sufficient so i added the third lemon juice as well the number of lemons depends on the size of the lemon the juice you get from it the quantity and quality of milk you are using so now i can separate the whey and paneer i will place a cloth on this vessel and pour the milk into it this way water is very healthy you can use it by needing a dough for chapati or in gravy paneer so after taking it out separating paneer from the whey water i poured water at room temperature onto the cloth not inside the paneer onto the cloth i poured some water at room temperature to remove the excess water in paneer i have placed a bowl with water on it like so at the bottom there is a sieve paneer is on the

silky tender meat you can definitely make this recipe in your regular pot or wok today I'm going to show you some tips about how you can use a rice cooker to complete this recipe as good as the chip there's no way so let's get started first let's talk about a chicken you want to use younger and smaller chicken for this recipe the older the chicken is the stronger the meat fiber will be if you want to achieve the tender silky result smaller chicken is the way to go it is better to get one that is about 1 kilogram if you don't want to deal with a whole chicken you can use chicken leg or chicken wings to make this recipe there will be a lot of fat attached I'm just gonna trim that off you can discard the fat if you don't like it or you can save it to brown the chicken tomorrow just cut it into smaller bits and set it aside in the fridge too the chicken use a rope to tie the legs together make sure you leave a fair amount of rope at the end they'll be helpful when you cook the chicken flip the chicken over bend the wing and tuck it behind the back there you go looks beautiful right set it aside we're gonna prepare some aromatics you will need about one inch of ginger cut into smaller pieces smash them one by one a cloves of garlic slightly crush them as well half of a medium sized onion cut it into smaller pieces slightly smash two pieces of spring onion to release the flavor and stuff them into the chicken now let's make the marinade this is soy sauce chicken so of course you will need 1/2 cup of light soy sauce 1 tablespoon of dark soy sauce 1/2 cup of rice wine 2 tablespoon of brown sugar 1 star anise 1 small piece of cinnamon I like to break it apart to release the flavor two pieces of bay leaves and 1 teaspoon of citron peppercorn this is optional the original recipe doesn't have it I just like the little numbing kick thump in the aromatics that we prepared before stir to dissolve the sugar put the chicken into a sealable bag pour in the sauce if the sugar is not fully dissolved use a rubber spatula to scrape it down push out all the air and seal the bag we're going to let this sit in the fridge breast side down overnight this is the next day pour everything out of the bag remove the aromatics that are on the surface of the chicken take the chicken out and save the liquid we'll use that later I'm using the simplest rice cooker it only has cooked and warm to settings if you got a fancy rice cooker it will be even better we're gonna saute the chicken fat first just add that to the rice cooker and spread it cover it and let it cook for a few minutes for this rice cooker if you don't cover it there's not enough weight for you to press the button down if you got a better one the settings might be different the good thing about using a rice cooker is that you don't need to worry about burning anything because it will talk to warm setting before the ingredients get and look we've got about 1 and 1/2 tbsp of chicken fat and the chicken bits are nice and golden you can snack on those if you want take them out and we're going to brown the chicken if you don't have chicken fat it is completely okay to use regular cooking oil this is optional I have tried skipping the browning step is to taste delicious I consider myself as a perfectionist and I do think the Browning brings a little more flavor to this dish look at that I'm Julie now it would just take about two minutes on each side the rope is really helpful while turning the chicken what do you think you got enough surfaces Brown pour in the sauce along with all the spices and 1 to 2 cups of water different rice cooker the power is different you will need to address the water amount if you'll nosh your you small amount first and add more water if needed cover it let it cook for 15 minutes to 1 hour my chicken weighs about 1 kilogram if your chicken is bigger you will need to cook it longer during this time you want to come back every 15 minutes to give a flip that ensures an even color on the chicken surface like I mentioned before if you think the sauce is evaporating too much and it becomes too thick you can add more water after 1 hour of cooking the sauce would be really thick the chicken looks really nice Cantonese restaurants will hang this soy sauce chicken by the window you may have seen this if you've been to Chinatown if it's freshly made you can see the sauce juice dripping down it is so delicious looking you can serve it whole if you prefer this way because it looks prettier or you can chop it up like what local people would do I will show you how to do that in a second even though it is a bit annoying to eat with the bones use scissors to cut out the backbone flip the chicken follow the middle of the chest to cut the chicken in half take off the legs and the wings well a traditional Cantonese chef will use a Chinese chopping knife instead of scissors but I think scissors are good for beginners you've got the chicken breast and the chicken back just cut it in half then keep chopping each part into smaller pieces this is a traditional and authentic way to cut up a whole chicken in your Cantonese restaurant the chicken will be presented in your plate like this we usually serve this with white rice and some baby bok choy to balance the flavor I don't have bok choy today so I blanched some letters there will be a third of a cup of souls left in the rice cutter drain the spices is very salty I will dilute it with some water and taste it to make sure it's good decorate it with a piece of mint pour the sauce over the chicken doesn't that look good let's give it a try mm-hmm the chicken is very tender it has a silky smooth texture the main flavor of the chicken is soy sauce but you also got a mate of all the spices like onion garlic ginger flavors because they were cooked in the rice cooker together you know what I love to eat the rice with the sauce that we spooned over it is so savory I hope you keep this a choice you if you did leave me a comment let me know how it goes as always you can check the description for the written down recipe and give me a thumb up please don't forget to take a

the color of your eyes number one feed your eyes properly just like any other part of your body your eyes need specific vitamins and micro elements to function properly diets rich in vegetables and fruit and low in fatty foods and sugar that your eyes demand is actually beneficial for your whole body such berries as grapes goji and blueberries have effective anti-inflammatory properties and also help to improve your vision dark leafy vegetables sweet potatoes carrots and pumpkin contain beta-carotene dioxin fen and lutein act your eyes from being damaged by the Sun strawberries eggs salmon mackerel oranges and such nuts as almonds provide you with vitamins a c and e for example vitamin A helps you to improve your night vision and prevents night blindness and vitamin C slows down the development of cataracts and macular degeneration vitamin E is beneficial for those people who have early signs of macular degeneration that is connected with age as for crab turkey and oysters they contain zinc and copper zinc helps to produce an eye protecting pigment melanin copper prevents the development of age-related macular degeneration both these vitamins and minerals are vital for good vision as well as for disease protection if you include in your diet onions garlic and caper you will enrich your diet with lecithin sulfur and cysteine this will prevent the lenses of your eyes from getting cataracts omega-3 fatty acids in the amount of a thousand milligrams per day will help you to avoid dry eyes and macular degeneration that's why mackerel herring tuna salmon walnuts and flax seeds should be frequent ingredients in your diet if you can't get any seafood buying fish oil supplements will be a good alternative number 2 make some lifestyle changes first of all adjust the lighting you have in your room or in the office for one fluorescent lighting isn't good for your eyes it not only gives off wrong frequencies of color but also emits radiation this makes you feel drowsy also when you work or study keep a shaded lamp on the desk it should be located in front of you the light should be pointed at your work while the shade will protect your eyes improve the quality of the air in your office and at home first and foremost get an air humidifier the thing is that the reason you have dry eyes is a lack of moisture and lubrication on their surface this can lead to a mild irritation but also turn out as bad as a serious inflammation of the eye tissues that's why a device that will moisturize the air in your home or at the workplace is a must also check the air flow of your thermostat if it's too strong your eyes may suffer as well the same goes for a vent if your desk stays just next to it try to replace it to another area going outside when you know that the air quality is poor or pollen count is high is also a bad idea pet dander is a potent irritant that's why you should clean the furniture in your house and vacuum as often as possible if you have pets quit smoking this habit not only harms your lungs but also causes such health problems connected with eyesight as macular degeneration optic nerve damage and cataracts what is more smoking can lead to diabetes and this condition in turn will damage your eyes control you weight first of all a good diet will fill your body with vitamins and nutrients beneficial for your eyes secondly following a balanced diet you'll avoid diabetes which can ultimately lead to blindness always wear sunglasses when you go outside the reason isn't even sunlight that is too bright UV radiation coming from the Sun amplifies your risks of macular degeneration and cataracts invest in a pair of sunglasses with ninety nine or a hundred percent protection from UV rays and put them on

with more contrast this will help you to read and browse easier your monitor should be directly in front of you it's screen is to be located a bit below your eye level number three do special exercises to train your eyes I massage it's a good preparation before you start doing eye exercises wash your hands close your eyes and apply light circular movements massaging them for a minute or two this will help to stimulate your eyes properly pencil push-ups take a pencil and draw a number a letter or just a dot on its side now focus on the sign you've drawn and move the pencil a bit away from your eyes you shouldn't lose concentration then move it back toward your eyes stop as soon as the pencil starts to double close your eyes or look away for a couple of seconds after that look back

little bit so a fatty liver again we get people writing into the channel all the time asking about how do how do you treat a fatty liver and i actually think it's a term that is unlike some of the terms out there that i don't like which have been overused or used in a way that i think doesn't do them justice such as leaky gut has not do that diagnosis justice but fatty liver really does reflect what happens inside your liver um it just doesn't give you all the rules of how it got there you can think uh with a flash of uh or minimal investment in understanding the the ketogenic diet and fatty liver that if you have a fatty liver you shouldn't be on a high fat diet and i'm here to show you how you got a fatty liver in the first place and how to undo it okay so fatty liver that's a beautiful liver i don't know if you've noticed but it's smooth it's lovely and if you look behind there there's a vein that flows into your liver and then your liver filters and it actually makes a bunch of ketones that's where ketones are made is in your liver and then out of the liver flows uh the blood to your heart so the next stop after the liver is your heart but we're showing you in the background there that not only have red blood cells floating through there but you have some resources for your body and the little blue circles represent ketones the little red rhomboid squares are glucose and those things with three yellow lines are triglycerides that are in your blood and so that's not a perfect representation but it does really hopefully capture that these are the research sources we're going to talk about over the next bit but you'll notice in a healthy person all three of them are present for your body to use and for those cells throughout your system to decide which fuel is the best for them ketones glucose or strings of fat as you look just that little vein right there is the portal vein we get it ports uh nutrients from the intestines to the liver and so it is usually very filled with the food you just ate so the liver will check that out make sure that it sorts out any toxins but also if the fats are in a certain place it's going to decide what to do with those fats all right so here we go we now have a time where you decide carbohydrates are their favorite thing to eat we've all been there that's not a terrible thing for the human body but if it's the only resource you're eating or it's such an abundance of glucose that you're eating eating every two to three hours a really high carbohydrate diet it is almost like the default that happens in america is um that carbs are easy they're processed they're right there every meal every lunch uh and school breakfast is like overly flowing with with carbohydrates and what happens is these little white balls that ended up in the in the liver this is normal uh they are strings of glucose because you had extra your body couldn't burn them all the time uh it will work really hard to keep those blood glucoses under a hundred actually that is normal uh you'll see people say oh it's only a little bit over a hundred my blood glucose was a little bit high it was 105. and in a fasted state that is not normal after eating you'll see it rise but it should fall back into that 75 or 80 range even into the 60s if you're fasting for quite some time and when there's extra sugar around your body will put it in a string and store it in your liver as glycogen so glycogen is a whole bunch of glucose strung around and in storage form it's the most rapid to store and it's the most rapid to empty when your body needs sugar so from that point we like to point out that your insulin during this state is still considered normal it isn't overshooting by very much it is rising the more time spent with a high carbohydrate job or high carbohydrate food and its job is still to say we'll check to see if there's too much glucose and we'll fill up that liver with these glycogen storages as soon as it's above our threshold which is really insulin is going to start being a production or a a full-time job a full presence if you would uh when that glucose is above 80. for sure when it gets into the 90s and it's in full-fledged flames if you would when that glucose gets above 100 so what happens next is after your body spent some time saying hey there's just so much glucose um we can't we can't really put any more glycogen into the liver it's pretty stuffed uh the next thing that happens is the insulin turns into a very inflammatory process it starts screaming at your cells get the sugar out of the blood get the sugar out of the blood and although glycogen balls were a nice idea and a really quick way to store sugar the a more a much more efficient resource to store energy is a fat and the liver will make those little strings of carbohydrates into a fat you'll then tie them together essentially and you'll have three strings of fat called a triglyceride and you can notice in that background of that blood that the triglycerides are again three strings floating along they are resources trying to be dropped off to different cells because cells do like this energy it's a very good energy but the liver becomes a nice place for um uh you to store that uh excess glucose and it stores it in a very efficient molecule meaning a high calorie molecule called a triglyceride or a fat and so as you look at what our liver looks like now i don't know if you can i want you to appreciate the the artist that helped me say this is what a fatty liver looks like and i actually i can remember the first fatty liver i ever saw on autopsy it was in medical school and like most gross anatomy labs there's going to be a serratic liver a fatty liver cirrhosis is actually what comes after a fatty liver it's with years of the liver being filled with triglycerides and high amounts of glucose glycogen balls glycogen storage so that fat and sugar become [Music] more and more inflamed those cells then cannot process the job of making the fuels cleaning the blood and it becomes hardened that is cirrhosis commonly associated with alcohol but very much today i would say most of the patients that in my internal medicine practice that end up with a cirrhosis of the liver it came from years of elevated blood sugars being type 2 diabetic insulin injecting type 2 diabetics and they didn't reverse they didn't empty the storage tank they continued to fill it and their little friend insulin became their enemy because that insulin turned that storage tank from this beautiful resource that can quickly turn into a uh energy glucose or fats um but can no longer do that uh once the body has tapped out the liver in a way that there is just no more room in the end now i will tell you that at this point when the when the liver is fatty um you can see those little glycogen balls they still have the ability to unwind back into glucose but all that glucose that has been uh turned into fat the only way out of the body is through a ketone meaning the only way that fuel gets burned or used or if you get too high of ketones flushed through your kidney the only exit once that high level of glucose turns into strings of fat it's you got to make ketones so when people say you know how do you lose weight well especially if you're trying to clean up problems like a fatty liver we need you to make ketones we need you to be in a state of ketosis to constantly pull on the undo button for a fatty liver so how do you reverse it that's the whole point here right so reversing this is possible is it your your liver is wonderful in how it turns over and will make you some fresh liver cells tomorrow and the next day and if you get it in a great state of chemistry it's going to not let you down first of all i tell patients drop your carbs total carbohydrates to less than 20. i tell them to eat a high fat diet i steer them away from seed oils and what i'm trying to do is lower their insulin i've written a book actually we're getting so close to having my pre-readers read it which talks about the keto continuum this is the process that i use in my internal medicine clinic that gets patients from not knowing a thing about a ketone to being very proficient the keto continuum i'll just give you a brief outline of saying eating at the beginning of that slide where the glycogen balls were filling up and the and then the triglycerides were coming in that's that would be keto continuing number one where the patient usually eats every two to four hours when they do drop their carbs to 20 or less they go to eating about every six to eight hours if you can see way over on the side of this you'll say it takes about four to six weeks to get through keto continuum number four and then we have some harder choices to make you'll also notice that it is a time where i think checking urine ketones is absolutely all you need to do i just need to know that your body's in ketosis and to reverse a uh fatty liver we can speed it up or slow it down but the basics are in that one through five of the keto continuum and we can go we could spend a whole hour just walking through the keto continuum i i don't want to do that i have an online course that you can go to bosmd.com forward slash shop and click on consistently keto and you don't have to spend the time clicking around youtube saying that i can't seem to follow the linear process of how do i get into a state of ketosis and really help reverse some of these long-term metabolic inflammatory problems the book that i'm writing is based on keto continuum i tested out that curriculum in an online course and have been just super thankful i think the most powerful thing that happens when you take that course is you get part you get to be part of a facebook group that everybody in the group has been through the course so it is a very advanced level and i don't mean advanced i just mean they're not asking the newbie questions like what is a ketone what happens if i don't have a gallbladder how do i you know why are my urine strips not working those basic questions which i feel like i've answered a thousand times are all in the course it is a very methodical process and it teaches you that one of the key components for staying consistently keto is to do what i do and that means yes check your numbers but number two is help create a keto support group in your community and i give you the tools to do that so you get through that keto continuum at least to keto continue number three and now you can see that their blood in the setting of that fatty liver has a different chemistry set you've got ketones flowing in the background you have those triglycerides and you've got some glucose you're always going to have glucose there but what happens next is things start to empty and you're going to keep that insulin is going to protect you it's going to stay high for quite some time it doesn't lower by itself it does take uh energy to lower um it'll lower in the first week you'll have less insulin in the first week which is what allows the liver to make those first layer of ketones and then you'll see what happens is you'll start to see the disappearance of those triglycerides you'll start to see the disappearance of the fat and those cells do regenerate we do end up with a healthy liver normal enzymes in the end of having a liver that looks much like what my brain said on that first day of gross anatomy how can we get this beautiful looking liver and not a gnarly looking one it does require that the insulin gets back down to a normal range that does not happen overnight it you didn't make it high overnight but in the presence of the things i do on the show every week i check my glucose i check my ketones i fast once a week i show you that on instagram those processes are stressing my metabolism they are stressing my body to keep it in shape preventing my liver from getting a fatty liver but if i had a fatty liver this would be how i coach patients to reverse it is slow steady continuous ketones in a ketogenic state watching many of the processes that we talk about on this channel please subscribe

of homemade iced tea today we are celebrating iced tea month with this refreshing drink three delicious ways I'm going to show you my classic iced tea recipe been an unbelievable raspberry peach iced tea and finally a mojito inspired I see that you guys are going to love now let's get started with our classic iced tea recipe so I'm going to get started by adding some hot water to a heat proof glass container it's really important to use heat proof glass for this because you don't want it to shatter when you add the hot water you could also use a teapot for this if that's what you have on hand no problem at all so I'm adding my hot water to my heat proof glass container and to that I'm going to add my tea bag now I'm using 60 bags for 8 cups of water but if you prefer a stronger iced tea feel free to use a few more tea bags it's totally up to you next I'm going to add some lemon zest now this is an optional step but I find it adds a nice lemony flavour to my final iced tea so all I'm going to do is take a vegetable peeler and gently peel off the best of my lemon what you want to do is avoid as much of the PIP as possible because it tends to be a bit bitter once I've added my zest I'm going to let my tea steep for five minutes you don't want to over steep your tea because it can create a really bitter flavor once your tea is finished steeping you want to remove your teabags and your zest then we want to let our tea cool completely in the meantime I'm going to create a simple sweetener for my tea now I know a lot of people prefer their tea unsweetened and if that's the case for you just skip over this step no big deal all I've got is some honey standing by again in a heatproof glass container and to that I'm going to add some boiling water I'm going to stir it until my honey's dissolves completely and then I'm going to set it aside and let it cool once all of my ingredients of cooled it's time to assemble my iced tea so in my pitcher I have a whole lot of ice into that I'm going to add some lemon slices you could also do this with orange slices that would be super delicious next I'm going to add my honey sweetener and finally my cold deep tea I'm going to give it all a good stir and this iced tea is ready to serve how very refreshing next I'm going to show you it might delightfully delicious a raspberry peach iced tea now for this tasty treat you could totally use black tea that would definitely work but today instead I'm going to be using one of my very favorite uncaf native teas rooibos now if you're not familiar with rooibos it is a very mildly flavored South African team that has a busy of health benefits so all I'm going to do is add my robust teabags to some hot water and let this sit for about five minutes once our tea has finished steeping I'm going to remove the teabags and set it aside until it cools completely now I'm choosing not to sweeten this tea but if you wanted to sweeten it you could definitely do that using the method I showed you for the classic iced tea once our tea is cooled completely we can assemble our iced tea so in my pitcher I've got a whole lot of ice into that I'm going to be adding some sliced peaches I'm using white peaches in this recipe but you could use any kind of peaches you like I'm also going to be adding some fresh raspberries then I'm going to finish it off with my beautiful rooibos tea give it a good stir and it is ready to drink finally we are going to wrap things up today with my incredibly refreshing mojito inspired iced tea not to worry though there's no rum in this recipe so for this iced tea I'm going to be using green tea you could definitely do this with black tea if you wanted to but I think green tea is a great complement to the rest of these flavors all I'm going to do is steep my green tea for three to five minutes I'm also adding the zest of one lime to my green tea while it steeps once it's finished steeping I'm going to remove my teabags and my zest and set it aside until it's cooled completely while my green tea is cooling I'm going to get started on my sweetener for this recipe instead of using honey I'm going to use some white sugar into that I'm just going to add some boiling water and stir it and tell the sugar dissolves I'm going to set this aside and let it cool completely finally I've got my pitcher full of ice into that I'm going to add some fresh lime slices and some fresh mint I'm going to add my sweetener and my green tea and give this all a good stir I should warn you this stuff is highly addictive like three glasses a day addictive don't say I didn't warn you I hope you'll give these three tasty recipes a try and if you do be sure to tweet or Instagram me a photo because you know I love seeing what

healthy recipe and known as black pepper chicken so i'll take you through the ingredients and yes before you do that actually we was today's topic is healthy delicious recipes a lot of time people associate healthy recipes with the blandness you know boring not appealing to the eyes but japanese is yeah because she is a homemaker and an excellent cook very passionate she's going to show us today how we can be able to make a quick recipe that is healthy and very delicious in a short time so welcome and enjoy the show yeah so yeah let's go ahead and tell us what universe is request all the viewers to take that pan and diary and note down the recipes since today's recipe is based on health point of view we are going to use olive oil to cook which is healthy yeah instead of olive oil you can use normal oil yes but because of our topic today we are going to use olive oil or you can use ghee the pure gay healthy entity or vegetarian give for the vegetarians yeah sure but butter also can be used yes but because of health point of view we are going to concentrate on using either ghee or olive oil or olive oil yes so that also I'm going to leave it on the viewers to decide how much or in the u.s. Meath yeah there's no particular amount of oil to be used okay then we are going to use ginger and garlic paste this is again freshly homemade ginger and garlic paste we're going to use 1 teaspoon full of that you're going to use 1/2 cup of yogurt you're going to use 1 teaspoon sorry 1/2 teaspoon of cumin powder this again is freshly ground home ground cumin powder yes I roast it on the saucepan exact and then grind it this is all spice powder or garam masala powder 1/2 teaspoon ok 1/2 teaspoon of that this is salt salt again according to your taste okay this is green chillies or cutting julienne yes I'm going to use around 2 and this is ginger Julian Julian Julian style most of viewers will wonder why I'm gonna be using ginger and garlic paste and then ginger also exactly but trust me that there's going to be a very good tastes by adding this ok ginger julienne cut the black pepper chicken of coarse black pepper cannot be missed but I request the viewers to use black pepper crushed not powder not powdered yes because it's going to beautify the dish because we're going to see the particles of black pepper in the dish correct all right all right and again I've roasted the black pepper and then crushed so that is the ideas into the dish okay you're going to use lemon juice 3 to 4 tablespoons of lemon juice okay we are going to use the red pepper capsicum the red capsicum julienne cut you can use green capsicum also if you don't have red capsicum okay to add color to the dish I chose to use rest yes yes and this is the greens of spring onion the greens only the little green yes this is 1/2 cup okay for chopped green salsa spring onion we are going to use this as a garnish garnish you yes no fine yes okay okay so and half-killed 1/2 kg of boneless chicken cut in Julian Julian Julian is this is the Julian cut the long sort of long as you julienne style of cutting you follow through yes in the green pepper yes the ginger the red capsicum ok this one is not Julian but it's for garnishing yes so you choose one style yes and this dish is an endo like indo-chinese dish ok ok yeah so and mostly Chinese dishes have which you can cut the cut years have you done anything to this fish no total fish this is sorry chicken marinating it or anything there is marination required so you're going to first start by marinating the chicken ok so viewers at home you're going to make first marinate the chicken with 1/2 cup of yogurt ok right and we're doing healthy today so of course yogurt is healthy because it has good bacteria exactly especially for ladies yes different diseases or conditions it protects you against yes and then I usually prefer my mates to marinate with the very best tenderize it because yogurt tenderizes the meat it also has that that property yes otherwise the meat okay yeah and advantage of using directed a product and arises in moisture Isis the mates exactly it doesn't rather than the other tenderizers which dry out the meat dairy products always yes it gets juicier they yeah ok what are the other tenderizes are tend to dry out for example vinegar vinegar or the this the terrorises available the powder terrorizing me to resin will work on the counter at grocery shops ok markets that's a good tip yes ok ok viewers at this point you're going to keep the chicken at home for 15 to 20 minutes ok but since we don't have enough time at the show here we are going to cook it immediately yes but if you leave it for some time it gets better yes so you violated it just with yogurt and only your yoga natural yogurt yes you can use my similar mammalian ok ok so we're going to begin ok so that one is up to you you decide how much all you want exactly I'm going to use around the 1/3 cup usual not too much too much it always hits up we're going to add in the rest of our ingredients so I'm one of the people who works who tried out the old recipes really yes I cooked it for my husband menus class my tweaks and they were all like oh this is tsunami my husband was asking me is this organic chicken I was like no it's not much you can did you marinate it no I didn't yes that's the charm of the recipe very charming for working women like you I know yes thank you so much I'm good with making a lot of that and it was very quick yes yes it is okay so after 15 minutes you can now cook it yes when you realize and run again to be like 15 20 minutes or half an hour maximum there depending on the time that you have yes so we're going to add in the chicken at this point and of course the spatulas for scooping out all the goodness yes into the pot yes so the oil doesn't have to be very hot the ginger and garlic paste 1 teaspoon full of the garlic and ginger paste yes ok I noticed that your cooking is very different in terms of you don't start with the onions and tomatoes using that that kind of cooking it's become kind of old-fashioned absolutely like every time you think of cooking the first thing that comes to mind is kata-kata onions nice nice so mussels but this is very nice and different yes ok so that I don't use onions and all that but this is very trendy its trendy yes and it's possible you can't keep doing the same thing the same thing all over and yes you want different memories yes I would like to share with the viewers the properties since the today's chicken is called black pepper chicken yes I would like to share the properties some of the properties that black pepper contains yes that pepper is really really healthy for our bodies okay it contains lots of like it's contains lots of good good amount of main minerals minerals such as potassium magnesium zinc and calcium really I didn't know yes that's micronutrients yes yes yes this little thing black pepper contains so much decided yes and it is also very excellent it's an excellent source of vitamins a and the vitamin C and white will be complex vitamins so it's actually very healthy yes very healthy and the chicken as we all know it's a good source of protein yes and it's white meat yes B to have less with less cholesterol - yes less colors and easier to digest easier to digest lemon again very good for health yes yeah with a means full of vitamin C time in three yeah and you're good it's a probiotic yes good first stomach and it contains healthy bacteria which are good for your stomach that's right yes another thing about lemon you know this this is very good because not only do they have the health benefits but they make the food delicious exactly because lemon gives it a tangina Tangela and it up very nice chili teas that is not true not too chilly yes - you taste buds can manage the chili okay we also have garlic and ginger yes antioxidant a yes antioxidant yeah and enhances the flavors of your dishes as well that's right yes ginger is good for like we usually use ginger when we have sore throats hot lemon ginger hot lemon commercial equipment coals and actually hot lemon ginger usually has lemon it has ginger and of course so this is also good for you to improve your immunity exactly yes and cleanness and you know what there's also vegetables yes and great chillies are very good in vitamin C the yes and it's more healthier to eat green chillies rather than red chillies oh I didn't know that because if you last time we used green chillies yes it's healthy it's great how's our chicken doing our chicken is cooking yes you know I noticed that when you cook with your gut clean your gut it's sort of such to look like I don't know is it breaking down you know how it looks it almost looks like it's not like it's going off no but I'm yes it's good meantime it blends less the spices and everything and you're going to get a very easy into curries so when I was making Monica plundering it's okay for you to look like this but I was like suddenly did that so I'm following I'm following the more you cook the more that Luke disappeared yes now at this point we're going to wait for the chicken to turn from pink to white it okay that's it we're not waiting for it to get cooked yes just only to change the outer color yes that's when you're going to add in the rest of the spices and leave it to cook that's it okay yeah so we need to let's show our viewers how it look so that when you see this is juicy yeah it's pink because some of artists and white the other is still pink to wait for it to change all wirelessly - right and then we're going to add in the rest of the is yes and that's very easy actually you actually notice that color change I like the way you know when you organize your cooking like this also it looks beautiful the display and also makes it very easy to know because I notice that you arrange the ingredients in a line the way they the way they go before falling on the exactly you're very organized and very passionate receive it makes work easier yeah yes rather than going in fact the pantry cupboard I know like you know you maybe you need a chair because it's on the upper part exactly I tend to come she feel like me I can do this is to climb Oh your father knows something that's happened and maybe your food has overcooked you know so it's good to actually be organized and just have this layout and this you can have somebody even prepare for you if you you know able to yes because if you're working you come home and find it like this cooking it's very easy yeah so at this point we're going to add in all over all our spiced spices the dry ingredients this is cumin powder we're going to use 1/2 teaspoon of cumin powder okay half teaspoon heaped always yes hipped yeah okay you're adding a little bit more because you also look to the eye yes yes you're used to you know and this is a half teaspoon measurement yes it is yeah and this is all spice powder or garam masala it's also called allspice it's mixed in certain in all the spices yes you do them yourself or you put its when it's mixed in so we usually make it at home okay we dry Rostock the girl the whole spices and then grind so this is a combination of mini spices yes that one's cumin seeds cardamom cinnamon cloves black pepper nutmeg the mace and it all depends on people also how many more spices they want to end well these are the common spices that are mostly used and you and you have them all at home yes really yeah their natural form so you roast them again yes in the new grind and yes roast them again to get the aroma out first to taste so 1/2 teaspoon of salt you can always adjust salt later yes that's right okay that's it we're going to no let it be for a while before the rest yes any time we're gonna stir this it's all white all right now the color is starting to change a little because of the dry spice you can see that there's some brownness coming up the chicken has all turned white mm-hmm and it's not yet completely cooked but the color there's no pink at all Indians it's gonna still cook further yes with the spices and getting all the aroma and we're together yes sir the spices in early so that they get the infusion to the chicken exactly okay and again I would like to share with the viewers that this dish can here today we are going to serve the dish because of the health point of view we're going to serve it with the mashed potatoes and sort of vegetables mixed vegetables but the other option is you can serve it with the noodles noodles so again what kind of a sauce are we going to get out of it is it going to be more liquidy or less semi liquid a semi liquid Seminole yes okay you can serve it with rice noodles and fried rice yes fried rice you can serve it with naan as well nan a garlic bread again the variations are endless and yes so it all depends on how you like your career to go with yes that's it like your career to go with on the test of your family members exactly that's right away if you have children then you can only do spaghetti yes beYOU know most children love middle alligators yes so you put the moves at any point on top probably exactly we're going to move in while this is cooking we're going to waste time you're going to be moving into our next into our design is that your next recipe for the day okay so the next recipe for the day is known as citta fault cream citta file cream or custard FL Casa de PO cream this define is what language certified is Indian language / Indian language yeah and then English is custard yes I'll give you a brief history of how I came up with this recipe it's your own first years I developed this recipe myself after testing it okay one of my very close friends in there Aslam she's called Shazi she sent home he's watching yes she's also I her so she's watching here right now she sent me once do you usually do Ramadhan time yeah we have dessert as part of the meal part of the meal yes so she's a deletion type oh yes so she prepared this and sent me and I loved it so much I loved it it got into my test buds and my teeth your mind back in there yes I tried to play a couple of times but didn't really get that same taste mhm then on our last visit to Dube yes we went to visit my brother in law my husband's brother okay lives there and there's a very famous joint Indian joint which is there in which is in based in Mumbai Ali mm-hmm and they have franchise in Dubai oh yes so this is one of their speciality and after a long day shopping he is to always stop by because the the corner used to come on the way to the his house so he used to stop by there and have this dessert almost every day and my mind developed the ingredient I tried it a couple of times and came up I came up with the recipe one faster and I would share it with the viewers today okay so custard apple this for those who know what custard apple is this is what custard ethylene is it easily available yes it's it's a seasonal fruit like I I didn't get it very ready available here OB I would like to thank my sister-in-law's mother who just came in yesterday from masa did she got it for me yes she's such a sweet lady thank you a very good friend I call her Auntie but she's a friend okay we stay nights chit-chatting and all that above grade she's a wonderful lady thank you so what this recipe requires five or six customers are they ripe right now because they look green ish black we have hard when they are not right like this is not right this is not the kind of change when it gets right yes no no the color doesn't change how will you know it becomes and okay once you if you wanna cut it you just have to push it back so push apart yes and it just because it's very soft when it's right okay yeah all right you don't need a knife you just use your hands and a bit of pressure yes so this set of four cream or custard apple cream requires five to six such set of all creams yes you have to de-seed them and remove the pulp so this is the pulp of five or five or six SATA for cream all secure phones do they have a lot of seeds yes they have black seeds little ones or this size that size maybe a quarter in size I already have in a desert somewhere and I didn't know it's possible then we are going to use one cup of cream cream this is cooking cream de la ley de rien on or not the Navy creme de vie but this is non-dairy option yes not the epson or for healthy option and this is confectioner's sugar 1/3 cup of confectioner's sugar it also icing sugar icing sugar is called confectioners sugar or you can if you don't have confectioners sugar you can use castor sugar sugar is normal right the common grinded sugar at home you just grind it in a coffee grinder oh just make it yourself even this was available at home that's why I brought it otherwise I would have also used use castor sugar yes oh nice and again because we are talking on health point of view yeah all those patients diabetic patients or health conscious people who don't want to take direct sugars yes can use artificial sweeteners exactly or diabetic sugars that are readily available in the market today please consult your doctors yes please do that this is food sweets yes it is sweet can you avoid the sweetness and the sugar yes you can according to your taste you can even use honey and I've not tried honey yeah but you can give it a try you can yeah it's good to be able to be flexible yes take a clean mixing bowl you're going to add in all the fall yes so how often do you make this at home if you used to eat very I know it's so easy yes we're going to add in the cream mm-hmm that's one cup right yes one person one column yeah actually desserts usually have a lot of cream in a lot of it's comfort food yes yeah do you find that sometimes when you go out to a restaurant you eat and then you have no

how many minutes has this chicken been cooking for do you have an idea it's like until you already like the duck to five minutes yeah six-five yeah but I'm seeing there the the chicken has sucked up all the rest which you can has looped in all the ingredients so it's looking very nice yes it's starting to brown a little so you have to add in the green chillies haha the filling in all of them yes and the ginger genius of here this is let's show our viewers how it looks like I think I can see it's coming along pretty well yes heading our our our time to cook and soft yes but I usually prefer my vegetables not to get overcooked we don't like overcooked vegetables because I feel there you lose most of their nutrients by getting overcooked and becoming mushy yes Carla you know I like your choice of red pepper because the contrast between the meat and the pepper is very clear you know and I remember what you said last time that you must first eat with your eyes exactly before you eat with your mouth yes you guys can't appreciate this okay before I say this and we'll add in the lemon juice yes we will add in 3 tablespoons of lemon juice ok 1 and the final and the main ingredient of the dish because I'm going to be having this soon in my house the people in my family are very grateful to you because you're changing it's making exciting look at that color let's show our viewers a little so that the care appreciate yeah the black that actually gives it and you know because what you said because it shouldn't be powder yes it should be crushed should be cracked with the business and most importantly like the warm garlic the hold one yes love you what do you use to get this yes I use normal than ever but the only times the ladies especially the Asian ladies yes to use that the stone type pestle and I used to grind grind in there and as your branding you're talking and cut one being it looks really nice Wow two minutes and our dish is ready we if you want to wow your guests you just need to follow shop news on Facebook oh well okay no we talked about your future plans yes to do with Kim yes about that again yes I'm very passionate about cooking yes because my husband is a foodie and he has always encouraged me to do this cooking and all that so yes my future plans are to upgrade my skills on cooking and come up with cooking classes at home and you know commercial level yeah and for sure for my viewers know that support I'll put it up on social media yeah although you want to do more baking yes yeah mo begins alright okay so this is oh is it ready yes with no garnish it with a bit of the green part of the and you see that color again becomes very beautiful because now we in there we've got the chicken the word pepper and now we have the spring onion the green part so the colour contrast is very beautiful very very famous okay so a quick stir here and description haha that's it that's it yeah it's over yes it's always in such a soft side now I have a question can you do this with another type of meat for yes I will do that because we have very little time on on the show I came up with chicken chicken cooks very few yes but the same recipe can be made with chicken unborn or turn yes but takes longer to to cook because yes oh you can use the same recipe for beef base to cut in strips julienne cut we cut belief yes Melissa follow the no beef sometimes tends to be a bit a bit tough yes sir yes they're going to add in water yes points yes at what point at work point we're going to add enough to be able to add in the yogurt and the Oh Angela yes before you wait on the spices you're going to add in some water like 1 1 and 1/2 cup and of course beef we have this Follette beef you feel it yeah the the type of beef to you so this is the Phillip business yes specially Follette beef or if you don't have because that tends to be more expensive and some people would not want to go for that no more beef can also be used but we just add in a bit of like 1 to 2 cups depending on hose you can then see by eye and yes I mean by the touch of the meat if when the meat is ready to be to be sure to be added the spices travel on the next for the next level of cooking ok will there will the plain yogurt will it also tenderize the beef because I find that yes so be yes you know they tend to be rather tough which would also tenderize yes ok yeah in moisturizers yes yes juicy yeah because also sometimes it gets tough because of drying right now yes all right and then again we can use the same recipe for fish oh yes fish cooks even more faster exactly yeah so you have to be careful so it isn't become overcooked yes or break because the fish filleted mostly yes yes yes and the same recipe for vegetarians you can use paneer paneer yes and canoe is something that you can make at home yes I have a brother who loves to cook it I remember that he knows how to make money remind me how you do I also maintain you know I make most of the times I do make paneer at home okay especially when the milker like there was a time I used to buy I used to buy fresh milk they remove like I said in base yes the menus not looking over at pasteurized not questions yes I used to buy that so normally like per day we normally consume because of the kids taking milk and on the base to consume like 2 or 3 litres sorry ok today yes so there are some unfortunate days when the milk when you boil it like this is point a this is point but actually is G is its characteristics and can be used for exactly so what I do with that is I add in vinegar or lemon a tablespoon of vinegar or lemon to it and let it boil further and a whole tablespoon full of salt maybe for 1 liter of milk a whole tablespoon full of salt here and one lemon I squeeze it into the into that milk yeah so I let it boy it's going to cuddle further because of the lemon yes I see did introduced it to the so once it's done that we normally use a muslin cloth yes a muslin cloth if you don't have what is the alternative oh there's some sieves that are available very very tiny holds sieves yeah because they are the normal season let's a lot here yes but there are some sieves I've seen in the market that are very tiny ok and can be used for that but I usually use the muslin cloth yes I put it over about like this leaf bow I put it over and put some weights it doesn't get into the sieved water yeah so I pour all that all the water will is going to pour down were down and the residue is going to remove remain all that muslin cloth then slowly taking all the rest residue die or not and leave it to Hank I also like a place Oh overnight yes oh it's gonna drip and then and I don't rest the water that really you know this Cadiz I use it to make sure party doors to party doing yes it turns out to be very very so make very very soft chapatis uh-huh Wow and now of course what you have left on the Muslim yes now before you die that if you want flavored punished you can either flour it a black pepper some people want to flavor it with the spinach puree carrot puree to make colored ponies yes so you can use that do that at that point okay you're going to try it together we are gonna make a knot and then let it let it take over night away in your house they usually need the kitchen cabinet yes those handles yes I tell you doing those handles and it hangs overnight yes and then you have a booth to capture yes together add it here and make your Chopin yes so there in the morning when I open I get my lump of Peniche yeah and it's actually alum yes which you can cut out right up in here I feel you tie it tighter yes ah yeah freeze it you can freeze it and then when you want you can make black bunny or black paneer stickers funnier Curry's actually the only type of funny I've had is the one with with the spinach funny bunnies exactly it's called palak spinach yes I think inside of me like a part of half of these Indian alright so okay move back to this side yes so sure the viewers how to this was in the fridge Chile yes if you were home yes you are I keep it to chill for around 20 to 30 minutes yeah so it gets good chilled and it's enjoyed eating I wanted to also say that I noticed that um a lot of my Indian friends because of the fact that their food has a lot of chili they tend to have something like with whites to always I think it cools the turnoff yes that it's cold falooda yeah falooda or white like yogurt lassie lassie that's the one of last year we usually combine Alessi with the biryani z' and let's see also is very simple to make yogurt to mix to the bit of water cumin seeds & black pepper and salt it's a biotic an ice cube yes yes yes so it balances out despite because biryani is very rich in spices yeah so having that combined with biryani balances out the spice level in your intersted in your nose and eyes so they're going to show the viewers how we're going to serve this because plating is very important yes you know yeah look at that bowl let's talk about it because the display is very important you know this is a bowl that is so beautiful it actually looks like it's a strawberry yes and it's been cut yes and it's good for serving your desserts or you all your fruit spam because you know it's in theme with yes we're doing to pour in our city fire cream custard apple custard apple cream yeah yes it's so simple very very very simple and you know when you have gifts like on a Sunday returns you Dada has taken off here the day yes and sometimes you feel overwhelmed but this is something that you can do it's such a short time yes an hour yes you have a meal and it is that it's so simple that it doesn't even require lots of garnishing or anything it's already just goes well this is the main serving we're gonna show the viewers how you can serve them in individual bars let's actually show them how it looks so that they can appreciate just there you go yeah able to serve in individual pounds [Music] and even the bowels the tables are very nice and very simple yes yes so do you like to host a lot of visitors or do you mostly cook for your family only I do cook for my family and we also vr where we have a very good friend sir calendar well I have extended family yes because usually each other yes yes and because we live in the Islam we get our family to visit us there okay so that also expects me to cook new new dishes for them I'm sure they love coming over because they know their culinary their taste buds are good to have a field day so this is our seven for the sitter for cream yeah exactly yeah next we go further for the the main course the main cause okay our chicken is ready yes our chicken is ready so let's put this here so that's okay this is complete actually first let's show the viewers individual serving yes if you are plating the food in do some time to do that like plate the food in the kitchen yes I do we do yes I do sometimes my kids are like good The Mummy we want to have KFC style chicken uh-huh yeah so I make for them fries the chicken the cost was seller and played them so that they get that ambience the restaurants can be radically because actually the restaurant they pleat it for you they don't even port yes yes yes so you can actually do that sometimes I find that people are so afraid to plate food at home because of the portions I don't know how much to serve but anyway but maybe you can like it's easy to know your home for me okay yeah but for your guests sometimes can be a bit tricky yes yes this is I was serving and this is a very nice because it's nonstick yes yeah all right there we go okay and additionally oh yes of course because you big about you big on that yeah so to keep this I must bring in some humor here garnish yes like this never strands now you to eat it or not oh is it hasn't been over handled with the hand preparation I believe these days most restaurants are very hygiene conscious yes so the chef's and all that handle they usually wear gloves so they are very like you get sanitizes everywhere exactly so the issue of hygiene shouldn't really commits then means it's optional yes and since people are so health-conscious then mostly i've seen these days people do consume these very dry muscies yeah because they're mostly made of vegetables you know yes look at that it's actually looks like a flower let's put them close together to each other yeah so do you have a cutter a vegetable cutter that cuts into these chips or do you use just i have it back at home but here i didn't have it so I just used a knife or but this one I think you use the carrots you use no no idea I use the knife as well Oh for the card yes this is yeah oh yeah on top there I think you you you you're you express the art in you through food yes right because even just knowing where to place the you know this is a very artistic dishes yes are you are you able to see let's just you instead it's plated yeah there we go look at that that is such a beautiful dish actually people who are watching are probably thinking it's a lunchtime now I wish I was at GBS don't worry we are going to enjoy the food for you and this is when you have put it on the table to serve it for people to serve themselves yeah this is how it looks and it's garnished very very well I love that the colors in the food you know yeah well green dress and you say that you don't cook you don't overcook the vegetables just softened a little it's mostly for the color and also you don't overcook so that you retain the the flavors the flavors in the the nutrient nutrients yes that's right alright so what would you like us to taste it today do you start with the dessert or do you start with the main course I suggest to start like the main person and sweeten your test buzzer all right so let's dig in here you go so this is what you're saying is the healthy option because it's actually boiled potato mash potatoes but you added something to it yes olive oil and milk and milk and salt and pepper salt and pepper black pepper yes you can advisor as well very nice how did you just mash it up you blended I boiled it and another healthier option I'd like to give my viewers is that always always boil the potatoes after peeling the skin after filling yes when you peel the skin of the potato and boil it it removes the starch of the potato when boiling while it's boiling please when when you don't boil the potato full how you usually feel it and then boil it yes so that it removes the starch if you if you boil it the skin the starch retains yeah okay all right let me chase the chicken you need to start thinking about this it's very very nice I always like the way you get the balance of the salt the spices and the chili you know I don't want to add anything yes I just want to sit down it's not stop doing it hmm and the veggies these are saut\u00e9ed veggies yes such a boiled and sorted various thing very delicious Oh guess what it's almost time to wrap up the show and this is our dessert as well yes the sitter for cream sitter for this is my first time to eat custard yes asked changed my life for the

in today's video I'm going to be talking about the different Bath & Body Works candles that I own because I do have a bit of an obsession with them so some of them are old and no longer in stock if there's anything in that scent i will link it down below like a different body wash or something along that line or some of the candles i may own in the tree wig and they no longer available in that size they might be available in medium by the minis or vice versa so i will try to link down below anything in the scent that i am mentioning if there is not a candle so if you want to know watch candles I have what I like then just keep on watching so I am going to start off with the 3-bit candles I own then move down to medium size and then to the minis so at first sent I'm going to be starting out with is called endless weekend and I don't have the little cover for it anymore it came with a little BG seen it smells like summer basically so that's what I like about it this time of year like in the winter I don't burn it as much but I really really like how this one smells but I don't think it's available in a candle for many more so if there is anything available in the endless we can send only get down below so you can smell it to see what it's like and then if it comes back out in candle form you could always pick it out that the next scent i have here is called beautiful day i got this one for christmas remember thing and this one I believe it's an apples and it's just really again kind of summaries so it's not sold this time of year I'm sure they'll come back out in the spring summer time there are other things available online in the Sentry two whole days i will link those down below because the candle is not available but the next step that I have in the three-week handle it's called renew and refresh and this one to me smells kind of BG it smells sort of fresh like water sand almost if that makes any sense this one I don't think there's a candle online anymore if there's anything in the you and refresh sent i will link it down below definitely go smell it because it smells so good the next scent that i have is called party dress and this one it's really almost kind of musky it's like a mature woman sent i would say this one is not available at all anymore nothing in the party dress ascend that I could find available on bath and body works but it normally comes out around the holiday time so I guess it must have been discontinued because I didn't see it out this year along with like black tie champagne toast those kind of ones it's the same kind of general theme to it but I didn't see it this year so I guess it was just continued it's not exactly the great ascent I have gone through the most of it because I personally do like it but I could see this being like not one of the most popular sets the next three mik i have is red velvet cupcake which on the lid it actually says limited edition 2013 which means I've had this for a while and i haven't even burned through half of it because it's one of those sense that's kind of overwhelming you can't burn it for too long it's really sweet and as you'll notice throughout most of the candles i have i don't typically have a lot of sweet sense i normally have more of the like kalloni type sense or the more fresh or even fruity scents but not really not this sweet cookie hot chocolate those kind of sense I don't typically gravitate towards those because I just find that they get kind of sickening after a little bit so that's why I haven't gone through most of this even after three years I just can't burn it too often or for very long at a time now this next scent that I have here is completely opposite from red velvet it is more of a cool oh nice and it smells a lot like hollister and this is mahogany teak wood which i think is like a cult classic like everyone loves mahogany teak wood my entire family loves mahogany teak wood and I do have multiple i think i have two of the three wick of this and then i do have it in the mini and in the medium size as well so obviously i'm obsessed with this scent in particular i could burn it for days at a time i could burn it every day of my life like that's how obsessed I am with this send the next through a candle that I have is the stress relief eucalyptus spearmint and I don't believe they sell this one in the three work anymore but I'm pretty sure they have the eucalyptus mint which is not the stress relief but it is still the very similar sent so it is really relaxing considering the stress relief one I pretty much owned this scent in any form I have like a bath oil of it I have a body wash of it I have two different types of lotions like I I live for this scent because it does for ask me more recently I did pick up a few more three bit candles because clearly I didn't have enough so during black friday or the black friday sale it wasn't actually on black friday that i bought these it was unlike the sunday after they still had the same sale going on so i picked up four more three with candles the first one being champagne toast which i love the sun and for a while I couldn't find it in a three week I found it in a medium to begin with and I loved it so much that I've barely burnt it because I was scared of not having it anymore because I just love the scent so much also sharing the black friday sales that I picked up for more candles with the frosty air one which is a really fresh scent and as you can tell I do like the fresh spends a lot so this one I could just see any burning like any time any time all the time every single time and then the next scent is sparkling icicles which kind of like frosty air is a bit of a fresher sent this one I'd say is a little bit stronger I don't even know exactly how to describe this scent on us the other than fresh but it smells really good and this one like I said I picked it up not that long ago sparkling icicles I mean it's winter so ice so I'm sure it's still available I would suggest checking it out smell in it smells good then last but not least for my three wit candles which to be completely honest is probably like my new favorite it smells kind of similar to champagne toast honestly it's called juniper berry and pine that's great it smells so good oh good I've had to resist burning this to film this video because I didn't want my new ones to already be messed up like some of the other ones are looking a little janky so I'm one who'd make new ones to look pretty for this video so basically right after in been filming I'm furnace alright so next up we're moving on to the medium candles that i own and the first one I'm going to talk about is called black tie I have two of these in the media and honestly is another one of those kaloni sends this one I think is a bit stronger than the mahogany teak wood sent and it's a little bit different like just how cologne smell a little bit different from each other these coloni candles kind of smell a little bit different from each other and this one again it's just it's really good i like my room smell like men I don't know guess I was lonely before her boyfriend and then the next one I have in a medium candle which i also have in me three wig I also have in the mini is champagne toast I'm not going to go into much detail because i have already discussed this one a little bit when I was wrong about the three-week I believe it is only available in the three weeks sighs now though again I'll link everything down below next this one as you can tell by the way it's packaged is older but it's good it's mahogany teak wood which I do own and their three-week in the medium size and in the mini and again this one just its calumny it's good I need it in every size and then finally for the mediums I have the scent flannel which is now only available in the three wick size but I have it in the medium size and in the mini in the like older packaging that some kind of smells a little bit cologne meet you to be completely honest with you I feel like this is more of the like more typical one that people you would always talk about with flannel you know flannels are typical vowel sound typical sorry if the Lighting's changing a little bit during my filming of this video it's just that as you can tell I'm in the middle of my kitchen right now i am using natural sunlight because girls broke and can't afford no fancy lighting to start her youtube channel so i mean we're going with the natural sunlight and we're getting kind of in that point of the day especially considering its winter and the sun's only up for like two hours the day so the sun's turned to get a little funky right now so bear with me with this lighting situation eventually if I get enough support from you guys and can actually spin my channel a little bit then I'll be able to afford the lights but right now i can afford the Sun moving on so last but not least we're talking about the mini sized candles and I have leaves which smells kind of like apple cinnamon like an apple cider kind of that's what smells like I like it it's very cinnamony like a straight-up cinnamon stick actually so if you like cinnamon if you'd like the scent of cinnamon you're going to really like this scent lease is also available in three weeks sighs and I believe in mini size step all right and as I said before hot me Jake why I love it so I have it in the three week I have multiple in the three wick I have it in the medium and I have it in the mini I have two of the minis I have too many 100 chica candles so when it comes to the minis apparently all I really own other than leaves is since i already have in larger sizes so the next one up champagne toast but you know is one of my face love this one's self i also just side note really like the packaging on these like more holiday ones i don't know cute the final one that I have to share is flannel again and this one's in the mini size and it smells good cyclones been that man yum yum yum all right everyone so that's everything for this video if you enjoyed it go ahead and like this video leave me a

classical look which we're not so sure we can retain we just tried that out my life in system is totally up and here we go guys isn't that kid my life in system is totally fixed now so my aunt of the counter lighting with that installed is fixed and everything is okay so we're gonna do it along with our decorating process anyways that is not what we are about today today we're about to go down to the kitchen with a summer project guys I've been consuming teas I fell in love with teas and I'm just I found a brand it I really really love and I've been just going at that tea I've consumed so many

everything about the coal lignite and every craziness is going on I said I'm not even gonna take any chances so I went into my garden today and I found some business plans there we go they were in some water I put them in some water to stay fresh and instead of staying fresh they limp but that does not stop us from having a good cup of i disgust and this is a tea that we're going to be making today I miss so pretty heaven in this water here fresh water that we wash them and for some reason they closed up in so stayin open in the water if I used to wash them to remove insects and all of that it's instead of staying open they closed maybe they don't back a lot of water I'm not so sure but what we do it goes through and make sure that there is no insect or insects and that's why I saw them in the water and vinegar [Music] a little bit and these are the pink ones these are current one is pink so we have a whole different kind of I discuss plans here guys for our tea and we have washed them as you can see and now we are sorting through to make sure all the bugs are gone and we're ready to make our teeth so we gonna be baking hibiscus tea today guys look at that I think making different kinds of I discuss teas these we could have been making some a great tease and we're gonna be making some black or white please okay so here we go we got really doing we could open some two that will give us energy so for the people who need a lot of energy they would be making the Lipton tea Lipton tea has the caffeine in it and therefore that will give you a lot of energy if that's what you're looking for the high energy tea for this occasion will be Lipton or of course if you want coffee which is not really tea but I do do a lot of Starbucks also so Lipton is the high energy one tea times with friends I usually love to use British teas and that's just reading my background so on tea time with friends is definitely British tea so if I'm having afternoon teas I would just definitely be using some either Earl Grey or British teas okay not a fine tea that I love really really love are these English teas this one's just a fine English tea really really love that one so I can also do that before afternoon teas which one's very very entertaining and very fine taste in tea is also notifying tea it's just English breakfast tea and I love that one also entertain friends sometimes I'm throwing a Japanese party I also do this whitey is very very very very good this one is low in caffeine and I love this one also love this tea but today let's look at some of the teas that we can make and how we're gonna make it okay we just just shared with you some of the teas that I really do like to drink and we could look at making today okay so to begin the tea we're just gonna need a mixing spoon and this is just my Japanese mixing spoon and sorry guys so my camera blowing up I think it's on autofocus and I can't figure out how to take it off this is a nice mixing spoon that I have here nice and long and I usually use this when I host my Japanese court is so we're gonna need a nice mix we're gonna pour this one we couldn't break apart our discuss and we're gonna put it in this glass container [Music] so let's go ahead guys and break up the my disgust for this team so I'm just breaking the leave support we're gonna do the red one first okay guys on my stove here boiling is a whole pot of water okay and we're just gonna pour that into our container and we're gonna cover our TV so it gives me okay so let's go guys to make sure that your tea is not bitter it's it's good to put a little baking powder in or baking soda whatever you have okay if you have the soda put that in individual make it not bitter and give it a pretty color okay so here we go for our teas we can use fue we can use on cinnamon sticks and I keep my cinnamon sticks in this container here it keeps them fresh so you can use a bit of cinnamon sticks in your in your tea to infuse of course let that infuse with the leaves of your tea to give you a very good aroma and taste there's a very nice consideration cinnamon stick we can also use fruits apple orange banana if you lemon juice lime in your teas okay so those are optional you can choose what you jus what you would really like to use your team just showing you guys I would say you can use in your tea his mates and these are taken directly from our little garden summer town we planted this garden in the spring and now we have made so we can also use mint tea so there are several different things you can use to make it very very interesting so yeah guys here we go alright so I'm just giving you ideas and you can choose what you two would like to use in your tea okay for our first year we're going to use them use the cinnamon sticks and so let's go ahead and take out a few pieces of cinnamon sticks okay so this smells so good I love spice we're just gonna use one we're gonna start with the radish hibiscus which we have right here okay just for demonstration purpose I'm going to put my a discus in here so you can see as yeah but usually I use my Japanese kettle it's a wrought iron kettle I just dropped my abacus leaves in here and they cradle here and cover it over and let it steep and it's another way you can do it so I just pour the hot water over once I put the leaves in which we're gonna do it right now all right so we're gonna put one bit of my business in and we're gonna put our cinnamon stick in we're gonna go ahead and put that add bit of baking soda and so if this tea is not bitter okay okay guys so I pour the hot water in this container you can see the steam and for demonstration purpose I just use this so let's begin so we're just gonna go ahead and pour in our order just a little at a time [Music] so once your five minutes is up if you want to put the sugar in you can go ahead and do that if you want to put a bit of lemon in or lime at this time you can go ahead and do

It mimics a natural design that's found in stone or a nice piece of ribeye. You've probably seen the marbling technique used on things like the end pages in a book, or in stationery store. But did you know that you can marble dye fabric? Hi, I'm Cathy from Online Fabric Store. Today I'm gonna be using some liquid Rit dye and shaving cream to spruce up some plain boring white pillowcases. So let's Dye-ve right in. Here are the materials you'll need: a press cloth, a trash bag or plastic to cover the working area, Something to dye, I'm using some cotton pillowcases, shaving cream, liquid fabric dye or fabric paint, I'm using Rit all-purpose liquid fabric dye, a flat edge, I'm just gonna use some cardboard, a medicine dropper, a paintbrush, paper towels, gloves, an old t-shirt, and an iron. First off if you actually care about the clothes you're wearing, you're probably better off putting on an old t-shirt. You're gonna want to match your fabric to the type of dye you're using, or vice versa. All-purpose Rit dye likes cotton fabric so I'm using 100% cotton pillowcases. If you're using new fabric make sure to pre wash it ahead of time to remove any sort of finish it might have. Lay out a trash bag, so it's large enough to cover your work surface. Cutting it open will double the amount of space you'll have to work with. You don't need to use a trash bag, it just makes cleaning up a lot easier. Depending on the size of what you're marbling you can even use something like the top of a pizza box if you don't want to waste a trash bag. You can lay out your object first and make a few dots at the corners to better gauge the area you'll need to fill. Distribute the shaving cream across the surface so it's large enough for your object. It doesn't need to be too thick, about one inch of cream all around will do, just enough to cover the surface. Smooth it out a bit using your fingers or a flat edge. I'm gonna use my fingers because it feels cool. Next drop the dye on top of the cream, but make sure to shake the bottle first. If you don't want to stain your hands, now's the time to put on some gloves. In the end, less is more so be careful of how much dye you're adding into the cream. You can use however many colors you'd like, but you should probably keep it to about 2 or 3 or less. When trying to figure out what colors might look nice together, or what colors combined will create other colors, using a color wheel helps a bunch. Using whatever tool you'd like, swirl the dye into the surface of the cream Be careful not to press your tool in too deep as that will push the dye to the bottom of the cream which isn't what you want. I went ahead and used the bristle side of this paintbrush to give a more speckled effect. There's no right or wrong way to do this. It's all about personal preference and experimentation. Another technique for marbling is to create smaller batches of cream with the dye mixed into it. Then add that colored batch to the larger shaving cream surface with a small tool. You're basically replicating the process of adding color onto a blank surface. Doing this will create more prominent veins in the design and allows you to play around a bit with texture. You can also reverse this technique by creating a larger batch of dyed cream then add white cream into it I'm also going to experiment with my fabric being damp as opposed to dry, just to see how well each retains the color. Gently place your pre-washed fabric on top of the cream starting from one side and going to the other. Lightly press down with your fingers and let it sit for a few minutes. Make sure the entire surface is touching the marbled dye. You can push the fabric down a bit to get to the corners if you have to. Gently remove the fabric by pulling it up from one end or corner and set it aside on to another covered surface, cream side up. After letting the fabric sit for a few minutes, use your squeegee or a sturdy flat edge and scrape away the excess shaving cream. Be careful not to press too hard or you risk smudging the dye. If you need to dye another item, you can just reuse this cream by adding a little more to the top and smoothing it out. This creates a blank canvas without having to start all over again. Just be careful while smoothing it out as you don't want the dye from below to mix with the new cream. Additionally, if you're only using one color, here's a good place to try out that reverse technique I mentioned with as little wasted cream as possible. If you have to go in for another pass, make sure to wipe the blade clean first. After most of the shaving cream is removed, heat set the dye with a hot iron and a press cloth. Make sure not to iron directly on to the fabric. I reversed this lovely ironing mat Clara made, so I didn't ruin it. Rinse out the fabric in cold water until the water becomes clear, and hang to dry. And here are the results. I'm pretty happy with how it came out, but I do have some reservations about the damp pillowcase that I dyed. Keep in mind that no two marbled things are exactly alike, so have fun with it. Despite everything I read on the internet, using dry fabric as opposed to damp fabric seemed to work better. I used the same techniques on both dry and damp fabric and found that the colors transferred better, didn't bleed, and were more vivid when the pillowcase was dry. If you're planning on marble dyeing separate designs on something with two sides like I did, it might help to place a piece of cardboard or something flat and sturdy in between the fabric. This prevents the dye from bleeding through and transferring on to the reverse side. I'm not sure if it was the shaving cream or the dye, but I noticed with the first technique that the dye congealed a bit on the shaving cream surface. When I went to swirl it, it clumped up a bit and that translated onto the fabric, which leads me to my next point: Remember what I said about being careful not to press down too hard when wiping away the shaving cream? Yeah, make sure to listen to that advice, nice and gentle. And you can marble more than just fabric. Why not create some card stock, or water marble your nails with nail polish? What do you think about this whole marble-but-not-marble trend?

farmer Maggie today we're gonna talk about one of my favorite things coffee I'm a huge coffee drinker and I've always drank my coffee hot well my friend Rob who happens to be behind the camera this morning is a cold brew drinker and Starbucks has come out with a coffee that is cold brew with cold foam and Rob has figured out how to make that foam at home save himself a whole lot of greenbacks not going to Starbucks all the time so what we have done is we have made our own cold brew and I'm going to show you how to top it off with the phone okay so I'm gonna show you how we made this cold brew take a look so you're gonna need some kind of a gallon container so you can use a gallon jar or you can use a gallon pitcher you'll need a full pound of coffee grounds and you may or may not want to put your grounds inside a cheesecloth bag that you're gonna make by tying it around the grounds just to give yourself a little less work to strain the grounds at the end you can put your cheesecloth into a larger Bowl cut it big enough so that it hangs over the sides of the bowl then pour your grounds into the middle and then just pull the corners up and tie them around the grounds so that you have a pretty tight bag that will contain the grounds while they're floating around in the water next you just put your bag of grounds or just dump the whole bag of your loose grounds into the bottom of the pitcher fill it all the way to the top with water and put the lid on it once you have the grounds and the water in your container you're gonna want to set a timer for two hours because at two hours you're going to either stir the pitcher if you've got loose grounds or sort of push the bag up and down a little bit into the pitcher of water if you've got a bag the full timing for the the cold brew is 20 hours so set yourself some kind of alarm or timer and so that you know that come back at 20 hours and remove the grounds and now you're ready to enjoy your first cup of cold so once your cold brew is made and as you can see from the photos we showed you we put the grounds into a bag into this pitcher so it's been our 20 hours and I'm gonna get this grounds out of here of course it's going to go in the compost pile according to Dirt Farmer J's rules and now we need to strain all the grounds that have accumulated and hair out of there so I have a French press which works really well so we're going to just strain out enough in order to show you one cup of course you're going to want to strain all the grounds out of this before you grew it before you store it in your fridge so I'm just gonna push this down kind of slow not to stir things up and now those grounds are all trapped under there and we'll get some clean coffee so what I'm gonna do is pour some coffee into this glass making sure we don't get any ground so it looks good I'm gonna put in a couple of ice cubes so it's gonna be chilling it down nice and now we're gonna go to the magic of the cold foam so if you're like me I watch carbs a lot and I know a lot of people do and have to for health reasons so there's a couple different ways you can do the foam we've tried both and they both work but if you want to do a low carb version you can use a syrup that's sugar free because the syrup doesn't really make a big difference and you can use half and half which only has one gram of carbohydrates for every two tablespoons so that's quite well as opposed to the skim milk that has 13 carbs in a cup so one of the main things I've learned is that you need to have a curved blade on your immersion blender if you have a little straight blade it's not gonna frost up the milk correctly so I'm going to go ahead and put some this is skim milk so this is the non-fat version of milk put some in there and then I'm going to go ahead and put in this syrup you can use any kind of syrup you want you can use regular maple syrup this happens to be a vanilla the syrup doesn't really matter it's just to taste so I'm going to put some syrup in there to give it a little sweetness add that on touch my immersion blender and here we go let's check that and see how that did whew that looks really nice so you can see that it's nice and frothy we're just going to pour it in slowly into the cold brew it's gonna be right on top there and give you all kinds of num enos and you can see it starting to slowly melt down into the coffee and there you have it Starbucks cold brew at home Cheers [Music]", "WSZOQ-UZKdI": "00 god daughter today at Linda's Italian table we're making bow tie pasta with lamb and teeth let's get started we begin this dish by browning our ground lamb in some olive oil we're going to season it with a little kosher salt and a little freshly ground black pepper and when its brown on all sides will remove the lamb from the pan with a slotted spoon and use the same pan to cook our vegetables we browned our lamb and our olive oil and we've removed it from the pan and now we're adding our chopped garlic we finely chopped it get it all in there and add our chopped onions and we're going to cook those vegetables for just a few minutes until they're tender and then we'll continue and you can see that our onions and garlic are nice and tender your beautiful color and you're really sizzling in the pan and now we're going to take our ground lamb and we're going to add it back to the pot with any juices that are clinging to it we're going to give it a stir and then we're going to add our fresh rosemary hopefully from your own garden sir that a little bit wooden spoons are great for this tiny bang then we're going to add our wine get about a half a cup of some nice white wine here and add it in I'll go ahead give it another slug what the heck and now we're going to let it cook down it's going to take several minutes and when you see that the liquid has cooked down about half will be ready for the next step oh the aroma mmm too bad we don't have smell a video at Linda's Italian table you can see that it has really cooked down and it it almost thickens it doesn't get to be a thick sauce but it does stick in a little bit and all of that liquid just becomes a little bit thicker adhering to the vegetables and meat and now we're going to add these beautiful green peas what a luscious color love peace and in the summertime is to do this fish maybe you can get some nice fresh piece after we add our piece we're going to add two tablespoons of butter and that's going to give us a really nice velvety soft for our bow tie pasta or farfalle as the Italians call it and we're going to melt that in and we're going to cook this sauce with the lamb and the pea for about five minutes more okay we cooked in our butter and now we're ready to add some Parmesan cheese we're going to stir that in just incorporate it and now for the kicker the juice of half of a lemon and please use fresh lemon juice for this and not that nasty stuff

have graded and ricotta salata is really great on this dish just sprinkle that over the top the beautiful cheese and a little fresh mint which is great with the lamb and last but not least a little drizzle of extra virgin olive oil just a little bit give it some extra flavor and there you have it it doesn't get any easier here's our dish bowtie pasta with lamb and tea isn't it beautiful powerful sanli come visit again at Linda's Italian table you", "JlTFpKEF0-M": "okay hi everyone I'm happy that you join my show please like share and subscribe hopefully you'll like what I have to say in this video okay so first I want to start off with my makeup I know if seeing inside should makeup on but I like to keep it more natural so I just use a little bit of makeup to kind of inhibiting and actually look like I have more makeup on when I put it on but it looks like less on the screen so what I have on is kind of like a coral orangish blush today I noticed that oranges and corals go really well with my complexion you guys should branch out a little bit into that color using that color a little bit more over pink or blush blushes and stuff like that you know the coral coral is a nice color to use on I put a gloss to different clauses this one is a color lip gloss from Sephora I can make a manam what's the color of it now it's called shimmering coral so this has a light color tint to it and then this one is from Milani this is called coral crush so I just put these two colors on I put maybe like I think I put like a lip balm on before I put this on and then I put this on top so just wanted to let you know coral is a really nice warm color for the fall and actually fall spring summer is a really really nice color and then on my eyes I have a orangey color eye shadow that's from black opal all of these things you can get all of these colors if you get your local department store aside from the Sephora you know you have to get the Sephora lip colors at Sephora and please actually I should try this because a lot of sephora's lip glosses and makeups are really really nice if you want to get just like a basic palette just to have something sometimes it's all about the color and cream I love these I have this and maybe a two different shades of red which is like a pinkish red or I can't not pinkish right it's kind of like um it kind of reminds me of cherries like a cherry red and then I have one that's like a deeper red but not deep like a burgundy it's not like a burgundy red all right so that's what I wanted to show you one the colors if you happen to like these earrings I got them at forever 21 I had this sweater from before and I thought that this triple color earring will go great with this sweater when I bought it so this video is about weight loss and body shapers now I've grown up you know seeing my mother where it's kind of like those would he call it the corset kind of body shape is just the way that every day going to work and now she more or less she doesn't have a stomach for me she said that was what really helps her to try her stomach so when I was younger I used to wear the body shaper is off and on but most of some Road weather the leotard looking one so the one that's I thought that looks like a leotard may see but it holds your entire midsection and so when people who are about Apple body shape they have a tendency you know the way it tends to go up more to their tummy inside of your arms so in order for you to control that you should wear a body shaper on a regular basis just to keep the shape of your midsection as much as possible so the leotard ones are good to wear every single day under your circle and so were going to school just every day where you should put something like that on that keeps you firm that helps fit your posture it helps to keep your stomach more in in comparison to you know your chest and stomach ratio you want to keep your stomach in and you know in comparison to the two areas so um with body shapers I'm going to show you I'm gonna actually start it now it started is really for 2019 my resolution for 2019 but with the resolutions I try to start months and invent so I can get my mind kind of geared up to losing weight so this is the latest body shaper that I have I have different ones but this one I really really like I just got it maybe about I want to say about two weeks ago and it's kind of it's a full body shaper so what it does is it holds your upper arm in which is why I got this one is because I love this both the upper arm in then in the top portion right up here it pulls your breast center so this part on the side looks like a little flap that comes on the side this will push it like your side breast more so that it can be more centered and then in the middle this is stretchy and it's kind of comfortable it's a little is definitely tight in the middle but that's what I wanted is that one of my stomach's it'd be pulled in so it so has like that traditional points that phoning now this is not this one I would wear outside but I'm not gonna wear it outside for now this is just gonna be used more like a shaper that I will wear in house every day I wear this every single day for a minimum one hour if I'm gonna be here longer be in my home and be home longer rather I would wear this much longer than hour so for example if I eat breakfast I wake up in the morning I eat breakfast let's say it's a Saturday something walks and I say okay I don't have any plans that much plans later maybe is gonna be a upkeep date some people have that I have people I want I want my sweater no anyway you might have a day where you say okay I'm gonna paint my nails my toenails I'm gonna do a face mask you know maybe tie my hair and do all of those things so you know you're gonna have like a full day like that of things that you want to do so just get yourself ready for the week that could be a good day for you to wear your body shaper because you're gonna be moving around you're gonna be in the house doing a lot of different things so if you keep it on the longer you keep it on the more you can shape your body now for the arms I didn't get it yet go get it there's our arm shaper so they have a shaper that comes all the way up and it holds and so like let's say you have areas that are not firm and in your arms or wherever else if you know if your Apple body type a lot of times you may have point in your arms but you want to smooth it in and bring it in I feel like those arms are really good for that having this shaper that I just showed you it was from fit I think it's called that ve D et te is the brand I'm not one of those people that that are committed to one brand I kind of look at the functionality and my main thing is is it gonna hold my midsection in indivisibly if I could get something to hold my arms it so every day every single day for at least an hour I'm gonna put the shaper on I'm gonna do that every single day from now until forever because there's gonna be anything that I do in regards to weight loss and things like that is kind of in in gear of a life lifestyle change so it's not something that I'm saying I'm only gonna do it for a month and then I'm gonna stop it's gonna be like this I'm gonna wear every single day for a minimum of an hour for the rest of my life this is a lake I'm never gonna stop once I start this it's gonna be a everyday thing look at a waist trainer let's not over waist trainers because I have a whole bunch of waist trainers too now the waist trainers I'll also wear those around the house also so usually I don't wear any of these things to the children the only thing I do in terms of work you know like I don't work out as much as I used to I'm starting to get back into our work workout routine so one thing I tell you is that I do workout every single week I try to see if I can work out at least three times a week for hour each time no less than 30 minutes so I'll work out anywhere between 30 minutes an hour and most right now at most three times a week with the goal of trying to work out five times a week now I'm not gonna overdo it I'm gonna do basic things like walking my aerobics DVDs I'll do those and if I don't get to do those two things what I'll do is these are the things that I got this from another youtuber I can't remember his name right now but he said that you know in terms of losing weight he said that there's so many things that you can do but if you do these four things on a regular basis this will shape your body and help you to look a little bit better like more proportional number one planks so I'll be doing planks every single day I'll be doing push-ups every single day I'm going to do arm and back exercises which will to include mainly light weights my own body weight and resistance bands so the resistance bands are really really good for upper body training or upper body strength because it builds muscle but it also leans the muscle out when you use the Willetts it kind of books the muscle up first so it takes it you might get bigger before you get smaller when you use the weights but to avoid that from and then you have to mix it up with a cardio so if you do cardio for like an hour whether that's walking just make sure it's like it's a little more intense than a casual walk so you're gonna do something that's gonna be a brisk walk so that you can sweat or you're gonna do like an integral thing where you're gonna walk for a little while jog for a little while maybe it will if you're able to do a sprint like you know I think that's called interval training you have to kind of trick your body until lose that way so the kids that you have to sweat you have to be active and you can't just choose one thing some people say oh I'm only gonna do cardio yeah cardio burns the fat but if you want to shape your body you have to put weight behind it so you have to build muscle and the only way you can build muscle is by either one weight training if you want to build nice lean muscle if you want to build up a muscle you gotta put weight on it and if you're just trying to burn out fat and lean out of area I feel like there were systems are very very good for that so for our arms I noticed like when I use the resistance bands it definitely helps to bring in the arm weight down now for the stomach if you want to lean stomach and a lean arm back the best thing to do is body training meaning them you're doing planks to do a front from planks back leg side planks after you warm it up then you can do like this called the suction technique where you push to hold and you pull your stomach in I hate to wrong crunches I hate doing stomach work but I'll still do it anyway it's just that I'm gonna let you know for me I don't like to do it intensely so if I gonna do my leg lifts or I'm doing crunches or sit-ups or different kind of exercises you know we call it the cyst I don't know the quality scissor for that but if you're doing all those things that will help to bring your stomach weight down do not put weight on it because weights will build up the muscles so you kind of have to train it in with the waist trainer as well as do like planks every single day like you have the planks that will definitely help lean your back your stomach your upper back your lower stomach everything so that's easy right you could do that before you go to bed you go to that when you wake up in the morning if you have time in the middle you're watching your favorite show then you can't just you know on a commercial break do a plank for as long as you can and that's it so in between like if I'm watching my show in-between those breaks I might just get up and just do planks in the middle so I just do it throughout the day and that's it I don't choose one thing I use the waist trainers I use the body shapers I have leggings that you know you have your leggings and then after you have the shapewear at the top that holds the upper stomach in when you're an apple shape you can never ever ever let your stomach go ever if you want to fit into any clothes you have to always keep your stomach your midsection your back snatched in as much as possible and then I'll talk to you about diet and what I do diet wise I'm never on the diet let's put it that way so now you know don't don't hold yourself look at your body and ask yourself what part of your body do you want to come in what area do you want coming out you know that if your apple shape you're never really gonna have my hourglass shape but you want to try to bring it in as much as you can so yeah that's pretty much it so that's something when you hit well you hit adulthood as a woman I'm saying as soon as you pay 18 just like you're a broad that you wear every single day you have to train your body every single day because when you get older your body's going to change they call it they call it the middle-age spread you're going to start to spread out so when you're 20 you know how you have that little cue kind of shaped like everything is in I know you're gonna become an adult and get older but if you want to retain that more a little like shape or have it more in have everything more snatch then or more shape then you have to have to have body shapers or you have to have different kinds you have to have the legging kind that just holds everything and compresses everything you have to everyone that pulls your stomach in if you want to shape you but you have to have the budget shape if you want to get your arm arms and you have to get arm shapers I'm at a point now that I'm probably gonna have the arm shapers on it every night asleep with the arm shapers every single night until summertime comes around hopefully that will bring my arm and make it more sleek and make it more slim I'm gonna tell you my goal is not to be slim I just want to be within an average range I feel confident in certain clothes that I wear now feel like oh I have to cover up all the time I want to say okay I have a choice if I feel like covering up but I want to be a little more sexy but something a little more fitted on then I want to be able to do that so let me tell you some little tips and tricks that I've done in the past few months to either maintain my weight or bring my weight down so personally okay first off in five seven and my weight is over 150 and under to said let's put it that way I don't know exactly the number but I know it's between 180 in 210 right what that said I've more or less been around the same weight since I was in my early 20s I have a gained weight of course you know but that's just in the past year because I have have you been working out as regularly as I have but I'll tell you that if we work out on a regular basis you can mean to at least a minimum maintain weight of not lose weight so for the most part of I have clothes now that I still wear that I still used to wear when I was 20 so I have a lot of clothes and I kissed it still fit in but I can tell you that you know you have to keep on it I noticed that you can't just say oh I'm gonna be this size forever know after a while you need to have to cut calories here move a little bit more hair and that sort of thing so one thing that I do now or I'll show you a few things that I've adopted over the years number one I don't get as much junk food as I used to I used to eat like a lot of chips a lot of mainly a lot of chips he does evade the main thing so you see a lot of a lot of chips so what I did was because I'm not the kind of person that has like a huge issue with sweets like I'm not really a sweet tooth kind of person as you can see one of the my weight loss things right here I have a glass of lemon water if I'm not drinking lemon water I'm drinking water like a lot of time from drinking water another thing that I've added to reduce in calories sugar rather reducing sugar reducing calories is this I know everybody sees this all over the place this apple cider vinegar with the mother in it and they you know this something that you should drink every single day because it does help to reduce bloating it helps to increase in seasoning increase enzymes certain enzymes that your stomach needs and what it's a function so if you have a healthy digestive tract that's like the main thing like one of the main things to have in good weight loss results and just increasing your fruit or vegetable intake don't be afraid of having a lot of foods and a lot of vegetables people try to cut calories on that that is not necessary what you really need to do is cut refined sugars out and white white things that you know are not good for you like sugar like bread white rice I know everybody says that I'm not saying I do that I'm saying that if you know you can stop those things stop what you can stop and reduce what you can reduce I think that people get caught up with oh I'm not gonna have anything at all or you know they're very restrictive I'm not overly restrictive meaning that alright I don't really have a lot of juice but sometimes I get a craving for juice so when I tap that craving sometimes what I'll do is I'll put like maybe this amount of juice down here at the bottom and then I'll fill it up with water just to kind of trick myself like I don't want to take on the full calories of the juice or the full carrot music water so I just put just enough juice for taste now if you feel like oh that's not good for you you get used to it actually like after you drink a lot of water and a lot of lemon water you'll start craving it more and I think that your taste for juice is just gonna die down like that's what happened with me it just kind of died down after a while but then it comes up again after all after you know several weeks or maybe like a month you're like okay I've been drinking water lemon water for so long I want to taste something different so I'm gonna show you what I do to spice up my water right now what I'm going to spice up my water is I'm loving these zero calorie I'm sorry this is not zero calorie these are five calories and this one right here this one is my favorite one this one is zero calories so the Wyler's drinks they sell they sell like two or three flavors that Family Dollar and I buy a lot of they have a lot of great things I found without it I don't think that you should knock it go in there you can find some great things that can help with your diet you can get mixed mixed nuts you can get will you call it trail mixes they have the zero five calorie these are five calories the five category drinks now one of these packets makes two drinks by the way but think about it okay so it's ten calories in the one packet but think about ten calories as opposed to 120 calories and one glass like that's the difference you know you're not get you just chopped off like hundred and ten calories and you could drink this so the flavors that I like you know I don't like sometimes the drit the juice choices to taste a little synthetic I'm like a lemonade iced tea kind of person oh that's another thing aside from all I should show you those teas I'm gonna show you them in a minute what I have I'll show you some of what I have but I have like a whole bunch of different teas that I drink also hot beverages help with curbing hunger hot beverages help with um healing and the digestive issues like les evokes like bad bacteria or have any arm bloating or gas or anything the hotness of the teeth what helps to filter that out sometimes I drink coffee too because it gives you like a diuretic effect so that's another reason why coffee but I don't drink coffee often because it's very dehydrating so sometimes like after I have a cup of coffee whether it's hot or cold I end up drinking like so much water after so I really just don't you know drink a lot of coffee Wow I must admit I have my week it's sort of like sweet things and my weakness is like the starbucks Frappuccino coffee so so that I go that's a Family Dollar I do pick up like one or two from there because I think it's 250 for the big one you know two for five or something like that anyhow get in back city is they have a whole section of sugar free drinks they have Welch's they have they have so many other kinds I can't even tell you have orange flavor grape flavor if you like anything like that like lion punch I saw Hawaiian Punch there but I chose this um this one like this one I got on eBay this one is a cranberry apple so you're not gonna find that flavor there but you or you can find this one this is a peach I see this is one of my favorite ones this is my second favorite one actually so they have this one that's on each I see then they have my first favorite one which is this country time country time pink lemonade and that's my favorite that one tastes really good I recommend that one and then they have this one called strawberry lemonade we should this one I also got from Family Dollar so I have a mix of different flavors in the package because you know open some before and so sometimes I will not go away I just don't like a few go somewhere through a few these are my purse and instead of having juice I just get a big bottle of water and about one juice I'll take this and fill like those tall waters its homeland and then I'll fill it with one of these if I want to you know really drink something but this minds you if I get the tall water and I put this in there that that told water I'm drinking throughout the day with with regular water so yeah I highly recommend that at least cut down on the juice part um now another thing since I was talking about that hey Darla this is just another one of the items I picked up there that you can just munch on so I was looking for sometimes I go you know I wanted something sweet but I don't know what it is when I have like certain treats like it's just way too sweet and um I really had a craving for these banana chips so I didn't buy this at a Family Dollar which I thought that's pretty cool because they do you really search these stories you can find something healthy so I thought these were really really great these are the sweet kind this is not like the planting time so and they also have that there too so if you want to get a regular plantings and you want to get something like this just so you've got something sweet so munch on that's guilt free I think this is great because I don't like bananas but I love try it fruits that's my favorite so a lot of the fruits that I don't eat when they're in their whole state when they're dry like whole like like a banana like a full banana pick that I know is that when they're dried I like them so much more because something about banana I don't know I don't like the taste so the banana chips really helped is nice and like oh I'm getting all the benefits of the banner without the horrible taste so look into that I think I paid $1.99 for that which is a really good buy all right where's my notebook that me some years so in between the process I had some shakes and my first experience with one of the shakes what was um ideal shape I talked about it briefly before but I wanted to get some more of the details of ideal shape so when I started the drinks trying trying the meal replacement drinks ideal shape was not the first one but in terms of like a meal replacement program this was the first one that I tried so let me just first tell you about the flavors they have in the mail replacement they have chocolate vanilla salted caramel mint chocolate chip cookies and cream mocha and then they have like the super super food version of the vanilla and chocolate and then they also have chocolate cream pie so the chocolate cream I don't remember seeing that the last time which sounds really good by the way but anyhow before I tell you how what I thought about everything I'm gonna just tell you the prices and everything so the the meal replacement shakes at original price of $59.99 then they have the bars now the bars they have in blueberry honey roasted almond double chocolate and cinnamon caramel and that original price is 1699 then they also carried chips now that is the cool part about that meal replacement program is that they do have chips and a lot of these newer replacement programs don't have a salt option for people who really have salt cravings over sweet cravings and I thought that that was a great addition to their program because others don't really have that so the flavors they have in the chips they have sour cream and onion barbeque and sweet Thai sweet Thai chili then they also have weight loss drinks those come in a 30 pack and they have that in a pineapple patch in black cherry and I see I think it was a peach I see that they had and okay so I think I said it's $39.99 so those prices are not like out of the ordinary I'm not gonna say they're good at mad I'm a cheapy I like to get I like to get things for the cheapest amount so my whole thing is I'm always looking for a sale I'm always looking for a coupon code I'm always looking for a deal I love getting savings or I could get it for free even that's wonderful so a lot of the drinks right now on sale because they have a carryover for their Cyber Monday or their Black Friday so a lot of these shapes have deals right now and a lot of the prices that I've mentioned to you right now have slashed down significantly except for the parts I think they took off like a dollar or two dollars for the Cyber Monday so I'll tell you what I've tried and I'll show you what I have on oh I don't have anything from the ideal shape sorry I had I originally bought the cookies and cream and no replacement and I did not like it okay so I just want you to know I didn't like it but that is one of their popular one of their very popular shakes is the is the cookies and cream now when I've tried shakes in any in any program or any non specified protein shake program whatever it is the knowledge seems to be like the only one that's consistently good and if you're gonna try any of these things I always say start off with vanilla if you notice that or chocolate because you know a lot of people that chocolate chocolate lovers and so because they aren't chocolate lovers um you know the chocolate one man may be really good for you also I'm not like a huge chocolate lover lover so vanilla is usually like my goal so even with my when I make coffee I put vanilla I put vanilla every in every flavor because that's my favorite flavor even in hanging that that's my favorite flavor of ice cream so usually that's the one I'll go for because I know most of the time you can mix that with fruits you can mix it well oats if you wanted to put oats in your shape is vanilla is one of those staple flavors that if you mix any fruit or any spice cinnamon nutmeg whatever it goes perfectly with vanilla most of the time chocolate is now always the preferred one you know when it comes to making your smoothies um so I did buy the cookies and cream I went outside the box of my usual flavor I said alright cookies and cream at least there's a cream flavor which is some Nullah so maybe I like it and the cookie is of course you know I like the chocolate is supposed to be a chocolate flavor so I said can they really get this wrong I was like hopefully I don't think so so then I took it with me and you know I took it to class with me or whatever and I tried it and I was like mmm I said I was like to my eyes it looks like cookies and cream because it had that two-tone white and chocolate flavor chocolate mix and I was like okay it looks like he's in cream but when I tasted I said all right don't get caught up in the look taste it and see does this really remind you of cookies and cream and you know every time I think of cookies and cream I always think of like Oreo cookies so more or less I'm looking for like Oreo cookie type taste so I tasted it and that's him mm-hmm I'm really I don't really see I don't taste that I'm not gonna I'm not gonna be fooled I don't really taste that flavor and I had like a texture to me that wasn't inviting wasn't like a shake I didn't feel like oh you know this tastes like a shape to me do I get that shake taste no so I give it you want to know I give it a thumbs down I would say do not try ideal shape in regards to their shakes now with the bars I tried the cinnamon caramel and I liked it I liked it a lot I think the cinnamon caramel bar is really good I have an interest in trying the blueberry one I may try the blueberry one actually in the bars all the flavors sound good to me the double chocolate the honey roasted almond those all sound good but for sure the cinnamon caramel is the one that I've got and that tasted pretty good now the chips I ended up getting two flavors before I think I told everyone that I got the BBQ one that's nothing when I purchased I purchased the sour cream and onion and the SWAT a sweet Thai chili so initially when I tasted the chips I did not like them initially I thought that Iran it reminded me a lot of Pringles that of texture because it's like a potato they use like a potato blend and that potato man is part of their weight loss it's like the key one of the key ingredients to their weight loss program so I must admit the sour cream added at the initial taste did not taste bad better all like it was for a scale of one to ten I'll give it maybe a six you know it was tolerable it did have a sour cream taste it was edible you know it was okay it was like you know because I'm not gonna compare it to chips so many chips on the outside because those things are you know they have oils and salts and other fats and things to make it very savory but the sound cream onion for weight loss item that supposed to suppress your hunger for three hours mind you all of these items are supposed to keep you satiated for up to three hours so if you have one of the bars that's supposed to keep you good for three hours if you loved one of the bags of chips they're supposed to keep your hunger down for three hours the same thing with the shake and everything else they have that even the weight loss drinks are supposed to help with keeping your your girl weight your your appetite kind of suppressed so after my experience with the shake I just threw the shake out like I tried it the first day and then when I put it in the fridge I said oh I didn't finish it I didn't wanna waste it so I said okay I'm gonna put it in the bottle and leave it in the fridge and I'll drink it another day I went after a few days and everything was homogeneous like it was not that two-tone black and white color it became a very thin watery chocolate consistency but not the kind of chocolate that will make you money drink it so I said oh mom I'm done touring this out because I have a candy like this active few days can you imagine what its gonna be like in your system so I said alright I'm done with that so I moved on to another program which was the 310 nutrition system so before I get us a three time let me just wrap up what I was saying about let us stop my hunger for three hours no did I eat more of the snacks that I was supposed to be eating yes I definitely did because I wanted the hunger to stop but I was like well I have one bag of chips this should be it I should be like at the end I should feel my hunger is coming to an end so when I didn't see that happen I said okay let me just have like either another bag of chips or I have one of the bars and I realized within the program I had noticed that I was eating either two bags of chips or two bars or altering alternate lead to of whichever mix and I said why should I have to to stop the hunger when they're saying that you all you need is one and I said no this is not gonna work for me cuz it doesn't make sense to get weight-loss stuff and then eat double of what you're supposed to eat in order to get the effects that they're supposed to get this supposed to be given to you so honestly like no in terms of the hunger killing the hunger I was at high hopes for the snacks and the bars because you know on the run it would be nice to just have one of those in my bag and be like oh I know I don't I won't get tempted by all these unhealthy snacks and I could just take this and be like oh I have my you know my bag of chips or I have my little you know car and I could just eat that until I get home to make a proper meal wherever I'm going I can make a proper meal I eat sit down and eat a healthy meal so yeah that was a that defeated the purpose because of I'm eating double that means I'm gonna end up buying more or finishing or faster and that's pointless right so I said okay you know I was very drawn in by the 310 nutrition program and in the flavors I I had I actually got the starter kit and they actually have it on sale now and it looks like they have even more things in the kit it came in this white bag this mesh bag and it came with like some you know fruit juice mixes like how like kind of like a powdered version of what you would have if we're gonna say if you if you juice your own juice and it had like a little packet powder of like all the things are supposed to be alike if you had juice their own juice and then it came with these two tears like these these actually have three in each but um this one is the peach language I really loved the peach ones I highly I have one of the juices left I thought I finished them all all right I'll show you guys the juice as well so this was a 3/10 juice juice packet that came in the starter kit and it has a lot of people saying or I'll say I went on I want students in my research to find out how people change their juice if they just added it to water and drank it or if they had some other alternative option so with this they were like oh you know just put it in put it in your juice when you make your shake you can put it in with the shake and I was like this just one is gonna taste good if I put it in any of their the flavors that they carry so when you get the kit they're gonna say oh you need to get choose a flavor that you want in a regular size and then after that they give you samples of all the other things that they carry so I haven't even opened it yet they say I have not opened it yet I bought this vanilla 310 shaped package and whether it came other packages which I'll get into that in a minute so yeah so it came with two of these juice blends one I had it tasted pretty good I had it with the salted caramel because I really wanted to see if these shapes will go well with the juice so when I had it with the salted caramel it was a nice taste it was good in terms of flavor taste texture I do like the 310 nutrition better than several shakes that I've tried I've tried other things before because you know when you go to GNC they have their own shapes they they have their vegan shakes and other things so sometimes they have like the sample package so you can just try it and if you like it then you can go get the bigger version you know the family size big version if not then you know at least you've tried it you said okay I like it I don't like it that's that so in terms of the 310 shakes and the taste the taste to me is good I like the taste of the vanilla I did like I liked the taste of the salted caramel and I also liked the taste of the chocolate and they all mix pretty smooth a comes with a 310 shake up within at the top has this little dome kind of thing that you put inside of the cup and that helps to shake up the liquid so that it doesn't it's not like powdery like clumpy clumping up and it works well for that so I've never had any clumping issues and I also put other shakes in that mixer and it actually mixes up other Carter shakes pretty well so don't hold back on getting the shaker if you need a good shaker yeah cup it's a good cup to have so this is good to mix with any of your smoothies the tears they come in a regular flavor which I still have two bags left there are three bags in each of these packets this one is the original it's a 310 silliman detox tea both of them are detox teas and they have a pleasant taste so it supports weight loss helps promote digestion and appetite control so all their items have appetite control which is great which is really really great and I recommend the peach one it tastes really really good both taste good you can't go wrong the peach they both run out quickly when they had this sale and I'll try to get more of the peach one it was sold out so I have one to have one or two bags in there don't have two bags in each because I remember just happened just two cups of tea because I tried one 101 separately and it has like a lot of first of all has a less than 1 carbonate so it's not even one card and and one thing one package once he bag it has green tea oolong tea mate leaf I don't know what I'm saying this right Rubio so room boasts I know that's very very good for you in terms of detox and punishing body needs ginger pomegranate juice birch stevia piranha cornflour I don't know that the cornflour is but okay dum Domini aliens and natural peach flavor I highly recommend these tears in terms of appetite control and taste you have you don't have to add any sugar if you want I think at one point I did use half of a lemon and in the tea just to give it more of a citrus taste it's already sweet and you don't need to add anything if you want to give it a little extra something natural to it you can add the lemon juice so that's what I just got a half a lemon cut it up into two and squeeze that to the one half lemon it also came with this promotional card so when I make a purchase anything from them them again I can get $10 off I actually got it I think I've got two of these cards so each time each time I buy I have two opportunities to get $10 off now furthermore I got the the mixes the juice mixes that you have my car I had with the Beiler's oMG those are really good um those definitely stop your hunger for sure like I wanna have those juices I feel satisfied and they taste so good like I don't know to me they taste really good and I don't really um go for my kidney blueberry you know they have blueberry lemonade or raspberry lemonade or they have like those blends that they have that goal with a lemonade or iced tea I usually don't like those flavors if I goes to the store and I get an iced tea I usually stick to a lemon or peach or green tea like that's it any of those other synthetic sour flavors I've never liked the taste of them and I know kind of a problem so this was a nice change because I actually had the drinks that they have at the treats and nutrition the treats and mixes on the drinks are very good so if you really want to try like a drink that doesn't have a lot of sugar that gives you an energy boost that has a detox effect that um is low calorie I highly highly recommend the drinks day they have a lot of flavors now I took up with the list here they have lemonade watermelon lemonade berry lemonade pineapple mango strawberry lemonade cherry lime peach punch I want to try that peach punch one raspberry lemonade and blackberry lemonade all those lemonade ones are good I even I had in the pack I think I had gotten the blackberry lemonade the regular lemonade and I think it was maybe the very very lemonade no no wait raspberry sorry so I've gotten the lemonade raspberry lemonade and the blackberry lemonade and all those work very nice and you just added to your water stops the hunger tastes good that's a goal all right now in the pack they give you all the other flavors that they carry so I come to all these caps I had a total of six packages one which was vanilla so I had the vanilla one already and I told you I had the salted caramel so I didn't try the other flavors I didn't try the motor they have mocha they had oh I had chocolate - so own online and that's  chocolate I don't try it the chocolate flavors yet strawberry now everyone says the strawberry one is the worst tasting wine I'm a sure this one soon just to let you guys know what it tastes like but the majority the people who tried the recent shake they said that the strawberry was their least favorite one then vanilla chai so the top flavor salted caramel all the commentators that said anything they said salted caramel is their favorite flavor salted caramel is a little bit sweeter than the vanilla so if you have a sweet tooth you may want the salted caramel you love caramel and you want something sweeter that's gonna you know kind of you know give you like a sweet treat um yeah the salted caramel was good I'll tell you it tastes it tastes pretty good so you should try that one the vanilla was also very good if your vanilla question chocolate I'm not sure yeah I'm have to update you guys on the chocolate so I thought it for I think I've paid I don't think it I think it was like $50 give or take you know mainly mainly a little bit more out of $50 or between 50 and 60 I think I paid for all of this stuff including the full bag of the shape the full vanilla shade as well as all these samples that they give my thing for $60 that's a pretty pretty a pretty good price because normally their shapes are in the hundreds when you get like the whole package that we like 100 is something for the whole package so I would say try some try this see what you like what you don't like and then when you go back to 310 you can say okay I want this and I want that so with that said on ideal shape I would try the chips again maybe maybe and I would probably try the bars again because they weren't too sweet the texture was not sort like a sawdust you know something like that saw this kind of texture it didn't have that so I probably try that again with the ideal shape but the odds of me trying that again are slim I'm probably not going to try any of those again because my whole point is that I wanted to stop the hunger I wanted appetite it was something that was gonna kind of suppress my appetite the three ten drinks I'm definitely definitely getting those and the drinks again the mixed drinks again because the Wyler's you know it's okay but it's a little bit synthetic but at the same time like I know it's reducing calories and there's not something that I'm drinking every single day so I do not recommend that stuff that you know that's like this well you know there's no real nutritional content this is this is specifically for reducing calories but with the 310 you're getting so much more because you getting the calorie reduction as well as the appetite suppressant so it's like boom like you know if you're hungry or maybe thirsty but you think you're hungry but you don't feel up to eating the three the three ten the three ten I would recommend that and some does you want a beverage you get and you don't feel like eating but you really want you feel like the hungers coming on this will stop that hunger from coming on completely and hydrate you at the same time it also has nutritional benefits so yeah alright so that's mainly the two cents of shake programs that I went through now I'm going to talk about these two shakes that I've tried let me start off with the one that I did not like at all like I don't like it and have a lot of the shakes because I got a huge case thinking that it would have a better taste but I have to tell you this if you end up buying it right and you don't like it the only way you can really make it more palatable is if you add like some kind of artificial sweetener or honey or something like that you can add honey to add equal or whatever you you like I don't know not everyone likes equal some people like Splenda or stevia or something else I personally like equal the most so I will probably use equal and actually instead of using sugar a lot for certain things so sometimes I do like in my spaghetti sauce I like it to be a little bit sweeter so I'll put like maybe one or two packets of equal when I make it for me not for other people and I make it for other people I just make it straight but for me because I like a little bit of a sweeter taste I'll add like a packet of equal to just you know make it seem like this tomato sauce is a little bit sweeter so with this you can doctor it by adding fruits if you want if you have frozen fruits at home you can make this shake work with frozen fruits but I do not this is not one of those shades you can just grab and go because you're not gonna like the taste there's something that you have to mix into a smoothie of your choice if you have mango something like a sweet fruit get a sweet fruit like cherries like frozen cherries frozen blueberries or frozen mangoes like something like that well you know it's gonna be real sweet when you put it and see smoothie so that you're not gonna notice that the vanilla is not that tasty so this is the brand now this one is supposed to be organic so it has 150 calories gluten free premier is called premier protein that's the brand from your protein and this is the organic vanilla so they had regular vanilla but I want to do organic warm because you know I'm thinking it's gonna be a little bit better and it also says naturally flavored so I'm like okay it's organic it's naturally flavored can they really go wrong with vanilla I was like no it says no artificial sweeteners flavors or colors so they're not paying anything in here to really doctor it up the truth is that this does have nine total carbons is nine and the proteins are 25 so this is inadmissible to be there oh yes another reason why I got do I get this one choice because it has 25 grams of protein so like if you let's say you want it you don't want to eat something for dinner this is like something I will take other for a dinner or for breakfast this is not something that you know about and then I'm gonna be in home so just make sure you have if you get this one this premier protein it's good because it is organic naturally flavor it has 25 grams it's a low carb and this is something that you could just mix with your fruits and be happy you'll be happy that you did that okay but this other one is though is the one that I like the most and I got this in two flavors I got it in french vanilla and I got it in a cafe caramel now the cafe caramel because I like my coffee every now and then I got that as okay let me get the let me get the caramel first I actually started off with the cafe caramel and it was good it tastes it tastes okay it's not bad it's okay it's not gonna be like a Starbucks or Dunkin or anything like that but for something that's already in a ready-made bottle it's pretty good and this one is the one I like the most this one is french vanilla so it's the same singing Catherine it's like the cafe caramel but just french vanilla and I and I really love this one the most now this one is good for anything sometimes I just hate but this in my smoothie with ice I'll put it in my nutribullet and put the ice maybe I'll put a little bit more vanilla I'll put this and then I'll put the whipped cream on top and I'll make it into a treat now mind you whipped cream is low calorie low calorie low low carb very very low carb so don't feel like if you have whipped cream that that's like one of those guilty treats that aren't guilty so you know whipped cream makes everything seem better so even when I make my coffee I mean I add sugar to it or if I add sugars are gonna be a very small amount but I consider that a treat like my coffee if I have like I make my own like latte version when I put the whipped cream on top and it makes you feel so much happier to drink it because you know exactly how much sugar is in there you know how much flavor is in there you know that even though it tastes like a tree is not heavy and sugar so I recommend this this is good for on the go if you keep it like really ice cold in your fridge you know you're going somewhere you know you're gonna come out you go put it in here in your freezer for hour to make it real cold put it in your bag you know you're going somewhere someone's house somewhere else and you know you may not eat you might be busier on the run doing something but at least you have this in your bag so some other tricks that I do on top of that is if I know that I'm gonna be out for a long period of time I always have certain things in my purse I always have um some kind of nut I don't have cash to use or pistachios or some kind of easy nut that I could just open up and eat nuts always nuts or trail mixes in my bag um something like the banana chips are something I could put in a ziploc throw it in my purse so that I don't have a urge to get junk food like I will know I will never I'm one of those people that when I go out I will search for a place that carries soups salads or some kind of healthy something some kind of healthy option when I go to McDonald's I'll be like this let me get a salad or I'll get a salad and water a salad and it's heat from McDonald's you guys listen don't fast-food is not a bad word it's just about when you go to these fast-food places you have to be disciplined enough to say hey I'm not going to eat the cheeseburger I'm going to get it okay they have salads here or if they have like a snack wrap if you get a snack wrap no ranch sauce whatever like you know you got to cut it somewhere and I'm gonna be missing it the rack because that chicken is no good okay that's not equal real chicken is better for you to get your own tortillas get your own your own chicken breasts and make your own chicken fillets put your own salad put them on whatever you want to put in there and boom you're good so you could make your own wraps by getting just the chicken breasts yourself and and making the chicken cutlets and put your own veggies whatever veggies you like and see a wrap wrap it up and take it to go I do not recommend you eat those wraps from any of those factual places because something's wrong with it is there anything else alright so I shall show you the trail mix and there's another trail mix we didn't find this one learn about this one maybe I bought this at arm writing so this is nutrition track of planter's it says cashews cranberries banana chips pistachios and it's such a sea salt this is something like you have a big purse you can just pull this is not happy it's not having if you just take this throw this in your purse you go you're good to go you know you don't have any problems they have other mommies and the bags take this and a mom you store it in the back if you want to get pita chips if you if you're ambitious and enough it good enough with the cooking that you can make your own pita chips do that if we get Stacie's you put some Stacey's in in a ziploc and throw it in the bag I think that bring our own snacks has helped me so much from making the wrong choice when I go out go to any store I'm usually when I pick up beverages I'm usually picking up water that's it water what I don't care what brand it is it could be the store brand it can be essential it does not matter because it even if I'm a little bit of money on me I will get water still I'll get the name brandy who only gonna write it they have and I like that water too it's called crystal crystal lakes i think it's called crystal lake water and it's a tall bottle of water like this and that's one dollar for that no excuses no excuse if you get that for one dollar you get the big tall bottle of Crystal Lake water and you get this at the Family Dollar from one dollar that's two dollars you're saving and you're saving calories and you're saving money okay so definitely can't go wrong with that and I think I don't know if I mentioned this the apple cider vinegar apple cider vinegar you should be drinking this every single day now I don't like the taste of it and I know a lot of people have talked about the taste is not the greatest so I just do it like a regular drink I'll get my water I'll put the ice I'll probably take like maybe two capfuls of this and put it in the water and just sip on it that is it and I don't think anyone should say oh I'm gonna have like a whole bunch of this Apple a whole bunch of this apple cider vinegar every single day does not make sense just take some every single day after a while your taste buds will get used to and then you'll be able to decide if you can add a little bit more or whatever it is that you need to add now the apple cider vinegar thing I do once in a while I don't have a set time sometimes I'll do it in the morning on an empty stomach I may do it in the morning if or at night time on an empty stomach I don't know I just like I feel like much better when I do it on an empty stomach so I thought like some a glass at night or a glass in the morning on an empty stomach and in the morning it kind of like there's like a light flush on your body now this shape I highly recommend that now if you know like diabetes diabetes runs in my family and you know you have to really work on having less sugar less refined sugar so it really means if you can start off with trying to reduce your junk food that's a good story now try to reduce the junk food or eliminate junk foods when I first started with weight management I called it kinda like all the weight loss but managing my weight when I was younger I would have like a series of sweet things that I liked I had a series of salty things that I like and over time what I did was I said okay what let's say there were 10 things that I liked I would say okay um these three things I really really really like out of the ten things so I would eliminate the seven things and say okay these three treats are the only treats I can get if I really wanted something sweet or I only get these three things and I was cool with that because those are like my three favorite things now same thing with with uh chips or salty crunchy snacks whatever sometimes I will get vegetables and then I'll have it with like a dressing that I really like you know I'll do that for awhile and if that doesn't work you know if I really feel like a craving for some something snacky sometimes I'll have like crackers and crackers and cheese or like something really simple it doesn't have a lot of spices or a lot of preservatives so you have to remember your body's working all the time to get those things out of your system so anything I'm trying to pick up I wanted to be as clean as possible so I feel like if you get a nice cracker a nice cheese or something you can eat that as a snack instead of like you know some fatty potato chips or something so not a rule like if I wanted treat say let's say I had a crazy and that's actually a rule of mine now in a way like if I really really want to treat now I'm up to the next level that healthy healthy options of snacks that's where I'm at now so I've pulled back over the chips so I have a once in a blue instead I'll get you know something like this if I have no craving for anything then I'll get something like this or I'll get you get like the you know sea salt head not so whatever it is and that's good for me and then ever I have a craving like no you're sure I'm craving for any type of potato chips when I go or if snacks I'll go sort of store my rule is this it's one sweet thing one salty thing that's it that's if I have a craving for both I'm not going in there and getting like a whole bunch of different things but I said right I want something sweet maybe I don't know I'm just doing this out of my head maybe I'll get a peanut chew and some kind of salty chip and I'm on there I'm not getting a whole bunch of chips or a whole bunch of sweet things and that's the thing it's like that's where you have to curb it's not all or nothing thing just say to yourself okay before you used to get ten sweet things or ten salty things you know just so I wasn't doing that much but you know you do ten sweet things ten salty things they say it's alright cool I'm gonna now cut my list in half now that I've made a list of these ten treats that I really love now I'm going to reduce it to five or three or whatever your number is and you work on that for as long as you can until you're ready to reduce it even more now I'm at a point where I'm like okay I'm not really into sweets like that I know that so I try to avoid it but if I do have a sweet craving like I said I get the sweet fruits or sweet dried fruits or whatever or this thing that I'm about to show you right now which is from the dock his name is dr. Burke dr. Burke's shake it's like a chocolate shake and it tastes really good really decadent like this is the whole point of this it has um MCMC teas and BCAAs it has zero sugar it has eleven proteins and has four grams of MC MCTS MCTS are derived from coconuts Brett a coconut branch chain amino acid and BCAA is derived from pea protein so in a nutshell this shake is like it's a meal replacement shake so like let's say at night don't either line but also you want a tree like you know I want dessert but also I want to eat but you may be in one of those moves like oh I don't want to cook or anything like that and I want to take something that's gonna be good for me and that's going to satiate my hunger and all that great stuff and still feel like a treat this is this is actually so good now you can use this in two ways you can use it as a meal replacement and you can use it as a shape after a meal if you have a healthy keto meal like let's say because I'm trying to work on being so lean more towards a keto diet I think that would be perfect for me I don't know about other people but I do think like just having like some little protein and some vegetables it's good or or whole Whole Foods pretty much they doesn't matter that's where my diet is right now so well having all foods that come from the earth and also kind of having more of that you know the proteins and the and the vegetables right so you have to think of that and you have to keep it lean like I know this I don't like a lot of meat and I don't like big pieces of meat so chicken breast is pretty much good for me if I go out and I get some kind of chicken breast that's the best because I can you know make it thin I can you know chop it up in my salad about if I make you make any kind of chicken breast bacon chicken breast I can you know if you have an air fryer you can put it in the air fryer then do that if you have a slow cooker depending on what you want to make chicken breasts can be doing so many things it's just that it depends on how you prepare it I mean if you have a tenderizer you can make it thin as possible chicken breasts can last so much more and it will be more palatable in salads and that's what a day so anyhow and soups are really wearing tool for that because you have most soups have a lot of vegetables in it as well as maybe you could get turkey have a little a little protein if you have chili you could get the canned chili and you can cut up all your you could cut up all your favorite vegetable and things like that add to the chili to make it a little more hearty and just you gotta be creative you know those are just some ideas that I'm sharing with you guys but if you add this if you add this shape to your diet this could be a great addition to your diet in terms of keeping sugar low so if you want to have a night time like a night time tree or a nighttime meal because I'm one of those people that I stay up late and because I stay up late sometimes I I get hungry late night but I'm still concerned about my weight so I don't want to end up munching on things that I don't want to munch on so you might have like a bag of pistachios or something to eat some like something like that some statues or like a small bag of pistachios and maybe some junk like this you mix this with almond milk or whatever milk you prefer I use the almond milk when I make my neck smoothies a lot of the time like something like this I'll use only milk or I'll use water that's it this is good either way I'll people he says in the back it says dr. Berg's meal replacement shake was uniquely designed as a delicious creamy chocolate brownie shake with the perfect combination of vegan protein and healthy fats with no added sugars so I'm gonna read the rest in a minute I'm gonna tell you like out of all the shakes that I've had between the Atkins the the premier protein all these shakes that I'm telling you about now out of all these shakes even the 310 right I'll never stop using this one this is a staple because if you have if you know in your family that you have diabetes or your doctors telling you that you have to reduce your sugar levels if you have this the gene for diabetes if you have any kind of insulin resistance this is the best thing that you can get and I'm telling you like if you want that sweet treat believe me you will feel so happy to drink this because it actually tastes really freakin good like really good it tastes better than all these shakes that I mentioned it tastes the best it holds my hunger down I mean like when I was drinking it I was loving it loving loving loving this and I will have this so I knew I was gonna be up late night I will have this and I'm good like I didn't feel like I wanted more of anything after I had this I felt completely satisfied with my system my body really really liked this arm doctor  now I'm gonna tell you it does cost about $50 especially if you get it from him forget about his direct website it's like it's gonna take some time and he does I don't remember him having any sales on his site so you're gonna end up paying full price for this if you can find it find it another way and get it for a cheaper price that's good but I think out of all of these shapes that you can have just just in terms of health and reducing sugar right and 11 grams of protein isn't bad but I mean if you want more protein so really hold you down this has 25 grams of protein but I can tell you based off of how I felt drinking this the taste the taste the texture the way it made me feel this this is a spot on my god I've got to get this I wish I could just go to the store and just pick this up and I wish they had this make sure they sold this I get a chance II or um a vitamin shop I might actually check and see it um if they do have this and even one of those places if they do I'll let you know but yes this right here is a must I think out of every shake that I mentioned if you get this shape you're gonna be happy with how you feel after you have well right um and water water water I think that's pretty much it I know I was gonna talk to you about some teas since I remembered I'll just get a couple of teas that I have here that I told my sister about this teacher she was drinking it for a little while also I um but now she stopped but we both were drinking I got her a pepper I took her panic that's a girl backpack because she was really drinking it so this one is called so be though the herbal oh it has it's a detox tea with caffeine so it has organic green tea based holy basil experiment rosehips the lemon myrtle linden blossoms and ginger root so this helps to detox so like let's say you don't want to do is check it not that hungry or maybe you feel like you don't want to get bloated or you know have like a lotta gas in your system or something like if you didn't eat that much you know sort of you don't eat that much then sometimes your stomach feels a little bit bloated or whatever but so you want to drink something hot to kind of flush your system or even in the holidays you have you know you're eating all these different foods that you probably normally don't eat all year round that can cause weight can cause you know issues so this detox tea is really good I like that it was okay it did help with my stomach but the flat tummy tea definitely helps like you I have I have that something I don't know where I put it but the flat time you see it definitely helps and if you do both together like you do the detox at night and then you do the activation in the morning you will see that your stomach will go down for sure like I haven't I wasn't even on top of it but if you stay on top of it and you do it every day or every other day like regularly you will definitely see some great results with the flat tummies heat the detox tea I'm gonna tell you like it tastes good in terms of detox I'll be honest I did not drink it every single day I just drink it here and there like if I feel like my system needs a little cleanup then I may drink it um Caribbean people they drink Sarah seola so my background is from the islands so Sarah C is supposed to wash your system out but if I don't do like a Sarah C maybe a in a quick run I'll get this detox tea and this will help kind of like do like a mini flush or my system now I also have this I know a lot of people don't talk about this one there's a beautiful is called beautifully bamboo its bamboo C and bamboo tea is good for your skin it's good for elasticity if the skin is it has silica so a lot of people they take silica through vitamin supplementation it kind of looks like a dick kind of looks like a sulfur ish kind of color like white like pure white powder but this is a more natural way of taking it in it's from bamboo the bamboo tea and all you do is just you know add it to water it says here silica is a mineral that is said to promote healthy hair skin and nails place teabag into hot water stick for several minutes allow what it's a cool before a joining so yeah like I just used this for this drink this tea mainly for like hair skin nails that's it mainly my skin and mainly my hair I guess for the most part so this will increase the elasticity the firmness the youthfulness of your skin you can use it topically also but these tea bags are pretty pricey in my opinion they're a little bit pricey so I would say just use it for drinking if you have if you have the money to buy this tea I'm a regular I don't know how much does he cost right now can I remember I know just you know what look it up they have a site they have a beautifully bamboo website which is I think where I bought this from if not maybe I put it from somewhere else why I'm pretty sure water from there excuse me so if you want to just work on one day you just want to have a tea just to help with enhancing your skin your hair and everything this is very good for that I start from then then I have to see where where tea or pour hot tea I'm not sure if I'm saying it right but I think I spelled pu e rh and then ta do the google search and we'll go find the right TV you want you to the google search and on that's he makes me feel good overall so like you know sometimes you might wake up and you don't feel 100% maybe you just feel just out of balance like your Energy's off balance or maybe you feel maybe a little bit nauseous or something like that right that poor where's he is like a wellness key for your entire body that's my top tea like if I want to drink it see every single day that is the tea I will go for because that makes you feel good first and that first thing in the morning like if you don't want to have coffee which you want to pick me up but like on the weekend you know like let's say you drink coffee or week but then on the weekend um you're like oh I want to pick me a battle wanna drink I don't want to drink coffee the best thing for you to do is drink the the just gives you like this energy boots like accent so aside from the quantity then I'll take chamomile tea which I have here in this bag it doesn't matter you could get whatever to you mom but I have it in this bag here this contains antioxidants essential oils and other vital nutrients that support full body health and wellness a lot of people drink chamomile tea and at night to calm their calm their nerves come to their senses to help them go to sleep so sometimes I'll drink the can I just like the taste of kab you'll see there's like a citrus like a citrusy taste in the chamomile tea that tastes really good to me dandelion tea is also good but I don't have any dandelion seed but if you want to try dandelion tea that is a good tea to try so can chamomile chamomile tea for short so out of all these teas I think all these Caesar will are great teas for you to try you just try any of the other teas that just have a flavor this is what it looks like I'm yelling to smell anything yeah so I hope that you know the recommendations that I made will help you towards a healthier lifestyle and it's not about it's not about feeling like you're in a diet it's not about restricting if you have a sweet tooth all I can say is forget about sweets get like a bag of of I don't know whatever you can you like and put a few pieces of candy and and call it a day forget about cakes forget about cookies forget about all that that's dust shouldn't even be in your vocabulary that should those those things should not be in your vocabulary unless you are making it yourself and you know exactly what ingredients are being used if you know you're putting your own skin all right sorry about that everyone whatever it whatever you're making that's a treat make sure you know exactly what you're putting in there how much sugar you use and how much of the quote unquote not-so-great things that are for your body that are not so great for your body make sure that you're able to monitor how much of that you're consuming I'll world this is just this is just gonna be a start off of my my I don't want to call it a weight-loss journey and we'll call it my my upgrade to healthier living right let's just call it that those upgrades healthier living so these are all these things I mentioned to you I'm going to I'm going to implement majority of these things the main thing I'm gonna talk to you guys about is my experience with weight training on waist waist training with the body shapers waist trainers body shapers any success I've had with any of my diet changes ever I realized that my stomach was getting smaller or whatever it is I will be doing the push-ups every single day planks every single day and squats that's what I tell you there was this Rhodesia those are the three main exercises that he was saying in order to shape your muscles and give your body or overall good luck to work all of your muscles pretty much to be able to work all your muscles doing pranks every day if you either try to stay to a minimum you can do it in increments try to do 15 seconds in a plane then 30 then then you know 45-minute I have a timer that helps with that before I used to count in my head I was like you know maybe that's a little bit of a cheating mu so I thought it's a little timer like this that I set for 30 seconds I don't have to think of the time and I could just focus completely on the move and then I don't know once I stop like if I didn't hear that alarm go off in 30 seconds that means that I've done it for less than 30 but then I'll check and see okay I could do it for 20 seconds or whatever it is so I could do it for 20 seconds then on the next time each time you stop I'll get a little bit stronger if I feel motivated of course I'm gonna do a little bit more than those three movements but I'll say first you know if you're really trying to work your body overall I'll say push-ups push-ups to work all the muscles in your arm and in your upper back and your upper to mid back and then to the planks the planks every single day will work every part of your body it works your arms your back sit yes stomach your thighs everything so planks actually strengthen your body overall but try your best to do every single signed of plank from the front the sides the back and the squats get the form right first after you get the form right then build up to how much you how many repetitions you want to do you want to do three reps or something or whatever it is or you just want to get here maximum amount of squats and then do that two or three times then fine but just make sure that you're doing it every day now that's easy you're not going to the gym you're not doing any of that stuff if you don't want to all you're doing is making sure that your planks push-ups it squats regularly and then of course if you can put in some cardio in there to help start off easy and with something that you know you can handle I know for me I don't really like to work out like that I like the effects of working out like I like the good results you get from being in shape and the energy level the energy boost that you get from working out and then also you know your skin just glow so much more when you're sweating and working out so just to go in there and say hey I'm gonna do 30 minutes to 30 minutes until you feel motivated to do more because sometimes when you go to the gym you're like oh I don't even want to go the hard part I realize am I going to the gym is it's getting there like getting to the gym well once I'm at the gym like I'm so motivated by the energy at the gym because everyone is moving around and you like wow look at her body in look how fit he is oh my god let me do this let me do a little bit of that and just that energy just motivates you to do more the hardest part to me about gym work working out is getting there getting to the gym is the hardest part so goal the goal for this week is let's go to the gym let's just go there there's how about just getting there before you think about when I get on the machine you know that when you get on the machine you're on the machine sometimes here doing the 30 minutes on the machine you feel like this extra energy who's he and I walk into another 30 minutes and so yeah and start substituting guys like think about your diet really seriously think about your diet and ask yourself how much how often do you cook per week how often do you make a healthy choice this is something that your body is a machine and you have to treat it with the love you have to shoot it like you love your body you may not be the slimmest person don't look at all these people around you and say oh wow she's such a little frame or she is this kind of figure just think about what are you doing because I'm gonna tell you like when you do the things that that you wanted to accomplish and you feel good about those things you're not gonna worry about oh I'm a size 14 or something or a size I don't know the 30 or whatever it's 20 something right you're not gonna focus so much on arm still a size 24 when I really really want to be a 14 don't look at it that way just look at it what can I do for today what was my what's my weight gonna be for today what's my week what's my my even intake gonna be for today am i taking too much too little calories am I taking too many calories you have to understand that each time like given with me when my metabolism is like all over the place because I've had a lot of times where I didn't eat anything at all there'll be days that I need anything but I'm eating very little and what happens is that when you start putting that little food into your body your body is like oh I don't know when I'm gonna eat again so I have to hold on to this food as a survival mechanism and the first place their body wants to store it is right in your tummy tummy area midsection so a lot of people think that people have extra weight because of just eating a lot part of it is that and part of it is going through the ups and downs of trying not to eat that much and then putting your body in starvation mode and then your body just starts to hold on settle food because they don't know when they're gonna get food again that's like the worst and I think I suffer from that a lot in this is bad so I'll just very you know like try your best to eat just eat when you're hungry eat a moderate amount eat something that you know your body is really gonna utilize because you know your body needs that function each organ needs certain things so you need certain nutrients regularly in order to be healthy to work and function properly some people take Moringa Moringa is not good for everyone you better do the research and and a lot of people swear by my uncle but the truth is that Moringa does not work good for everyone sometimes as far as a problem you know can have an adverse effect on you if it doesn't you know sit sit in your body the right way so you have that to try to get maybe really quality of wheatgrass juice wheatgrass juice wheatgrass juice powder chlorella you don't have to take all these greens all at once just take something that you're like okay I'm getting greens every single day I want it or take up mostly multivitamin that's really good for you I take rainbow-like multivitamins and their they work like in terms of energy and feeling that my body is getting what it needs out of a multivitamin definitely the rainbow lights are good they have it in men's and they have an in women's formula they do have powder options they have part of juice options too you should look at that also they have organic organic vitamins that they have in capsules they have one of these they have a whole bunch of choices on the rainbow light vitamins so I hope that this review this video one is very beneficial to you guys if you like these videos please you know comment and let me know if this information has been helpful useful to you I'm trying to really stick with just talking about the products and sticking to what we're gonna discuss so my future videos I will have some comments on how I'm in tune with this shaper that I showed you guys that's gonna be my primary one the size I have and that is an excel I am going I already ordered the next size which is a large and so what I'm gonna do is wear this XL until it becomes too loose and then when it gets loose and I'll go into the large until I can get into the medium because really I want to see if I could get downside medium yes so that I can you know wear better clothes I mean you want to wear more dresses and look more feminine and all that stuff so you have to try to bring the weight down I noticed that a lot of people you know you try to do all the things that women do that are in more of an average range and it just does not work the same way if you look healthier if you're healthier or you're not you know in a healthy weight range it looks so much better when you do the nice dresses and the hair and the makeup and everything because it looks like you're more put together but when you have the extra weight it looks like okay you're doing all these things topically you know to kind of to get away from maybe the weight nothing that we can't be happy at I'm not saying issue sorry I'm not saying that if you're a fear of a certain weight they give you a of a happier because I've seen some some girls who look really beautiful and they have extra weight but that's rare okay so I need people to understand that that is rare that that you're gonna find big big women like like super super bbw women how you gonna find them that attractive a normal uh normal sized man you may not be able to deal with the woman or all that weight is that fair to him I mean as a woman do you wanna feel somebody who's huge on top of you big a big body that's you know on top of you know you don't want to feel that either and men also need to not say hey I want a beautiful woman and then yet you you don't even take care of yourself like some men don't even take care of themselves and those who do take care of themselves some of them are a little bit cocky you know I don't understand it shouldn't have to be a seesaw it shouldn't be like oh now I look good and and everything else and I'm developing outside but mentally you don't or emotionally you're not developed because you have emotional immaturity and you have mental growth they need to work on and it's not just about you having a six-pack you have to be well-rounded overall it's not just looks as it looks it's the way you present yourself it's arm is everything is everything is that are you a whole person or are you just really looking good but then you're you know the way your attitude is nasty rather you know whatever kind of nasty attitude and a lot of people who do have looks and have body a lot of them do have nasty attitudes because they just feel like anybody should take their and it's not it's not good so with that said you know I said everything here about the weight loss tricks that I have the weight management tricks that I have and also if you have lots of sex so I'm not saying that you it's not reading like a if you are having like you have the significant other that you guys are in committed relationship if you're not a working out person if you're not a working out person maybe you know with your husband or significant other whatever it is you can have great times with them and that could be your version of a workout if you have a treadmill at home I have an elliptical but I haven't even been on this I cannot fix something on there that's a global once that's fixed then I'll have that as another option so I I think that um you know that's pretty much that's pretty much it and yeah so I hope you know we have any more questions oh I know what I was gonna tell you guys before that along with all these tricks I will also talk to you about my non-surgical cosmetic procedures that I will look into there are a lot of things that I had an interest in checking out like coal sculpting and sometimes they have the one that has extreme heat to help melt some of the fat I wanted to do the skin-tightening procedures they have some skin you know electric something that you can do or some wraps that they have at the spa is that you know you have to seaweed wraps and you have all these and you have the lymphatic massages that helped to bring fat out of the body you drain some of the toxic materials that may be stuck within your lymphatic system and I'm gonna start doing those things and when I when I have an opportunity to talk to you guys I'll let you guys know which ones I've tried and I'll say okay you know right now I have to set up appointments I have for my group on which a lot of the procedures I'm gonna try are going to be through Groupon and one of them that I have already is a lymphatic the lymphatic drainage massage which is supposed to help fat and impurities to come out of the system better you have to drink a lot of water and stuff like that so they're going to do it technique on you to push those things out as well as reporter as I a tenth session series after all my sessions are done or at least I'll tell you my first experience is like and now when I started doing all ten then I'll say okay this isn't my results this is where I saw weight loss as well it's good if it was bad if it's something that I think that you guys to try so that will be part of my weight management body series so just just to let you know I'm not crazy about getting smaller for anyone or losing weight for anyone but myself so I'm just letting you know they're gonna be at times that I'm gonna be on and I'm going to be off but I'm going to try to keep it as consistent as I possibly can just so you can say hey you wanna do want to try this or I don't want to try this I don't want to go under the knife for anything but what I want to do is use what's available to me without going under the knife and I'll let you know my results if it's if it's worth it for the price I'll tell you the full price I'll tell you the price that I paid on Groupon or if I had any kind of discounts or anything like that I'll let you guys know more about that I'll let you guys know more about the facility that I've gone to like I'll get I'll tell you all the specific details because some of these videos I'm saying I'm not getting enough details enough images like I said let's just get back to the waist training behind me or the body shaper rather when I put it on I only put it on one time and my stomach was flattened in after just like a couple days and it did not and it didn't even hold back like it's one less there I put it on today for like a half an hour I'm probably gonna eat some dinner or whatever now and after dinner I'm gonna just chill for a little bit and meaning for like a half hours had an hour and I'm gonna put the shaper back on for like two more hours so I could tell you in terms of the smoothing out and the pulling in of my stomach it definitely pulled everything in the middle 360 in when I put it on is it tight yes it's tight in the middle because that's where the area I want to get snatched in so my upper body my whole upper body wanted to be snatched in as much as possible so I'm starting on for this size to pull everything in smooth everything in get used to being shaped out and then after that I'm gonna get let out so put the largemont on but this particular shaper that I'm showing you or then I show you right here is of the dead shaper I got it out Walmart is warmer he's won Walmart's website I don't think how much should I pay for this $40.00 but this for this kind of shaper with all this material in the length it comes all the way down to the hose your inner thighs and all that so and it really the main part of this shaper is that it pulls the entire middle in the middle is being sucked in for sore and it does shape out your booty and your hips a little bit more so I got this one out Walmart one more it does have all the shapers the Butt Lift lifters it has the arm shapers I will get the arm shape or probably next week the long sleeve one and that's something I'm going to wear all the time almost like a broad so I'm actually gonna get multiple of those I'm gonna start off on one and see if it's comfortable they have one different one so just really look at the cut in the stylet of the arm shapers the butt lifter I just got the butt lifter this week it's coming and that's something that I don't have the power lifter this you put in between your butt like that that's not good for me I don't know who why they would even make something that goes inside your butt it's something that you want to wear every single day there's pretty much a lingerie this is a like a underwear you still have to put underwear and meat even if your butt cheeks are popping out I think you still gotta put her underwear Danny I'm not too sure how people wear that but I have the one that's a full coverage full coverage but lifter that shapes shapes your hips holes you know stomach in and and lifts the point and lifts it all the way up so it's no point in doing these things without the working out you've got to do that and gotta work out like together you want to get faster results the two together will the shaping if you can take these to the gym I know a lot of people think these shapers to the gym it's just that I hate stuff that you're so tight while I'm moving and I'm sweating and then it's so tight and then after practically peel it off of my body I don't want to really do that so all I do is I'll just wear my right if I go to the gym is where my regular gym clothes and then you know if I'll do my workout DVDs I have the belt plate though the sweat belt that you wrap around yes I make I have that so that's that's good enough for me for now and if I feel more comfortable in the shape or after a while I get this shape and become salutes and I'm ready for the second shaper I may wear this shaper just to do like stomach wraps and stuff like that because I've have done the stomach wraps but it was easier when my niece's were home because at least at least my niece's could help me to put the cream on my stomach and help me with the wrap around but you know now I got to try to do it on my own it's good if you have a good girlfriend if you have a girlfriend that you went out with all the time all these things are going to be so much easier if you guys are doing it together because us can hang out together you guys could spot each other you guys can you know give each other's tips and tricks that have been working for you if you want to wrap you somebody when my sister was around all the time used to rakish and stomachs up it was cool like all I have to say is that you have a really cool female friend that's not jealous that you guys are really like sisters yeah you guys could wrap each others arms and stomachs up together and go to the park and and invite ride bikes do things whatever you need to do is together I might actually start a group or walking group in my neighborhood so that you know during the time that I want to work out instead I'm going to the gym or on the timeout to have like one or two I'm gonna start this group where we can all go and just say hey we're gonna go meet me and go for this walk for whatever amount of time we decided half an hour hour we're going to do a full walk around the park and then leave or whatever it is then it would be so much more fun to build like a sisterhood so I've been wanting to do that I might actually do it now I'll let you know when that starts because I don't care if it's cold outside I will still go southward and walk around I just don't want to be out in the rain or the snow doing that but as long as it's not raining or snowing it's a cold I think it's fine um so that's it so future series is gonna be updates on the trainers the shapers and everything as well as more for Apple body is more for appreciate bodies because the some reason I don't understand on the incident I'm not seeing anyone with the Apple body who isn't like significantly overweight or is in slim you know I haven't see anybody anyone with my kind of body type that has done all of these things and my whole thing is that you know you know that you're more top-heavy you want to see somebody who looks just like you who's going through the trenches the hard trenches are doing all these things that hourglass swim into a pear-shaped women too and you thinking how is this gonna work for somebody with the Apple shape how's everybody gonna shape out don't be afraid of anything cosmetic if it's under than if it's not under the knife you if you can afford it good one is there for those who if you know that you're on a budget and most people are on a budget and if you know that you're on a budget and you want to you like save a little money but you still want to be treated to these kind of things that will make you feel good make you feel more confident umm do now do them stuff or if you go to Sephora they'll do your face I think for free if we make an appointment and you tell them this is the look I want to achieve can I want to use Arm Sephora's bread do you guys have support so far is brand and I make up an end a lip palette you can get the lip palette get the eye palette until you can get expensive stuff like I have cheap I have I don't want to say cheap because the makeup that is cost effective or whatever it is um this is good you like the quality isn't bad at all and you can go see your local store and get a couple of things and you can get some higher price up soon I think in my makeup bag I have so many deserve stuff that's for a dollar gave me not at all okay very low cost maybe about so three dollars some items and there was like two or three dollars and I have some that I'm like fifty dollars like all of them are not gonna be high in but one thing that you know I don't want to pro share again but I am gonna quote her because I look upset her so much like she's just like Oh in so many ways she's just like everything I wanna be I am just like so fanatical about Shira but when it comes to your face makeup you don't want to get something cheap I do have something that or walnut he say the word cheap when really it's affordable I use right now I have Avon Foundation and I think it's pretty decent I've been wearing the Avon Foundation for a while I have tried on the Queen collection foundation but I don't know it doesn't really match like for some reason with the Queen Queen Foundation I feel like I have to take like two creams and powders now everyone uses the creature father a lot of people use just a regular liquid foundation but I personally like the cream cream to powder because it gives you a matte look you kit it's a bill it's buildable and most of the time able to find a shade that matches my complexion like when my complexion is lighter I can find a palette a foundation for that and I have a foundation for my darkest I did between the two I can mix the two together to get a shade the pendant soul in the wintertime I may use the lighter one the summer time I use the darker one and in between seasons I use the one I use the two together and kind of like blending them together or I use some tricks with the bronzer I can't tell you and I don't have it so what we're doing my makeup I do it differently every single time today I used it's like totally different makeup that I normally don't use that I know I hardly ever use that are already a shadow but I love it so now that I love it I'll be wearing it more throughout the winter the lip color I used to love the lip stains but the lips things are very hard to find don't hold yourself back I mean try different things try stuff at your local beauty supply store try stuff at the drugstore and then also both the places like also for or everything you know get something online that's fine I don't you know some people feel like oh the cheap stuff is not better the choose the cheaper the affordable stuff is okay the Avon I happen to have the same color in two different two different lines that they have one is darker one is lighter but each of those things cost me about $13 each or if it's on sale it's like a buy one get one buy one get one half off don't sleep one Iran do not sleep on Mary Kay because a lot of the stuff that they have are geared towards ethnic women I love avon because they have a lot of makeup colors like the palace the lipsticks and the and the lip liners and that kind of thing glosses yada yada they have those colors that match for women who are Hispanic and black and if you have in it it complements our complexion so don't knock a Ron there's another lady that I know she's an older woman and she uses Mary Kate and Mary Kate has the skincare line is phenomenal they have a lot of great skincare items to stop in time for anti aging for ethnic skin tones is geared towards ethnic skin which is why I do like once a blonde and Mary Kate for that reason even though you can still go to someone like I don't know dionna's fancy brand which has a whole bunch of later or dose of color and those are real nice out of dose of color also but if you want to get something more affordable and more consistent that's the thing about Mary Kay and Avon is that they have consistency and if you have a good rep my rep wasn't the greatest so I have me I stocked up on makeup from like when I went on eBay or whatever I got like a whole bunch of the colors that I needed because I didn't get along too well with my Avon lady she was you know starting to get a little crazy so I just said listen let me just stock up on what I need so I'm actually good for at least another at least another six months if not a whole year because that makeup I made sure that I was gone it was so hard for I don't know what it is it seems like it's so hard for me to find my shade it's really funny it's like it's hard for me to find my shade sometimes because you don't want to get that truck you look and you don't want to look too dark and you don't want to love chocolate chocolate but you want to look luminous so I'm happy I have this for now I don't have to worry about it for now but definitely my next summer I do kind of want to support and asking them to match up my complexion so that when these are finished that I can go to better palette cuz I want more coverage I don't have that much coverage I have some discoloration towards the lower part of my face in here I know you guys can't see it that much now thank God but you know when I'm out on the streets I want my face to have that finished photo already flawless kind of look and foundation is the most important that I could work with the eye palettes and the lip palette set foundations Clinique oh my gosh Clinique is like one of my favorite brands I don't care what anyone says they have really great makeup choices and also they have great skin care but the skin care and I'll use that much but definitely and like when it comes to blushes all those colors those pinks and oranges and corals and all those pretty colors in between looks so nice on our skin so Clinique is that my favorite my favorite one Chanel critique Chanel you can never go wrong with those two ever ever ever if you want to have a classy classy soft soft look and the makeup that's where you want to go I don't like Mac because it's the colors are way too bold and too sharp and you know that goes for certain kinds of people if you don't have that I almost say that personality but if you're not really leading with that personality on a regular basis I wouldn't say go for Mac Mac is like you know that sharp in your face like you want that look that that sharp sharp um harder like more defining to look kind of then you can go for the Mac well if you want like a soft elegant look or something I would say go with Clinique go with something like a Mary Kay to get like a soft after Khalid softer more oh when I hear soft I think feminine that's just my whole thing like if it's gonna give you a more soft feminine type of look then you should go with that alright um that's that's it for now I know that I really want to talk about the makeup I just just kind of in the mood to mention it but yeah maybe another time I'll talk more about my philosophy is on makeup but for right now you know I just really wanted to bring these weight-loss ideas the New Year's New Year's is coming up and I know a lot of people don't want to go out you might as well start from like right now if you can start you can still do something between now and New Year's you have a whole month and you can at least shape something if you can't shape something if you can't lose something you just shaped something you see and shape something maybe you can lose something or both which up but this is like a good start off for like next summer for New Year's for Valentine's all those things are coming up and you know you want to look pretty for your boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever you have and these holidays for that kind of thing you want to look beautiful and very feminine sexy or soft or whichever it is that you want to choose but then the time is now the time is really really now like I'm going to be a series now this next summer I don't want to feel like that person that looks like crap and believe me like every summer you see these girls they looking very very soft for every year these girls are looking better and better and my where I live the girls are looking better and better every summer either they look more fit they look smaller they look feminine hair looks good bodies look good face looks good and not to mention the age factor you don't know how many people want young young women and if you're in a certain age bracket you know that you got to work harder to get a look because when you're 20 it doesn't matter you can have jeans and a t-shirt on you're gonna always have somebody looking but when you're in your 30s and 40s and up you got work like you really gotta work to get some attention and I have to thank God like in a way that you know even at this age I still get looks oh I have somebody try to talk to me it's a blessing I look at it as a blessing to some people at a certain age everything stops you don't even get a look and as a woman I don't think as a woman you're you really want that if you especially if you used to get looks and then all of a sudden everything stops nobody is trying to talk to you nobody's looking and looking at you nobody is acknowledging you you're not gonna be happy about that that's why I said like just to a little bit better than nothing because you don't want someone to come by and you're like man I didn't I didn't I didn't do my detoxes I didn't do my water and into a workout into shape they hadn't do anything and now some is here and in the next in the next two weeks someone's gonna be here full blast and I have not even done anything for the past six months you've got to keep up you got to make sure everything is as good as you can possibly make it it's gonna be harder if you're trying to stick to your principles like for example um this whole thing with these Chinese people who have stores these are these many petty places and then they won't be disrespectful I don't go there I've actually taken next step to do my own feet and my own nails is not gonna be as professional maybe but it's gonna be from a distance okay or four or like a far a farm book close distance you're going to it's going to look nice it's gonna mean me look me and professional without what I want to say me professional it's not gonna be as great as you know as great as if you went to the salon but it's gonna be decent enough that if you keep practicing it's that you're gonna get it you're gonna get it so I just say practice practice practice when I did it I was really bad at first and then after a little while I started getting better and better with the nail application the polish application doing the little fine-tuning with filing this and smoothing this out and it's a time but I said you know I made time for it because I can I love myself and I care about myself I don't want to go to an establishment where somebody's not being kind to me after I work hard for my money and I work you know I'm working hard for my money and I'm coming here to do something to make myself feel beautiful I don't want to go somewhere where somebody's gonna treat me like crap even my eyebrows right now look at this I got to get it done I'm trying to I'm gonna have to figure out how am I gonna get my eyebrows done because I have to think about out of all the places I've been so where did I get the most amount of respect Orin cannot forget this out on my own I might get that stencil kid there's like a stencil kit that you can put over your eyebrow and just have it have like a standard shape or I might just do something just to clean it up on my own and that's it just like clean up around it and I said because that matters to me and the respect is gonna matter to me just as much as anything else like I don't want to be I don't want to be around an establishment where I know people don't like me and they don't respect me so I'm not going back there I'm like what I don't even want to take a chance to go to any of them that's what I mean so if you're going through those things just take it one day at a time just ask yourself what can I do today and just take it one day one day towards working towards that goal and you know even if you don't get there all the way do something something positive is definitely going to happen let's put it that way your other is gonna be something in your spirit because you know that you're doing the best that you can so it's a bring your best foot forward so internally there'll be a light that shines outward or you know you know something like that you know that's all I gotta say about that for now you get the point so um have a good day have a good night I hope that you know you guys will make some great comments I would love your feedback on if this was if this is good for you this is a good series to start if this is something that you like don't like is there

standard time march 23rd this is your raven weather report i was trying to pretend i was a robot but it didn't really work did it nah no one was tricked no one was sitting there thinking like oh my god is this a robot you're just thinking like this guy sucks because that's what i'm thinking when i'm pretending to be a robot i'm thinking holy crap this sucks how do i abandon this joke quickly that's how it goes kids that's how it goes all right so um i was telling you about this there's silly people out there online you know this right i was talking about this in the chain link video there are silly people online there are a lot lots of them they get silly ideas and silly things and because of silly people exist i gotta say a thing and i'm gonna say it now and that is i am not a financial advisor this is not financial advice do not buy sell trade do anything based upon these videos you are an adult who is responsible for your own actions if anything this is one man's online trading journal as i pick it all apart and try to do it if you want to pick up some tips some tricks some analysis if they work for you great if they you think i suck then you know you don't have to watch any of this if you would like to join the now elite 78 followers right we've been talking about my influencer game and how strong it is it's solid as and why it's so solid because i'm telling you when i get when i get 80 followers i'm calling i've been telling you people this and this isn't a joke i'm calling up the holiday inn and i'm gonna be like yo holiday what's up i got 80 people who would like to see me grammin my continental breakfasts at the holiday inn i can't even finish it uh you want to follow a fun gentleman on uh because you know one of the things that about this channel is you realize i'm not selling you anything there's no seminars you can't watch my youtube you can watch my videos for free and just there you go right because there's a lot of scammers out there and this guy who i like he he calls out a lot of the scammers it's a fun channel to watch i don't know i mean i think his heart's in the right place but there's something also sort of sinister about this character no offense i don't mean any disrespect to him i'm just saying you know sometimes i wonder his motivation for this if it's actually to get scammers or to get more publicity i don't know either way he's calling out scammers in a really dope way and it's fun okay so beware educate yourselves inoculate yourselves as i say inoculate yourselves against  okay and by being one of the elite 78 followers of my twitter will show well that'll demonstrate that'll demonstrate how you've inoculated you will say i've made my choice against  and i'm following the silverback because i like them maybe you don't like me it's fine all right uh raven kaka coin okay wacky little bird since you've been ice time this looks like modern art to me every time i see it i'm like isn't there a shakespeare that looks like this or a shakespeare a picasso is shakespeare that looks like off idiot all right so i know we were talking about the singularity which bumped me out because i was getting all excited about the singularity so when when ravencore becomes self-aware right and then i did a really bad impression of the terminator going like trying to do the terminator music and then i realized i forgot how it goes other than i'm pretty sure there's like just drums that go or something like that and then schwarzenegger comes out and goes i'll be back and then everyone goes oh that's the thing he says and in the movies right i'm pretty sure that's the plot of the terminator right is that i think the entire plot of the terminator is just arnold schwarzenegger saying i'll be back right let everybody know that henceforth he will be returning so we were talking about all these lines leading to this day on the 24th ish and then oh here yeah it was we drew this white line and then it dumped on the descending triangle right we talked about that happening i hope if anything like do i have your attention now like look i get it here's the thing go watch the other videos i'm making these calls and i'm not saying this to be a cocky jerk it's just there's a credibility level out there in the world and consistently time and time again when i draw my graphs and do my stuff i'm making these calls here's the problem that i'm having with raven yes i'm making these calls to some degree and then the coin and the acid itself doesn't follow through on the motion that i would expect like even this here like we called this this dump out of the triangle and then it did right i would expect it to we were calling for this i mean we were saying any time within this range but we really wanted to see what happens at the singularity here and now it looks like we're not going to get it so we've broken this little gray channel below that's a problem problem i told you it's like ice every time it bounces but go back to the other videos we've called we've i'm one of my skills one of my best skills thanks to the way that i deal with my arun index down here and my sars i'm very good at spotting reversals okay and or incoming trends but again we called this one here and it did the opposite of what it should it was a descending triangle and it went ah 30 of the time because remember they don't always follow through what you think they're going to do it's all about statistics you want to try to give yourself a statistical advantage can you do that is that a skill that you can acquire if so let's make some goddamn money together all right so we still have this four hour putting the pressure and you know look raven wants to stay tough and hook around um i again i would here's the real problem and why i've redrawn my i pulled away from my abc correction talk because i i was pretty sure that no one wanted to hear it and frankly i wasn't entirely convinced i was correct once it started doing this because i always expect b waves to be a little bit tighter a little bit shorter a little bit higher like in here that's a little high frankly but still you know it could go up to like within 10 range maybe higher i don't know all things are possible but the um i thought we were frankly out of it but now that i'm seeing this day sar come in creep boom what happens when this hits puts pressure up top right don't hate me don't kill the messenger don't hate the player hate the game because frankly it's not that big of a deal i think that's the problem when people talk about bearish scenarios i'm not bearish at cryptocurrency at all i am incredibly bullish but i also understand that there are momentary times where we have to do healthy corrections and the adults in the room have to come in and you know all the drunken high and then you know look excuse me this is not an immature person's game if you want to be serious about it here we go with the throat again promise i just did my chain link video i don't think i cleared my throat once second to start raving hello everybody i think i'm dying on the inside maybe i'm like doc holiday you know maybe i got tuberculosis and now i'm just like a a cowboy sidekick a wyatt wyatt hey wyatt i've been analyzing the the raven coin for you wider now we gotta go shoot a bunch of people down at the okay corral is that i think that's how cowboy life works so we have this uh you know coming up not cool the weak chart is still pretty good in our favor so that's nice but it is coming you know we're going to be looking at some consolidation once this comes meets up top consolidation that's life but that's what i'm trying to say about the adults in the room hey you want i'm sorry i got to clear my throat people give me one second i'll tell you what there are more fun things in life than that still the same gee whiz okay maybe i need to get one of those like stephen hawking style like when i do the ravencore or the ravencoin update by the time my throat's all messed up and i'll just be a robot you know gee whiz so you know when i say the adults in the room because it's easy to go out there and follow the hype moon boys and get all excited about everything going to the moon and then you get pissed when your shit's not going to the moon and you wanted your moon lambo and you'd already been looking at zillow at new property because look you are if you keep at this and you keep chuck and change in here you are going to make life changing well fact f a c t and do you know why i say that is because that's what it's done for me now i'm not at my goals yet i still have a ways to go before i'm like all right now i've got you money right i'm not there yet i will release what i consider you money everybody wants you money and what i say is  you money is when that like hey you gotta do this you i don't have to do anything right i'm getting to the point where i sort of only have to answer to the irs which is nice i only have to answer the irs and this shitty frog in my throat for the most part ah this is very very upsetting to me anyway um excuse me for one second i'm really really really sorry about this well there goes my career as a radio show host um the uh we were talking about life changing well yeah raven all this other stuff is going to do it to you like this is this is a changing of the guard of finance and people who are in early are going to make a lot of money and you're going to make a lot of money and you just got to be patient so you want to know where your money's going all right you don't want to get weak hands because everyone's calling for the moon every day and you know where is it going to about it they'll tell me it's not per behavior that gets linked into people's psyches win moon go look it up right and when moon not today we're going to build the case as to what it looks like and if this now is backing now i feel i could talk about this with a little bit more authority again right so maybe i have your attention i hope that i have your attention now because bare minimum we've been calling these we've been calling these reversals now the trends that follow ah gee whiz you know raven's act like a whack-a-doodle so i can't do it um but again when this day flips and it could flip anytime maybe at our singularity point here maybe by the 24th puts the pressure on now raven could no i don't like that jam out one or two days of down pressure and it's done but that is not you don't want to be making your decisions based upon what could happen every now and again you want to be making your decisions based upon what does happen generally statistically all the time okay so that would lead us to believe that we have a little bit more down time ahead before we start talking about these higher figures and man i got lozenges some night some nice fella chimed in yesterday hey man you should try some tea and lemon honey guess what i did this morning tea and lemon honey does it work i'm putting on another lozenge right now let's hope this works out i don't understand it because by the end of the day like by noon or you know midday especially after i exercise there's no throat problems sure there's not we don't believe you and by the way i don't want to seem like i'm being dower on i i i appreciate people being positive about hyping things up and things but i also look one of the things that you know about me is i hate scammers and i also don't like phony gurus and people like i'm look i'm not positioning myself as a guru i'm a brass tax analyst i'm a no  guy and i'm going to give you basically the straight dope of what i see okay based upon ta technical analysis sometimes i get it right sometimes i don't right and then when i don't get it right we'll look at that and figure out why like i didn't get this right that surprised me and then we went back and that helped us build a better case and we said well it looks like this bottom gray channel is a little bit more uh robust in its its nature of support than we thought right that build that case well guess what it just got smashed right here because i'm telling you this market is a cruel mistress and just when you think you've tamed that wild mustang it lashes out and bucks you from the saddle so you always have to be very diligent very careful very patient and if you don't acknowledge what's before you you're not going to make as much money as you want i mean look i've i've i say this all the time i sometimes think the holders are the people who have it right just sit back buy your does it really matter if you buy raven at 20 cents or 12 cents no not in the long term not really i mean if you're talking about several hundred thousand dollars where this buys you say 200 000 raven and this buys you um four hundred thousand raven well then when you get up to a dollar you're looking at a two hundred thousand dollar long-term differentiation in your overall bank so yeah it can matter but if you're talking like four or five thousand dollars anything sub 1g who gives a just get in walk away hold long term you win okay but if you want to understand where your money's at that's why we do this stuff personally for me i'm aggressive i'm a mercenary i'm a little bit of a pirate okay i want to maximize my rp that's revenue potential it's an acronym i just made up on the spot you know yo you guys down with your rp what's that revenue potential yo i thought you knew that's fool so let's see here let's just get this wrapped up because my throat's ticking me off uh as far as today is concerned like look we we've talked about this pressure on the four the one and the two seem to be putting a little bit of up but not enough volume is not great right we're down here um bears want to poke out on the one not on the tube i'm sorry bulls wanting to poke out on the one a little bit but the two's like now we're all bare the four is still all bare okay so keep that in mind as we focus through this because what you want to see now now that we've broken through this descending triangle this support area and we've broken through the gray not the end of the world by the way because some i say definitive so now we're looking at what i mean by a definitive break when you're looking at this bottom grade channel right here okay that's that is it's definitive now the differentiation is the following motion in my opinion is what makes it definitive so and we look like we're looking at that follow-up motion what is the follow-up motion it's looping back around on the one and the two we're getting a little bit of lift off right now does it come back to the where's the gray it's gone  jerk is it okay so now we've broken it didn't oh that's bad that's bad because that's now it's acting as resistance that's bad okay so when i say definitive we want to see boom if this resists again it goes down with that day star cloud cover coming in tight underneath there you know look if you think it's if you don't agree with my assessment on this that's fine i would actually like to see that argument because as we've been watching this show me show me how this is bullish show me how this is a bullish scenario that's all i ask i don't mind when people disagree with me i don't have an ego about this i want to get it right i want to make the most money possible so somebody's sitting out there be like bro bro bro this is why you're being a  because this is what's really happening and i think ah one i learned something two i have the potential to make more money i'm open to that just be respectful be cool just because people disagree doesn't mean they have to be your mortal enemies right we can work this out together we're a team we're figuring it out so if you somehow have come up with how this is remotely bullish right now in the short term because in the long term it's fine short term ain't looking so good show me that i want to see it and i want to see a technical analysis and i want to see a chart i don't want to see some dumb arrow because i you know you know if you know you know one of my pet peeves out there about other analysts where they post their charts that look like this right  burns me up it burns me up now you can do some analysis just by looking at this right not great analysis but you could say all right well here's a line of support here's another line of support there's another line of support it looks like we're going down man some kind of triangulation man right you can do that but you see a lot of these guys on twitter just doing this kind of it drives me nuts who are you gonna see here and then oh that goes away and then moon oh yeah but this all came back and ruined my big joke but anyway those people they're the worst man go here's the thing here's the you've seen it i've seen it they draw this constantly and they call for the moon has it mooned yet right go up go back i bet you could find raven and alice as they're gonna talk about here and they drew a big arrow all the way up to 50 60 cents  those people they're messing with the market they're messing with your mind that's why you need to learn how to do this yourself so you can ignore people like me right i just happen to be a good-natured pirate who wants to help people okay but there's a lot of people out there that aren't and they're going to try to sucker you in with making it look like they know what the they're talking about and they don't right because you want to believe the myth i want to believe that it's going to a dollar by friday i'd love to believe that show me the case instead of some dumb ass arrow can you tell i'm a little salty about these kind of people i'm mostly salty because i realize how much time i put in to actually analyzing things and they're just like yeah to the moon like all right fine that's going to be my new analysis right everything i do now is i'm going to change this channel to the moon it's all about i'm going to mint to the moon currencies by the way if you want some beautiful illustrious silverback cryptocurrency i'm giving it out for fun so all you got to do is post your raven core address and or your raven address your deposit address i'll send you some silverbacks you can collect them you can tell everybody how like oh you guys ain't trading in silverbacks that shit's going to the moon and they'll be like what how do i get silverbacks it's rare it's cool it's uh on fleek as they said five or six years ago um so i don't mean to rant so much about scammers i just my thing is i really look i i i don't like seeing people when i see people come out and they're looking at cryptocurrency especially when they're new and you're hopeful and like is this going to get me out of my shitty job forever oh my god am i going to be able to finally look in the mirror in the morning with dignity and feel like i've taken control of my own life and my financial destiny right what a great freeing emotion that is and yes the answer is yes you can do that only in so far as you take control of your money you take control of your mind you take control of your own goddamn destiny and you learn how to do what i'm showing you right if you don't like the way that i do it i have a very weird style i'm self-taught okay this is a very long system of trial and error i went through every one of these goddamn technical indicators and i studied them for you know a couple days at a time until i figured finally i landed on the ones that were for me if you notice i don't really use moving averages right i mean this is the m a cross which i sometimes check just to confirm but i don't like it again the ichimoku cloud also is telling us that we're below and with a bearish scenario but my meaning is look i want you to succeed if you're new welcome okay don't be afraid to ask questions don't be afraid to post your own analysis i mean

"welcome back everyone hope you're well if you need to my channel my name is Hannah also known as tropical plant addict and today I thought it would be quite appropriate to do a video on caladium care as I've been getting asked quite a lot of questions on my caladiums recently I'm going to run through with you soil mix temperature humidity light and overwintering for caladiums last summer I had a teeny tiny Florida clown caladium it was really small the bulb was tiny when I received it and I only agreed to leaves I think and it was it's so cute so when I planted these bulbs around ten weeks ago I was just expecting maybe two leaves from each bulb and I cannot believe the size of these caladiums compared to the one that I had last year I mean look at the size of this beast so caladiums are a tropical perennial native to South America and there are tons of different varieties I'm definitely going to be collecting some more next year I feel like they're really easy to care for and I'm going to run through some care tips with you now let's start off with soil mix so caladiums love a well-draining slightly acidic soil so if you're just using household potting mix you can just add a little bit of spagna peat moss to the mix just to make it a little bit more acidic so my clay diems are potted up in Koya compost a little bit of orchid bark some perlite and then I added a little bit of this bag named repeat moss just to make this all a bit more acidic so try and keep the soil slightly moist they don't like the soil to dry out too much and then they don't like to sit in soggy soil either so it's a bit of a fine balance but once you get it right your platings or just be so happy I did find that the stems would bend and snap if you weren't giving them enough water so just make sure that you're keeping the soil consistently moist I've been fertilizing my clay diems once a month with my baby bio fertilizer which are linked below for you I use that for all my houseplants too of my caladiums I'm keeping inside as house plants which is this one here and this guy and then this one it's got the biggest leaf this one has been outside now for about almost two weeks [Music] in regards to temperature and humidity Canadians seem to do best when the temperature averages around 21 degree Celsius or above in the daytime and 15 degrees Celsius during the night time they can tolerate lower temperatures but you'll find they won't grow quite as big or as fast I'm actually quite surprised that this caladium has grown so large being outside for the last couple of weeks because the nighttime temperatures in the UK have only been about 12 degrees Celsius so not really that warm but he still seems to have grown really big for some reason they will tolerate various levels of humidity obviously the higher the better they love a nice warm humid environment and that will just avoid crispy tips the humidity in my home is currently around 50 to 60% so it's not too bad if you are having trouble keeping up the humidity levels in your home you can get a humidifier or I have made a video on how you can improve the humidity in your home without the use of a humidifier just some tips and tricks so I'll link that below for you I only really run my humidifier probably once a week in the summer because the humidity levels are quite high anyway but in the winter I'll run it about two or three times a week I also made a video on my humidifier last year which I'll link below for you and if you'd like me to do an update review video on it let me know in regards to light requirements for your caladiums they are light sensitive due to the really thin and fragile leaves especially the more translucent leaf caladiums like this one here this one is not quite as translucent so it's not quite as light sensitive so depending on exactly which variety you have they may have different light requirements so Canadians prefer shade and filtered Sun if they're outside and bright indirect light if they're inside and they can tolerate a little bit of morning or maybe evening Sun if they're inside I have heard that you can put yes varieties that like full Sun but I'm not quite sure which varieties those are so you have to do a bit of research on that if you're looking to have them outside in full Sun too much Sun can actually damage the leaves and cause brown patches so be really careful not to get direct Sun on your caladiums especially the ones with the translucent leaves like this one next to me as you can see with this one here there are slight brown patches on some of the leaves and that's probably because it's heard a little bit too much Sun but all the new growth is coming through really nice and there doesn't seem to be any brown patches on it if you are planting your caladiums outside just make sure they're planted in a really sheltered spot as wind can also damage the fragile leaves they get blown about in the wind so all my caladium has been planted as bulbs or tubers around ten weeks ago if you are planting them as bulbs you need to make sure that there's about one and a half to two inches of soil on top of the bulb when you're planting them and usually it'll take about four or five weeks for them to start coming up if the soil is warm enough and the temperatures are warm enough I think I put onto the mine back in May and it did take about five weeks for them to come up overwintering caladiums so if you live in a lovely warm climate unlike the UK you can probably leave your caladium tubers in the ground over winter if they're outside and just mulch over them but here if you've got them outside you're gonna need to dig them up and dry store them so all you need to do is dig up your tuber and then make sure it's dried out so either keep it out in the Sun for a couple of days or put it in the airing cupboard or something like that and then put it into a paper bag and I always put a little bit of yellow sulfur in with mine and that just make sure that it doesn't go mouldy and then you're basically just storing it in the cupboard over the winter just make sure that the temperature where of you're keeping the bulb it's about 15 degrees Celsius and then when it comes back round to spring you just plant your tuber and wait for it to grow again if you're keeping your Canadians as houseplants what I did last year was I left the tuber in the soil I let the leaves die back and then I left it and then when it came around to spring I thought oh you know hopefully it's gonna grow soon but it actually didn't come back so I don't know what happened it may have just rotted away in the soil even though I wasn't mortaring it during the winter so I think this year I'm gonna dig up all the bulbs and just dry store them even with my caladiums that I'm keeping inside when it does come around to that time of year where I'm starting to overwinter some of my tropical plants or make a little video for you so you can see how I'm doing it well I think that's all the basic palladium care tips I can think of if you've got any questions just leave them in the comments below and I'll do my best to get back to you thank you so much for watching I really hope you enjoyed the video found it useful and I hope it's spark - a love for Canadians because I'm sure if you get one you'll want to collect loads of different varieties because they're just absolutely beautiful and so striking so I'm just gonna zoom into the caladiums for you now so you can see they're absolutely stunning leaves so enjoy the last bit of the video and enjoy the music and I'll see you soon in my next video take care everyone bye [Music] [Music]", "1BPDbczgoZI": "how to stop root canal pain it's easy to think of teeth as simply being bones but they're more than that your teeth are made of multi-layered hardened tissue and are buried in your gums enamel and dentin are made up of minerals that protect the inside of your teeth the pulp this inner part of the teeth contains sensitive nerves and blood supply unfortunately bacteria can damage the protective coverings through a process called demineralization demineralization can lead to infection inflammation in cavities one your dentist may recommend a root canal to clean the area and relieve the pain treating pain at home take pain medication your dentist may prescribe a pain reliever for you to take after the root canal if not or if the pain is only minimal taken over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen according to the manufacturer's instructions although you'll be given pain medication during the root canal you should take the OTC pain relievers within an hour after the root canal this will give them a chance to start working before your anesthesia wears off three use ice to relieve pain ice can temporarily numb the pain from your tooth place an ice cube or crushed ice on the tooth as long as it's not sensitive to cold keep it there until you no longer feel pain or the ice melts or place an ice pack over the side of your face for 10 minutes to help minimize any swelling never apply an ice pack directly to your skin make sure it is wrapped in a cloth like a towel or a t-shirt to prevent frostbite you can also make a compress to set over the tooth crush ice and put it in a balloon or in the cut off finger of a non latex glove tie off the end and set the compress over the tooth use a salt water solution relieve toothache by dissolving one-half teaspoon of sea salt in 4 ounces 118 milliliters of warm water place some of this solution in your mouth and hold it over the painful tooth for 30 seconds to one minute spit out the solution and repeat this two to three times rinse out your mouth with warm water you can do this up to three or four times a day just don't swallow the salt water you can also use a vinegar solution mix 1/4 cup of warm water and apple cider vinegar and keep it in your mouth over the painful tooth just like the salt water solution try to avoid any alcohol consumption or even holding alcohol in your mouth as it will produce dehydration of your mucosa and gums bite down on a fruit or vegetable Chile's slice of fresh ginger cucumber or raw potato and place it over your painful tooth or you can freeze slices of banana apple mango guava or pineapple and place the slices on your aching tooth the cool fruit or vegetables can numb the pain you can also try cutting a piece of onion or garlic to place directly over your tooth bite down gently to release the juice just remember to use a breath mint after this home remedy eating ice cream may also reduce pain especially if you feel a pulsating pain make a tea compress take an herbal tea sachet or dip it clean cotton cloth in warm herbal tea goldenseal echinacea seven sage which can also treat gingivitis eight green or black which can prevent oral cancer and cavities nine apply an esse foetida paste take 1/4 teaspoon of asafoetida powder and mix it with enough fresh lemon juice to make a paste apply this directly onto the tooth the lemon juice will help hide the bitter taste and unpleasant odour leave the paste on for 5 minutes before rinsing out your mouth repeat this 2 to 3 times a day asafoetida is a phenol like plant that's usually used as a cooking spice in Indian foods it comes as a powdered resin or as a lump of resin and can be found in Indian stores and markets use a heat pack some people find that moist heat can help relieve pain the day after your root canal you can also try baby teething gels these contain a local anesthetic that may relieve the pain keep in mind that these gels aren't antimicrobial and won't treat any infection know when to contact your dentist if you've tried several of these treatments but find that you feel severe pain even a few days after your root canal call your dentist you should also get in touch with your dentist if you notice pressure that lasts several days following your root canal your dentist can prescribe pain relief medication if over-the-counter medications aren't reducing your pain", "CVX6TtvDr4Q": "they can

everybody turn off the heat of the milk once you have boiled do you need to wait for it to froth before you turn it off so yeah do i have to wait for the milk to boil before i turn it off or do i just you have milk boiling then after that switch off please and now can you bring a small cup of water or coffee or anything with we need for 2 liter of milk a big tablespoon of um citric acid okay so if you've got your citric acid if you don't have your citric acid if you have your lemon or your vinegar how much do they need raw i have citric i said you can use one lemon juice lemon juice for one just and you have you need two tablespoons of white vinegar okay so if you do not have the citric acid you use two tablespoons of white vinegar if you do not have white vinegar you can use how much lemon juice just one one just one if that's two or two there is a too many juice and one lemon if you don't i have that means three that's mean three tablespoon of juice lemon juice brilliant okay three tablespoons of lemon juice or one and a half tablespoons of citric acid yeah and now i will put a little bit hot water inside this one and just try to melt this one together okay yeah and why and the way you put the citric acid with the with the milk you can't um this is the old way there was my from the people in the middle east use it to to exchange milk or to make a uh to make from milk cheese easy cheese or quickly cheese we can say so now uh citric acid is melt with the hot water i will add to the milk then you can see what it's having now okay okay so that was just a little bit of hot water with the citric acid okay just a little bit of hot water and now rau is adding it to the milk she's stirring it slowly and she's showing you the process that happens when you add any kind of acid to milk yeah i would if you if you see now if you see we need to change the milk to yellow water you can see milk change to yellow water and the cheese follow in the tub okay you can see that we will repeat these steps for you if you are behind do not worry one tablespoon we need another half tablespoon okay so that was one tablespoon of citric acid she's just gonna add another half can you see can you see the cheese on the top here this is yellow water and the cheese hollow in the top hold on so you should have a curdling happening to your milk at the moment remember the heat is off that's very important and raw is just adding the second or half tea tablespoon to the milk just stirring it slowly brilliant and oh yeah can you make other things so not just this is this can make savory cheese can this make other things for for dinners this way i said before with this way we use it to make uh easy che uh cheese um this is a cheese we like this one like two clear flam cottage cheese if you know cutter cottage cheese but we use it this one with a sweet dessert a sweet dish but if you want to eat in breakfast or in a on the lunch just you can after now we strainer this one just you add a little bit salt and black seeds some any flavor you can use it the spicy like paprika who said you need you can add sometimes add just a dried mango the mint and just i will to teach you how you can change this one to a cheese to eat in a breakfast or the on the on your dinners brilliant did you hear that jamal you've got a nice paprika flavored cheese there good stuff here on the cookie that she's on the top now i will put the cheese on the strainer on the strainer and leave it up to just a drain okay so here we are we've got rau going to take the cheese and she's going to strain it with through the sieve there because raw she said me tricky one about the cheese if you need this for breakfast just just add little bits of salt and the oil extra virgin a little bit of olives yeah sounds good sounds delicious um if you are cooking at the moment just take a look at what rowie is consistency of her if you just hold that close there rouh the consistency of the cheese there just so that we can see what it's supposed to look like brilliant that's what we need this is cheese and if you can see we have here yellow water okay even just you know and even this yellow water we think this is um full of uh good things so my mom not to throw this one never always if you want to prepare any dough or two to wanted to do any another thing we use instead the water we use this water we use this one with a lot of good bacteria brilliant so there's no waste fantastic are we recycling all of these that's great i like it when we recycle all the food and do not leave any waste that's brilliant so if you can see participants um rawria is just straining the cheese off there you can see it's got a kind of quite um creamy texture hopefully yours looks the same if it doesn't don't worry raw will do some troubleshooting in just a little bit if he thinks it's okay with everyone just i wanted to have a chance yes let's check then how is everybody with their cheese the message how are you doing if it's not very cheesy do we leave it to cook more okay so what happens rauria if it's not very cheesy veronica's nodding her head joe are you the same yeah can you show me your cheese please okay so let's have a look at houses first but that's happened sometimes i said before uh if the mel can i see this one again please yeah yeah how many how many uh how many spoon you bought from the citric acid it was one and a half yeah a tablespoon i said yeah that's enough because that's too much experience however it's very so sometimes we have kind of milk there is a lot of chemical treatment not help us to make to do cheese the important the the good milk for this one good milk to do a fresh milk if you have any fresh milk i would to be honest i tried before when i came here to uh to uk many kind of milf um the good one i use it this is a whole milk um like a fresh one or this is smaller milk i don't know i use this kind it's too good molar milk this is good um or do you know this one um green one but the good one the good one this is fresh milk if you have any if you can get the fresh milk but don't worry in this time if you if you don't have this cheesy cheesy uh milk just we can bend and use miscarbony okay one don't worry i'm so sorry you want to throw your uh well but i will maybe maybe we can do different things with this one now in this time just leave it and just use this now so yeah get off the heat yeah take it off the heat and um yeah i would just leave it for a little bit it might curdle on its own so just put it to one side don't give up on it just yet veronica are you the same is it on the heat there veronica okay yeah yeah yeah we didn't get much we got some but not much cheese so well i think we'll use the mascarpone as well yeah okay great so thank you so rau they've got uh just a couple of bits of cheese so is that okay they can just they can um strain off some of the cheese in the moment in this moment please if you have a little bit don't don't stare too much after you what i said leave the the cheese float or on the top leave it don't stir too much yeah okay great after that after that if you have any um any um like below any a new below you can put all that she all this milk inside this uh below a couple pillows sorry covered and just this one you can get this cheese great so that's a veronica and mike if you just use something like a pillow case or like a cloth or something to just strain the cheese off um if you've got the small bits of cheese i think the problem is we don't use the normal milk we are using the vegetable the vegetable milk among i don't know about this one but like what i said before for um for your friends you we can use just mascara bunny if you if you want okay any idea about coconut milk or any oats milk yeah if you can make it curdle that would be great veronica and you can tell us how it's going brilliant i think so i've got from annabelle here and mine's taking a little longer but following um elana has said mine hasn't curdled yet elana uh how are you doing are you okay so so that's okay uh joe you're okay oh you're on mute hold on if you can see my cheese now one second uh raw yeah joe what's up yeah my milk has thickened but it hasn't really curdled i don't think okay let's have a look rawhi can you take a look at joe's milk can i see you please i'm going to be careful not to drop the phone in the milk okay and this is this is boiling yeah yes that was oily yeah it was but i've taken it off the heat do i need to put it back on the heat yeah and you would hand you you put the citric acid yeah put the stitching caster in but i didn't put it back on the heat that's the problem with the milk or because this is the first time you do the you did like this but again i i uh do this one many times many times always my mom on my phone and she's teach me how i can do this she is always she say the problem with the milk because in my country we use fresh milk just from or goat and put on the or on the cooker but after many times when i tried many times a milk type of milk kind of milk this is the uh the best one when i use it and look at my i prepare this one now with you wonderful that looks really good okay so um don't don't worry if your milk it's not quite curdled yet and you as broward said we can continue using the mascarpone this time round um and then perhaps we look for some fresh milk maybe i will teach you how you can make cheese with different way easy way but we need to be a cold because that i don't prepare this one now but this one easy one and you can prepare this one to breakfast not just a sweet we can eat any breakfast or in the middle if you are just when when this one hot add a little better salt a little bit black seeds a little dried melt any spicy you want and just leave it on the fridge after you make any shave what you want like this square or anything in the morning you can't find this one like one pieces and you can yeah it's good sounds good fantastic okay thanks roya what's the next step so now please put this one on the fridge if you have this cheese i hope some one of you just have this cheese put this one on the fridge because we need this one a little bit cold can we press liquid out of our cheese or just just let it drip a little bit did you hear that roia alaina is asking if you can press um if do you need to press the liquid out of the cheese or did you just leave it to drip off no if that's if the the cheese on the strainer just keep stir that keep stirring up to all the water drain just leave it yeah just we don't need very too hard just like soft cheese okay great is that clear elena elana sorry yeah brilliant okay all right raul raueah what's the next step next step we will prepare together syrup our syrup okay yeah we need to prepare the syrup two cup of hot water 2 cup of hot water 1 cup great this is second one fantastic if you guys have any questions on the live stream please do uh write them in to row here um or also just put your comments down how are you doing carolina uh ravia we can use this shirt for any middle east sweet yeah i mean any kind of sweet you can use this cheddar or serum we call it or sweet any kind i just put it after when i finish from use it i put it in a jar and close it close it too good and keep it for one month two months we had the question before about the ghee how many spoons did you use with the gear you said for one for pastry from this one we need 200 gram 200 gram of ghee okay and another question is instead of fresh milk uh for the cheese can you use yogurt yogurt no no no yogurt um yogurt sour and different yogurt maybe we melt it's leak with a little bit when you use it with this one i said maybe we can use mascarpone this is amazing one to use with this kind of past pastry instead of uh that cheese made with milk yeah that's nicer when you mix miscarbony with this cheese what we prepared before right thank you and now one two cup of hot water with one cup of sugar okay sorry sorry we need sorry again two or one two cup of sugar with one cup of one cup of water okay so that's two cups of sugar to one cup of water everybody two cups of sugar to one cup of water other way round um yeah just so you want more sugar than you want hot water again we have two cup of sugar with one cup of hot footage brilliant thank you each two cup we need one cup of water and now together just melt all of these together until all the sugar melted smell fantastic now heat and now on the medium heat until all the sugar melts and then just leave it after boiling five minutes after boiling okay we can add some aromatic thick with the syrup ravia sorry again hannah we can add the other aromatic maybe spices like cinnamon like cardamom for this for this sweet i will use frozen water i will use yeah this is amazing and this is give for our syrup very very nice taste and we can use as well and we need to use again my uh my today ingredients i said uh now i will tell you why we will use this one with the uh with our syrup yeah but if you want to add if you want to add the cinnamon or any taste that's depend whatever you want but for this um pastry or for this way always be with this one or rose water you know there is difference to time was water or lots of water so you can use one of these but this is very tasty and smell very very nice in my country if you have any pain for uh tommy you can just put a little from this one with the hot warm we can say warm uh water and drink in the morning sounds good thanks and go they always give this one for the young kids or uh or for use for you if you want very tasty mmm sounds like it oh i'm getting hungry already my favorite smell rose water but i don't do you know what is the difference between rose water and birds and water i think there's a slight smell more of an aromatic flowery smell yeah but it's very very similar very very fair and then rose water this is like any a rose in a when you can smell but this is especially in the middle east this rose you can't find it anywhere this rose white rose this is white flower you can't find it anywhere and now i try to just to grow this one in my garden i'm always awesome i can't found it so i'm asked just from amazon to bring this one brilliant okay how is everyone's sugar doing you're dissolving the sugar everybody staring yeah yes do your family like this dessert yeah yeah this family favorites for my sorry this dessert it's uh my my dad very very love this i love this one too much um and i remember when we have when we all my me and my sisters just go to my dad i remember just always he go to the shop and bring this sweet it's not too heavy it's very fluffy and crispy and you keep one pair you can eat one piece to eat we don't feel any bad things when you eat this one great oh i can't wait that sounds so exciting and see the sugar no sugar you can't see sugar all the sugar milk melted great please and now now like any syrup i don't know if you prepare syrup before like any syrup do don't be sticky don't be caramel we should to add any a kind of salad you can use um a little bit from lemon juice or a little bit pinch of citrus i said you can use as well okay this is very important so the citric acid or the lemon you can use a tiny pinch of it into your syrup so that it doesn't become that sticky caramel you want it to be very very kind of viscous very very loose if if you try if you try sometimes or you sometimes just uh you want to make syrup and just forget to put this one if you next day you will find all of these like one pieces just stuck on your pan so this one that's allowed to that's happened right because i think the combination about citrix syrup it's it's to keep the syrup liquid this the way we should put a little bit of citric okay so if we just watch raueah she's just putting that citric acid into the sugar and water a teaspoon on the syrup and again step keep stirring actually put a teaspoon of citric acid or half a teaspoon half teaspoon thank you yeah because don't we don't need this one too sour just a little bit how much lemon juice how much lemon juice just one tablespoon one tablespoon of lemon juice great now you start boiling just leave it two minutes two minutes is it still on the heat raulia on the heat great and wow look at that so it's bubbling yeah and then you will use one tablespoon of floss and water okay one tablespoon of blossom water or if you're using rose water if you prefer and now now you can smell if you have this one you can smell very very very very nice small with this one what does this smell like yeah i love this one ours i don't know but this is like kind of flower amazing do you have a good memory of it rauria or anyone i have any problem uh always just depend this one i'm putting next to his nose when he smells like he's like that's helped you to wake up really use this one like anything so when you feel dizzy when you feel you are not good just drink this water with the flour some water or just smell this one we have the steam we have a similarity yeah we used for for any baby vinaigrette but one tablespoon of blossom water that's one tablespoon of blossom water just to repeat those instructions there but i think hopefully have saha get a little bit of cheese yes has been successful in getting cheese apparently they left it in the pots just untouched and they managed to get some cheese so well done guys you did great fantastic way yeah yeah i'm so happy good uh we've got the question uh one second on the live stream yes from the live stream if instead if we can use um lemon juice or orange juice in uh in a syrup but i think you said something sour like lemon juice or citric acid yeah yeah lemon juice but not orange juice different taste yeah orange juice yeah yeah but lemon juice that's it's work yeah in the past just they use uh they don't have citric acid just use lemon juice but citric acid nuts and now it's quickly you can use it and more effect because i think because it's chemical things so that's the effect too much yeah quickly more than more than juicy so now our syrup is ready and our cheese in the fridge now i will switch on my oven and start to prepare my okay so i need to switch on your oven to what um temperature 200 200 degrees yeah degrees yeah 200. 200 degrees everybody switch on your ovens and we're going to prepare the pastry and this is our you can use any name but i prefer to be fresh one but from the fridge from just um not frozen i mean just i'll be about one today and it's uh very very soft not too hard always i'm excited about the day i don't want this one from too long time three months four months just i prefer this one at least one month before great raw how long should the syrup boil for is it around five minutes the syrup after boiling just and we are switching off the uh no we are switch off the oven when we bought plus some water okay so you switch off the heat elana when the blossom water went in so if you just turn off the syrup now it should be still quite like water so it shouldn't be sticky it shouldn't be caramelized okay once it's ready to prepare this one okay so if everyone's got their um pastry it doesn't have to look like this one that raw has you can have any kind of shop bought one but it can be fresh or if you took it from frozen you just have hopefully defrosted it before sophie's got a nice one there i can see so if you just want to hold that up that looks good yes you can uh just you can have rectangle one or square one great great so which ones have you got have you got a aha good stuff yeah well she has buff past three ah do you have puff pastry no filo nice we actually did have somebody who had a puff pastry before but it was okay oh sophie that looks great yeah your cheeks that's too good well done preparing to drain all the water and just on the fridge now in this time so sophie just uh stir it a little bit more just to drain the water and then put it in the fridge to cool down right well done may i show you my cheese to see if it's okay yes roya can you have a look at the cheese i think alana did the best this one please can you keep it on the fridge okay yeah thank you that looks amazing well done we got this cheese oh wow we have some good chefs here tonight yeah so three of them they have a cheese yes yes i think so i think so i think i'm gonna check back on veronica and mike in a little bit see if they're see if they're uh coconut milk curdled uh oh mike is doing the counselling sign well at least we had a bit of an experiment now we know now my doll this is i think 20 layers of this dough this one very very ready if you can see this one i'm very sensitive so be careful when you try it when you use it very sensitive yes easy to tear yeah just now we have this rectangle shape we can use all or if you want to use just half this one that depends how many uh one you want to eat this one uh after you prepare this if you don't want to use all of these just you can hold it um put it in like any bed on the fridge you can use it later in the fridge and you can use it later now a ruler please if you have a ruler we can use any uh sushi stick or any stick you have in your kitchen ah like a chopstick if you didn't have a ruler or just measure depend about your eyes i major so we have we have this pastry like rectangle shape i uh now i will to cut this one for a small not a small medium square i don't like to be very small or very uh too big so i will cut this one for 9 centimeter this one for 9 centimeters you can use sharp knife or just pizza cutter okay fantastic i prefer to use this one that's this one easier and now here we can put with nine like this nine then cut this one all on the tallest one brilliant so that's nine centimeters across and then cut that strip down you should check before you cut that the uh with its sides toward this corner fold this corner that corner to have square and then cut okay so fold the corner over and then cut where the edge is there so we have this square from 20 layers brilliant how many square we will have for all the dough that depends uh how many how many one they want uh to eat to cut this one if you have too many people you can just make small one small pieces not too big you can six meter um just for this what we are prepared this one for eight people okay eight people okay so now uh prepare your tray oven tray and now i will make another square in front of you if you just watch how raw is doing it she's just folding over like a triangle to make it equal and then cutting along and look the last one as well square so you can just fold it fold this one to have triangle shape brilliant like this and then i will put on the tray like this after you fold this one this tie with the opposite one i will put this one wonderful how many layers of pastry are together right here ready how many do you have more than one layer together for the pastry twenty how many one two twenty layers can i just say i will yeah it's 20 20 layers there half sir 20 layers if you have less don't worry the same things don't worry if you have some some pastry 15 layers some pastry 10 layers that's it's work don't worry about that okay brilliant as long as there's some layers yeah depends which type of the dough do you have a layer yeah yes yes so as long as there's some layers that's fine you can't get history from any big middle east shop from turkey shop from several store or worldwide you can fold it in the fridge in can you do can you maybe manage to do the dough at home homemade dough feel good yeah especially in our country is a lot of this about this pastry they make different the kind of syrian sweet or in the middle east swede with just depend about this pastry they filling you can use anything i said before you can use pistachio or not or any kind of cheese but this is popular not like when we came here everything's um i think um like uh donuts um and cake it's too popular here more than so all my friends now start to prepare this sweet in their home because they miss this sweet sometimes you can't find it with some shop here but it's too expensive to eat on this one not like before great so your oven should be getting quite hot now as you're cutting off the pastry and you've got your syrup on one side don't worry it's not solidifying because it's got that acid in it and you've got your ghee as well hopefully you've got your cheese in the fridge so all of your elements should be coming together now for this uh gorgeous pastry do you need to oil the oven tray or say that again sir do you need to put any oil or on the oven tray or is it fine in this moment in this moment just cut all the pastry like this shape and put on that oven tray without any things okay yeah just like this leave it you're one step ahead so um i just will do this one and what i have here i will just again try again to fold it and put it on the with you have it in the material i put it like this to don't be dry right so if you want to use up all of your pastry please do um and but arauja is just doing a small she's just doing eight for a sample now but please make as much as you like if you don't want to make all of it just wrap it up in a towel as you can see um there and you can leave it there so it stopped and drying out i have some exciting news you have some exciting news who's that is that is that joe yeah i have some cheese finally finally we will have four oh well done joe fantastic so about this about this pastry if you want to continue today and to do this one today just keep to do like what i teach you but if you don't want to use today just please put a container or any um hard bag and put on the fridge okay or next day you can use it now everyone here after we make this shape of a rectangle a triangle sorry i will tell all of this ghee on the top of this pastry like this this one so using a spoon just pour all of that ghee all over the pastry there don't worry if it slops over the sides that's really absolutely fine i want it drenched don't worry about and you wish to cover all of these pieces because i think the ghee will give the the square a little bit of crispy yes to make this pastry come up don't forget 200 gram of this ghee for whole this pastry now we will use just half of the tart yeah just half of this pastry so you should be making if you're quick you should have made 16 of those triangles and then you'll put all of that ghee on if you're only doing eight just put half joe can i just check something because i was so excited about my cheese i missed an instruction so with the squares of pastry am i now cutting them into triangles no um you are following them over see them yeah yeah okay after we we covered all of these pastry i will put this one uh in my oven 200 degrees for 15 minutes great 200 degrees you're folded over squares for 15 minutes into your oven fantastic raw yeah just to let you know about some comments from the live stream so uh people are saying it looks delicious and they definitely want to make it in the future and they many of them they want to try to make cheese and i am sure they will love this one more than what and when they can found in the show definitely and people if you're watching from the live stream if you go to the video description you can click on the uh ingredients list there and you can make it rowi's delicious pastry at home and follow this video back at another what's the next step between my uh our pastry in the oven where we will bring the cheese from the fridge and mix the cheese with mr bunny to prepare the filling great so we're going to do the filling now everybody so if you've got cheese you're going to mix it now with the mascarpone if you haven't got cheese you're just going to use the mascarpone and rawria if they haven't got cheese should they flavor the mascarpone with blossom water yeah if you don't have a cheese today we are so sorry about that but you can i'm sure if you try that many times don't you try with one or two liters just to try with one cup of milk when you want to try many time to get the cheese try every day maybe with different kind of milk one cup of milk dry maybe i'm sure one time that will be happened if you don't have just use miscarbony mixed with blossom water and a little bit sugar pinch of sugar if you want if you don't want that sale not necessarily but now if you get the cheese just make it cheap miscarbony and my family just this one they put uh plus some water and a little bit sugar one table teaspoon sugar and just um use this one for the filling for me i'm i think because they don't have mr money in their country but i think this is too tasty together make this one more tasty so this is your own adaptation so you're taking mascarpone because you like it um rather than what your family has made before that's great i think as well the milk might be more more heavy more full fat well more rich more than this milk because the i remember the this one it changed to yellow color not like white color because this may be the test it's more clear like what we have now we can use the creamy cheese instead of mascarpone yes yes you can you can use as yeah like philadelphia philadelphia but without any herbs or without any taste yeah oh yeah that would be weird but use this one half of this one mr bonnie and mix together maybe jamal wants to add paprika here yeah maybe jamal is obsessed with his paprika already no no please no paprika with this dish and now we have like heavy cream wow looks gorgeous looks really nice so yeah originally that dessert doesn't have mascarpone is that right it's just cheese no no no i said before in our countries with my mom as well um all the families just depend about the cheese what they get from the milk right yeah now i would to take you uh two tea tablespoons of floss and water teaspoon two teaspoons there or blossom water with a little bit of sugar just like this lovely how does it smell veronica does it smell nice yeah mike you think it smells great fantastic good stuff good stuff open just to check the oven don't forget we need yeah the pastry change to the golden or a little bit brown color brilliant if you smell this one this one it's ready yeah yeah fantastic how is everybody doing there has everyone got their pastries in the oven has everyone got their uh cream or cheese mixed together with blossom water yes yes good good elena that's fine i haven't done the cheese step yet because i was um late with the other things so what do i do i mix mix the mascarpone with how much orange butter blossom water one two one one teaspoon one tablespoon of tablespoon so just the cheese and one tablespoon of blossom water yeah thank you this one to be to remember this one you can use it if you use all the full uh pastry all the full pastry yeah half so i will use half of this one if you need one so joe you'll be mixing it with your um you'll actually be mixing it with your cheese that you made as well yeah but my my cheese is a bit hot oh i see i see i see don't worry leave it to cool pop it in the fridge yeah um and then actually leave it to cool and we're going to be doing the pistachios next all right yeah so don't worry we're not filling just yet so pop it in the fridge now and then you can do that step afterwards yeah okay thank you no problem and please now shake the oven don't forget the pastry if you can see we need more if you can see we need this one more to be golden colors needs more time yeah so it's not golden enough okay so back in then we need 15 minutes yeah okay we need another five minutes just five minutes then that's what we ready after we prepare our filling and we need a pistachio you can buy pistachio whole pistachio you can't find it or just you can i don't know i'm about me i don't found this one crushed so i bought this one whole pieces of pistachio then i crushed this one for medium size i don't want this one very fine so because that i'm not use it uh blender one uh just i use my uh all the way just to uh to smash this one for medium size can you show them how to do it rauha is that okay yes i use uh look like this size i need uh we on my my old way i have this uh these pieces you can use this one ruler for this one or you can use i don't know we use always this one yeah brush all of these like this to have a lid because it's the traditional one to go everywhere so my advice for you just to put a pistachio on the bag and close it then start to use one this one just to crush all station fantastic okay so everyone working with it i can see veronica and mike with their very fancy are you cheating or is that very clever i'm not sure just a little bit chunky now after that as well if you go to a super store or any uh turkish shop you can't find this flower we use this kind fried flour to decoration any kinds like rice pudding this kind of pastry you can use it we buy this one yeah so you can use that or any flowers from your garden optional yeah yeah you can use that's from your garden right yeah yeah yeah this is from my garden beautiful yeah especially this one i love this one too much ah yeah they're beautiful i know them yeah so this is from my garden before the winter it's uh coming yeah uh we can use the almond instead of pistachio for this pastry almond not nice eat color almond brown we need color with white color okay yeah so i think pistachio with green very very nice tasty and very nice when you just present serve this one okay for now my pastry is ready and we have good nice so i will leave it for just five minutes to be cold a little bit more switch they look very nice and golden and crispy yeah and crispy because this pastry now it's a crispy so we should leave it for five minutes to be warm don't touch this one now it's very crunchy very crispy maybe it's well broken so leave it uh broke so leave it for five ten minutes then we will put the filling inside it okay so you've got your crushed pistachios and you've got your pastry just cooling on the side um if your cheese has cooled down you can mix it now with your

have cooled down now is that right so now this is our pastry and if you feel now it's warm not too hot and we will be prepared our filling and plate to serve serve this one wonderful now we will hold this one and remember we fold it for in the middle from the middle so just we open this one and be careful when you open two not too hard because it's totally crunchy so a little bit like we said like a fish mouth fish now great yeah and i will start what the filling here inside if you if you hear the voice and a little bit press like this a little bit what you have to yeah extra just leave it we need from all the sides so and now we have the secret one how delicious uh things this is the pistachio we covered like this one on this side and this side that's what i said about that nice color yeah yeah i think a big pistachio is better because about the color yeah yeah this one so just put here in your plate and prepare another one the same on everything's with everyone it's okay i think so i'm just gonna go to the screen and see how everyone's doing so just filling it slowly let's just watch rauha one more time and then i'll um go to the participants see how they're doing so rao where they're going to watch you again and now press a little bit then again in our pistachio okay you want to roll it around so you press that pastry down pressing that pastry down and then you want to cut off the corners to then uh dip it into the pistachio sophie already with the filling just to watch ravi do one more well that's too easy one not too difficult but this is sensitive so you should to be careful when you use it when you put the filling you know and right brilliant i can hear them crisping and cracking wonderful wonderful so i think everyone's busy i think everyone's busy folding rauha but if anyone has any questions so far we serve them like this or maybe do you have any other type to serve in the warblers um you mean we can use defense filling no no about the feeling about you we serve we serve the door but like this or maybe we should put it in another side like uh yeah yeah that's that's uh uh as you like what do you like which shape we can use one but as well not in triangle shape you can use them just like um we can we called like uh your finger just like okay yes roll yeah yeah veronica how's it looking veronica let's have a look wow yeah oh nice mario what do you think that's really amazing very very nice mashallah good and annabelle let's see yours oh what do you think rojo i've adapted because the cheese didn't work so thank you so much still looks great yeah good stuff good stuff well done everybody so far so now don't forget we will use the syrup in the end to have a taste yes don't eat it yes i know you're hungry veronica's already eaten her whole plate right and tafsa did you finish let's see how how the family are doing wow well done very nice before some people they can't eat any uh dairy um milk or creamy or anything so you can use this pistachio with a little bit syrup just make like a dough and and put on a fillet fill all this pastry with this pistachio you can eat like this this is more tasty if you can't eat any cheese or any heavy cream okay yeah that's a good idea so for people who can't eat dairy or perhaps if you're vegan yeah that's good my my friends they can't eat any any kind of milk or cheese so always she make her pastry with pistachio carolina have we got any more questions on the live stream uh no questions really but everyone wants to make it now everyone thinks it looks amazing uh some people are worried that this is heavy dessert or oily dessert but raw yeah you said it's quite light right um when you try you can't discuss that's like or no but uh but again we we not eat this sweet every day or every week we eat like one month one time every month so that's not too much not not like kuwasan every day every day or daylights maybe every two days in the weeks so this one just to prepare in in celebration wedding in our eid when we want to visit anyone or if we have any guests so because that when we eat it we miss this one too much so we eat about me just eat one pieces not too much yeah thank you yeah it's like a treat and half star i think have said that the cheese is quite light so now in the end just put some decoration in your dish my best part is the last one the way the most important if you're not going to eat all these right away would you fill them later or do you fill them kind of closer to when you will eat them again sorry again um if you're not going to eat them right away maybe you're going gonna eat them the next day yeah yeah fill them the next day or would you fill them all and then put them in the fridge um for me for uh to advise you if you don't want to eat all of these pieces today don't put the filling today just leave it the pastry out not on the fridge uh and like tomorrow just when you want to eat it put a four or five just a switch off the oven and when that's uh to heat put the pasty for five minutes just after that uh you can do like what we do with the filling and in the end put the syrup we should do what's here but if you leave the pastry inside some of water from this sorry if you leave the cheese inside the pastry some of this water come out maybe and make this one soft it's still delicious but not like when you eat this one crunchy or crispy okay now in the end i will put the serum on the top of this one syrup depend about what do you want do you want this one too too much or just a little bit for me and for my family i prefer to eat this one with a little bit syrup not too much okay okay so drizzle the syrup on the top of these sweets oh wow yeah i can just i can hear it it sounds so beautiful if you don't want this one the smell if you don't want to eat this one now don't put the syrup on the on the top of of the world oh this looks amazing we've got some flower arranging going on as well yeah

thank you bye-bye crazy goodbye bye bye bye everyone", "dVhY8LXd1MU": "summers coming and I hear it's going to be a hotline so today I'm going to show you a quick way to make fresh brewed iced tea Lipton has picked the tea leaves at the peak of freshness and specially blended them to give you the best tasting brewed iced tea so let's get started there's two different methods that we can do today the first one I'm just going to speak to which is called the traditional method you simply take two of the family sized Lipton tea bags and you brew it with 8 cups of boiling hot water for about 3 to 5 minutes once your tea is brewed you simply place it in the refrigerator until it's chilled and ready to enjoy but if you want your iced tea a little quicker than that we've created a great Ice Cube quick chill method this method also starts with the two bags of the family iced tea simply take these two teabags and place them into a heat proof 2 core pitcher once placed in your pitcher simply add 4 cups of boiling hot water instead of it we're going to make up the difference of the water with ice camps just cover and brew for three to five minutes again okay after your teas been brewing for three to five minutes you're going to remove your teabags but again don't forget to squeeze them because that gets all that extra tea goodness great flavor so remove your teabags and now this is the perfect time if you like your tea sweet moon to add the sweetener because your tea is still hot any sweetener you put in here will dissolve perfectly I like to add a little bit of granulated sugar tonight so just give that a little stir now we're ready to chill it down quickly with some ice cubes you're going to take a lung cup measuring cup and simply place it gently into the cup so that looks like roughly 1 cup of cubes I'm going to place 6 cups of ice right into my t 6 then you're going to just stir it and the heat of the hot proof cream will melt down the ice and that will be the perfect amount of water to complement the 4 cups of boiling and you just keep getting it a gentle stir for all the ice cubes stuff there see how quick and easy this is once the ice is mostly melted then you're ready to enjoy just simply pour into your glass and serve there you have it IceCube quick chill freshly brewed iced tea from Lipton mmm it's delicious thanks for joining me you", "mgrqVTJzeD0": "welcome everybody to tune up your eating habits the second in our tune up tuesday series and i am so excited to bring this to you i'm kelly robert journey program manager and i would like to thank all of you for tuning in it's a beautiful day and you could be doing something else i'm glad you're not i'd also like to thank my colleague caitlin moore for helping out with these series and for sam dolezal who's joining us sam is amazing sam is union bank's wellness advocate and she is such a resource to ubt employees and management she has um she has helped build an award-winning wellness program with the support of ubt management so we're really excited to have her here today and you know tune up tuesdays is all about finding things that areas that you need to fine-tune and i don't know about all of you but um my diet is really after a year of self-correct quarantining and the holidays yeah it needs some love so we're asking sam to help out with that go ahead if you have questions type them into the chat feature and we'll have time at the end of the segment to answer any of your pressing issues questions if there's anybody that can help out with your situation i'm sure it's sam so without further ado sam will let you take the floor thanks for coming today wonderful well kelly thank you for the fabulous introduction as well as the great overview and what we're going to talk about today so just to give you all a little bit of background about myself i as kelly mentioned i work at union bank interest i'm the well-being advocate here and so i do a variety of things for the bank such as teaching fitness classes doing nutrition consultations helping with stress management a variety of things and as you can see on your screen there's a photo of me with one of our awards that we won in 2020 when it was nice in this ring and there was leaves on the tree so looking forward to that time coming soon but what are we actually going to dive into today and again as kelly had mentioned we're going to talk about nutrition and so there's a comic on your screen garfield the vet kind of rings the bell for any of you and it goes kids farms are where we get our food cereal fruits vegetables and he asks excuse me sir where might i find the whipped cream trees and we all probably get a little bit of a chuckle out of that because we kind of wish it was true like wouldn't it be nice if whipped cream fell into the category of fruits and veggies i know personally i would get all of my 10 servings and much easier if whipped cream was in that category but nutrition can be complex and it can be confusing and it can be a lot of different things again as kelly had mentioned you know 2021 kind of threw people for a loop and nutrition was one of those things that could have gone out the door and so we're going to talk about how can you get back on track what are some of the small changes you can make to really get your nutrition back to a place where you feel good about it and you feel good about yourself so we are going to cover many habits for big wins so what are some things that you can do on the daily that will ultimately lead you down a path where you're feeling really good about yourself and then the second piece of it is going to be specialized nutrition care so the things we're going to talk about today are really general advice and these would be things that cover just very broad statements for each individual now you may have certain medical conditions or eating habits or things that just make you feel best in general and you may say hey i know that for me personally i need xyz in my life or hey personally you know i really need to watch my carbs or my fats or my proteins and the use of an expert in nutrition such as the registered dietitian can be really helpful especially if you're working through a medical condition or a disorder anything along those lines even for somebody who doesn't necessarily have something like that in their life even just talking to somebody who can really dig deep into your eating habits and walk through you walk through it with you can be super beneficial so we're going to talk about some of those resources as well again the things we're going to talk about today broad overarching kind of themes that can help you live a better life but then again hey if you want to dig deep one-on-one conversations we're going to talk about who you can do that with so many habits what are many habits most of us have a variety of habits one that always comes to mind is we brush our teeth maybe you brush your teeth first thing in the morning right before you go to bed but that's something that is really kind of small you know it doesn't take us a lot of time but over the course of a year let's say you didn't brush your teeth you just didn't do it by the time you finally go to the dentist after a year they're gonna go whoa like we can tell you didn't brush your teeth or you didn't floss kind of same thing with these eating and drinking habits is that if we just do them every day kind of just kind of keep them in the back of our mind is hey you know maybe i should pass up on the fries and get the apple slices um my family always makes fun of me because we go to mcdonald's i'm like i want a kid meal with the apple slices and they're like oh not again and so but some of those small switches can really add up in the long term and so the many habits like i mentioned today are going to be small things small tweaks you can make to kind of just help help your health in the long run so many habits then kind of to give you a visual perspective so on your screen you should see a human body and it's made up of lots of little dots now think of all the things you do throughout the day that are there to help your health whether that's brushing your teeth flossing drinking water you know taking the stairs instead of the elevator parking farther away even just getting out of your chair every hour just to kind of get up and stretch a little bit think of all as many habits as those dots so flossing is a dot and drinking enough water is a dot and pretty soon we get this full picture all these dots start to make up then this bigger picture of a lifestyle and so we go from little habits to lifestyle again going back to kind of that flossing teeth brushing then seeing your dentist if you didn't do it for a full year maybe by the time you go to the dentist you might have a couple of cavities versus if you brush a russian floss it doesn't mean you're not going to have cavities but maybe you'll have less maybe you'll have healthier teeth maybe you'll feel a lot better they'll be whiter so same idea with the eating and drinking kind of aspect is that when we encourage it every day in the long run those little things start to add up so there's actually a kind of theory out there what this is called and it's called the snowball effect so we can start rolling a small snowball slowly add slowly add you've probably done this building the base of a snowman just keep going pretty soon you got a big snowball you have that big base so if we can start with these many habits and just slowly add on slowly keep the good ones going pretty soon we have a fairly healthy lifestyle again there's always going to be those outside circumstances that kind of come into play whether that's hey i went on vacation and my you know some of those habits kind of went out the window while i was gone or you know i ended up needing to have surgery and i wasn't really able to be active the way that i like to be active but again some of those mini habits we kind of get them going and pretty soon we have a fairly healthy lifestyle so we've talked a lot about these many habits what they are why they're important so let's talk about some of the many habits that you can start to implement or maybe you already do so first one is drinking enough water this one is so so vitally important why because all of our systems need water so there isn't a system in our body that doesn't need water to function so if you're thirsty you're more than likely already dehydrated our thirst mechanism just isn't very good at what it does and so it doesn't really start to ring that bell until you are already dehydrated it doesn't say hey you're going to be dehydrated dehydrated soon i'm going to start going now it's oh you are dehydrated now i'm going to start ringing the bell really hard so we understand okay we need water we understand we need to drink water often and it's not a hey i'm thirsty i'll drink a glass of water it's hey i need a glass of water every two to three hours to make sure that i get enough throughout the day now there are different recommendations when it comes to drinking enough water one of those is eight eight ounce eight eight ounce glasses per day so that's 64 ounces in a day that's one that we've probably heard a lot there's another recommendation where it's one ounce of water per one pound of body weight so if you weigh 150 pounds that would mean that you need 150 ounces of water and you might go okay we just went from 64 ounces to now 150 that's a really big difference and again these are recommendations so you are unique every day is unique so you may find that you know during the summer and if you're outside a lot more maybe you're drinking a lot more water you're more active again you're outside you're probably just sweating a lot more going through a lot more water you might find too that hey during the winter i don't really want to drink cold water it's cold outside i don't want to drink cold water i know for me personally that during the winter i drink more water because i tend to drink tea i drink hot tea so for me that works better but again everyone is different and you're gonna have to kind of determine okay how much water do i need again we don't ever want to get to the point where we are thirsty though that means we're already dehydrated so we want to keep drinking water how much you need is very specific that's where those specialized nutrition resources we're going to talk about the end today could become very helpful because they can really narrow down okay this is probably how much you need based on what you're eating what your activity levels are and how much you're currently drinking if you're getting enough so what are some ways to go about doing that say okay i understand i need water maybe you know i'm just not a very good water drinker maybe you drink your two cups of you know coffee in the morning and then you don't drink anything again until lunch and we need to just have some more water in there so what are some ways to get some more water one is ditch sweetened iced tea for regular unsweetened tea we are fortunately maybe sweet tea isn't a big thing here but we can say the same thing about coffee we tend to add creamer and sugar and honey and you know even a couple days ago we were talking about tea different types of tea and adding honey and the things that we like and again you are you are adding fluids into your diet but you're also adding a lot of calories which for some folks they say hey you know i'm just going to have this one glass well then we don't add on a glass of water so if we have something that's you know unsweetened a little bit better for us we tend to ingest more of it so find ways to add variety to your drinks whether that's lemon or adding cucumbers different fruits and veggies even every once in a while grabbing that crystal light if that works for you for some folks are like i don't necessarily like the taste of it but adding a little bit of jazz again like i said i'm a hot tea drinker that's what works for me so number three carry a full water bottle with you that is one of my hugest examples carry it with you take it with you i went somewhere and all the water fountains were closed i didn't have my water bottle with me and i was thirsty and i didn't necessarily want to leave and go buy something and they didn't have a vending machine and that's just kind of like i should have just brought my water bottle i would have been a lot better off and so have it with you i've even gotten into the habit of carrying an empty one so at least i have a container at least i can carry it so if i do find a water fountain or if there's a kitchen that i can get into and at least fill it up then i have it with me number four drink a full glass before or during each meal so again focus on drinking that water continuously throughout the day we don't necessarily want to say hey i drink at each meal and that's it again we want to make sure we have it continuously throughout the day but again another great way is make sure hey by the end of my meal i need to make sure that i have a full glass of water and again we can always count coffee we can count tea we can count milk we can count juices but really we want to focus on just water why just water again when we start to get other things added we add calories we add sweeteners we add all these other things so we just really want to encourage the drinking of more plain h2o so there's habit number one for us habit number two eat a rainbow the rainbow on your screen is not the rainbow i'm talking about though as much as we might enjoy saying hey i can eat that kind of rainbow that is not the rainbow i'm talking about what rainbow am i talking about when i say eat a rainbow for your bitty habit it is fruits and vegetables eat a rainbow fruits and veggies you might say okay why fruits and vegetables depending on their colors do have a variety of vitamins and minerals and so when we get a variety of color we tend to get a variety of those vitamins and minerals as well essentially rounding out our diet so you may say hey i am a person who is apples bananas oranges cucumbers tomatoes whatever else i can grow in my garden during the summer and that is a-okay again we want to focus on things that you also enjoy add a couple creative pieces in there as well but again we want the full range of colors so i always go back to little kids are like i don't want anything green on my plate i don't want salad or green beans or peas or brussels sprouts and again when we take out a color we kind of take out this whole chunk of vitamins and nutrients that we can get from other sources but again when we ensure that we have that full color plate that we're also getting that full vitamin and mineral scope as well so let's just talk through some of the options because sometimes we walk in the grocery store there's about 6 000 different options and we pick up our usual favorites i know i am totally that way i get apples i get bananas i get oranges and then i steer my cart out of the produce place because i have other places to be so fruits left hand side of your screen i broke them down in three categories so the first one is fan favorites ones that probably pop up into your mind when we start talking about fruit apples bananas oranges and peaches so those are four trident truths again ones that you've probably had you probably enjoy but maybe they aren't you know really accessible to you or ones that maybe come up first pears pineapple blueberries raspberries cherries and strawberries and then new kids on the block these are ones that again you've probably had but maybe they're not necessarily over abundantly available to you or maybe you haven't had them they might be new to you kiwi jackfruit is another one that i've seen lately so there are some fruit options and as you can see there that's just a handful that's that's not the full listing of fruit that's available but again kind of think outside of the box when it comes to those fruits and veggies vegetables fan favorites iceberg lettuce corn green beans and cucumbers again ones that i know they are on our table on a weekly basis at least again we like them they pair well with other foods but we can also try those tried and trues peas asparagus tomatoes peppers onions and then the new kids on the block things like brussels sprouts avocados again ones that are becoming more common people are getting creative and trying out fruits and veggies in different ways these listings aren't necessarily designed in any which fashion it's just to help you see that hey you might come up with your top two or three that you normally get but there are tons of others out there and these were ones that again just kind of came to mind in terms of what's crossed our table in the last month so what are ways to actually get more fruits and veggies in your diet especially when we talk about a color range so prepare fruits and veggies for easy snacking later in the week i heard this from a registered dietitian once she has a household with four kids in it she just keeps a relish tray in her fridge just a full socked relish tray when they come home from school she takes it outside it's on the table that's their snack she puts peppers in there snap peas baby carrots even like the baby corn they like and so just having some of that stuff prepared and ready to go can be super super helpful i know even our house sometimes that pre-packaged stuff is really nice um the applesauce squeeze packets that are met maybe for little kids oh yeah we go through a lot of those and mainly because they're accessible they're easy i can throw them in my work bag take them with me they can be in the fridge they make them where they're you know peach apple and banana apple they make ones that are just veggies but again just making sure that you have those fruits and veggies prepared so that they're there for easy snacking so when you open the fridge you go oh yeah that sounds good pull it out whatever it may be have a stocked pantry with both with brush frozen and canned options now a lot of times we think fresh is the best and that may be the best option for you and it may not be i know that after i've had a busy day and i don't really feel like cooking the last thing i want to do is cut up a head of lettuce and so those freezer steamable bags they're about two to four portions pop one of those in the microwave a lot of times we'll do like tacos and corn or we will do like burgers and a baked potato and then brussels sprouts again last time we went it was 10 for 10 and i was like okay you pick out 20 of them because we have one almost every night but it's just nice option then instead of saying hey you know we're just gonna make macaroni and cheese and burgers we can at least say hey if we're gonna have macaroni and cheese at least then we can have peas too or green beans or whatever you enjoy again they make a lot of different options and they're designed for probably one to two people the portion sizes aren't huge in those steamable bags so make sure that you have stuff on hand pick items you enjoy you're more likely to eat them one of my friends just really wanted to like spinach kept buying spinach and it kept going bad in his fridge and he's like sam what do i do i'm like you quit buying spinach you don't like it you don't eat it quit buying spinach so pick things that you enjoy ultimately food and nutrition as a whole is something that we should really look forward to and enjoy and so if you know you've tried brussels sprouts and you just don't like them don't buy brussels sprouts buy something you do like again now we don't necessarily want to be super picky and we want to keep that rainbow going so if you're like hey i really like peppers maybe buy the orange and yellow peppers instead if you like potatoes maybe try a sweet potato if you're like hey i really like salads that's kind of your jam mix it up get the spring mix try maybe a prepackaged salad that has cabbage in it again there's lots of different options but pick things that you're going to enjoy so that you will ultimately end up eating them because they don't do us a lot of good if they tend to just get freezer burnt or if they go bad in our fridge so add vegetables to come inside to common side items for a kind of pop of color and that boost of nutrition so like i mentioned when we make tacos we usually have corn and black beans or even refried beans when we do salads i always say hey do you want peas do you want you know the different things that we can add again taco salads is one that i we spend a lot of time making because we do the tomatoes we do the onion we do the lettuce we do all those things but you can add vegetables to common side items even like rice adding in a core or a can of corn to rice you really don't notice it but you get a little bit of color and then a little bit more of those veggies so those are the swaps for my um i had to shift so i could see my other screen um those are the swaps the last one that i have is less is more and what does that mean is that sometimes the less processing we have the better so you might really like the like instant mashed potatoes but they usually come with a lot of salt so if you're like i really like potatoes just do a baked potato you don't necessarily have to have instant or you know double nash baked potatoes with bacon and cheese in them again they're really good that way but sometimes less is more same thing with even some of those steam mobile bags a lot of times we just add pepper and then just a touch of salt so we don't add butter or oil or anything and as long as we pull it out cut it open and eat it right away it's really good so we don't necessarily have to add it or make it more processed to make it enjoyable so many habit number one is drinking enough water many habit number two is getting those fruits and vegetables and for the day kick over to my next slide here mini habit number three is smack snacking smart now snacking is one of those things that can be super helpful and it can be one of those things that sends our good day kind of into a spiral because we just continue to snack and continue to snack so i know that my brothers they love the fruit snack packets and they're great but they start with one and then one turns into two and then two turns into four and pretty soon the box is empty and it's like okay guys you should have just kind of stuck with one because then they kind of started that spiral so how do we go about snacking smartly now snacking like i mentioned it can be your friend and why so snacks can help tie us between meals by stabilizing our blood sugar so our mood our overall kind of feeling again our body needs that sugar and those nutrients to continue to function properly and when we create really big highs and really deep lows then we kind of start to get this wave in our energy levels and our mood and so on the right hand side of your screen you can see a chart it shows the snacks and where there's just a little bit of a bump just enough to kind of help keep it nice and stable and we don't have this big drop after lunch or after dinner now snacks can also be an effective way to get those additional fruits and veggies and again if you're one of those individuals who's like hey i need to get more calcium in or i need you know a certain nutrient that you need more of even like some of us need a little bit more protein depending on activity levels and needs maybe that's a good time you know to get out the apple and peanut butter just enough to kind of keep you going and get those additional nutrients in snacks are not a must though so for some of us it's hey i'm really good i kind of have a late lunch and then an early dinner and my meals are spaced out appropriately that i don't need a snack or maybe i don't want to snack but snacks can be helpful in building a better nutrition plan for your day so personally i know i usually have a snack about 3 30 4. if i don't have that snack by the time i get to dinner i am just starving and i just go overboard like instead of two tacos it's four tacos a bunch of corn and i'm halfway through my meal and i'm like this was a bad choice i should have stuck with the two tacos i should have had a snack and i would have been set up better so again snacks can be helpful but they are not a must in our day and kick over to my next slide and don't let the snacks derail you kind of like with my fruit snack example and we're looking at our screen we see on the left left-hand side there's you know the fruits the veggies kind of those baby carrots and we think okay great snack now we see donuts on the right and we don't necessarily want snacks to lead us down that dark path where the rest of our day just ends up for a free for all but you know the donuts will give us the energy but maybe not the long-term energy and the nutrients and vitamins that we really need to get through the rest of our day in an optimal matter now you might say sam but that one donut has blueberries on it and it does but that same donut also has a ton of added sugar so i'm not saying stay completely away from the donut stay away completely from the things that you enjoy but just know that hey is this the best choice for me does this make the most sense for me i know personally what works best for me in terms of snacks and you probably have thought that through as well you've probably had snacks that you know hey that was right about perfect you know like granola bar was really nice and led me into dinner well or hey if i snack it just ends up not being the best choice for me for whatever reason so don't let snacks derail you but again they do serve a purpose so i just really like this image again when i saw the donut with the blueberries like that is perfect because i tend to think that when i'm like but pizza has tomatoes and veggies and stuff on it and it does but there's also a lot of other things that go along with it too so suggestions for smart snacking a left-hand side of your screen according to the usda this is kind of their parameters for a snack is it needs to be rich in whole grains or contain at least a fourth a cup of fruits and veggies so rich in whole grains or have the fruits and veggies and it needs to be less than 200 calories so that's kind of their parameter for a snack now we don't necessarily have to follow that to a t 100 again we want something that's going to work for us and everyone is so unique in their you know activities and what you need but there are some snacks on the right side of your screen that kind of fall into those parameters so the first one is an apple and two tablespoons of peanut butter so again we have our fruit and veggie component your peanut butter is going to have some protein some healthy fats to kind of tide you through that afternoon a banana and eight ounces of milk i know that's one that i tend to go to it's really fast it's easy and again we get that fruit and veggie component and then with the milk we get a little bit of protein and some fat again to titus carrots and some vegetable dip again kind of going back to that prepare those fruits and veggies so they're easy to grab easy to snack on again i actually bought a relish tray container that we keep in our fridge because yes i'm one of those people where especially when i have leftover veggies from something whether that's hey i made chicken noodle soup and i have you know some celery and some green peppers and just random stuff i just put it in the relish tray and it works out perfectly so that's a great snack and then the last one is a container of greek yogurt and then a handful of berries so those little greek yogurt containers they're usually about 100 to 120 calories throw some blueberries on there maybe a couple cut up strawberries and you're good to go so again as you see each one of these has the fruit and veggie component we're around that 200 calorie mark and then we also have you know either some of those whole grains tossed in or some healthy fats and proteins so we've gone through three healthy habits again we've kind of talked through some of these swaps when it comes to snacking keep those snackable fruits and veggies in the fridge the prepackaged items kind of talking about like the applesauce where they can be really helpful to just grab and go ditch the granola bar anything when we talk about snacks sometimes though is that there tends to be other things just like that donut yes it has blueberries but it has other things added sugars the preservatives maybe some of those things you don't necessarily want in your diet so ditch some of those pre-packaged things though for things you can make homemade so if you are you know baker a chef granola bar you can make energy balls there's usually three to five ingredients in them again you know what's in them you know what you need you know what you like so you can make it to what you need to be choose whole wheat crackers or popcorn for a fast and tasty snack popcorn is actually a whole grain which makes sense when we start to think about hey it's you know one grain we pop it but again great option 200 calories or less though so we can have quite a bit of popcorn especially if there's no butter on it quite a bit of popcorn to stay within that 200 calorie mark and then the last one pre-portion out your snacks you can simply grab and go snack bags are great little containers are great again some of those pre-packaged items can be super helpful but again ultimately don't let the snacks derail you we want them to be helpful not hindering for us when we start to talk about our nutrition so know okay what is working best for me if you know hey the apple and peanut butter works it works if it doesn't try out a couple other options to see if something does work better and again maybe you're just not sure you're like you know sometimes i have a snack sometimes i don't i don't really know those specialized nutrition resources at the end of this presentation that we'll talk through again that one-on-one individual attention and talking through what you need can be super super helpful so we'll talk through those as well okay many habit number four move every day and yes every day now you're probably thinking this is the nutrition presentation why are we talking about exercise now so exercise and nutrition do go hand in hand so let's talk about why so exercise aids in regulating appetite so again when we exercise it can help kind of like stabilize us in some capacity i know for me personally too getting outside and getting away for a little bit can help me to just kind of settle into the day so i am a notorious walker i am out there treading it along especially with my too many aussies and that always just helps especially if i've had a day that's either been kind of stressful or just kind of unsettling in some capacities had a lot going on and i know the first thing i want to do is open the fridge door and eat the fudge that's in there that's been in there since christmas i know hey if i go on a walk settle a little bit come back inside get drink water just kind of work through my day a little bit it can be super beneficial so exercise can help in motivating adults to make healthier food choices now sometimes again think back to that snowball when we start to add in those little habits more little habits start to come and we get this healthy lifestyle so if we exercise and say hey i'm really proud of what i did today and i want to keep those good vibes going then we start to make healthier food choices sometimes we start to create almost like this why and we start to go in one direction when we just don't eat so well or exercise so great or some of those other health habits are to fall to the wayside everything starts to go with it so if we exercise again kind of stabilize our day a little bit we tend to make better food choices and then finally the amount we exercise or that we're physically active tends to decrease as we age so activity goes down where as the older we get the fat mass we have tends to go up so activity goes down fat mass goes up as we get older now exercise and nutrition both play a role in our body composition so how much lean mass we have how much bone mass we have and how much fat mass we have and so if you are concerned about body composition exercise and nutrition can be helpful in working towards the place that you want to be and so again anytime we start talking about activity and eating we need to also be cognizant of hey it does have other roles as well simply versus simply just you know burning calories so activity does have quite a bit to do with nutrition and as we kind of dig into this a little bit deeper we'll start to find that hey you know when i do exercise you might do a better job of eating or even just drinking water i know personally i always have a full water bottle with my you know workout and when i don't do that i tend to not drink any just because i don't have it so let's talk about suggestions for getting that physical activity in focus on what you can do now again kind of going to match that frozen veggies if it's not your jam it's not your jam no one is saying hey in order for you to be physically active you have to run a half marathon that is not the consensus here it's focused on what you can do so if you enjoy yoga and that is your jam keep it going if you're like i really don't want to be in a gym i have no interest in a gym membership i really like walking they keep your walking going if it's hey you know i just really like walking and talking with my friend that's fine even if it's like hey i'm going to make a couple laps around my apartment just inside my apartment you know walk to the fridge and back 10 times even five times focus on what you can do because ultimately doing something is better than doing nothing now again when we start to talk about some of these things everyone is so different and needs are different and ones are different and so you also need to be cognizant of what is going to work for you what is safe for you and what makes sense for you second suggestion choose activities you enjoy now here's a list of things these are all things that i've tried and i've enjoyed so dancing walking cheer yoga aerobics treadmill walking sometimes having that support is helpful water aerobics one of my favorite classes biking fitness classes everything is a great option again we're not saying hardcore exercise it's simply being physically active simply moving the act of moving your body so choose things that you enjoy whatever that may be and then be creative so think outside of the box a little bit if you've taken the same route while walking maybe walk it backwards maybe take a new route maybe try asking a friend again kind of create new ways if it's hey i haven't been able to get outside it just hasn't been very nice out what can you do inside what can you do again to be active maybe it's just walking back and forth to the fridge maybe it's hey i'm gonna you know stand up out of my chair and then sit down 10 times in my chair again the goal here is to be active and to move there's no specific way to go about doing that though so there are a couple of suggestions for you to be physically active again it doesn't relate in maybe the way that we think it fits to nutrition but it does play a pretty large role when we talk about nutrition so wanted to make sure that we have that in there as well many habit number five kick added sugar to the curb now added sugar is in a lot of things we're going to talk about a lot of those things today and one of the things with added sugar is that it's not necessarily good or bad which we're going to talk about next so as we walk through this just kind of keep those ears and eyes open and just kind of take this piece in because added sugar gets a really bad rap sometimes again we really like it it's in a lot of things it's not always very good for us though so we're going to talk through it and again just keep those ears and eyes open as we talk through this today so we hear added trigger block what is added sugar so left hand side of your screen added sugar is exactly what it sounds like sugar that has been added to products so things like ketchup granola i've even seen it in yogurt so sugar that is added so it's not supposed to be there or wasn't originally there now this sugar tends to be heavily processed and refined so again think of your white table sugar that you would add to like cookies or even like banana bread stuff like that that's the type of sugar we're talking about one of the catches with added sugar is it doesn't always compare with other nutrients so when we add sugar to say ketchup it doesn't necessarily come with fiber or vitamin d or vitamin b it just comes as added sugar that's the only thing that they add now naturals to sugar so around the right hand side of your screen this is found in foods that we find slightly sweet so think of oranges apples honey again natural sugar it was already there to begin with now this pairs well with other nutrients such as fiber in the food so we're going to use an apple for example an apple has naturally occurring sugar but it also has naturally occurring fiber so there's peel in the fiber of the apple so even though you're having that sugar the other nutrients of vitamins in the product either a help stabilize your blood sugar make sure you're getting the proper nutrients that you need as well as feeling your body properly so the difference between added sugar and natural sugar laid out on your screen added sugar doesn't always have a great place in society but we do tend to add it to things to make them taste better we've gotten really used to things tasting a certain way that when we take the added sugar out we're like ugh this doesn't taste very good but when i have this conversation about added sugar i usually ask people when was the last time you had a tomato and it tasted really sweet like ketchup sweet because when we start to think about that a tomato doesn't really taste like ketchup ketchup is sweet i always think of the little kids where they dip their french fry in the ketchup and suck the ketchup off and then dip for more ketchup they don't want the french fry they want the ketchup but it's because ketchup is sweet ketchup has sugar in it and so when we start to think about some of those things we go oh that makes a lot more sense you'll see now though that going back to the ketchup example there are no sugar added less sugar added options out there so that might be an option for you if you're concerned about how much added sugar you're getting but we're going to keep going on added sugar so difference between added sugar and natural sugar we've covered then and let's talk about how you know if something has added sugar and natural sugar so this is a nutrition label and if we go down to the really thick black line right above that is protein and then right above that it says includes two grams of added sugars now a couple years ago the food and drug administration essentially made this change that shows how many grams of added sugars are in something now that doesn't always necessarily include all the sugar so as we see above that it says total sugars 2 grams so naturally in this specific product there's two grams of natural sugars and two grams of added sugars so that's where we can see if there's added sugars to the product now again you may find that something like if you go into a local you know bakery or even like a restaurant if you order something you may say well they don't have nutrition labels it's for the most part usually pretty straightforward and what has added sugars and won't do it and you can always ask but again if something doesn't taste like its base product it probably has something added to it to make it taste better so again go back to that ketchup and you know tomato example there was something added when they took that tomato and made it into ketchup to make it taste better to make us want to eat it so let's kind of turn this into an example so we're going to use the example of instant oatmeal versus old-fashioned oatmeal so left-hand side of your screen this is old-fashioned oatmeal and we are simply looking at the added sugars that are in this product so we're not going to dive into the rest of the nutrition label again we go to that thick black bar on the bottom above it it says protein five grams and then above it it says include zero grams of added sugars so this old-fashioned oatmeal has no added sugars to it if we look above that there's one gram of naturally occurring sugar in the product okay so old-fashioned oatmeal no sugar added it has a little bit of natural sugar in it though right hand side of your screen this is instant oatmeal so this would be those paper quaker oat packets that are delicious i promise you i fully enjoy them again go back to that thick black bar we see above it protein and then above that there's eight grams of added sugars and above that we see total figures is 11 grams so we see in the instant packaging oatmeal that if you kind of think back you're like okay which one tastes better i know personally instant oatmeal for me is the way to go it's easy to tear up in the package dump it in a bowl add water milk whatever get it warm and it's good to go but it may taste a little better a bit better because it has 8 grams of added sugar and that's only one packet so you're like okay i'm starting to see the difference here i know what added sugar is i kind of start to see where maybe it's at and how to find it but how much do i get in a day is there like a daily allotment how much do i need to worry about so daily added sugar limit for men that is 9 teaspoons or 36 grams and for women it goes to 6 teaspoons and 25 grams now this isn't necessarily a limit that we need to hit so it's not oh i can i need to get x number of teaspoons of added sugar you know that's how much you can have up to in a day so that is the maximum amount you can have now let's think back to our instant oatmeal there was eight grams of added sugar in it so let's say for myself i'm a female i have two of those in the morning i only get 25 grams in the day so that is nearly two-thirds of my daily allotment of added sugar and that's an oatmeal so if i have anything else a pop a cookie even ketchup my added sugar limit is met and so when we start to think about it that way like wow we really don't get a lot of added sugar which is a good thing it's not necessarily great for us anyways because it's not paired with those other nutrients such as fiber but their products have added to it that we really hit that capacity really fast so even by adding creamer or sugar or honey to your coffee you can meet your added sugar limit now this isn't meant to say okay i gotta cut everything out no that's not the goal but the goal is okay how much are you having currently and where can we kind of start to kick kick this added sugar to the curve because is it really doing any favors because again it doesn't compare to those other nutrients that can really help us live our best lives it's really just adding that flavor and that taste and a lot of times those extra calories that maybe we don't need so what are some suggestions you're like okay i get the added sugar thing i know i probably have too much added sugar in my diet how do i cut back read nutrition labels and know what you're putting into your body i know for myself when i started kind of looking at this it's like whoa okay you're getting a lot of added sugar that you really don't need and then start to make some of those swaps so again kind of that ketchup example they do make no sugar added less sugar added you look at other options you'll start to see hey there are other options out there that have less sugar so quit adding it yourself as a second suggestion you don't always have to add even just straight sugar but a lot of times we add sugar packed products to things so i think of ketchup for example is put it on burgers put it on fries put it in meatloaf put it in baked beans again maybe we don't have to add that again coffee creamer do we really need that on coffee do we really need the extra sugar i know again a registered diet registered dietitian suggestion is when you bake or add sugar add half of what it calls for so if it calls for a cup reduce it to half of a cup you won't taste the difference you'll still get that sweet taste but again you cut back quite a bit on the amount of added sugar you add and then the third example the third suggestion is cut back the amount of sugar that you add to baked goods or add for unsweetened sugar added products so really kind of start to make those small changes so that you're slowly cutting it out again these suggestions are not meant to hey completely cut out the cookies hey completely cut out the things that you enjoy it's understand that you're where you're getting your added sugar understand how much you're getting in a day and then how can you make changes or swaps so that we're not going over that daily limit again there are other ways to get that sweet kick sometimes i know i'm one of those people i'm like i could really go for a cookie right now and that would make my life a lot better at least that's what i think but maybe there are other options out there too i know recently chobani yogurt they make these little cups they call them chobani flips where you flip one side of the yogurt packet over and they have flavors like cookies and cream and peanut butter dream and key lime pie and they have a little bit of added sugar not a ton enough to make it sweet but then along that side of it there's also that hey i'm having greek yogurt which has fats and proteins and some good carbs in it and so i'm still getting my sweet kick but i'm also getting some good nutrients to go alongside of it so again maybe that's a hey i'm gonna have a little piece of dark chocolate over having a whole brownie because really i'm just looking for the chocolate kick maybe that's what you need i know even for my dad a lot of times we do sugar-free pudding just chocolate pudding a little bit of sugar with sugar-free cool-up that's his favorite thing it works out well for everybody so again we want to make sure that we're kicking some of that added sugar you may find that artificial sugar isn't your jam either again talking to those specialized nutrition resources we're going to talk about here shortly can be super helpful so don't forget about those folks that we're going to talk about at the end here so we've talked about five different mini habits today they're laid out on your screen and like i mentioned we're not necessary not saying you know go all gung-ho on all these think of the snowball effect again we start small we slowly start to add that is our overall goal we're not saying okay i'm gonna drink enough water tomorrow and i'm gonna eat all these fruits and vegetables and i'm to snack great again start small start with a couple things saying hey you know i'm really going to focus on drinking enough water throughout the day or i'm really going to make sure that i have a glass of water with every meal or hey i'm going to start by cutting some of that creamer out of my coffee because i know that's a huge source of added sugar start small get the little snowballs rolling then add in the other things we don't want to bite off more than we can chew so back to that snowball effect again just like i kind of explained there and now kind of going through this all over again we went through our introduction we've gone through our many habits and now we're going to talk about that specialized nutrition care so specialized nutrition care again you may have a condition or a lifestyle or even just a need where you need a little bit more than just broad advice you need one-on-one hey i really want to have a conversation and get to the root of this so i can you know essentially fuel your body in the way that's gonna cause it to function the best it can be we want to be the best versions of ourselves so i've laid out a couple of different opportunities that exist in lincoln now again you may be somewhere else across the state across the nation there are lots and lots of resources if you have questions you can always reach out to me and we can talk through you know who may be the best fit for you and what's available but again the ones i have laid on the screens are ones that i have worked with so the first one is sage nutrition they are a local practice again out of lincoln nebraska you can contact them at that email and that phone number again i've worked with them they are fabulous they have a really nice holistic approach to nutrition and so if you have different concerns they're a great place to start then next one power nutrition that would be bridget easley again lincoln based great gal super helpful more than happy to help you walk through you know next steps that you may need valiant fitness that would be olivia borg and her email is there i have worked with her quite a bit over the last year and she has a very holistic approach where if you are looking into whole foods eating the paleo diet even kicking some of that added sugar she would be your go-to gal so she is she's incredible she's fabulous all these resources are great all great starting spots but again like i mentioned i've worked with olivia quite a bit over the last year so great recommendation for her and then the last one is hi-v um hi-v stores each one actually has their own registered dietitian and so they are there to help you make the best choices so if you're like hey i really want to walk through the store and have you help me pick out you know what would work best for me depending on my circumstances you might be a type 2 diabetic you might have heart disease or have had surgery and you're like hey i really just need help in knowing and understanding some of this stuff now the first three i mentioned the stage nutrition power nutrition and valiant fitness they each will come at a cost i do know that they will do free consultations but for hyvee i did want to show you that the hyvees will do this dietitian discovery session and so this is free this is a complimentary session you would meet with your hypes registered dietitian and you can learn more about what they offer at that store and then some of the offerings that they do offer so highview when we talk about registered dietitian services very reasonable again we work with the o street hyvee dietitian who's fabulous she is great but again each hyvee has their own registered dietitian so if you're in fremont or grand island or kearney and you're like hey i'm actually not in lincoln each one of those sources has their own registered dietitian as well so again they offer complementary sessions as well as those stores i do know that heidi also offers like once a month or every so many weeks different free sessions like essentially like grocery store tours so the dietitian will walk through the store with you and say hey you know if you're looking at chips here some good options to kind of swap out if you're really into those doritos maybe try these instead type things so hyvee is a great one-stop shop as well again those others the more individual clinics they are fabulous but ivy is a great starting point as well so if you have questions i know kelly had mentioned that questions throw them in the chat if things come up later you can always feel free to reach out to me in my email or call me at my office phone number but kelly i will kick it over to you any questions that have come up through the chat perfect thanks sam my the first question i have is from me i want to know how in the world fudge has been in your refrigerator all this time and you haven't touched it that that wouldn't happen in kelly world so we it's actually been on the bottom shelf that's why it's been there but it's one of those things where we're like ah that would be really nice and they actually kind of fortunately come in these like almost big blocks someone had made them and we're like we don't need the whole block well then we're too lazy to really even get the knife out to cut the fudge so we end up not having it if it was more pre-packaged it would probably all be gone though so that's a secret okay okay good to know i i just wanted to give another endorsement i i know that any resource that sam gives is an excellent one and i know that some of these resources she has made available to ubt employees the hyvee dietitian that she speaks of you may be familiar with because that's jenny donovan and she did the happier holiday meal prep series for us she has assisted with a journey event a meal prep event a couple years ago as well as doing some videos for our newsletters so that's jenny that that sam is talking about the questions that i have are please clarify can i include caffeinated coffee and tea in my daily water intake yes you can there is a certain amount i think it's eight ounces of coffee is equal to four ounces of water so it's not a straight eight for eight yes you can have caffeinated that is totally fine just like juice and milk would count towards your total two again we really want to focus on just drinking more of that plain h2o so we don't necessarily have to kick out the coffee completely but we do want to keep in mind that hey are you drinking enough just plain water because i know for some of us maybe it turns into you know we've had a couple cokes in the day or a couple diet mountain dews and really we want to switch those to plain water coffee isn't bad for you tea isn't bad for you milk isn't bad for you but we just really want to focus on that getting enough plain water perfect and there was a question about juicing you just answered that um the next one was what are some infused water ideas to get the veggies and the water does that count yes so i guess there's two d there's two different ways to look at this some people will put things like strawberries and berries in their water to add the flavor some folks will do more of like almost like a smoothie where they're really kind of mixed in think of maybe like the drinks that maybe starbucks would prepare for you again prepare maybe for those at home so you don't have all the added sugar and other additives that maybe you don't want but there's kind of two ways to look at that other things that i've seen people add to water are things like cucumbers lemon lime so there's a couple options again it's experimenting what do you like what do you enjoy more flavorful fruits and veggies are going to come through bot water better if that makes sense so something like if you put an apple in there it might not come through very well or it might not necessarily come through the way you think it will come through so again experimenting those would be some of my suggestions i do know again like the starbucks they do more of like a pureed drink where they have the berries and strawberries actually incorporated in more like a smoothie but there is a couple options for you perfect thanks the next question i have is do any of the nutritionists work with folks with osteoporosis so i will actually back up to the specialized nutrition care all of these folks who are listed on this screen would be more than happy to work with you in terms of whatever condition you may have i know that power nutrition and stage nutrition have a variety of providers so for example sage nutrition their providers may be a little bit more comfortable with working with they may have more experience essentially working with different conditions per se but any of those will be able to help you appropriately now say that you go to one of them they say hey you know i have a actually a better resource for you here's an individual that you may want to talk to they will understand that community better and will be able to refer you appropriately so i feel that whoever you reach out to they will be able to help you and if they aren't actively able to help you they will be able to actively refer you to somebody who can okay perfect thanks this might be a stump the presenter question but maybe not how do i eat to improve focus and memory slash cognition so there's been that is a really good question there have been multiple ways in improving that um one of the ways that we probably all know fairly well would be caffeine caffeine can help us focus can energize us a little bit um it is something though that we can become used to so it starts to not work so well now when we talk about focus and some of those like mood memory starts at capacities there comes into a lot of different variables so things like medication activity are you getting enough sleep you know what other conditions may you have so there's other things that go into it again those specialized nutrition care folks for a question like that that might be a high v question again any of those could ask but if you just say hey i have a quick question regarding this you know what are your thoughts can you help direct me again they will be able to give you a prompt response with their best insight from my perspective i don't feel that i have the expertise or knowledge to necessarily answer that question so i would refer you on to a registered dietitian perfect and the final question is are any of these resources good for children i have a nine-year-old daughter that i would love to take a class with so i'm going to kind of break it up into two parts i know that hyvee offers classes per se i also know that olivia bohr at valiant fitness offers classes so more of kind of that series type educational piece if that's more what you're looking for as far as children per se i think all of them would be a great avenue to go forth with i know hyvee does have specific kids offering when it comes to like the cooking and grocery shopping piece i don't know what her interest your nine-year-old daughters would be again i don't necessarily know their kid series like how kid we're talking in that but any of those would be great resources um sage nutrition i know they also have an on-site kitchen and so they do a lot of you know kind of walking you through how do you set up your kitchen and things like that so if that is of interest to you or to any of you again sage nutrition does that but from my kid aspect they might think that's pretty nifty to go into a kitchen and kind of figure out how do i set things up and you know prep and all those good jazz i would have thought that definitely we also had a suggestion and that was one of our participants freezes juiced lemons and cucumbers and ice cube trays and puts them in ziploc bags to add a cube for a refreshing drink so i think i'll have that when we're done yeah exactly [Laughter] we all know instead of a cocktail when this is over we can we can freeze um goodies in in ice cubes and and have a refreshing water drink you know sam i think that was our last question i can't thank you enough for your time and expertise today it's just been really a treat to have you join us and to participants it's been wonderful to have you here i hope that you're able to join us next week the topic is tune up your emotional well-being and the presenter much like last week the presenter is someone that sam recommended she really helped me put this series together actually the presenter is gail suter of continuum and she's going to talk about ways we can build our emotional resilience so we hope to see you then in the meantime be well and take care thanks everybody", "FEanmOKMTp0": "hello friends...

Today I'm going to share with you an easy, step-by-step\nguide to making cold-brewed iced tea at home. Before you begin, you'll want to assemble\nthe following ingredients and equipment: A package of your favorite Arbor Teas' loose\nleaf tea - almost any variety will brew up great A teaspoon measure A T-sac, tea infuser, or strainer;\nAnd a pitcher; Start by measuring your loose leaf tea. Generally,\nyou should measure 1 teaspoon loose leaf tea per cup of iced tea. But fluffier blends - like\nwhite teas and some herbals - may require as much as one tablespoon or more, while denser\nteas such as gunpowder may require less than one teaspoon. Just flip over the label on your Arbor Teas\nbag to find our suggested serving size per cup. Place the tea in a T-sac or infuser, and place\nthat in your glass or iced tea pitcher. If you are using a pitcher with a built in strainer\n(like our Cold Brew Iced Tea Maker here), or you plan on straining out your tea, simply\nplace the leaves directly in the pitcher. Fill your container with 1 cup room temperature\nwater per final cup of iced tea you intend to make. Just pour the water over the tea-filled\nT-Sac or infuser, or directly over the tea leaves. Be sure the tea is covered completely\nwith water. If you're making tea for lots of people and\nneed to scale up the recipe, one quart of iced tea generally requires a \u00bd ounce of\nloose leaf tea. Now just place your glass or pitcher in the\nrefrigerator for 6 to 10 hours - basically overnight. Remove the leaves when you\u2019ve reached the\ndesired strength or strain the tea when you serve it. Doesn't that look delicious? Another nice thing about cold-brewing your\niced tea is that it practically never clouds, as some teas can when chilled too quickly. You might be surprised to know that heating the water is the most energy-intensive step in the whole process of growing, manufacturing, shipping and preparing your tea.  Cold brewing your\ntea is eco-friendly because it slashes energy use by eliminating the water-heating process. I hope you enjoy this step-by-step guide to\ncold-brewing iced tea as much as we do here at Arbor Teas! Check us out at ArborTeas.com\nfor lots of handy how-to tea guides, tea recipes, and one of the best selections of organic\nloose leaf tea on the web!", "s3LXMrnjets": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

be those unusual obscure names like let me think let me like my granddaughter i'm going to say i'm my grandson actually because sapphire and ezra are not your one of the mill normal names that you would be able to find on the ice street however we can now personalize it and like i said joe that eclipse um the whole basis around the eclipse means it does give that little illusion it's a trick of

so i'm going to stamp myself a little bit of a cupcake so i'm going to pop my cupcake i've used i've used some old cardstock that i had and i'm going to say from the do you know the birthday i've got a feeling from that birthday party and when i said very old i don't know if you're you're probably way before your time job but this was a this was a collection from one of sarah's signature rangers many many moons ago in fact i want to say about probably around 2016 2017 so just use up your elements that you've got but again just absolutely fabulous and i'm going to just stamp myself a few cupcakes onto here joe so first things first what should i stamp it with i've got a couple of um quick dry ink pads for this one i've got fuchsia and i've got crushed velvet so first things first i'm going to pick up with my stamping platform my cupcake and i'm going to ink this up now because these are stamps joe it means you can use any kind of inks you can use all your different techniques that you do when you're stamping so you could use your pigment ink pads and you could have a little bit of clear embossing going off there and give it an enamel finish or you can quickly simply use your quick dry which means they're instantly dry which means you're going to get no smudging whatsoever i'm just going to pop that on there i think i might have just gone a little bit too low down but i'm not worried too much excuse me that doesn't look like a fuchsia what's going off here i said somebody contaminated me ink pad oh no that hecky thumper's gone off there that i'm just thinking yeah it's one of my yeah heck i've never heard that okay somebody somebody look at this this looks like it's had a bit of purple over it oh look at the state of that it should actually be that colour test test tusk is all i'm going to say i'm going to bring in let me see if i can let me see if i can fix this i'm going to bring in me or pick ink pad oh shock it you see that's what it should look like in that color houses exactly joe exactly my goodness i'm who can we blame joe who can we blame oh anyone what do you think it is is it great that was charlotte did you do that charlotte she were quick to jump at craig then weren't she ah my days now i'm gonna use he'd be watching a little bit you'll be getting into trouble charlotte next time he's easier and then i'm going to use my um crushed velvet better just need to wipe that down joe i'm going to have to ask our lovely producer or director if they can ask jake to go and find me some tissue because i need a bit of tissue to wipe down um do you know like do you know like kitchens kitchen yeah thank you very much kitchen towel thank you yeah because it's going to be quite moist that and that's the last thing i want so while they're on the hunt is that your top yeah debbie what are you like well it's just a quick one i'm just using black bit no no notice nobody'll notice and i'll have a quick change later so nobody'll notice that but i'm just going to line myself up a couple of more now but in a couple of different colors so i'm going in with that gorgeous few uh not fuchsia crushed velvet there we go so when i pop that there we are and then oh look it's looking lovely looking then i'm going to just do another one at the side of it and then we'll be ready to use the alphabet and this is like i said the alphabet is now when you can start to make up any word you want there we go so i've got all that there let's move that there for a second all right so just literally take off that ink there let me get that off right and i'll i'll wait for our jake to come in and grab me oh look as if by magic because it's also going to come in handy for this jake it is 110 degrees in this room my days it's so warm oh now that's not part of the demo it's just they've been trying to cool down because it's incredibly hot in here right so i've got all stamped up so i'm all stamped so now we're going to bring in the alphabet look at the size of those jaw they're really nice what size are they i don't need to measure it for you right i'll measure the length oh now then is it oh wait a minute thanks johnny yep thank you johnny i hadn't realized it was on there i was just about to get my ruler out and whip my ruler out but there you go just shy of one and a half inches by 1.3 inches and obviously that will be variant on in fact actually i'm saying that they've all been measured so that they fit the die in that size so you can be sure that you've got that evenness in width or depth as well so that's all if you want to like really if you want to mark it out and measure it out you could actually measure the spacing on them because they're all the same width how many absolutely what shall we spell what shall we spell let's have it oh don't drop your alphabet don't drop your alphabet uh we'll have a little piece of because it's a cupcake we'll have a little piece of anybody know where i'm going cake absolutely a bit of cake let's have a little bit of cake so again just pop those on now i've done that background oh do you know what joe you're even getting your ampersand that what fell off absolutely perfect and then i'm going to use some low tactic to hold this down into place now the size of this alphabet means that you can get these through your small list of machines so they are going to fit through perfectly through your gemini mini oh do you know what shall we get that shall we get the mini out let's get them in it where's the mini oh aisha says joe get debbie beyonce's fans she has got the beyonce fan on it already today don't you worry about that ain't sure i'm actually going to have to turn the fan because i moved it earlier because it was blowing army samples the way but i've moved it now and turned it away so i'm actually having to stand right back here before the beyonce fan starts working and wafting so i'm going to go and move that so i'll get into the right place don't get you know too caught in the draft because you look like rose on the front of the titanic in that dress hey right now i'd gladly swap places with rose i really would right so he's so warm in here it is it's very very warm it's much more than that it is really warm sorry joe all right so just run that through there we go and now like i said they will fit through your small list of machines which means you can put them through do you know what you could cut out quite a lot if you use your bigger you know your bigger electronic machines but we'll take this out joe and straight away when we take that out you've got your letters keep them where they are as well don't be moving these because these are gonna these are gonna what's gonna create that eclipse feature so if i just pop my cake back out of there let's just move that for a second what you could do as well is you could cut these out again into black to make them really pop even more underneath in fact i might do that in a minute but let's just pop that there for now so i've got my cake ready but then you've got your piece here that you're going to fit these back into and we're going to raise these that will create that eclipse you you could also excuse me you could also and pop a little bit of ink just a touch of ink around the edges to make them pop a little bit more but i quite like the idea i quite like the idea of having um the cake onto here so let me just chop this down for a second johnny johnny that's because i can hear johnny and mia do apologize joe he's there johnny and charlotte are in the gallery today uh which is awesome uh loads of you saying hello to me today lots you tuning in from all over the place deborah's in defiance ohio what a great place then that is georgian's in clearwater florida victoria's in birmingham uh karen's in from tennessee and brenda is in in utah as well loads and loads of love for this collection lots of you placing your order very busy on the main collection but also the over over 10 on the main collection but also on the alphabet and that exclusive party stamp set that debbie is using here as well you won't have had the chance you won't have the chance to get that anywhere else so i do grab that if you've already got the rest of the collection it's available on its own which is fantastic just pop the details just over there for you uh if you want to grab that very very busy on that 799 or 995 if you want to get that so we cut it out then debbie and then we cut it all again in black do it well you don't have to you can keep it as it is but i just want to give it a little bit of a lift underneath so that you can see it pop out a little bit more uh but as in still keep it nice and camouflaged so there's a couple of ways you can do it you can either use the ink like i said around the edge and that would make it pop but you can just literally lay it back in now i've already popped mine onto a xyron and i'll show you in a minute what i mean by that for the time being i'm just gonna push those to one side because what i'm gonna do joe is i'm gonna bring in my card blank now i've made myself a little bit of one of our sarah's favorite cards in the whole wide world i've already done a little bit of matting and layering as well which is the double z fold card and so i'm just going to get all this bit ready joe you can see to make most there i've actually done i've done a jan i've just i've just put a where you what do we call it now to say not gutting because that's the horrible word isn't it did we say halloween halloween house i like that's the whole the halloween out so let's just pop this on and make sure that's in the right place there we go yep absolutely and then we're going to just line up and this is what you can do at home obviously i've just i'm fast-forwarding all these bits because i want to try and get as many demonstrations in in this two hours as possible so all i'm going to do now to always pop this front panel on and again you can see if anybody does recognize this paper this paper still got a few sheets of it left um just absolutely beautiful but there's loads of papers on the website that you can be doing with this and again i've already just started um to pop some on there but left this blank because before we attach it i'm going to pop on now the piece that i want to layer it so i've just oh debbie don't rip it don't rip it that's the last thing you want to do let's get this off there we are take your time girl you don't have to rush there we are so i'm just going to line that up and pop that on and then we're going to start now to create this lovely eclipse feature so at the minute it just looks a little bit not quite right until it doesn't look so bold doesn't it doesn't look so bold it doesn't stand out so much so you can just take these back in now and you can use things like your 3d colal glue and go straight in and i'll show you what i mean by that or you can and this is why i've done them in the black i'm going to put these in first so let's just and then in fact i am going to use my 3d color glow um you could use things like um very very thin small um and you'd have to chop these down if you were going to use uniform pads but i love the idea of using um as you all know i love to call it the chunky glue just to lift these off slightly you could use though and keep it nice and flat if you wanted but i quite like the idea of lifting it up a little bit so that you get that effect um where it's raised and it gives a really nice 3d feel to it as well but i'm just going to pop all of these back in and like i said the idea of having an alphabet jaw this size a different sized alpha alphabet and a different style alphabet i just think is absolutely fab and a very useful to have in your um crafty crafty stash now then this is when we're going to start popping these off quite like that as a different look and texture yeah yeah that looks quite nice yeah because it looks like it's looking because you can do that you can have the effect where you sink them in as well but i'm just going to pop my glue just around there and i'm just going to slightly and i mean slightly just give it a little bit of a shadow drop into there so i've got now you can see my little four parrier because i should have used that one because look that wasn't fusion was it it was that mucky contaminated one however i'm not going to worry too much joe in fact debbie debbie debbie remember what you did you've already done one come on off you go you can you can wait for another time i'll put you back in does anybody else talk to the craft when they're crafting i talk to everything do you really absolutely everything yes i need to say to diane's daughter uh you need to go make uh your mom a cup of cup of coffee she says watching welsh lounging in bed hoping my daughter will make me a cup of coffee she's watching with me maybe you can tell us to make my coffee show i hope it works i like that go make me a cup of coffee yep come on get get up get up and go get coffee what's your daughter's name what did she say doesn't say oh right so what's the lady's name again diane diane diane's daughter somewhere in america i was in bed watching us right now get up go and get her a cup of coffee and while you're at it i like mine frothy maybe a bit of toffee toffee flavored in there and joe likes his flavored teas don't you i do i like a peppermint tea don't you yeah yeah and you can just hop over and fetch that for us maybe you've got a flask [Laughter] now i'm just going to finish the last one off in there let me grab me a out of there and we can see now it building up and i'm going to straighten up and one thing about using uh 3d uh 3d i'm getting a new name three oh no it is 3d 3d glue it gives you the wiggle time to get it into place so i've just tiny and i'm just saying a tiny bit of a shadow drop there you could play with it and get a much bigger drop shadow if you wanted you can't be doing that exactly but can you see how it just pops just by adding that little bit a bit of black behind there makes it pop and you'd get that same effect joe with your um with your ink if you were going to do the ink as well so i'm going to just now run a bit of glue on this end and a little bit of glue just on this end and then i'm going to attach that to the front panel there we go and then let me just make sure i've got this lined up so before i actually pop it in make sure it folds nice that's all i always do mine i just make sure it folds nice and neatly um just by lining up at the other end and then we're going to finish this off now with a few of the other things that are on there so we've got happy well let me just have a quick peek at that there it is got me happy day let's pop that onto here so we'll have a happy cake happy cake d just pop that down there and then a few other little elements on that stamp set you've got some birthday bunting and we've also got things like your birthday candles so you could pop your birthday candles and personalize it if you wanted to but i'm just doing this for decoration jaw so let's pop that on there add my little candle let's just push yeah just push you over the top there like that and then so coffee is on route now apparently oh fantastic yay i see i know i knew by talking to you diane we get that sorted but there you go so now you can see can you see that lovely eclipse feature where it just gives that lovely little bit of a an element but because i've got it on with 3d glue you can see just slightly popping out there but how beautiful is this i love these stamps and this this alphabet set i think it's absolutely fabulous i can't do no i can't get overjoyed it's like you just said can't get over that price and alphabet alone and i remember days when i used to used to pay a lot of money for alphabet but laugh a bit alone let alone all those extras that you're getting in there all those stamps to do that um decoration and because it's over that 25 pounds how many points is it joe you get an extra 50 points on this wow that's incredible you're awesome uh sarah brown's got a bailey's on the go says after 2 a.m uh do you think it's okay and also would you like one debbie yes please yes please if you've got a bottle in a cupboard here somewhere yeah yeah running jokers i have oh okay she's just off to a bailey's drawer i think she's gone she's not there in this she's in front of the she's gone getting the baileys i don't think she comes i just had to go on two seconds i'm so sorry two seconds i just needed to go and move me fan oh i'm literally like a wilton rose are you back in the the uh the draft now i am now yes i am glad uh will says wow nice collection great price uh s joneses congratulations debbie for your win this morning all right june rubbing it in uh daisy connor says i got it this morning i'll enjoy the show and all of the inspiration uh kirsten says love this technique beautiful cards uh tracy saying good morning jones i'll be looking forward to all the demonstrations on the eclipse stamp collection uh this is so different and beautiful uh lots of you loving this and says uh we gotta stop picking on craig debbie we need to stop picking on craig and ramona says hello joe and debbie love the two of you good fix on the colors uh right i just want to share a couple of bits with you i'll go back through the collection again i've just got a few of what we call the concept suite just here i just wanted to show you these just so you can see some of the ideas of of how uh this was thought about when it was designed by leanne's team so you've got things like this very very simple some of these but very very effective and they will work on any card size which is awesome don't just think about cards and card sizes how about beautiful boxes as well even just in the monochrome i think they were really really awesome now there's a few different options about how you want to go for this collection you can go for the big collection i need to let you know already the big collection which details on your screen there already a fifth of the stock 20 of our launch stuff now remember this is an exclusive crafters tv configuration you won't be able to get this configuration anywhere else because you've got exclusive items in here if you want to go for the whole collection which represents the best value for money you can platinum members can get this for 36 pounds or 40 dollars if they want to or you can go for individuals everything that makes up the collection is available individually maybe you just want to go for the alphabet absolutely you can 22.99 or 24.95 to get these yes they're going to work beautifully with the eclipse stamps they're going to work wonderfully on their own as well now obviously in the main collection then what we're also going to do is include this stamp set for you now this is that exclusive item you can get it in the main collection you can also get it on its own so if you went for this collection when it was available over on hsn you wouldn't have got this stamp set and if you want to complete your collection then these are the details that you need right here 7.99 or 9.95 it is in that main collection you're also then going to receive in here stars and celebrations which is this one here loads of different style of stars in here love this frame as well this maybe would be great for a little bit of monogramming if you wanted to do that also next up we've got this one it is the birthday balloons loads of texture on these i think these are gonna look fantastic heat emboss would be another beautiful way of doing it the next one we have here for you this is your beautiful blossoms gonna work beautifully for all of your different background techniques that you'd like to do with this and then finally last by no means leaf you can't have too many butterflies can you butterflies in flight is what you are looking at here how about decoupaging these up and adding texture to them maybe some fussy cutting i think that would be a really great way to go with those something else that's on the show and it wasn't back in stock just last week it is the 8x8 stamping platform and the magnetic base so you're getting that base in there and the platform it's going to allow you to line up your stamps every single time if you're doing layering stamps or rotation stamps this is an absolute must or if you just find that when you stamp the first time you don't always get the cleanest clearest impression this will allow you to go back and line it up beautifully to have a second go at it which is brilliant so do grab that 22 pounds or 26.50 if you want to get your hands on that one um are you saying uh get the fan we've got the fan don't worry about that aisha uh miss jack says debbie what you like good thing your top is a dark color i think that was about the uh uh adam says uh adam's rose says joe and debbie you two are such a who what a fun way to start the weekend linda says there i go again teased into thinking i need this off shopping i go mary says i talk to myself all the time while crafting i don't think you're alone there mary um lots of love for that card that debbie just created too and la quiet says well thanks to debbie jo and diane i just got a cup of peppermint tea without asking so thanks awesome glad that we're keeping you all hydrated uh on this uh march weekend got a fantastic deal for you on some pigment ink pads and i'm gonna take you through these pigment ink pads are far and away my favorite i think the amount of different um things that you can do with them and techniques that you can do with them makes them pretty much uh the most versatile so in here you're going to get twilight grey you're also going to get the pink tulip lagoon plum jam you've got the honey pot the parakeet the grasshopper the orange you've got also in here the fuchsia the fry brown the lemon tonic and you've got the crushed velvet and last one is at least the chinese red so a great deal on these everyone gets a great saving basically when you buy them in this configuration they work out to be three pounds 85 or 538 if you're a platinum member you can get them for 40 pounds or 56 dollars meaning it goes down to three pounds and change or four dollars and change which is great value and again ink pads i know we've talked about it a lot in recent months uh has been one of those things we've really struggled to keep in stock it's great that we've got a 13 piece collection for you with 13 of the most popular colors so with ink pads at the moment i think you have to strike why the irons are when they're in stock absolutely grab them we've just had a fantastic restock on these which is why we're able to bring you such a fantastic bundle of them oh it was gonna happen wasn't it you should have seen what happened just before the show i don't know what i don't really know what happened but all of a sudden i think i picked this up and i knocked one thing and all of this fell over i know it happens to me all the time it doesn't happen to anyone else i bet does it here we go there you go back on there if you want to get in touch with me you can in all the usual way crafters tv or crafts companion on facebook and uh youtube uh if you've got any questions whatsoever about this collection then drop those in to me i know some of you maybe will have already received started to receive this collection if you got it from hsn or maybe you had the eclipse craft box now the equip craft box had a smaller alphabet i did have a question about the difference these are this alphabet is much bigger than that one but if you've got either of those two things you want to send me some pictures i would love to see them and you can send those to me studio crafters companion dot co dot uk details are right there along the bottom of the screen for you right very very busy over a fifth of the stock as i said that big collection has sold out and gone we're having a very busy launch day as i knew we would uh what would you like to share with us next debbie nice little um birthday balloons background that we're gonna then cut into and and again this is up to you i feel like a bit of a party though are you in a bit of a party mood i love a party i love a good party but these are really good fun now don't forget you've got all the alphabet but you've got all these stamps jaw so who needs paper pads who needs all that when you've got at the touch of your fingertips some fantastic stamps to create some beautiful backgrounds and look at this let me just let me just i just want to show you this look at these look at all these different balloons you've got on here gorgeous like um a bit like the hundred thousands again that one joe they're really really nice uh then you've got some nice little small plain ones a solid one an open one so you could take things like your coloring mediums to these and have a good old play with them and you've got a lovely stripey one there we've got a lovely one that looks like um like squiggles on that one i can't best describe that one but a nice lovely variant of different uh different style balloons i've got all my ink pads ready again joe cause i'm gonna create myself a background now using these balloons i'm going to start with this one let's start with this nice big beautiful one here and i'm going to turn my cardstock because i'm going to have a nice little small 4x6 card for this again any style cards you're going to be able to decorate um anything you want to be fair jaw i'm using some of our quick dry inks again and the reason i do love our quick dry inks for the whole purpose of being that once you pop that down you lift it up oops i missed a bit little there but i'll go back down in a minute but look absolutely no smudge whatsoever let's see if i can line that back up a second there we go give it a nice little push there we go oh no i'm done oh joe what on earth is going on with these ink pads who have been at these ink pads you sound like the goldilocks of crafts who's been well it is i mean dear me this is disgraceful we need to get them we need to get these because it's affecting the cause we need to launch an investigation yep shall we get liane in the courtroom who has been using this i reckon our viewers will be able to tell at least you know who are using these ink pads let us know in the comments it will it wasn't me so i need to oh if i sounded like that shaggy song then it wasn't me i didn't get it on the ink pad uh somebody's saying me or the other debbie you were all checking the other day oh what's that thinking about the other day random songs again random songs joe just keep coming at me um let's have oh let's have this lovely confetti one let's have a little play and like i said this is the fun bit of this this one don't look too bad joe that one let's have a look so this one is ocean blue so let's go and have a little play over but again look nothing's moving i love the quick dries and i guess it dries instantly does that mean it won't bleed into the other color debbie yeah it's not oh no look what i've done oh i've got it on me oh i need to let just hang on a minute jordan i'm gonna have to just um because i know what'll happen and then i'll end up with even more rinky hands and i'll end up with really monkey stamps if i don't clean it while i'm going along oh what we're going to do did you see what we're going to do we're going to do that then no no no no no come on come on get a grip dabs get a grip let's have a little little play let's push that down and this is when you start to build up your pattern so i'm going to do that again let's um let's have a different uh stamp on there lift that up good quality stamps as well portal polymer stamps sure they're incredible they really are uh let's get let's have that stripy pink one let's have a nice uh yep we'll have the pink tulip i'm gonna make yep pink julie let's pop that down let's build this pattern up but this is what you're going to be able to create your own backgrounds with ease just by literally taking your stamping and then having a go all over and let's not remember let's not forget we've also got those birthday uh tails birthday um strings strings streamers streamers birthday streamers i can't remember what they were called them but yeah so we'll add those details on in a moment i'm just going to stamp this all way around um want that little love heart let me clean this up as well let's give that a nice little clean lift that off pop that on where's that lovely love heart one yep we'll get that one on there what color should we have the love art jaw shall we have that red let's have a bit of red let's go a bit dramatic with this one drama today aren't we oh absolutely absolutely but i'm just gonna pop this all the way along uh no i mean you can if you want to you can go for the stamps on their own there may be people that just would love to go for these stamps just to create your own bespoke background papers and absolutely these will allow you to do that also on the other hand some people are going for just for the alphabets on their own maybe you want to cut the alphabets out of patterned papers that you already have absolutely that is something you can do but what i think debbie i'm sure you'll agree is when you have the whole collection it gives you the most amount of options yeah it really does give you the option to get something exactly what you want because it means that you can create background papers in exactly the right color theme that you want to to match uh your card blanks and do what you want and get you know the ultimate amount of customization which is fantastic it's just lovely to have the whole set debbie really isn't it well it is and it's at that launch price as well uh joe which i just think you know we do i mean it's a great price i mean look at that already joe look how lovely that's looking i'm just gonna add one more on there because i've seen a bit of a gap that i'm not quite happy with so let's pop that there even without those butterfly streamers is that what they call them streamers streamers butterflies i've got that right again thank you you'll have to help me out with these words because i just call them little the ones that you you know you tie your shrinks what do you want to call them squiggly bits let's just call them squiggly bits just some squiggly bits but let's add these details on now so again using me quick dry and then just matching up and marrying up those two that that balloon but look at love they're starting to look really nice now i'm really getting stuck i'm really starting to be impressed with my little design here sometimes i have this plan in mind of where we're going to start and it ends up being something completely different to what we started out with but again let me just um pop all these on now let's have a think what yeah well we'll go back over all those colors and we'll add those strings on let's have the blue there we go and would this work did you say with all of your ink pads everybody so you're watering yes with your water reactors yeah all of them your pigment ones now your pigment ones everywhere so this is when you can start to use your clear embossing can you imagine yeah how fabulous that would look that would look incredible as well and just wipe up all the excess ink it doesn't so it stays wet while it's on the pores surface the minute it's the non-porous that's when it's i've got that the right way around a minute poorest non-porous yeah you have i didn't have it right way around didn't i'm just questioning myself again joe i always do this to myself i question what i actually say but look at that that's starting to really really come together now i'm quite happy with that and i think i'm gonna leave that as it is joe because i think sometimes we have to stand away step away from there when step away from the ink pads debbie step away from the background you're quite happy with what we're gonna do and now let's get our party word together so i'm gonna bring back in the alphabet so if i bring back the alphabet we're gonna have p we're gonna have the a we're gonna have the r let's go on this side this is what i'm saying though about spelling your words joe anything you want to spell and any shape any way any style that you want to have them i'm going for a bit of a quirky one this time so let's have a bit of a quirky and then me lastly me why because i can but there we go so there we are parties on there let's get me tape again let's take the whole of that down now i am gonna have to use me bigger machine for this because i've got a slightly bigger than the smaller one that we was doing last time which is the mini so let me just pop another one of those on there that's it and that's me bring me gemini junior plates in because i've got my gemini ear so i'm just going to pop that on joe and then we're going to cut those out as well absolutely awesome there's a lot of talk about the ink pad uh scenario the ink pad situation beth says it was craig charlotte says it with quake and debra says it was craig as well so so i'm saying unanimously it's craig absolutely unanimous uh yeah the jury has spoken i think they're out and they are they've spoken uh judy says i love these shows uh that show us how to use our products and great tips and ideas absolutely remember as well because this is a brand new launch will absolutely be doing a craft along on this in the very near future so if you get these today uh you will definitely have the opportunity to have a two-hour craft class with one of our experts live here on crafters tv we're all craft together in real time so that's definitely something to look forward to if you're going for these today over 20 now of that launch stock has already gone it's very very busy particularly on the exclusive stamp set and the alphabets on their own are also really busy as well right joel so i wonder who's doing the craft along and i wonder when it is i don't know who it is or when it is in fact i reckon johnny will have a little look he'll investigate for us yeah because we've got his we've got a schedule that before april so it's bound to be in here because a couple of weeks time there's every opportunity to get from warehouse to everybody's house so let's have a think oh we'll have to have a nosey now i'm just going to tell you another little top tip here when you're using these so can you see the waist what we would normally throw away so like the inner part of the a and the inner part of the r and the inner part of the p we're going to keep those because that adds to an effect as well so we can have those in the background so you can raise up your p you can raise up your a but you actually keep those little bits in the center of those flat so that it it doesn't distract from that design and it gives it that proper true camouflage feel to it joe if that makes sense so i'm just going to move that to one side there and i'm going to move these out of the way of the fan because i can feel the fan will end up blowing me bits all over the place and that's the last thing we want so let's just move those out of the way for the second time that didn't sound right sorry dear sometimes i just don't think before i open my mouth right so i'm just going to move those off there so i've got myself a little card piece here now and i've got i've just got a layer of black in the background so last time you saw me cut those out didn't you joe and i got them out i don't need to this time because i've got the back in the background so okay i'm just going to pop this we believe that it's going to be the 24th of april as part of the stamping and ink pad craft along does it say he was doing it johnny do we know who's doing it hillary is actually doing it oh wow okay that'll be fun oh it's with me isn't it johnny yeah excellent really look forward to that maybe i'll have a little craft along as well uh hilary will be here with us all day on that day wow wow that sounds awesome that sounds absolutely awesome that'll be a foot that'll be fun that really will now then i'm going to pop this on so you can see now and i've got all my bits there that i've cut out so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to use yeah i'll use some wet glue let's get some glue gives me that time to slide it into place as well so i'm going to run this across there we go oh i've missed a little bit there we go yep there we are but you could use any tape or anything like that that you want and i'm just going to place that over there so now you can see that i've got my party but what i need to do now is put my words back in now again do you know what you could do you could multi-layer these so you could cut them out in a few layers so of layers of white cardstock uh and pile them up to create a nice thickness so you've got a nice depth and when i say that that's when i'm going to just bring this mr and mrs mr mr card back in again if i turn it can you see the thickness there of how thick these what these words actually are i think i'll show it's going in really close there shall i turn it that way charlotte it might help a little bit there you go so that has got absolutely a few layers of that underneath but it still stays like camouflaged within there which i just think it's a nice little sample that to show you that but you can do that or you can just literally again do what i did which was wait a minute please could you cut it out the double-sided could you cut the letter out of the background and then re-cut the double-sided foam tape with the out with a die would that work absolutely it would it would do indeed because you can run that through there but again look can you see now that black just makes it pop but depending on how you lift this so depending on how much of the 3d calal glue you pop on there or the foam pads you can double layer your foam pads like you just said die cut them through um you'll create you'll create something different every time you can go as flat as you want or as raised as you want i think is the message i'm trying to get across there awesome so i'm just going to pop those in now bearing in mind at the moment i haven't put because at the moment you can see that p has got its middle missing and the a has got its middle missing so i'm just going to pop a little bit of glue just on the back there there we go i think i might have to fill me uh me tube back up in a second so let's pop that back in and i'm going to flatten that and raise the pee there we go i love that lovely and then i'm going to do the same with the a as well so on that part i'm just going to pop this little bit of glue just into there now you could use your tweezers to get this bit in if you wanted to um because if you like using tweezers you know why jan she loves the tweezers oh she loves the tweezers she does indeed so again just pop that back in i'm just gonna move that little bit of excess glue just off there we go and then i'm going to lift that again as well so let's pop the r in there so this is all you do to create that camouflage feel that eclipse feel and just by like i said you could actually add a little bit of ink around the edges to make it pop more but i quite like this i think this effect here looks absolutely fabulous and again i'm using the middle pieces that are this is the important bit because it really does make it camouflage then if i were to leave it blank joe it would look quite obvious can you see with the black there so just by popping and placing those back in it really does create a little bit of a a stunning effect and i'm sure hillary when she does the craft along with you um you'll you'll get to see just when we do step by step stage all right so literally now i'm just going to pop the last two in there and these two bits are what haven't got anything missing from them but you can see now and just by off just slightly putting that off there you can see reflect from that black which makes it pop a little bit and you've got that eclipse feature it's almost like when you look at the sun lovely you know the moon sorry and the sun when it eclipses do you remember when we had a total eclipse in the uk was it not long ago was it 2001 i want to say was it about 2 000. are you sure it was that long ago yeah total eclipse was uh i think it was 2 000. you can only see it in the bottom half of the country though i remember everyone was there was a mass exodus down to like cornwall because that was where you that was where you could see it when it went fully it went fully dark really easy what year was it johnny have a little oh we need to yeah we need to find that one i don't know why i remember it being the middle of summer when is the next one johnny well we'll be alive we'll be alive 2090 is the next one 90 you can go to india they happen there all the time debbie do they really yeah when's the next one in india johnny have a look we'll get we'll get a trip booked maybe we could do a we could do a crafting retreat there we could do a clip stamping during a total eclipse hello took that full circle i love it i love it now then there you go the finished card made by my fair hand from start to finish from the background to die cutting to popping those words back in to create that eclipse effect but look how fabulous that looks just there and i didn't do anything i didn't layer it up or anything like that i just used 3d color glue and the inks to create that background but look how fabulous it looks joe it really is um a gorgeous dye concept um and a stamp concept that works so beautiful together it really really does uh don't worry not as long as wait if we go to india may 26th debbie yeah i don't think we can travel there just yet maybe we'll go to we'll go to one there next year maybe yeah absolutely beautiful creation debbie lots of love for it in the comments as it always is uh judy says i just love

you is these are the concepts really for the alphabet they share with you uh just some of the ways that you can put these together i think these are definitely an alphabet set that you can be very very clever with or you can just really keep it simple absolutely love this one just here with you and me then we've got smile i love that you've got thanks here and also think about doing all of these kind of um generic um sentiments but also then you've got complete personalization so it means you can spell out absolutely and i've just dropped one on the floor uh i've got two here i'll get those in a minute you can you can get and spell out absolutely anything you want honestly i'm one of those days today aren't i let me run you for everything so the the best way to get the best value is always is to get the main collection as i said earlier platinum members 36 pounds or 40 dollars when i think if you look at the amount of different techniques and styles and creations you're going to be able to make with these is such a minimal investment to get hold of them today uh what you're going to get in here is you're going to get the eclipse alphabet now if you did want to go for the eclipse alphabet on its own absolutely you're more than welcome to do so 22.99 or 24.95 if you want to get that now remember this full collection though is a crafters tv exclusive because this awesome stamp set is only available here at crafters tv if you bought this anywhere else in the uk in a retail store or you bought it across or over on hsn or here in the uk and creating crafts you will not find this stamp set totally exclusive here if you have already bought this collection from hsn you're thinking oh gosh how do i get hold of that on its own we've got that on the show for you you can go for it right now 799 or 995 if you want to get hold of that on its own which is brilliant again it is coming included in that big collection you've then got this one which is the stars and celebrations which is awesome lots of different styles almost like fireworks here some of this and i think this frame would be excellent for some monogramming if you wanted to do that we've got birthday balloons and of course balloons perfect for all celebrations so definitely a stamp set you are going to get loads of use out of we've then got the beautiful blossoms florals of course ever popular so versatile mix up the colorway is going to give you a really different look and feel and of course can you ever have two minish metallings plot twist no you cannot so that's why you've got the butterflies in flight in there as well would love to see those heat embossed i think it'd look fantastic uh finish off in that style that is everything you're getting as i said 45 pounds or 50 everyone says save 1794 or 24.70 platinum members though save 26.94 or uh 34.70 so a great deal wherever you are don't forget you're also going to get 50 bonus points when you're spending over 25 pounds so do grab those also a lot of people uh talking about debbie's demonstrations uh and how fantastic they are everything's saying damn it debbie you are such a blast i love your shows you craft as i do i always get messy the apron comes in very handy audrey's saying how creative debbie is and how much she's loving the demonstrations also if you have done some eclipse projects in the past and we talked about it earlier i'd love to see some pictures of those projects maybe you've already got your hands on this collection maybe you had the eclipse craft kit get those pictures into me studio at craftscompanion.com uk is where they need to go to i need to share something else with you because debbie used the quick dryers a lot just then we've got a brilliant quick dry collection available on it for you on the show it's a 13 piece collection so let me run you through the colors that you are getting included in here so you're going to get the orange you're also going to get the lemon tonic the honey pot the baby blue you've got the spring meadow the jet black pine tree straw bale fuchsia then you also have midnight lagoon plum jam and the ocean blue 13 pieces in there for you a great saving just like i said earlier uh with the pigment ink pads as well is rare that we got these larger collections in stock at the moment so do snap them up when you see them at 50 pounds or 70 dollars they equate to be 385 or 538 platinum members though you'd be looking at getting these for 40 pounds or 56 dollars meaning there'd be just over three pounds at just under 450 that's really really great value considering individually they are normally five pounds or seven dollars really lovely saving there for you something else that you might want to go for or maybe you didn't get them because i know they've been out of stock so so often are these finger daubers and these are brilliant these are great when you really need to add a little more finer detail to your projects you know the blending tools are great for laying down a lot of color but these are definitely great for adding smaller areas accenting and detailing your projects with our ink pads 2124 28 28.4 cents usual club inspired discount on there as well uh two now we're only halfway through this incredible launch it is exceptionally busy over a quarter of the stock has gone lots of different themes that you can bring in and also david we're talking about using the stamps that are in here i'm sure people are going to have a lot of stamps in their stash that they might want to incorporate as well also maybe you want to use these stamps and incorporate other alphabets some people in the comments earlier talking about left fold alphabets or maybe even using the butterfly alphabets and using these stamps with them absolutely you can and that's the great thing really about going for the whole collection is it gives you the most amount of options you've got the most amount of craft ability and when you can get them so affordably definitely snap them up and remember you're getting that exclusive stamp in there too some beautiful samples from the design team here debbie yeah i'd show a few more um different ones that we have got and again like you said joe about different ways that you can use them your different things that you have in your crafty stash this one has been used with one of those layering stencils love that debbie clean for the day that's me queen for the day but again this is what you can use so you can mix and match with other things that you have in your collection what about adding all the little elements i love this one that sean did there it's absolutely gorgeous where he's added the lovely um i mean very much what i just did when i made the background with those balloons but he's added one of the lee holland characters there to give it a touch really lovely and you can you can see the happy you can see that eclipse feature to it but it looks absolutely beautiful the butterflies oh this is just gorgeous i love this one absolutely love this one um where you've got these butterflies and then you can put whatever you want now the lady in question who's made this i definitely miss her so i miss you nicola because i used to see nikola quite often when i came up here unfortunately i don't get to see her as much as pencils that's been done with that debbie that one is let me just see what she's popped on here what she's used she's used the sparkle pens you know the sparkle pens um so yeah absolutely gorgeous look at that that lovely twinkle there but i love that one that's absolutely fabulous and popping it onto craft card what shawn's doing on this one he's put uh he's pulled he doesn't pull the tire do i apologize he's popped the um butterfly butterfly background there and and again just top the word oh i don't know what's going on debbie i'm going to be honest with you well honey and it's just something came out of my mouth when i said to say pop because i said something else but there we go so look at this one look at this one that lovely layering stencil again look how gorgeous that is nice yep we do a lot of that when we're in this room but again i mean this one this is lovely what trudy's done she's literally lifted up the word with foam pads nice but look how gorgeous that looks that lovely eclipse feature there i just think's fabulous and again there's so many things you can spell friend mom mom mom mommy mater whatever it is you spell it ass mater what's mate yeah it's me is it red to german for mutter i think it is it's mutter is it water yeah minor mutter minor mutation my mother mata yeah it's mutter that's how a bansley girl pronounces it that's what i'll say uh but look all different ways you can use these i mean that one's really fabulous oh i like that that's just so gorgeous isn't it but again you can see that eclipse feature absolutely oh it means mother in latin oh there you go i must have took latin at school are you so bilingual honestly uh do you know what i think would be lovely with these i haven't seen a lot done with them yet debbie you know some really sort of colorful dark sparkle background just plain washes and look nice weren't they with these beautiful yeah that would look really nice yeah i quite like that idea joel might have to get you on that one oh i've still got sparkle background you know that i made when we worked together for one of the first times debbie that was like two years ago now do you remember yeah yeah yeah we've got the unicorn where's it little unicorn stamp on yeah indeed all right lots of questions still coming in please keep getting them into me keep getting your pictures in as well where would you like to go next debbie what are we going to be doing next i'm going for a drink job but there you go you got it oh you have some pot then you get some pop i'll tell you what uh i'll tap dance while she do that i can't get me back you're having a drink yet are you drinking right it is still very very busy remember what you are getting in there it is literally like barbados in here today uh 2694 3417 is what you're saving as a club inspire platinum member are you rehydrated debbie robinson oh yeah i just had a quick swig i'm not going to take too much because it's a bit of fizzy pop and fizzy pop makes me a bit gaffy so that's the last thing we want uh joe i meant bursting i mean no i know that's what i meant live on air oh no you wouldn't be the first taking a little swig you wouldn't be the first presenter that burps live on air with me don't you worry about that one presenter once burped in one of my shows saying brussels sprout of all the things to burp during saying i know i'll remember it forever oh do you know i'll try not to i'll try and stifle it now then i'm gonna use the beautiful i couldn't do a show we could smell brussels sprouts couldn't we with these brussels sprouts you can yeah that'd be a good idea for a birthday card for him i wonder if he'd get the reference brussels sprout but yeah i'm gonna use the butterflies for this one so really lovely choices on here you've got lots of different butterflies to choose from again make your own background papers um that you can then cut out with your alphabet absolutely gorgeous i love these so i'm going to use my quick dry ink pads again and i've had to bring in me fuchsia or pig that's nice and clean that one yeah because this is not the quick dry one this is the fuchsia one i can't find a future quick dry ink pad oh no we're gonna have to blame we're gonna have to in fact you know what i'm gonna do producers when they're on these prices you think we'd treat ourselves wouldn't you yeah we think we treat ourselves yeah we're gonna have to treat ourselves we need to um we need to put them that's the thing actually yeah that's the thing every time they come in they go straight back out johnny's right there they do indeed it's like the hokey cokey with these ink pads but i'll just use that now again what i could do is put some um clear embossing powder shall we yes go on debbie i love it when you do that a clear embossing powder over there in fact let me just is it is it small enough to dunk in in you go i've never seen it dunked before devin yeah we're gonna start calling you debbie the dunk of robinson at this right now after this demonstration well it fitted just nice and neatly in this i thought might as well don't keep let's get a donkey oh sorry i snorted oh dear oh let me pull it back let me pull it back you could double you could do it once and then double dunk it yeah actually i could yeah because i could get a really nice enamel finish to it as well but because these are stamp still joking aside that's exactly what you can do so i'm just going to let this set if i should have let me go get to the right temperature first before i started using it uh maria's saying i'm making her laugh apparently apparently i'm very funny i try my best we do like to have a nice time don't you hate crafters tv we like to get some crafting done we also like to have a good giggle and keep you all entertained as well stephanie says you two are so funny it's amazing some days that anything gets accomplished some days stephanie every day it's amazing i am always amazed peg says we have heard windy pops in the background we're all friends here oh windy pops in the background what's the windy part i think peg means they heard someone do a windy pops in the background watching all our shows oh it wasn't it was so basically i'll level with you right there's a lorry park just behind the studio here and apparently a lorry drivers gave us a good couple of honks on his horn and then everyone was saying that maybe it was ben or craig took the flame it was definitely a horn don't worry oh dear that's hilarious i can't believe it yeah because we've got like we're in like an industrial park well it is an industrial parking thing this is a business park yes so lots of lorries you can smell beer hops as well when you go out there because beer hops because there's a brewery somewhere near here it's really pongy so i stink uh but honestly so you get you get to smell those as well when uh when they get going now i'm just gonna give myself a nice little i've cut my little butterfly down down into little squares here and these squares measure because i'm going to make a little bit of an arm decor piece you know i've just started this demonstration and forgot to tell you what i'm doing a two and a half inch square and i'm just going to give myself um four little butterflies all decorated up um into in fact to tell you what was yeah well we'll look out we'll carry on with a few more there in fact no i've got a couple more demonstrations planned so i'll just speed this one up a little bit so that i can show you uh but you just carry on so what i've done is i've got me one two three four little butterflies all ready and ready to go i'll save them for another time and then what we'll do is we'll spell out a word so this time i'm gonna spell h oh there we go i have two options here where are we going to go well it could be hope or it could be home oh so i i was thinking where is it going because i'm thinking and we're gonna i didn't know what to spell myself at first but i'm going with home home deco so there we go so i'm gonna go in with a home now again because these are small jaw and that's a small they're not they're not as small as the small pieces well you would would you you know these two in my hands no idea what's going on in there i [Laughter] she's always very giddy yeah um nope nobody a little handy thought that you told her at the beginning at shore no i don't think so johnny's birthday coming out so johnny's johnny's fake friday today he's giddy debbie's always giddy when she's here yeah first day of five so i'm giddy it's that's why we're having so much fun today is it your birthday on monday producer johnny birthday on monday oh i didn't know that i thought i thought you know i did it what was the birthday cake the other day then that was our five year anniversary yeah so that wasn't your birthday cake does that mean there's more cake on monday you might be taking on wednesday i'm not here wednesday so i'm gonna miss out on the cake oh hang on so we're talking about windy pops craigs calls burps windy pops we've we called but that's what we were referring to as well i thought we'd got on a different tangent i just need to maybe just maybe fold that up just pop that away and not talk about that again for the rest of the show uh adam rose says omg you two are killing me you're okay to me it's just you i'm wrapping it up i'll put it in the pocket in there here we don't need that i can just stay in there for now for the rest of the show uh debbie you are a writer i have to love you says samantha cheney oh bless you thank you i think it's because it's so warm today here it is i was actually going to ask is it possible we can have the door open at all because it's open the doors it started starting to feel really really ridiculously hot in here it's either that or my internal clock let me tell you because i am incredibly hot and it started starting to affect me i don't know what anybody else gets like when they get hot uh but it's starting to really get to me a little bit so thank you very much for that i've got a fan on me and it's still not it's still not keeping me cool so thank you joe now you've just got to remind jake that we've got the door open [Laughter] but everybody else is it's their own for the weekend so we're okay aren't we we're all right all right so now what i've done is each one of these individual ones has created me a little background drop again and also um the letter in there as well but again now we've got all those spelled out let me just put these back on here um joe because i know what i'm like i'll end up losing my alphabet there we go now then i'm going to bring in now a little bit of a what i call an arm deco piece that i've made myself here so i'm just going to push these to one side remember like i said about keeping the middle bit because the middle bit is important okay so we're going to move these just to one side while i just compose my little home decor piece so i've used um some papers now do you know if i love the money i can't remember where i've got these papers from but what i've just done joe is i've actually just cut myself with some black cardstock i've cut myself a little plaque um at six by six i've got myself some white stamping cards so i'm just going to apply that to the back what if i done when we glue lynne harvey said she wishes what the she could hear what the gallery was saying sometimes we'd get taken off airline we really would you don't you really don't want to sometimes they say hello and craig's wake up call honestly i did the first one i'd ever heard it i wondered what was going on yeah i thought i'd do the message a message from above when they spoke out in the show yeah i think that was really clever how they did that i didn't realize that they couldn't talk to us in the studio if they wanted anything if they want to yeah they can yep there we go so i've just popped that onto there and then what i'm going to do uh joe is i'm going to add my papers on now let's just get um grab this one at the bottom and again this could be made up of anything you could use any kind of style papers for this but um you know i'm gonna have to remember where i've got this paper come on joe paper pad king where did we get this one which one's this one which one that is from the staycation i think that cloudy one isn't it so is this the get it got it good i think so i mean um don't don't take that as you know as the as fact go to checker.com after the show to see i think i've just had one of those light bulb moments do you know the pop-up boxes pop out the pop-outs no it's not the staycation is it the staycation no i was right you're mocking me from my uh lack of knowledge about paper pads i say we're meant to be friends right now i've got this piece but i'm going to just add myself my little bow on the back sorry joe i didn't mean to mock i just thought you know for once i've got a paper pad right but i'm just going to pop a little bit of glue just onto the back there now i could seal this in you know because this is going to be a little home decor hanging i could seal this in with another piece of cardstock over the back so that the ribbon is kept really nice and neat as well but what i've just done now is got myself my little plaque going and now i'm going to pop on now my words however i need to make sure they pop off a little bit more so i've taken some um some um oh my days nested squares that's the word i was looking for gosh today today just today and i'm trying to find my phone pads joe so let me just have a little fiddle around on these loads of people loving this show uh hadassah says what is it which i mean debbie uh joe and the debbies uh he always let me try that again hadassah i can only apologize hadassah says what is it with joe and the debbies he always has them cracking up i do the debbies are they are always such good fun uh debbie fisher is a right old giggling she's got a proper old giggle out ebbs she really has it cracks me up a giggle bed says so lovely shows laughter and learning exactly what could be better than laughter and learning on a weekend eve bee's got a song stuck in her head she's got a world he's got a song stuck in her head she's got stuck in her head it's getting hot in here so take off all your clothes is going around in eve b's head absolutely not eve honestly looks like a blue in the wind i'm fine i'm fine joe i'm fine you are funny honestly oh deary me you do crack me up let me just because i've actually realized i've cut my little uh my little square out here so let me just pop a little bit onto the back very very busy on this collection honestly the heat is getting twisted here i think it's getting resolved if anyone watches this show back at a later date and critiques as debbie i am just going to say that it's very warm in here and i think it has made us a little giddy very busy still on that big collection uh over a quarter gone now also the alphabet on its own is getting very very busy i'll quickly flash the details of that up for you 22.99 or 24.95 if you want to get ahold of that too so i mean they work beautifully i think it's always lovely to have the whole collection but the alphabet will work away from the stamps on its own as will the stamps away from the alphabet two so you've got lots and lots of options when it comes to using this right so i've got all my panels on there now joe so what did i do with my foam pads there they just put that on there so what i'm gonna do now is bring back in my uh my lovely words already cut out so what i'm gonna do again is i'm gonna lift these off a little bit in fact you know what do you know what let me just yeah no oh oh i know what i've done oh debbie that's because i got my frames there that's it and they were going to go over top oh do you know sometimes i do worry about myself joe that's why i've done these let me just i'm thinking to myself where'd i cut those out that's why that's why because i wanted them to frame each one i think these are you know again you're gonna have to excuse me i sometimes get like this where i forget which ones i've actually used but i quite like that idea that's going to sit over there and then the frame will sit just over the top makes it pop a little bit more don't it's quite nice yeah quite like that one so i'm just going to literally let me um yep it was my tape pen so let's pop a little bit round to the back of each one and just pop that on we'll try and keep this nice and straight again because the clip for the key to this is to make sure that you get it nice and um so it sits nice and square on there now again i'm just going to where's my 3d collage i keep moving stuff joe have you seen it stay that side oh dear it's not nice and tidy in here today oh you got time to well you are debbie's going to be you'll be with these will you will correct yes yeah

debbie oh don't forget also debbie in about 15 minutes we need to do that vote for the demonstration of the show don't let me forget oh i forgot all about that i did forget about that joker we didn't do it this morning because we didn't do it on the morning show so oh i quite like that idea right now then let me think let me think so shall i use the stars i love this one look at this in fact the proper title is stars and celebrations again another lovely set of stamps here that you can use and to create your backgrounds for your uh your projects and so i'm going to use this with another new launch that we had out quite recently which was those border panel dies as well because we got myself a little easel card but again these stars and celebration stamps are just absolutely exquisite and if i just show you for a second let me pop that down there again those different designs always can see a little bit better on some white cards i love this one oh that is just gorgeous i love that that stamp and you've got a nice little ring one there some separate stars as well again if you've noticed joe a lot of these collections they you're gonna be able to use them so you know the stars and the balloons they've got the same thing so you've got that lovely stripe running through it those little hundreds and thousands bits in there so you could have a nice little play with these to create something if you're going for the whole set and at that price i'd be really surprised if you wasn't because to get everything all in one goal for me is always the best bit right so let's make a background so let's have um i'm gonna use my quick dry ink pads again i've got baby blue this time i've got midnight i've got ocean blue and i'm going to use one of my metallic ink pads on this as well to create something just a little bit more um what's the word uh classy that's a nice word we'll have the classy words uh but yeah just have a little play around now so again i'm just go oh joe george jojo we need cam can we produce johnny can we have a little memo can we write a little melt can we have a new set of ink pads i think i think basically we need to get all of them i think we need to have a set of new ink pads well i hope they're all in stock well that's the thing that is the thing they might not be but we definitely need to get ourselves um a new pad because these are um starting to um they've been contaminated then i'm not gonna say dried up but they're a bit they've been a bit contaminated so i think yeah we're i think it's about to take a bit of a battering here in the studio well of course they do because um we uh we use them ever such a lot in all of our classes and um i don't know if anybody i don't i don't tend to bring me on anymore because we've got these sets to hand so i don't bring my own up anymore but i think um i think we might have to do in fact yeah i think i have to start bringing my colors up until we get a new set and that's a thing we need to check to see whether or not they're in stock however we'll start building this up again let me grab myself a little bit of tissue um and we will start to build our background so that's just one of it like a bit what would you call that joy is it like a star burst starbucks reminds me like a dandelion clock or a firework yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a good one to describe isn't it yeah absolutely oh what was that i just dropped something on the floor it'd be fine i'll pick it up in a minute joe i'll pick it up in a minute i'm going to go in with midnight with this one because i want it to be really striking i love this stamp this stamp is d vine oh and i could think of many ways that i'd be able to use this jaw let's just pop that down but look at this watch this love in that lush it's absolutely beautiful i love this stamp i think that this one's going to become a firm favorite of mine this one it's absolutely beautiful really really love it so let's just pop that on there let's build all these elements up absolutely gorgeous what is there not to love about this collection jar looking that star it is gorgeous it's absolutely gorgeous it really is sim says goodness can they keep it together for another 30 minutes i hope not this is the best crafting time uh face just placed her third order of the week she's got hold of these lin sayings i'll just put my order through for the eclipse letters and stamp collection too uh we've also got a new viewer hello to elise who's watching us on youtube says new to the crafters companion tv love these shows so much fun while i learn new things judy lin says well love the eclipse dice and stamps uh and also uh clarden says always love watching these shows i learned so much but the bonus is how much fun we have absolutely oh we we do and we do joker's side we have some real good fun don't we joe we love these shows all of the team love bringing these shows to you because it's all about that education as well as having a little bit of crafty fun um and i do love our little crafty family i'm not gonna lie you know it always puts a smile on my face no matter which show i watch i wish i wish i had enough hours in the day to watch them all but sometimes i find myself going back on shows as well because you know the ones that i i just love that i just absolutely love uh the whole community that we've got here at crafter's competition it's fantastic and also yeah as you were saying talk about what she shows back deborah you can watch any show back at any time for free on our website it's like the netflix of craft that's how i like to think about it there's a fully on-demand system uh you can go over the website craftscompanion.com.com if you own every single crafters companion product ever you're going to love watching it even if you don't own a single crafters companion product you're going to find hints tips inspiration education that you're going to absolutely love using across all of your crafts so between shows if you are new to watching this definitely go over there and have a look i love that effect with the metallic ink and this just honestly in this just gorgeous can you see that shimmer and shine do you know what you could do you could actually put your because this is a an opaque pigment ink pad as well you could add your clear embossing powder to really make it stand out but this stamp i mean oh my goodness what is there not to love about this stamp set it's absolutely beautiful this i mean i can think straight outside the box that that alphabet aside the alphabet absolutely fantastic yep you're going to be able to make these gorgeous cards with your background stamps with ease but these stamps are something that i'm going to be able to use time and time and time again they're absolutely glorious i'm just going to find myself a little bit of a white because i want to wipe this down i'm just going to add a couple more elements joe but honestly and also i'm just using this as a little wipe just to clean that off and then a bit of tissue paper over the top just to give it a nice little clean down uh and then honestly i mean this is just you can see how well it's coming together now really love that um addition to the uh with the gold minus gold and midas ink pad oh if that were a mouthful then um but i'm just gonna finish that off now where's that other little star that i really do like on here and kalinowska says in connecticut it says the stars will be nice for july 4th oh yeah yeah absolutely they would that oh there it is i love that one uh they'd look fantastic weren't they yeah but i love that idea love that idea right so i'm just going to finish off now with a couple a little more and then we'll start to put his words together so let's just give it a little uh finish off just add it and this is what i'm about this this bit here for me is the creative side just making your own background paper i mean even if you weren't going to use the alphabets over the top of that now and create something that is in an eclipse style just for sitting and play what a lovely time you could have spending the afternoon just making your own background papers and you know i'd be so i would do joe i really would now i'm just going to give it a little bit of an edge so where did i put the ink there we go here we go let's just take um shall we have yeah i'll have the midnight pop the midnight and i'm just going to finish that on just by running a little bit of ink around the edge just to make it pop a little bit more and you've probably seen sarah do this and some of the other craft experts that do this it just gives it a little bit of a pop without having to add just around the edge can you see there yeah um you could take your ink pad directly to it depending on how brave you are so you'll see some people pick up their ink pad and just literally touch around the side i prefer the other method because you can't control it as much when you're doing it that way but you can control it when you've got an ink adobe in your hand and it just makes it pop that little bit more really love this how we doing for time we're okay for time yeah we've got loads fabulous i think sometimes it's nice to see these processors where you do it from start to finish um and i do i do genuinely mean that but look how gorgeous that is looking now how fabulous is that wonderful ready to do my die cutting with so let me just put my last little stamp back on there and i'm doing a bit of a bit of housekeeping getting everything back into its place because i know what i'm like and i end up losing bits and bobs so i just want to pop lisa saying she loves your teachings uh debbie and she says this is looking absolutely fabulous it really is getting busier and busier and busier as we move towards the end of the show lots of you ordering and getting checked out now and i can't wait to see everyone joining us for that craft along which will be fabulous at the end of april with myself and hillary make sure you join us both for that later in april i love that i thought that's lovely but we want to tune in for watching our lovely hillary as you know or people who may not know what larry is hillary is leanne's a right and woman she is um a part of the product development team so all these products that you get i mean who better to do a craft along than one of the people that are behind you know you you'll get some behind the scenes maybe she might share a secret or two she does yeah absolutely johnny she's the first person that gets her hands on these products to play with so not only is she part of the development team getting it from start to finish she has a good old play with them as well so absolutely yeah she's going to be the one for that show she really really is right so i've got my wish because i thought for this one with it being stars i thought that'd be quite a nice one to do so again i'm just going to place them i quite like the idea of eagle the piglet i like them all floating around yeah i think it looks slow i'm just going to try to get it into a place where i'm happy with and the best thing about it before you actually commit to it you can have that little play around because this is you know it's your project and and who's to say what's right and wrong you could have it nice and straight if you wanted i'm just going to go down here joe because what i did drop earlier was my law tap tape so i'm just going to hold that into place i'm going to pop those down make sure that doesn't move too far away there we go pop that down yeah i'm quite happy with that and then i'm going to pop that on to my plate so again let's pop that down and run that through thin metal die combination as always um and obviously depending on the size of the projects you're working with will be dependent on what size uh machine you use or the size of your plates that you use um i'm getting away with gemini junior popping it into a large gemini but they will go through all your other machines as well brenda's asking how long the pigment inks take to dry debbie pigment inks take a few minutes to dry um if they stay open that little bit longer because of the fact that you cannot then add to them uh things like your clear embossing powders or glitter embossing powders to create your own custom made colours as well which is what i love about the pigment inks but yeah a few minutes i would say they're not like the quick dry the quick dry instant mint touch that paper i mean nano seconds it literally is you saw me go straight in and start to move it it literally dries instantly and the water reactive obviously and they're quite quick and drying as well so but they're say a few minutes for the uh for the um the opaque pigment ink pad fabulous right so i've got my words now so let's take this off let's cut take this there we go all the way out i'm just going to make sure i've got all my letters out there we go joe just taking my time with this because i want to make sure i've got all those out there let's pop that down there and then grab my poke tool and poke those out so i've got my w me i me s and my h there we go so we've got those words spelled out as well and they're going to go and fit back in there but first things first i'm going to get together the base of the card so for this one i've taken and let me just give you the measurements again this is a six by six um base and it's actually five and three quarters to be fair it could fit inside a six by six card but i've just scored it from top to bottom because i'm going to give a little bit of um easel feature and i've also let me move that to one side taken some of our luxury luxury gold uh cardstock for this so i'm just going to stick this on and again now let me think where did i get this um this paper from dear me me and me papers today oh joe it's one of the recent ones isn't it oh i know i know i've just remembered i've just remembered hey i think i might be getting better at this where is it from it's do you know the year of the crafts yeah it's the year of the crafts paper pad so do you know you could buy the extras the 8x8 pad it's from there that's what that one's from yeah i knew it to come to me see i'm not so daft after all joe i've got i've got that i've got there in the end i still won't like to challenge you though in that paper pad because i think you'd win well i would guess that one did you not no oh honestly i just i've got like light bulb moment again but i don't know if anybody is the same as me i've got that many oh i'm not happy with that that's that's a bit off oh he's so super strong that glue it is so strong it really is once you get that down but just didn't quite have it in the center classic color combo here debbie thank you very much joe thank you very much now then i'm going to actually pop behind there now so i've got the gold behind so this time i'm gonna just use my tape pen all the way around there let's just pop there we go yep and then just line that up and again let's try and make it centralized that looks about right yeah that'll do there we go and that's going to sit on the front part of my cards like so however what we need to do is pop back in the words so i've actually got a little bit of a stopper as well because look what i've got oh that's gorgeous where's that from well this is the latest border panel dyes that we've had on this week oh these are launched in the week yeah and i just think that these absolutely suit these stars down to the ground and look how well they work and that's going to act as my little topper and i'm going to have it just going across there but i need to lift it slightly so let me see if i can cut down a couple of me let me take oh me and that blinking fingers dropped on the floor again ah do you know my um low tactic yeah it's the law tap tube it keeps do you know what it is does it stick to your back wings it's these it's these it's these things they knock thing i mean look how white look at this good job you weren't wearing it last week when it was windy you took off i would have took off i really would have took off in this um they keep catching things can you imagine joe you see me going across um ed office in aircliff flying up the m1 uh nettie news says this what a great name nettie new on youtube says this set is just falling into my bar to get think i need to buy a larger house i really don't have any room in my house for crafts companions wonderful products do you know what if crafting is you the excuse you need to get a new house we're here for you we are we'll enable you in this sense don't you worry about that uh nona asks uh debbie will the midas ink pads take the same time as the pigment ink pads to dry great question uh these so the pigment ink pads and the midas yes these are the both opaque pigment ink pads they're in that same metallic yep so absolutely so i'm just going to make sure that that acts as me topper there there we go so i'm just going to place that in there and i've used believe you can and you're halfway there and then i'm going to now add on so oh wait a minute have me back wings knocked him flying oh the real look oh whew for you nearly thought i'd lost that then joe oh that would have been a disaster that would have been a disaster now then again you could pop on the back of these you could pop um foam pads cut your form pads down like i just did with that decorative border panel and that would really give them a nice lift off so by that i mean you would take your phone pass the ones that craig talks about being ideal you know the ones that come on a sheet um the foam sheet they would be absolutely perfect but you can cut them down there's nothing to stop you from cutting them down to size so for this one i'll just do i'll just do it with this one so that you can see that i'm taking my time though not to cut off the bottom of my w because i don't want that to happen um so let me just see if i can lift that up a little bit tv nails are one thing but when they start getting in the way start to drive you a little bit mad so let me just pop that down for a second so let me just move those bits out of the way and then also i'm gonna do is place that back in and i'm just going to lightly slightly just move that out of the way well i've just realized i've not stuck one up back leg i'm going to minute i've got a minute joe i've got a bit of a wobbly yeah i've got a bit of a wobbly back leg because i forgot to put my form pad on there never fear three doo through chunky glue is that hans there we go i don't know where we're going with that one sorry joe frudy you sounded like mr t mr t well oh no that's what i want to say what you're talking about willis that's different strokes in it that one sorry um oh you're too you're too young for that that's not mr t i'm thinking what you talking about willis were different strokes was a um it was a comedy did you not remember i have no idea um so there were gary corbin in it and i'm trying to think who else was in it we're a little i'm saying a little american company we're a massive american comedy uh back in the i want to say the 80s i'm going to go with the 80s for that one but can you see now it's starting to lift off like i said though what you could do just to make them pop out a little bit more is add a little tiny tiny bit of ink just onto there to make them pop that little bit more but i'm quite happy with this so i'm just going to add another little foam pad to the back there we go and this is when the fun starts you can start to personalize make them want to say whatever you want to say oh we should have done one for johnny shouldn't we have a birthday card that's what we should have done his birthday card who made johnny a birthday card on air last week during one of johnny's show so he saw what it was anyway me was it you did craig do it as well oh i say what's he like did he get in before me i might have known i might have known hey i love him to bits i wonder if he's sunbathing on his new um his new furniture because he's uh oh he's got a sexy gun he has yeah he's being treated himself and i mean he works so hard bless him what has it been theater in that backyard there's so many seats in there well apparently once um once social distance is lifted we're all going up for the past we are allowed to meet up in groups of six in back gardens from a week on monday debbie nine days time well that next time i'm up then that's a dick rig get your sausage on the barbie craig we're coming around [Laughter] um you know i can't wait because it'd be nice to be with people again now then can you see where that is lifted and can you go in close there charlotte let's have a look see if you can get in close can you see it now camouflaged in there eclipsed in there but it's got that bit of height and that dimension because i've used the um the foam badge pads apart from my little w there just on that other end and then we're just going to fit that to the front there joe so let's pop that on and make sure that goes that yeah that's the way i need to do it so i'm going to pop a little bit of blue tape just onto this bottom section and then literally manage that just in the middle there and there we go using as well one of the latest designs that we have along with this brand new collection today you've got that beautiful decorative panel board which just works so well with this collection and that

with I've got some chicken made a bum sauce over here I gotta pee and I've got a tablespoon of regular vegetable oil and a teaspoon of sesame oil um I took my chicken two days ago and I use some of this plum sauce here and I used a little bit of white vinegar but I do use rice wine vinegar and I put it into here with two chicken breasts all right and to start a little marinade going ahead of time and that's been in there for two days ah so on the deck we've got some broccoli which I'm going to steam off some green onions some red peppers yeah I got a lot of stuff on my table huh most of us about cooking I'm always ready to make a roux you know mr. sesame oil just pulled out soy sauce a little bit of garlic plum sauce that you can find this store but you can also if your research up um some of my shows you'll find me make it with actual plum sauce with actual plums okay so huh you guys are like he don't even nothing yet yeah I noticed but anyways um excuse me how to run a show here all right ed sense what am i doing all right i knows what's that doing i knows what i doing i'm looking for this and this and this so i could put my bra in here and hair for its name because I do my veggies first on my board and then i do my meat and then wash before so it's neat cover one little water all right start the rice soon as i got home I'm really hungry I did my run real early and what's doubt and played frisbee with a kid and with my homie okay good good start like rough night you guys are like how does he yeah I know I'm not cut a finger off when I'm doing that look I can actually do the head thing why I'm not going to be nice my blade is low cut sharply oh yeah okay yeah those were all nice thin slices but my blade wasn't getting all the way to the back of me all right fun show off and see be humble man beyond moon just be kicking it with your crew man out the new snow you make it remember them to making bobsledders it was fan got some brothers running right that's wrong like Longest Yard Man he does drew become the boards anyways man that's uh that's our broccoli telling us it's about done alright that's our rice telling us it's done okay I'm trying not to like I can having lots of dishes to do when I do a show because I get the stuff off free prepped for you guys often so we're going to do our chicken first we're going to drain it okay because I'm going to put it on my board i can save a little of that juice actually i'm just i'm going to save about a ounce of it yeah that'd be good news their chicken i would say that alanson i'm gonna help that with the sauce hook that up with the sauce errors are broccoli done i'm also i want to do Oh God ah chimney hahaha ok said don't bend down get that stand up and get it sup here somewhere oh man dude sesame in boxes no I George still smells wonderful ah oh this is from my buddy James all right all this stuff game drew mmm yeah directly from Taiwan so we got black sesame and we've got some regular sesame here and he does this cute little trick I showed you guys that that's how they do it in Taiwan man over an Asian man they have cellophane bags this is not made out of oil made out of cellophane or cellulite in some form of plant fiber and you know so they're not punching all this what we punch into our environment on a daily with plastics because it's oil-based because it's a huge massive economy you know what I mean so we're going to have to change things around because all we do is trash it and put it back in the end of the environment and that stuff is really poisonous you know all the plastic we have living in our houses you know more we got more poisonous it is but that's just a thought you know but I know when I was homeless and I was walking the streets alone long time ago and about 2005 and it probably got a thirsty and he ain't got no money and man he just want something to drink and I was hot and there was this iced tea lying there and it was brand-new it had been lying in the Sun for a minute haha alright always gonna want to tell you is that Snapple peach iced tea tasted like a plastic not a little bit though Bob oh yes I don't get all it was back in the day alright i don't think i need anything else from up here we're going to start with just slapping the chicken right in oh then our um where to go red pepper green pepper oh yeah water chestnuts put your two items at the end that added near the end um like the broccoli that makes I make another Chinese dish this week so let's see those need to be taking all going about same time okay so taking a handful water chestnuts they're about half the can write and then got somebody who want we can have enough of that right enough of that oh yeah good enough of that oh all right okay and reach in there and get a couple em out I love these things man just claim break them their comp big there used to be a little bit more on the baby side back in the day alright that these are pretty big yeah keep the baby form like that this I can keep in booth all right we need to cook them my pants off that real quick and I'm gonna try Oh click run I'm gonna put the meat back to the bottom see how I did that I got a rotated old man well and got the meat all to the bottom chick and still got some cooking to do put it I'm going to add a little bit more sesame oil right now gettin and then I know it six garlic soy sauce okay is my finger I've been limited by market okay over here we have two broccoli we have the plum sauce we have the rook Shar slurry our chicken is about done I'm going to give them though the move here all right ok now I'm going to create our saw this I need that's what we're going to start with running it down uh-huh then we're going to put that tartar sauce in that was in marinade alright we want that to cook for a second because it has raw chicken in it okay and it s is highly acidic so it's going to give an extra flavor in there I can push down on sauce this is the plum sauce you hitting every you know this is americanized bum sauce there are plums that grow all over eugene and springfield it's a very small plum it's red and some of them are yellow and those are actually prized by Chinese restaurants as a as a true plum sauce and that's what I made a mate um oh man that's so tasty made this dish from once all right so we put three teaspoons that bump sauce in there I'm putting in about a tablespoon of sesame ok turn temperature way down and then I'm going to put my broccoli am and we don't have enough for a sauce there so I'm going to add water cold water to my slurry just to build up the sauce a little bit okay make sure it's all lifted all right and so when use that yeah if you say my kitchens and mess is a little bit I was supposed to clean last night or yesterday or yeah like I said man it takes like a whole bunch of dishes to do the show uh huh excuses excuses I had may I be excused please I think that's up I think there's something wrong with my knees my head it gets moving it in a funny way I can't seem to make it stop all right and the water they're raised that back temperature save the rest of the plum sauce because I'm with you at all that's how you do it in a restaurant you think ahead about what you're going to do next your next maneuver and in restaurant you'd be thinking 20 things ahead you know and then watching another hundred things and keeping another 500 things in your head and keeping a thousand things memorized that's how it restaurants that's what a chef does and that can change periodically every 10 minutes okay that's what it's yep that's right we're having interesting conversation some chef buddies and I about you know time and skill and where your skill set lies and you know how you lose some skill sets the time goes by and I'm sure I can agree with that I'm gonna set you up now so you can see I'm on on the level that uh back in the day when I cut all the big fish for red lobster I had really good skills with a knife right I mean amazing Jade cuts out of the fish being able to hit 10 ounces almost on mark because that was our selling weight and being able to gauge how many pieces to get out of the fish and then make beautiful fillets out of them after I cut them because we were getting fish like this big blaze this big they're off that big now but the halibut and snapper and monkfish and soul this big and it's just tuna tuna swordfish this big fat around man beautiful blood koruna men just before the big fish of all the big fish disappeared in like a year there's word because red lobster got the best all right there we go there's our whites yes our wide eyes basmati local stuff all right never got chicken sauce and sesame buns off oh how much just cost me yeah this one was about 450 because there's a baby corn and the the water chestnuts are made it more spending here I'll zoom in the girl stay said sauce over yeah oh I did want to add you to it I got tuned in I can do that on my own all right so that's our show", "pVkrXpyyguE": "how you doing i thought it would be fun for us to process some flowers again we had such great response to the last set where we processed flowers and i have a big event coming up tomorrow night i'm doing a garden club show for uh my friends at beth shalom garden club in uh boston area and uh they have a couple other garden clubs they're gonna join them and so we're gonna have a great little garden club uh thing tomorrow night and we're gonna make some beautiful arrangements and stuff like that and i thought it would be fun to hey i have to process the flowers anyway so why not have an experience with you about processing flowers again i had so many questions and stuff and you know flowers change all the time there's always so many different kinds of flowers that we're getting in and certain things that when i'm packing something i'm thinking oh i wish i could share it with you and tell you about that and typically when i do these types of events in person which we're getting closer to we're getting closer to coming back in person and being able to do those things one of the things is i get to go pick out the flowers that's a really fun experience to go pick out the flowers no matter where it is if we're getting that you know sometimes the san francisco flower market sometimes the boston flower market with this group um this group in boston uh my friend sue kaplan is part of it and i'm just crazy about her we've been friends for a long long time and she has a wonderful event company and she's just that she just goes and goes and goes she's the uh she's the ever ready uh bunny i think you know when it comes to flower arranging and stuff and we've been great friends so we've spent many hours in uh flower markets selecting flowers um she also worked with me several oh gosh it's been who knows soon i don't want to count um when i did uh the boston museum of fine arts art in bloom and i was the featured presenter there and she took me to the flower market and we got to pick out flowers together and it's always fun to do that so maybe that's something for the future where i can maybe take you along with me when we pick out flowers and so today what we're going to do is we're going to get these flowers ready and that's something that i always enjoy because typically there's four or five people that come and help you get ready and so you know i am a fanatic when it comes to processing and touching my flowers i really really take this seriously okay and i don't like people who touch flowers and stuff like that i just want to care for them i want to make sure that they're really wonderful people who run their hands over blooms makes me insane i hate that and so um i'm very i'm very particular about the way that that goes and so today what we're going to do is we're going to divide these products up into buckets um so that i can use them for different projects so i have buckets back here that have two gallons of water in them ice cold water right out of the tap and then i'm going to go ahead and add my chrysal professional uh three which is my favorite one especially when we're talking about something that's going to be tomorrow night i want to make sure that i use my chrysler professional three i'm not trying to hold them i want them to open up i want them to get beautiful this product is going to ensure that all the blooms open that they get bigger because it's going to feed the flower so it can get larger it's going to intensify the color so that the color is more vibrant if it has a fragrance it will intensify the fragrance it will feed the foliage so that the foliage can get nice and green and produce photosynthesis so that it will create suction and draw the water back up those are the things that are contained inside this product right here that's the important thing and this one is my favorite chrysler professional three there's chrysler professional true that wholesalers use or people at a flower market where they want to hold something for a period of time i don't ever want to hold i want it to open up and get prettier and especially we're gonna do some roses today especially when we get to roses we want them to open up okay and open roses are wonderful and with this product it's going to increase the volume of that rose so instead of having a rose that's this big and holding solution we're going to have a rose that gets this big in chrysler professional 3 because it's expanding the bloom and making it bigger so um that's why we use these products again if you're interested when we do this and air this on youtube i will put the chrysler link over there but it's youballoom.com backslash by buy chrysler c-h-r-y-s-a-l buy chrysler that takes you right to their website mention youbloom for a free gift but that way i'm ensuring that you're getting to them there's no middleman in between there and you're paying the best price that you possibly can so that's great um chrysler professional three i also have my cbbm tablets but i don't think there's anything really today that's gonna warrant me using that but we'll see we'll see maybe they're always at the ready okay um chrysler and christ professional glory um i got questions last time do i spray these with christ of the russian glory not yet not until i've created the arrangement and then it's a finishing spray that is going to make sure that they last as long as possible in the final arrangement the other thing that i thought would be fun i'm going to post a second video after we make this one i'm going to prep the containers for my event on line here a for the people who are going to attend the garden club show they can go watch that then but it saves me time so i can make more pretty things in the limited amount of time that we have and so we'll have one about processing the flowers we'll have a second one about getting the containers ready and then um what i'll do is i'll come back too because it's a private event so i can't share it with you sorry about that but um after it's over i can come back and show you the finished products so we'll do a video about the finished product so you can see oh that container turned into that thing this thing turned into that thing and you know what if you want to have a private event i'm always available for that too so we can do that as well but i figured this was kind of give us an opportunity to do these things that i would have just done here by myself um in the studio and so i wanted you to be along for the ride so i have these four buckets back here the buckets that i took to the flower cellar this morning was this bucket i have a bucket down here i have another bucket back here i filled those with cold water and put my chrysal professional three in and took them with me to the flower cellar so that as i was picking out things i could immediately put them into the buckets and it really really helps to do that because then they're not traveling they don't get laid on top of each other they don't get crushed it's just a really great way for me to do that sure it's a little bit of extra work but that's okay i i love that okay so each of these has two gallons in it and so one pump for a gallon so i need to add my chrysler professional glory two shots in each of these there we go i made a huge mess but that's all right you know that's what it's all about um and that's why i have my bounty paper channels all right so there we go i missed a squirt that didn't go in the bucket it went into my shelf back here with my flower frogs so yeah this everyone's someone was asking me about the shelf the other day these are these aren't all my flower frogs i have about 700 sorry um i have a problem okay um but these are my [Music] favorite ones and so they're in this little case back here and so um i just left for other frogs i think they're pretty cool and these are all the wire metal ones i have i have glass ones upstairs and i have figuring ones and stuff like that too so all right so now we're ready we have these buckets so that we can separate things first things first i also take a shorter bucket always because when i have a tall bucket and i try and stick hyacinth in them or tulips in them or these beautiful clooney ranunculus or my calla lilies if i try and stick stuff down inside that they're gonna get crushed okay and so um everybody's down inside here now the thing about this and what i'm gonna tell you about it is i have my tulips in here they're standing up straight they were dry packed at the wholesaler meaning that they come in a box with no water and so they're laying in that box they're starting to curve up because they're phototropic so i put them in here i left their uh wrappers on them to kind of straighten them up okay my collars are in here and actually the project i'm going to do with my cows is going to be a wind swirl type of arrangement so you can tell that these were also phototropic in their box and so when i took them out of the bucket at the wholesale house i just bought the box there i dropped them in here okay and then my clooneys are on the end up there so that they don't get damaged and and get hurt okay so everybody's up there on the end and i just wanted to show you those they're beautiful they're pretty and i'm just going to leave them there i did not cut i did not cut my tulips or my hyacinth when i placed them into that bucket they were dry i did not cut them and i just place them in the water that will slow them down it's not going to make them burst into bloom and color up right away because i want the stems to be a little more solid when i'm arranging with them tomorrow night and so i just put them in the cold water with the chrysler professional three and they'll start to take up some water because they had calluses on the end right and so they will slowly start to come to life if i wanted to speed them up and have them be beautiful blooms ready to go a little bit taller tomorrow i would have cut them all and that's what would have happened they would color up much faster okay but i don't want to do that because i want to have them a little more stable for the arrangements that i'm going to make and so i'll explain that to you in the uh in the prepping one a little bit about where flowers are going to go and things like that okay so hope you grabbed your favorite beverage and you have your favorite music on i do not have my music on so you can hear me but um that's okay and so now we're gonna we're gonna work with the other things so i have stuff in boxes here so this is yellow dogwood um beautiful available right now really nice i'm going to use it for an armature type arrangement that i'm going to make it is this was dry packed at the hosa house it was just standing up in bundles in the corner of the of the wholesale house and um i wanted to take up some water and get moving along a little bit so that it doesn't seem so dry at the ends okay so there we go i gave everybody a fresh angled cut and this is yellow dogwood there's red dogwood as well and so it's going to go over here i'm going to have a bucket for yellow flowers i'm going to have a bucket for pink flowers i'm going to have a bucket for green flowers so i like to divide them up by color or by project because then when i'm bringing them out to make an arrangement then i've got what i need in that bucket okay and i feel like it's always really good when i'm at the flower seller to think about it that way too because it's like okay how many things do i have in this do i have enough entities different color shapes and forms to make this look really beautiful so with this this is going to be oh i'm gonna get this guy out of the way too so now just as a happenstance matter of fact um this is the first thing out of my garden i trimmed these this morning these are willows um i have some i had some pretty uh uh witch hazel last week but and it's pretty much gone now okay but those are my willows and i'm gonna put those back there and um yeah so the little catkins are starting to come on and that's gonna be great so i just trimmed those this morning it was like it's like 35 out this morning so that's pretty good and um you know and so there i'm gonna have a lot more but i wanted to have something from my own garden for the garden club ladies tomorrow all right so let's let's do that yellow let's talk about yellow because right now i have some yarrow okay regular yellow yarrow i have some uh kangaroo paw yeah yellow kangaroo paw and i have some giant crespedia look at how pretty that crispedia is okay so again what i typically do when i'm working with this is i'm going to cut the bands off of it i'm using my compact pruner from my friends at dram the red ones and my bypass cutter for cutting and then i also have my swiss army knife in case i need that um using the compact pruner i want to cut this wrapper off here sorry makes noise when you're doing this and so this is the time usually that i get a talk to the people that i'm going to do the event with and we just visit i learn more about them and that kind of thing so now look at these things they're going to go with my yellow dogwood that i have so i am going to go ahead and i'm going to cut my yarrow i am going to cut my kangaroo paw and i am going to cut microspeed yeah look at i mean look at how big those are those are huge they're really fabulous my friend andy did a great job of getting me the stuff i needed okay so now we were just talking a second ago about these guys so yarrow which so we have you know uh regular yarrow and we have crispidia yarrow and we have the kangaroo paw what do we know about those they have fuzzy stems and so they are actually gonna make the water dirty because of the sugars that are in the water that are going to help make the flower more healthy but because they have a fuzzy stem they could create bacteria faster so it would be a really brilliant idea for me to drop two or three of my cvbn tablets down in that bucket because what that's going to do is it's going to reduce the bacteria level in there so i really did need it i needed it as glad as here okay and so drop it down inside there and that is going to work great i have protea that i'm using i got some protein the other day that i'm going to be using at the at the event and um i got boxes in like our ones from splendor tortillas that you have seen before on our on our processing and making projects here and all of those buckets i added the cdb and tablet as well because that's going to help those reduce the bacteria level because protea like to make the water icky they have a fuzzy stem and that's what happens you know it's just that's what happens so now let's see let's do our roses okay so these are from rosa prima and this is called country home look at that beautiful okay and so let's see what's going on inside here they have the rosa prima branding all on here and inside here now here's the other part this is super interesting see how these are packaged so they're some up taller some down lower okay and when you look down inside that package you just see those 12 you don't see the other 12 that are down here and that's why they have to come out of that packaging because we want to make sure that these roses get air movement around them and that they're starting to get bigger and we're going to take off i'm going to take off one little layer of leaves as we go underneath here somewhere is my cutter there we go angled cut one and i i try and cut them individually because it's really better for them if we do that if we cut them individually i know it takes a little bit more time but i want to make sure that everybody lasts as long as they possibly can and so we're doing that and so in between these is the cardboard and the tissue paper and the cardboard and the tissue paper is used to absorb moisture on the journey because inside here if there is any heat at all warm temperatures then the flowers start to transpire and are transpiring as they're trying to stay fresh and when they do that they give off moisture and if that moisture gets trapped down inside here then we're gonna have the try to start to form down inside there now you know they have this beautiful little plastic wrapper on the outside which is really nice but then inside they have the cardboard and the cardboard is more absorbent and so that's a really great way to absorb any of that extra moisture that might be there excuse me sorry talking and drinking coffee okay so cut and in the water so now you know this is a single bunch and a single bunch and a half percona like that is plenty if i had a bucket a regular percona regular-sized percona three bunches max some people do four i don't really like two because they get too tight we want to have some air movement around inside there and the other thing i always like is i always like to remember what the name of it is so i rip out the little thing that says country home from rosa prima so i know that okay then all of this goes into the trash now some people say to me oh i keep my roses wrapped because that keeps them close no it doesn't now as soon as your roses hit that water they start to open up they start to progress and when you have that flower food down inside there they start to get bigger and when they do that they transpire and so you know we've all had the experience where we open up a bunch of roses and that 12 down below are all rotten that's because we left the wrapper on take those wrappers off because it helps them get air it helps the air circulate it helps evaporate the moisture on them and then you're gonna have beautiful roses every single time okay promise all right so then let's see okay so now we've got some beautiful carnations and i've got um three different bunches i got the jelly again because that's one of my favorites that angie introduced me to which is the pink and orange i got red because i can't resist a red carnation i love a red carnation my favorite and the other thing i love about these compact pruners from dram is that they're so pointed i can cut poke it right through the cellophane and cut the rubber band that's underneath there because i always like to do that and make sure that that's all done correctly okay and i got a bunch of mini red carnations because i always like to have two different sizes of red foundations in an arrangement and that's kind of pretty okay and so what i'm going to do is i'm going to show you something first because we're going to put these carnations back in this bucket over here so i'm gonna excuse me move these guys along all right so these this is my stock look at that color it's beautiful it's like the peach colored stock kind of a peachy pink i am going to leave my wrapper on the stock and put it back here with my willows and actually i'm going to use that stock with those with those roses see how pretty that's going to be it's going to be lovely together all right and i'm going to use these carnations so [Music] i'm going to grab these carnations now i always look for the broken ones because there's a broken one right here get that out of there okay and again cutting these at an angle trying to cut them in between the junctions on the stem okay so when we're looking at this all right see how we have the little knobs we want to cut in between the little knobs always in between because if we cut over the knob it's harder to draw water through that okay see look at this okay this little guy gets to go on the sink he's going to be in a little base at the sink where i get where i cook and everything every day so i can watch little because when i was a little kid my dad always put his carnation he wore a red carnation all day long take it off his coat cut it put it in a little in a glass of water set it on the sink and then in the morning he'd grab that carnation and put it on his coat again and he'd wear the same carnation all week long because you can because carnations are they like they like that it's all good all right down inside here i have a little surprise look at this oh not intended for consumption these are little blackberries okay see how pretty they are that's gonna be a great little addition and i think they're not positive yet but i think the little blackberries i bought them for my green arrangement but i think they're going to be really pretty with these red carnations so i think that that's what's going to happen with them and i think i am going to just slide this down a little bit and i'm going gonna keep it keep these blackberries inside this sleeve for a little while because it's awfully dry in the house right now okay and i just want to make sure that nothing happens to these okay then i have two hydrangeas uh my wholesaler allows me to pick them up as singles so i am just going to cut them again one time like that they're pretty look at how pretty they are they're gorgeous right they're gonna go in here and then i'm gonna add my red carnations and my jelly carnations inside there so open this up and again just trying to make sure that i cut in between the junctions on these carnations and typically i can go i can look inside look at the end and see if i cut anybody right at the end there's one okay and typically too if you tap it on the table you'll knock out any extra leaves that would fall below the water line carnations i have really good luck with them they typically last about three weeks and i love that they do they do will make the water nasty towards the end so typically i have to water change but that's not bad okay and there we go and we'll put the little mini carnations in there as well there we go and then the jelly pretty color it's pink and orange together [Music] and i have some orange pin cushions and some red mink protea that i think these are going to be just gorgeous with look at that okay so i just pop that down on the table and look at all those leaves that fell out so it's good to tap it down there and make sure you get rid of those because then that would be in the water making the water nasty all right so there we go okay so that goes those jelly go in there perfect okay so then also with the jelly look at those types look at that hypericum it's that pink hypericum that is perfect for easter because it looks like little easter eggs don't you think i think so okay i just like to look in there and make sure that everybody's all the leaves are pretty looking good i always lose my knife so that's what i was looking for pink are gonna go back in our pink bucket and i have some bestie miller the dusty miller has just been incredible um this is from bella flora and it's just be i mean it's it has been just stunning and so everybody cutting everybody in an angle anybody any leaves that need to be torn off or removed i'm going to slip him right down inside here with my blackberries and my incarnations and stuff it's going to be down in this one corner and that'll be okay all right now let's see okay okay great i picked up iris this morning this is how you want your iris tight tight tight tight tight because if it's not tight it's not gonna last okay you don't want them already open so um this came in a bundle of three bunches and i thought it was just wonderful and so now i i did not cut them when i put them in i took them out of a dry bucket they were they were in a dry bucket upright and then i'm cutting them right now okay and that means that tomorrow at this time these are going to be showing color which is going to be like an hour two before i have my presentation with the garden clubs and that's gonna be perfect okay so they're gonna go in this bucket right here and i'm gonna take the wrapper off okay and look this is the most advanced one i have one that's that advanced it's got a little bit of color on it see and tomorrow that's probably going to be almost open it's going to be perfect i'm making an arrangement with the with the iris and ginger the the ginger roots that you get at the grocery store be fabulous i'll teach you more about that in the other um the other video about prepping we'll talk about prepping um i wanted some spray roses and look at these little spray roses they're just beautiful and you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna leave that wrapper on because it has holes on the side and i don't want these to slump down into the water and since there's no cardboard and it's breathable in there i'm just gonna go ahead and slip them in my pink bucket right back here now after after this i'm gonna take this bucket down and set it on the floor or i might set it back here on the table so that i have plenty of air movement because i don't want the flowers to be so crowded and pushed together that there's no air movement in between them sure it looks pretty right now right to have everybody there everybody's all excited right but then i want to make sure that i give them enough room so that they can breathe and they can open up okay um so then i have this and um it is aristima i believe that's the right name aristima and aristima is um a foliage that has i'm going to show you here in just a second but what i'm doing is i'm tearing off these pieces that are going to fall below the water line because all they're going to do is get rotten and make this stinky and nasty sorry but that's the way that it happens and so i want to make sure super fragrant oh my gosh it just smells delish just smells wonderful but look at how pretty that is right this is the time of year when that's just all um where it's all blooming and so pretty and but if i don't take care of all of these little pieces then i'm gonna have a mess you know i normally oh well this is just a foliage we'll just we're just gonna throw it in a bucket and hope for the best yeah that's where we get in trouble okay because we need to make sure that it's gonna last a long time and do really well now these are kind of my little short pieces like that you know what i'm going to put them back here in my bucket with my monstera and my tea leaves aspedister sorry not tilly's okay and again some little tiny short pieces i'm gonna do something with these little short pieces i'm not gonna throw them away but just look at how pretty that is it's just gorgeous it smells kind of fresh like eucalyptus maybe a little bit and then um at the same time it's um the flowers are fragrant too so yeah it's really pretty you know what it's kind of like it's like boronia season it's almost boronia season mother's day is usually boronia season and i love bronia my grandma used to tell me that beronia she thought smelled like a permanent like somebody was getting a permanent um but you know okay i'm going to put some of that back here in my pink bucket because i want to use it in my pink bucket with my other pink flowers and then this stuff this is the little pieces and parts and i have a cute little vase in the bathroom that this is just going to look great on and maybe if you care i'll put it in that vase and then i'll show it to you when we prep the containers okay okay there we go ah i also grabbed a little bit of heather look at it how pretty it is heather is beautiful when it's pretty if it's not pretty it ain't that pretty i mean you know it's there you know sometimes and so when i see heather and it's just fresh just starting to happen then i grab it and again heather has a lot of foliage down at the bottom of the stem so again oh it's just a foliage or it's just a filler flower i hate the term filler flower as a matter of fact too while we're talking about all that i like the term accent flower okay because it accents the other flowers it's not a filler filler is what you put in your lips i guess right i don't know or your face yeah whatever but okay i don't like a filler in my arrangement a filler in my hot dogs is what they used to talk about hot dogs all the time or dog food dog food has a filler in it i don't want that i want filler in there i want it to i want the meat and the yummy and the accent and the flowers and the beautiful stuff so i don't ever call something a filler flower look at that accent flower isn't that pretty gorgeous now you know what because this will have a tendency to get the water nasty too i'm gonna put it in with my yellow flowers because it has the cbb and tablets in it okay so that's what we're gonna go about pretty okay so now i have a huge mess and look at there's a couple of little short pieces of my accent flower heather that will go with those in that other vase that i'm going to put in the bathroom look at a mess on my hands so every once in a while i wipe it off because i don't want all those leaves and little pieces of heather to go in my buckets with my other flowers not good not good would cause a lot of problems so then this all goes into this when i was a little kid we had a service building that's what we called it and it was this building in the back and it was where our coolers were and where all the water was and that was where i would spend you know my mondays or my tuesdays putting up flowers all day and i had a big wooden um table and i could lay everything out and get all the buckets ready and clean all the buckets and everything and that's the other thing i want to tell you about is clean buckets are super important that's a really really important thing because with our buckets we don't want any bacteria inside them and and i know black buckets look great on a set but i don't really like them because they can't tell how dirty they are okay so i am a little bit of a freak about cleaning them all out and making sure that they're nice and clean all the time and i there's a bucket cleaner from chrysler that i just love and it's like you put a cap in a bottle and then you can spray it on and it starts to work and then you can come through and i use a toilet brush and i clean them with a toilet brush and then i rinse them out and then that that bucket cleaner will continue to clean those buckets for up to seven days really pretty amazing okay and um so from that aspect i always like to make sure that they're that they're good and kept clean and exciting okay so here is it is just this time of year and so what i'm going to do is my friend angie put this in the bucket for me and that's just kind of because typically what acacia does the best with and this is acacia and i'm just going to open this up i'm going to wipe off the bag i'm going to wipe off the inside and get those little pieces out notice there's a piece of paper up in here okay and what i do is i take this out and i shake it to get any of the extra little acacia bunches out of there just smells so good but now if i put this in my bucket with my other flowers like this all of this acacia is going to start to turn brown and not be as pretty for as long and so what i want to do is i want to just go inside here i'm going to shake out any of the leaves and the other little when i used to shake this then my grandpa would look at the floor and he would say look it looks like oh look at my piece of paper got very wet okay so some bounty paper towels are gonna save the day okay because i don't want moisture inside this bag i want something to help dry it out and so thanks angie for putting it in the bucket for me but it doesn't need to go in the bucket because you don't need it to get all wet and moist okay now we're gonna go back in with this and if you can when you're picking your uh acacia up at your flower cellar just ask them to keep it in the bag and don't put it in a bucket of water and just take it back like this okay and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to fold it over like that and i'm going to put it in my refrigerator okay i'm going to set it in my refrigerator like that i don't have to worry about this okay but this is going to help it stay nice and actually would be helpful to i'm going to just repurpose my little rubber band here and i'm going to tie it into a knot and let it my rubber band i guess i shouldn't have cut it off i should have just peeled it off hang on time while jay ties the rubber band there we go okay so now i've got that bounty paper towel in there that's going to absorb any moisture and then this is going to be ready to go into the fridge i'll pull it out when i'm ready for it later on okay all right then my bucket down here it has a couple of hypericum [Music] three of them actually three hypericum we're gonna cut the bindings on those [Music] take off the wrappers because i want to eyeball everybody and make sure that all of my uh all the leaves are beautiful they look great okay back in my bucket back in my bucket back in my bucket these are going to be in an all green arrangement where we are going to use the lemons and lime or lemons or the limes and the uh granny smith apples back here i have some artichokes i have some broccoli on the stem that i'm going to use in that bouquet to be very pretty and we've got some green ball dianthus okay just like a carnation i want to make sure that i cut in between the segments of the stems at an angle that one's right on the segment there we go okay in here in my i've got two bunches of beautiful kermit colored pom-poms bright green little guys i'm just gonna pull off a couple of these leaves that might accidentally in the water i want to make sure that they're not going to make sure there's nothing that fell down in here in between two to make sure okay any ones that have a little bit of dead on them gotta go too okay and then i'm gonna cut these at an angle when i was a kid we used to smash chrysanthemums we'd smash the ends with a mallet it doesn't work completely shreds the vascular system and causes the plant to die faster we did not know better okay now today we know better so we cut them make sure that our leaves are trimmed and then they're going to go in here okay then we've got our uh fuji chrysanthemums i don't like to call them spiders because just like accent flowers do you want a spider in your arrangement nope nope nope don't want that okay so you know we're gonna do this i call them a fuji now you want to remove all of the little so we call them madonna gloves okay i'll show you in a second but we want to remove those so that the flower will start to open up that's super important that that flower starts to open up and again we are going to cut them give them a sharp angled cut green fuji mums like that okay and i'm going to put them down here so that they start to open up and get bigger okay so we used to call them madonna gloves because i don't remember what that song was that madonna had the crazy gloves that didn't have fingers in them you know so she put them on her hands so we would call them madonna gloves right but they're each one of these is put on by hand too they're put on by hand by people out in the field when the when the flower gets to a certain point they go out and they put them on and so that's important okay keep track of all your tools when you're bundling up oh so my grandpa whenever he would see all the little acacia blooms on the table he would say look it's chicken baby chickens from the air right so it's like you're looking down and all the little baby chickens are wandering around right because they're little yellow fluff balls so cute all right so i have one more thing to show you about processing and i have a bunch of bro to paradise here okay i have a bunch down there and i'm just going to show you what i do with these okay so the first thing i do and typically it's really good to do this under running water but i'm taking my thumbs down inside here and i'm gonna pop this little guy out just a little bit not a whole lot okay just gonna pop him out and there's actually two or three down inside here so you just kind of pull them back and you can pop out all of them a little bit like that and then you can see that all of them are outside there okay and then we cut this and we put it in a vase you want to see that close up and so i'm going to do that for you so hang on here we go i'm going to move this up close there we go i'm gonna grab one more okay it's always good to do that and the reason i tell you to do this under under running water warm i don't want it to be hot i want it to be warm running water warm but like lukewarm okay and it's just to warm this up if you've let it set out at room temperature for a while too that's great but don't do it right out of the cooler because it's too turgid so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just take this bird of paradise and i'm going to open up these flaps right here okay see i'm doing that exposing that on the inside and then what i'm going to do is i'm just going to reach down inside and gently pop that out okay and just getting that second one out a little bit getting this one out here it's going to go ahead and open up on its own then i'm going to cut it at an angle and put it in the base okay let's do one more together so if you get your burden it looks like this now if you have plenty of time you don't need to do this but if you want to rush along the list if they're shipped like this i'm really glad that i received them like this because if i receive them open they're not going to be good they're going to be beat up and everything so you know this is great so again i'm looking at this i'm going to gently open that up i want to get back here behind this and get my thumbs inside there and gently i'm using my thumbs to push that up okay and look it just starts to pop open on its own i didn't open it i didn't peel it back i'm not push if i push that back it's gonna it's gonna break okay so don't do that okay cut it all right so i have i have more of those to do but now you saw it okay so you see how i did that and again it's about getting inside there getting your thumbs behind it and popping it up popping it up okay awesome so i hope you enjoyed a little bit of processing flowers gosh how long did we do this it was 49 minutes okay but we had fun right and now when i go to make my arrangements i know that all of my flowers are going to be cared for properly um the second video obviously in this series will be the video to prep the containers and then the third video in this series will be showing you the completed arrangements that i made at the garden club show okay so we can give you we can give you the flowers we can give you how to prep the containers and then we can give you what the finished product looked like and so then you know um and and if you have a live event with me sometimes i make the arrangements in front of you and so that's how that all works too so if you're interested in those or i want to talk about those i'm sure that later this year we'll probably get back to live events again and so um obviously i have a website jswonkey.com that tells about all of that information too so if you're interested in that please contact me there or if you have a garden club um you can also contact me at jubloom.com and we can talk about that and show you how that works okay so i hope you had a great time processing flowers hope you learned some more stuff obviously we learned about bird of paradise and our roses today were really important and working with those too and i hope it was just a good refresher course from the other one that we had too so i hope you had a great time and until next time keep having fun with flowers", "p7k7LZlRhp8": "and be seen d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w X Y Zed 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22

right it's in this video I'm going to show you a really easy way to to route plants and start new plants from softwood cuttings or semi softwood cuttings now on my website free plants com I've got a page on the homemade plant propagation system that shows you of building a flat and putting screen in there and using a fish tank and painting some white stripes on that and so on and and that works really good but today I'm going to show you something that's easier and quicker and just much more simpler to do first of all you're going to start out taking some cuttings now when you when you take a cutting this is a big burning bush behind me you're going to take that cutting anywhere your cuttings can be anywhere from two to five or six inches long you're gonna make your cutting out step up here we're going to this is what the cutting looks like and now I'm going to strip all those leaves off and really you can even do that you don't need but a few leaves at the very top depending on the cutting maybe that you could this cutting could be like that or this cutting could actually be that short right there so the the length of the cutting really isn't critical it doesn't make that much difference what's important is that you take the cutting the right time of the year the early spring is not a good time because this new you want to work with new growth now this new growth came out this spring it started growing around mid-april and then by early June this the wood is soft or hard enough that when you stick the cutting it will actually stand up and not weep right over so that's what you got to be careful of so you don't take your cuttings too soon now if you go into the winter months later into the fall in the winter this would just continues to get harder the harder the wood the more difficult it is to root the cutting so the ideal time in most areas is June July August so again and it's it's really easy to just take you know dozens of cuttings in just seconds on a plant like this you can see that in that short period of time I took all these cuttings very very simple to do now I'm going to show you exactly what to do with the cuttings all right now in order to I showed you how we we took the cuttings out the burning bush you can do this with all kinds of different flowering shrubs you can do with evergreens so it's it's really a lot of fun to just experiment and try a lot of different things now to make this simple I went to Walmart and I picked up this is the plastic dish pan it's about two dollars as you can see I drilled a bunch of holes in the bottom of it that's really important you've got to have good drainage I also found this at Walmart and this is like a food storage container and it's already got holes in the side and that left a little bit of a rig a reservoir here so I actually drilled four holes in the bottom in the corners so that any water that were to get in this area around the bottom can still get out now this is a you know an aluminum baking tin this one does have a wire support I don't know how well this would hold up when you fill this thing with sand but it doesn't matter if it crinkles up a little bit it's just gonna be harder for you handle it so I'm not gonna use that one today I'm gonna use this one either one of these are work I've got a lot of my customers members of our backyard Growers group they buy these things at the dollar store and a film they got dozens and dozens of them that they're using it all at the same time so basically this is a pretty simple process I'm going to this is a bag of play box and you can pick this up at just about any big box store or hardware store and I'm going to fill this tub you want a sand it's a little bit coarse and this has this has there's there's pebbles in there and they're very easy to see so you got different grades of sand I mean from tiny particles to some small stones and that's ideal because when you water this you want the water to run right right in this stuff and out the other end so basically now I know people worry about the holes in the side once it's sanding it's wet and it packs in it's not going to come out those holes at least not very much of it well now if the sand we're bone-dry it would filter out of there just like sand does in an hourglass but when you're rolling cuttings you never want that sand dry so just put it in there like that it's good to go what I do is just take a broad knife like this and just make a slice in the sand so that it's easy to stick your cuttings in there because some cuttings like some tiny spy-ray or potentail are very very flexible hard to get in now I showed you earlier that's all I do is strip the leaves off of that cutting and then I take all my cuttings I strip a bunch at one time and I take all the cuttings and I line up the butt ends so they're just about even doesn't have to be perfect and then we use a rooting compound rooting compounds help they're not they're not a magic potion that instantly give you roots so if you don't have any rooting compound it's going to mean the difference between you making some cuttings today and not don't worry about it a lot of things will wrote without it but they're rooting compound helps and increases your chances of success there are liquid rooting compounds that you mix with water there are liquids that are ready to use you just dip your cuttings in them there are powders that you wet the cutting and you roll them in the powder there are gels like a plant cloning gel or you know and it's it's kind of a stick they all work one is not better than the other so we don't get all caught up in that whatever you get easier that's going to work any kind of a plant rooting compound you don't want it's got to be a rooting compound you don't want something that's full of fertilizer you're not trying to make the plants just trying to make them rut so other words you got them all pushed together in a bundle you're going to mix your routing compound in a container like there's a plastic cup of any kind and then you're going to be about a five or six second dip it's not that critical just make sure it's at least five or six seconds if you're in there ten or twenty seconds it's not going to hurt anything and then just take the cuttings and stick them in the container like this I put mine in about an inch apart know the roots once they get rooted they they don't really get tangled up because when you take them out of here the sand is going to be loosened a little bit drier and it's going to drop right off that's Cir one two three four or five six seven eight there's nine right there so you could easily put 50 or 60 cuttings in this little tiny container once they're in there I'm going to take something as simple as a pencil to use as a prop because we're going to make a ten and I'll put these in the corners and all this is going to do is just keep the keep the plastic up off of the the cutting a little bit if it touches the cutting it's not going to hurt anything now well now that I got those in there I'm gonna water those in real good because I want that all that sand washed around the roots I don't want air pockets around the stems of those cuttings so I'm gonna take the hose and I'm going to just really drench this so that all the sand washes down in and then I'm gonna slide the whole thing in a white trash bag don't use clear because clear is gonna heat up too much so you're gonna slide the whole thing whoops inside of the white trash bag which is easier said than done once I had the whole thing in there ashin will pick it up to do this and I can reach in there and adjust those pencils that I stuck in to make sure that I haven't knocked them over basically that's it I'm going to take this into the bag now I'm also going to spray some more water in there because I want plenty of humidity so then I'm going to take the hose and I'm gonna spray some water in here so there's plenty of water in a bag and then I'm going to take these ties pull them up tight and then I'm going to tie that bag shut I'm going to take this whole container bag it all and I'm gonna put it in a shady area because I don't want the Sun beating on this and that's it and I believe all now when you come back tomorrow you're going to see some humidity inside of the bags of moisture condensation that's good now yeah there are things that can go wrong you can get it it's not gonna hurt to come back after every week or so and open this off and just let some air in there for a few hours and then close it back up always make sure that when you close it back up there's plenty of moisture in there if there's not just go ahead and wet all again real good you can open that all the way up but basically this is very very simple and a lot of plants are gonna root like this this is something that you can start doing in June July August September you could even do some in October but it's going to be a slow process but you can do them in October or November or December and just stick them outside the woods don't worry about them they may not run in the fall but there's a good chance that they're gonna root in the spring so again you know once once fall gets here you're not dealing with a softwood cutting like I was here today the cuttings are going to get harder and hardwood takes a lot longer to wood but it will still run so this can you can do this with purple santuary and flowering dogwood shrubs like red twig or yellow twig dogwood Rose of Sharon and I got a whole list of stuff on my website it tells you how to do it if you just go to the website in search and look for that homemade plant propagation system there's all kinds of links on there to tell you how to do softwood cuttings hardwood cuttings soft woods of evergreens and you know there's a ton of information but this is a very simple system anybody can do it at home you don't need anything special this tub was about $2 a SAN was two or three dollars 47 cents for a package of pencils and if you have cuttings those are free so again it's a very easy way it's an improvised way of doing the homemade plant propagation system where you got to paint fish tank and do all that this is a shortcut but it works very very well give it a try I think you have a lot of fun with it", "liVe51r6fCc": "[Music] so at the hi welcome to the second episode of the thirsty edition on hot Thai Kitchen last time I showed you how to make that milky sweet Thai iced tea this time I'm gonna show you something lighter and more refreshing that I actually prefer on a hot day we're making Tam now or Thai iced lime tea now here's your Thai lesson tat means T and ma now just means lime now when you say Tama now in Thailand it's going to assumed to be cold so if you want it hot which you could it's not very it's not done very often you'd have to specify Charminar on and Ron means hot okay so let's take a look at what we've got so the same setup I've got this cloth coffee filter here you can use paper coffee filter if you'd like anything that's very very fine mesh strainer is going to be too wide and you get a lot of tea dust at the bottom so to this I'm doing two tablespoons of Thai tea leaves per cup this is a little less than Thai iced tea iced tea a mate three tablespoons and that's because there's no milk or anything in it so you don't need as much tea for the flavour to really come through okay and then for those of you who are interested this is what I use you can use any brand of Thai iced tea you can find I've yet to find a brand that doesn't work or works better than other brands and then to this a cup of hot off the boil water just pour that in and then this needs about three minutes to steep you can leave it longer okay and meanwhile we're going to get our glass full of ice now I've got this big glass here and you want to pack it pack full of ice because you want to have enough ice that by the time you pour it and you still have some ice left so what I'll do is actually take this lime this is about a third of a lime and I'm gonna squeeze it into my cup the reason why I'm squeezing it to this cup and not into the hot tea is because lime tastes freshest when it hasn't been exposed to heat when heat exposure has been minimized so if I squeeze it into the ice it'll taste better okay get everything out and then I'm going to add about four teaspoons of sugar into my mixing glass here and of course this is up to you how sweet you like it so we're just gonna pour in our team and what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna add in an ice cube after that after the sugar is dissolved so that it's not so hot when it gets poured over the over the glass I didn't do this for the Thai iced tea because we added condensed milk which helps cool down the temperature quite a bit but now we're not to minimize ice lost when we go to to mix it and now you want to taste for sweetness I know there's no lime in it here we're just tasting for sweetness you can add more sugar but once it gets into here it'll be less sweet so this should taste a little too sweet and you don't want to add it to the here and then add sugar because when it's cold if the sugar won't dissolve so you want to do all your adjustment here well you can [Music] hmm hmm could even use a little extra lime but that's all I got for you today this promise you it's gonna be one of your favorite and for this recipe you can visit haughty kitchen calm and I will see you next time for another drink", "_EURpxz7ZrU": "[Music] hey everyone joey here from respectmyregion.com back with another west coast we tour 2020 review so got another beverage today's item arnie's iced tea and lemonade this product comes highly recommended i've been to multiple dispensaries from san luis obispo port winimi all the way to socal true socal south los angeles down to long beach i've seen this all over the place this item is one of the most popular items in california cannabis infused beverage eight fluid ounces you guys can see the super attractive bottle here i'll give it a nice slow spin look at it beautiful totally stands out it's that hippie kind of drink uncle uncle arnie's uh we're gonna do one drink we're gonna talk about it second drink score out of ten might do a third drink probably gonna do a third drink you guys to read the full review on respectmyregion.com make sure you guys check out the youtube as well so on the bottle first things first instructions uncle arnie's iced tea lemonade is a potent drink friends if this is your first time consuming consider drinking a half serving and wait one to two hours for full effect less than two milligrams cbd 10 milligrams thc per serving less than two milligram cbd 100 milligrams thc per bottle 10 servings per bottle it is marked along the bottle here there is lines for you to identify serving sizes so that's cool but when you think about this much liquid and jam packing 100 milligrams thc into this i'm almost certain we're going to taste some cannabis in this so i'm excited uh it does say manufactured by space station flyspacestation.com ingredients here we go ingredients i always like this first ingredient listed high fructose corn syrup water black tea extract citric acid gum arabic caramel color ascorbic acid aka vitamin c ester gum brominated soybean oil i don't know if i said that right sodium benzoate benzoate and potassium sorbet preservatives and sodium metabolite f d and c yellow number five calcium disodium edta and bhca are up bha those are preservatives and then it also says cannabis oil and natural flavor so it says infused by vertosa as well so um that's everything on the bottle you guys we're gonna dive right in i'm gonna do one taste here out of the container and we're gonna do one taste out of the glass so i can show you what the actual color of it looks like unfortunately again per usual well no here it is there's a little edge let me get this finally see what i'm talking about not too bad to open still use my teeth just because i'm dumb all right all right so get some of this off push it down child proof lid oh yeah i can smell the weed straight off top so when you when you look at this and you smell it it smells like minute made lemonade mixed with a like uh uh what is it the raspberry brisked iced tea that's like literally an old country buffet i don't know why i'm getting that entire experience i'm even getting a little bit of the fried chicken no i'm just kidding no i'm seriously though this smells like mini-made lemonade mixed with brisk raspberry iced tea i'm sure it's just a basic um or not a basic but a custom made iced tea i don't know what they're using for the lemonade maybe they are using me made it smells delicious but here we go first drink talk about it oh yeah oh yeah so you definitely get a lemony lemonade-ness and you 100 get this iced tea flavored but the back end the aftertaste as soon as you swallow it cannabis cannabis cannabis this is not a joke i can definitely feel this is potent i can taste it i'm going to give it a close here and i want to shake it up slightly before i pour it out i just don't want any of the maybe it might sediment on the bottom i don't know i'm not sure as to their infusion mess method on this uh it does say need more fizz try matt's high soda oh yeah that's right this is a uncle arnie's and matt's high soda collaboration i believe could be wrong don't know let's pour it out here a little bit of the color so you guys can kind of see i don't want to pour out too much because it's 100 milligram this is like 20 milligrams right there but it's this murky light colored brown um you know definitely looks like iced tea has been mixed in with lemon i think that's pretty accurate looking but to me you smell this i can smell the cannabis i you smell lemonade lemon in it i can smell the iced tea when you taste it it's really just a big aftertaste of weed and citrus i think it's enjoyable for a hunt this is not a 10 milligram beverage so i can't sit here and score it and and compare it the same as how those operate so for high potency 100 milligram beverage i think i think the cannabis for me is a positive i lose out on the lent on the on the tea flavor i wish there was more of a tea flavor for me like a a black tea or a raspberry blackjack i wish there was more of a tennis of an herbalness of an earthiness but there's such high cannabis flavor to me that's an extra positive it's like an 11 out of 10 for me i think score wise overall for this product the presentation the appeal the texture it's not thick and syrupy i didn't expect it to be syrupy it's not um no it tastes just like a beverage just like oh oh you shook it up even more weed even more citrus on this one and i get more of that tea on that one i don't know this one's really tough um i would like to see a recipe guide on this there's enough real estate here on the space to put a little bit of instructions for a potential mixing it into something um gosh this is a tough one i'm gonna give this though i'm gonna give this a nine point um [Music] oh i didn't even see this didn't even see this manufactured on june 30 nope july 31st 2020 best buy july 30 2021 it's fresh the first one of the first fresh beverages we've gotten uh you know just because of that um i'm gonna bump i'm gonna bump it i was i was kind of thinking 9.3 9.25 i'm going to give it the 9.5 because for 100 milligram beverage i want to taste the wheat it's small so it's like one of the issues that i've run into with 100 milligram beverages before is too much liquid you can't taste the weed your brain thinks it's not going to work or you're not gonna get as high this one you really get the affirmation the cannabis the lemonade the tea i think they're all there i wish the tea was shining a little bit more i wish there was more info on the packaging in regards to making your own lemonade drink or lemonade popsicles something like that but for the most part this is a very good experience 9.5 out of 10 my

Charles Malky biologist and play an expert with ivory organics where we grow cool plants and in this segment we're gonna talk about passion fruit all about passion fruit and the importance of having passion fruit in your garden and for the many people that come to my garden I started off with this view they think that we're in Hawaii we've got so many tropical fruits growing here in Los Angeles California believe it or not and check out the success of the plants that we've got just from your view alone with the Apple or the Manzano variety of bananas it's like right over my head and they're behind it an even taller banana variety which is known as the ice cream banana or the Java banana which we're hoping to harvest within the next about 60 days now from as long as the night time low temperatures stay above 55 degrees so we're hoping that this you know season stays a lot warmer for the next 60 days maybe even 90 but on average takes 90 days from the time of balloons and it's just started blooming at the beginning of August whereas last year it bloomed in September and as a result it didn't have enough ripening time and we had to wait up to nine months to enjoy ripe fruit off of this plant so I'm hoping to share those great results with you but again being that this is all about passion fruit let's zoom in and get a little closer to the passion fruit that are right behind these bananas check this out so here I am now at the base of our passion fruit vine and you can see that there's a couple of fruit here about a Michele a lot more with you that's going throughout there's probably several hundred of passion fruits that if you were to go to the store range in price between $3 to $6 per piece so this is a wonderful investment to have in the garden and again there's nothing better than growing it at home and enjoying it ripe off the vine and gaining the maximum amount of nutrition and health to you and your family so what I wanted to share with you if you come into the base of this tree I've had this plant as a cutting which came from Florida about five or six years ago you can see the thickness of it like my hand easily goes around the base of it it's probably an inch maybe in diameter and and again you can see a lot more fruit that's hanging near the base there's probably five or six seven more fruit right here on to my left I'm hoping you can capture that as well you can see how successful and productive and prolific this is this here is known as the Purple Passion I'm going to show you the flowers which is the way to identify the plant in addition to obviously the fruit which we're gonna harvest some right for it as well later on what I wanted to point out is this plant is an extremely vigorous plant most passion fruit vines are it can grow as much as anywhere from 40 to 80 feet in one single growing season with it being pretty much dormant and we're not talking about leaves falling off depending on your climate this remains green year-round but the growth will pretty much stop from November through February March for this so for those three to four months don't expect any growth and do not prune your plants as I've learned my lesson once pruning the vine at the beginning of the dormant season and it just didn't have the sugars to support itself and I've lost a lot of vines in the past by pruning it to prematurely if you're gonna prune your binding to control it which I also recommend we're going to discuss that briefly in this video but if your pruning and make sure that you do prune it closer to the warmer months of March April or May even if it's blooming just keep in mind that during that growing season it's going to push out another 40 sixty plus feet of growth so no harm in pruning it at the right time but a major disaster - almost three other vines we had in the garden that we lost due to pruning and early winter let's check out some more fruit on this vine first again this is the start of the passion fruit vine we're right underneath the ice cream variety of banana and let's follow this vine all the way back and next I'm going to share with you the trellis that we've created as well so we've got the ice cream banana plant over here the three-in-one apple variety and then behind it the five and one fig tree and I've already cleaned out most of the vines that we're trying to make its way on to the fig tree but all you're gonna need are your paper scissors like this and I'm hoping you can capture this but you can see like there's some vines that are working their way into the apple tree you're always gonna want to go back to where the fine is and just prune it back like so but all of these will now create some excellent additional plants keep in mind that your passion fruit vine will only live an average of seven years sometimes I could be three or four years and other times some people are lucky successfully grown them ten years at a time but with these cuttings we're now going to be able to rejuvenate the plant and give it an extra seven years by taking this cutting and turning it into a new plant we're gonna discuss how in this video as well before we go any further you can see how long the stretch it's it goes again about sixty feet and now take a look going up into the Podocarpus and go all the way up about thirty forty feet above my head you can see all of those fruit up there - can you see that I'm hoping you can capture that camera person says no so I'm gonna take you up behind the wall let's go back so here we are now at the top of the lattice and I'm just walking up and now we're going up the portal carpets they've worked their way into this hedge which is now the neighbors tree and check out all of these low-hanging fruit and we've left it because we're literally just days if not just a few weeks away from harvesting these and then I'll pull the vines back out of this proto carcass tree but we won't allow it to continue growing into the proto carpus hedge as it could be damaging as it'll block out the necessary lights for this hedge to thrive check it all of those fruit for those of you doing the mouth it's a great value so we're still here at the very top of the trellis and there's several fruits that are here and this one still attached starting to get some color check that I can see some of the purple hues that are coming out let's see if this let me see some more fruit over here more fruit over here another food over here but the flaw in the system which we're going to improve upon with another structure we're starting is that this trellis has these diamond-shaped which we're gonna see from down below and I'm just gonna take this you see that diamond shape right there I've got my fingers going through it if I take that purple there's one over here even though it's not ripe I'm still gonna pick it just for demonstration purposes and this will not go to waste the fact that it's got some color means it's got some sweetness and I enjoy a little bit of a sour of passion fruit but if we push that through you can see that it's like stuck there it's not naturally gonna fall on the ground and many of these end up stuck and again without pruning these back it's easier for them to get lodged between the vines as well which makes it even more narrow and less likely to find its way down to the ground which when it's ripe will fall off I'm pushing that through and then I'll harvest it in the morning when I come and visit the garden they can see with all that area there's a lot of chance for me to pick up dozens of these every single day summer through fall so here's the fruit that came down to the ground that we forced through the lattice when we built this structure we started off with a pair of pressure treated wood and we created the cement posts under the ground and we space them about 10 feet apart throughout so we've got two four six eight four sections supporting this trellis that's above my head over here and you can see this diamond shape structure which again we forced the fruit through but this large passion fruit is not making its way through and being that I didn't have a chance this last season to prune the vine there's vines on top of vines which are making it increasingly difficult for these fruit to work its way down to the ground which is becoming kind of a nuisance that I'm going to go behind the wall over the lattice and search and comb through this plant at least once a week to harvest hopefully some ripe fruit this one here is not quite there but I want to share with you a better structure on accomplishing and harvesting your passion fruit vines better than this system which I've now learned through trial and error and want to pass off my results and my success is to and for you let's get on to let me share a couple other points with you before we get started let's zoom in one more time at it on the passion fruit flower and again this is the Frederick's purple passion variety take a look at the pattern and the beauty and the uniqueness of this flower and now take a look at all of these fruit that are lying under here and these are more purple in color and again my favorite way to harvest these is when they fall but unfortunately we're dealing with a few pests here in the garden that are getting to the fruit before me I'll share with you how I've discovered this only this morning is none of them have landed on the ground yet this season and here we are now in August and I know it should have been enjoying these for the last few months but I found some proof that somebody else is getting to these I'm gonna harvest these as a light purple and I can get the dark purple within a matter of days on my kitchen table but let me share with you how beautiful these look even right now so you get started now all you need is your fruit a knife and a spoon and as you can see here if you zoom in on the plate you can see that there's and again this here is the flower there created this magnificent fruit and I'm gonna tell you a lot more about the nutritional value and the health benefits of these fruit as well but if you come around you can see this here is the green one that are harvested I'm gonna allow this to wait maybe another day or two let's try to cut through the one of the most ripe ones and some people wait until these skins get completely wrinkled before cutting into them but again I like them a little bit tart you can see the seeds here and you can juice it as well my children like it when I turn it into a juice like this and I'll sometimes just have the juice without the seeds but the seeds are very soft and enjoyable to eat it's delicious second you got like two to four bites out of that half I will just continue such a delicious treat I wish I could finish them all we've got to continue with the video let me share a couple other points follow me [Music] so behind me is the mother passion fruit vine the one that I brought as a simple cutting from Florida about five or six years ago and from that we've created all of these other little baby cuttings as you can see that we put into these cups which I'm going to teach you briefly on how we created these but they've been sitting in here for about a year now sadly enough I couldn't find a home for them and so they continued you know resting in this tray and we're gonna create a few more plants now today and I'm going to teach you how and I'm gonna have even more leftovers but I'm gonna make an effort to find a home for these but some of these did find their way into the ground and as a result turned into some more beautiful vines and so now and I told you by creating cuttings we can now rejuvenate the plant and create another average seven years of additional life for these passion fruits to continue providing additional food and nutrition to the family which I'm going to talk about nutritional value towards the end to take a look at how beautiful and successful this little baby passionfruit cutting can look like in as little as four to six months we've installed it in the ground like I said in the early spring and now we've got if you take a look here at my hand we've got our first passion fruit already in the first year we're gonna work our way up this is another giant one back here I don't know if the camera I can capture that and there's another smaller one right there look how small and cute that looks right there it's a third that I've seen and then over here there's some flowers that were existing they only bloom for one day so these bloomed a couple days ago and there's another new flower that just bloom this morning hoping you can capture that but the vine is now working its way up and onto my roof we're gonna correct that issue today and we're now at the beginning of what was once my vertical tomato garden and as you can see we've got our fourth day avocado tree that's growing over the edge over there and we just prune that and we did an educational video on that I'll put the video links to that below but you can see a whole bunch of new growth since we've done our summer pruning we've got next to that our Bears lime tree we've got an oral Blanco the citrus variety also behind on you know on the on the other side of this vertical garden they take a look at all of these cherry tomatoes that we have in here that are mixed in here's some more cherry tomatoes and some more clusters but we're here again at the middle of August several of the plants have already exhausted their fruit loads a lot of the flowers if I can find some such as just saw one a little too high but I'm gonna take you up there if you can follow me you can see over here are some flowers but none of the flowers are turning into fruit it's just too hot and a lot of you across the country that are growing tomatoes right now may be experiencing a loss of fruit here is again another cluster of flowers but they're not supporting fruit anymore the season's over we're just harvesting what was accomplished in spring and early summer with the highest summer heat most of these flowers cannot turn into fruit but what we're going to do now is we're going to turn this vertical tomato garden into now a passion fruit canopy now you've strategically planted some passion fruit along this stretch if you want to come in a little closer so over here I installed two passion fruit vines near the base so if you take a look over here you can see at the beginning there's vine number one and find number two and I've done the same back over here just a couple of weeks ago I've installed a couple more so about three weeks ago I took one of these pale barely surviving passion for you gut cuttings from last year install them in the ground I did a couple more over here on this end of the trellis that you can see there's some new growth that's pushing through over here we've got about an inch or two of growth they keep in mind and one growing season as we said earlier you can grow anywhere from forty to sixty and possibly eighty feet in just one year so this year can accomplish the entire canopy that we're hoping to accomplish and I'm gonna do it in a way where the fruit will be able to hang they'll be low-hanging for picking and when they fall the fall to the ground safely in a way that they won't be trapped up in the trellis above I'm gonna show you a better system and a better method on how right now let's get started the first I'm gonna do is I'm gonna harvest some more of these cherry tomatoes behind it I've got some early girl variety Tomatoes I'm gonna clean this up so that we can start working on trellising the passion fruit vines so let me clean this up real quick and start harvesting these fruit and we'll get back and continue with creating the overhead trellis so here we are now we've just cleared out a lot of the cherry vines that were interfering with the area that we're going to now improve the passion fruit structure and then these are the tomatoes that we've harvest and even though there's nothing better than a ripe tomato off the vine the green ones will also be used within between today in the next few days in any of our home cooking as well particularly sauces mixing the green and the reds together to make a sauce works out which is perfectly well if you take a look now back up into the structure you'll see that we've now cleared out we've still kept a lot of the the cherry tomato vines that are not interfering with what's now going to become our passion fruit bond I've just discovered here yet another flower so we're gonna have you even more fruit off of this brand new vine that we've installed just less than three months ago so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna support the vine on this steak I'm going to share with you the steaks that we've used and if you follow you'll see that there's another steak over my head over here that I'm holding on to and all of these steaks are in fact steel pulls they're hollow steel poles that are covered in vinyl plastic let me share with you a couple of these that I picked up just yesterday to continue building the structure but I've been using these and the green supporting steaks have been used for the last at least five or six years and then in between I'll sometimes use bamboo but for the structure I'm creating today we're gonna use these larger poles I'm trying to see what they measure it says 8 feet 8 feet long and then I've got these smaller skinnier ones that'll be used to create the roof we're gonna do some diagonals across it as well and these measure 6 feet if you want to take a look here they're made by on Figueroa sturdy steaks and I picked them up at Home Depot I've noticed that not all garden centers carry it but I was successful in finding these home depot and haven't really seen them anywhere else so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna continue building the structure by taking now one of the eight foot poles and now we're going to extend it across the roof and what we're gonna use is we're going to use this in addition to these zip ties and they come in packages of here a hundred and the way they work is you simply create a loop like that and once you pull it through once it goes through you can't go back the other way and I'm gonna use these zip ties to basically bring this stake into contact with another stake that's up above and to bring them together to hold them in place securely so let's get started with that so what we're gonna do here is we're gonna take this eight foot pull and we've got again the pull that's in the ground over here I don't know if you can see you here underneath these leaves so this goes in the ground by about a foot or two it then comes up the thing goes across this way and then it's secured against another vertical pole that's in the ground as well about a couple of feet and then we zip tied it over here in this corner with a couple of zip ties securing the pole that's going horizontally in addition to this one which we've also zip tied into the gutter so this is secured to the roof and that's what's holding this pole vertically again in place what we're gonna now do is just do the same thing now with this pole we're now gonna start building the roof like so we're gonna take the same foot pull we're gonna stretch it along and the goal is we're gonna try to get this vine that's now growing up on the roof to go across this hole which will stay about six to twelve inches away from the house and we're gonna keep this gap and that's going to monitor to make sure that the vine is only overhead and not growing on top of our roof and here we go the reason for not allowing the vine to grow on your roof is you want to prevent rot to the to your home structure you don't want to damage it and also for harvesting purposes it's going to be stuck up on your roof as well in between the the vines and the branches so we've just now put on a zip tie over here we're careful not to you zip tie around any of the branches I'm not going to take my scissors and cut the extra zip tie length off like so and now we're going to continue to the other end you want to follow me over here we're gonna secure this up here like so hope you can come a little closer so you can see this check this out make sure you keep about the same distance away from the roof and and that's now secure in place go with my scissors I'm gonna cut off the excess and now we're gonna do if you back up a couple more steps is we're gonna correct the vine what we're gonna do here to get the vine off the roof and now back on to this and to training in the right direction we're just gonna take some strength I like using this nylon twine it's gonna cut it like so and you're just gonna tie a knot about a foot even a foot and a half away from where it splits and we're just gonna secure it knot like so just do it a few square knots and then you actually make sure it's secure so I'm doubling it up make sure this knot stays and now you'll notice that I put the knot against the against the pole you never tie the knot against the vine so it doesn't constrict as the vine continues to expand and now we're gonna carefully pull the line off the Rif and redirect it I'm being careful with its temp tendrils to make sure I loosen them enough damage to the vine and now we've got the vine growing this way and now we'll continue to secure it in place I'm also going to make sure that there's a little bit of a gap at least the half an inch to an inch gap and again I'm not constricting the vine and allowing it to continue to grow and constrict its growth there we go you can see there's a little bit of space where I can fit two three fingers underneath there so it's got enough space and I'll be monitoring to make sure it doesn't get constricted just gonna go with my scissors cut off the excess string and it's starting to look a lot more beautiful and again we're just gonna lead it this way we'll put up another time in just a moment up here to make sure that this stays in place and it'll continue growing in that direction and it's very likely that before December it'll span the entire length of this wall so we've got that accomplished and now we're gonna do the same thing to this vine as well we're gonna secure it in place like so so we're gonna get another piece of point and you can see in this situation I can fit at least two fingers between this the knot I just created and the vine so again my fingers fit allowing plenty of room for this vine to continue to grow and expand and now we're gonna do to continue to create the roof as we're not gonna go with our smaller poles which are right here behind you and the goal now is we're gonna continue with the zip ties and create now an X structure like so one will go there and the other up here and I'm just gonna finish those off on my own time I'm gonna secure these vines up in place to make the roof but the beauty of this system is gonna be when the fruit start hanging overhead and another important point is I'm capitalizing on this beautiful solar panel so to say as these leaves are gonna capitalize on Sun whereas these trees continue to grow to the left side they're gonna be blocking and preventing me from enjoying this beautiful vegetable garden that we've had here for many years as these trees continue to grow they're gonna shade out but these plants will continue to create what I'm calling a solar panel to capitalize on the Sun and maximizing the amount of fruit yields that we're gonna gain in this narrow strip of our garden so this here is a lesson for those of you creating structures and arbors and whatever else and lattices specifically for passion fruit if you want those fruit to come through create more of an open structure to allow those fruit to hang and not get trapped as we did in that diamond lattice that we've used earlier in years past so this lesson would be incomplete without talking about propagation we did a video as we discussed at the beginning about propagating and making more passion fruits about a year ago but let's say we're gonna start all over again right now and how we're going to turn this into more plants and there's two different parts on this vine that you can use to create your future cuttings one of my favorites is to use the tips if you come in a little closer here this here is the tip of the plant we can cut it down and the goal is to get down to about where the node is which is right here where the leaf is coming out and the tendrils were coming out before me cutting it here's the tendril again so we can just cut off the tendril and we'll basically come down to the note we're gonna cut it at a angle the angle is there to maximize water absorption they've cut that tendril off a little bit better well usually then go with our scissors and score the end of it like so and that here will also increase absorption we're gonna take off the leaf since this is going to be below ground and we can even take off the next leaf as well again because this is gonna be a below ground and then we're going to take our cup and for the cup we're just using a plastic cup I like cutting some holes near the bottom so that when we put it into our watering tray it can absorb most of its water through the base and then taking a mixture of perlite and vermiculite and these are ideal for both absorption and at the same time preventing raw a lot of other soil mixtures will hold on to too much water and create rot what we're gonna do is we're just gonna take that mixture of vermiculite perlite and then we're going to dip that exposed end that we just created with a rooting powder the rooting powder aside from being a hormone to encourage root growth will also and what's also very important is that it also has preservatives to minimize root rot not root rot but also stem rot so the fact that it's preventing rotting is a very important element in creating a rooting hormone and we'll just simply now put that in there and water all of the excess water will go down to the watering tray and and it will continue to absorb water from the lower part what I also like doing is but also I like doing is taking these leaves if you'd notice that all the couple of leaves that are above ground is to cut them in half like so and this year will also minimize the amount of transpiration or the water loss will do the same thing to the second leaf and then these smaller leaves can be left alone this one here we can also cut in half so again the goal is to minimize transpiration we're also going to do is we're going to use this product over here the ivory organics three on one plant guard protection against damaging sunburn insects and rodents and yes we want to protect it from insects and rodents but the predominant benefit here is going to be minimizing sunburn we want to minimize the Sun stress to the plant so what we're gonna do is we're just gonna simply spray on the plant like so and if you come in a little closer you can take a look at the leaves and you'll see that it's got now a nice light white organic protection to help keep the plant several degrees cooler while it's getting its roots established and off to a good start the other part of the plant and the vine that we can use for making roots will be the thicker larger area and you may have varying success with one or the other make sure if there's any flowers on they remove those and so we're gonna remove all of those flower parts and then we're gonna identify which one is going to be the top and the bottom so it's growing in this direction so we're gonna prune the top like so we're gonna come back down to the closest node and we're gonna cut that at an angle like so we're gonna remove the leaf we're going to score the base and then we're gonna cut the leaf as we did with the other vine in half and we're gonna cut this guy here in half and then dip it in the rooting powder like so and we can also insert that in there like that and we'll go again with the organics and spray those leaves to minimize transpiration ideally you should be one per container but for the purpose of simplicity we're doing it this way and I'm going to include that entire video at the end of this video as well as in the comments below where you can watch this in a lot more a greater depth where we talk about creating cuttings off of passion fruits as well as figs now let's talk about the nutritional value of passion fruits and why you should include that into your garden so this branch over here is pointing down and even though I could correct it I've got so many branches I've so far corrected on to this now x-shape structure which is again made out of metal which will easily support all the way of these vines for at least the next couple of years even if I don't prune it when it comes to the annual pruning like I discussed earlier I usually cut it as far back as 80% come March April or May within those months closer to March here in Los Angeles if you're in a colder zone maybe it'll be April or May but come March I usually prune it back as close as I can to the parent plant I'll leave a little bit of the roof structure and then I'll allow the vine to run the forty to eighty feet over the course of the year what we're gonna do here and what you're gonna have to do periodically throughout the month if you see any binds that are growing in the wrong direction such as this one over here being that it's pointing downwards we're gonna prune that out by pruning as close as I can to the base of the leaf we're gonna do one other example that's a little closer to the cameraperson if you come in a little closer here you'll notice that here's another kind of a sucker that's coming off the side of the plant let's trace it back and you can see that it comes right over here to the vine hopefully can see where my finger is and what we're gonna do is we're going to go with our scissors and we're going to prune right about the leaf so that the leaf will still be there to create the solar energy for the plant and then we've just removed another sucker vine as well so I'm starting off here below a trellis that I've created for my Thompson green seedless grape variety that we've got here in the garden unlike a grape vine that's gonna be going dormant within the next couple of months our passion fruit vine will still remain green here in Los Angeles California so we're gonna get to enjoy this beautiful green plant year after year and also enjoy these fruits that are extremely delicious and nutritious my favorite reason as it just said in regards to having the plant aside from it being an evergreen is it's a very delicious fruit and it's juice is actually used for flavoring a lot of fruit punches so it's got really the flavor of fruit punch and again being natural it's even better than fruit punch as for punch but you know serve and most places are you know chemically derived the passionfruit is native to South America there's about 200 varieties of passion fruits to choose from and and let's talk about some varieties here which I want to share with you that you can find when shopping and I got this one to get you guys started at Florida Hill nursery calm and you can see here they've got the Florida home purple passion fruit vine possum purple the Florida home yellow variety the Frederick's which is the one I've got here on my garden the Hawaiian Lily coupe ashen fruit vine the yellow giant passion fruit vine and then now when it comes to health and nutrition this I gathered off of the organic facts net I've rigged annex not endorsing any of these statements but this is one of dozens of articles you'll find out there relating to passion fruit health and benefits the here's a couple of bullet points nutritional value and health benefits that boost immunity prevents cancer vitamin A aids in digestion lowers blood pressure improves circulation improves bone health treats insomnia and soothes your russ berrie respiratory condition we go over here some of this might be repetitive but highly beneficial juice and you'll often see added to other juices to improve flavor and and an exotic taste grown in most warm climates throughout the world again even though it was originated out of South America you can now find the South Pacific Central America Middle East Mediterranean very subtropical location including Los Angeles and will continue antioxidant benefits flavonoids vitamin A vitamin C riboflavin niacin iron magnesium phosphorus potassium copper fiber protein boost immunity prevents cancer so again I told you some of us would be repetitive on vitamin A content aids in digestion reduces blood pressure proof circulation and here's another charm boosts immune systems improves circulation improves bone and eye health the gives relief from insomnia has and whooping-cough skin hydrated and glowing prevents against cancer and heart disease aids in digestion and and relieves constipation soothes your respiratory circulation and the list continues on and on and on so I know this was a lot of tips on passion fruits I think I've done my part to encourage you and motivate you to get the passion fruit binding in your garden hopefully grows in your area in my research also in areas that I've learned where it's got freezing cold winters sometimes the roots still remain alive underground and reefs Prout's under the ground and again with 40 to 80 feet of growth per year you're still going to have a huge vine in that same growing season with hopefully supporting plenty of freeze I want to hear from you and I'm trying to make this a little bit more interactive but I want you to share your passion food experiences and your knowledge with us here at Ivy organic with your Facebook Twitter Instagram this hashtag info actually hashtag ivy organic and we'll see your links and we can hopefully start a dialogue that way as well I hope you found this video informative and if

Wars day which is coming up it's like a couple days away and if any of you watching don't know what Star Wars day is it is every year on May 4th begin it may the force be with you anyways it's adorable and dirty and I celebrate it every year I love to make a baked themed treat so that is exactly what we're gonna be doing today now I was thinking we've made so many Star Wars themed treats our nerdy nummies before so I wanted to make something that I have been obsessed with lately which is baby Yoda ok I got Disney Plus I started watching the new Mandalorian Series and boom there was baby Yoda I've never seen a baby oh dude he's so cute and some and his eyes and he's just in it and I was like we need to make that a dessert he's so cute I could just eat them and today we're going to and if you love nerdy no reason you like watching baking videos don't forget to give this video a thumbs up click subscribe and ring the bell to receive notifications every time I post a new video so today we're gonna be making some baby Yoda macarons let's get started the recipe that we're gonna be making today is a matcha macaron why matcha us because it is naturally green and so is yoda so I thought that this would be a perfect fit I'll be posting all of the ingredients and their measurements in the description down below so if you'd like to follow along at home you can alright first things first is we are going to in a large mixing bowl sift our almond flour powdered sugar and matcha powder so you take your bowl and you're just gonna pour in your almond flour you can use whatever sifter you have at home this is one of my favorites I like it because has a lot of room in there for a lot of different dry ingredients it's got a little hand Creek on the side it's just really fine doot-doot-doot - now the reason we're sifting all of our and dry ingredients today and we don't usually do that all the time is because French macaroon cookies are very finicky I think they're one of the most finicky cookies that you can make but they're so delicious they're so worth it but one of the factors is you don't want any lumps you don't want a lumpy French macaron you want a smooth one so sip sip sip it is one extra step but trust me worth it oh yeah look at those big chunks exactly what we do not want in our French macaron cookies then when you got your chunks you're just gonna pour them into this little excess bowl over here now sift all of the powdered sugar same way we did with the almond flour look at this isn't it look like it's snowing on the mountain I love this I feel like a little kid like playing in a sandbox or something I don't know why but I love it oh how tall do you think we can get this mountain right let's let's see oh ledge oh no we have an avalanche each step to making French macaroons takes a little bit more time but worth it and you know who's really worth it baby Yoda okay baby Oh - I'm doing this for you I love you you adorable little even though I think baby Yoda in this series is like 50 yeah he is a baby but he's like 50 he's either half vampire so like he does age but like really slowly or he's got a really good skincare routine oh the force is really with baby Yoda boom pour off the excess scary those little chunks last but not least you're gonna sift the matcha powder matcha is so good and its really been growing on me me ten years ago was like matcha don't hate it don't love it fast-forward today love it and if you've never baked or cooked with matcha before you can just buy it at most grocery stores this is the one I'm using I really really like this one it's my son food and it's organic and it is like oh my gosh Molly Molly has got the loudest hiccup when I was talking about matcha Molly do you like this brand is this like your favorite whoa you're like a little bb-8 or an r2d2 where you just been making pop you just be making little noises once you've sipped it all your dry ingredients we're gonna whisk together until well combined and then set it off to the side time to make the meringue I'm gonna be using a stand mixer but you can use an electric hand mixer or you could do this by hand but I wouldn't recommend it cuz we're gonna be mixing for like eight minutes it trust me I've done it once by hand and it's not great protip you want to make sure your eggs are at room temperature when you're making this recipe you don't want them cold right out of the refrigerator like I said before these cookies are very finicky the are very sensitive to temperature and a cold egg will really mess up the batter they just won't bake right add three eggs to the bowl but remember we're only gonna be using two egg whites so you want to crack your egg open I do the jiggle technique it's my favorite you just jiggle the yolk back and forth between the shells letting the egg whites drip to the bottom of the bowl do this to the rest of your eggs or all of the egg whites into the mixing bowl mix together on a medium-low speed until frothy and if you're new to baking a beginner Baker frothy is like when it gets bubbly it's right before it starts to turn into a soft peak so you'll see a lot of bubbles it will almost look like a bubble bath that's the perfect time to start adding our sugar also this usually takes a couple minutes I'd say two to three minutes perfect the mixture looks very bubbly and frothy so now we are going to slowly add our sugar and keep mixing until stiff peaks start to form and we have a beautiful meringue so you're just gonna add slowly just add a little bit let it mix up add a little bit more and let it mix this is great Jedi training patience it's key this is definitely something Yoda would be teaching let's be like butter one and sugar all would go it would be like patience whoo oh yeah that's what we want we want your brain to be able to stand up and not flop over oh it looks so fluffy it's like a cloud I want to eat it right now oh just making me crave like a lemon meringue pie okay that I'll put that on my to-do list that's really I'm getting distracted now we're gonna fold in our dry ingredients to our fluffy egg meringue now right here is another time in the recipe where this batter could go very wrong you don't want to over mix and you don't want to under mix if you over mix your cookies are gonna bake very flat there they'll be smooth but they'll be very flat you won't get that height that you want but if you under mix the cookies are gonna crack something has worked for me is adding the dry ingredients a third at a time and counting in my head about 40 folds so let's add a third just gonna eyeball it and fold using spatula if you've never folded before it's very easy you're gonna scoop underneath and bring it over the top and this is to keep our meringue nice and fluffy so that's three folds four five six and just keep going there we go the batter is ready I ended up folding it about 50 times anywhere between 40 and 60 is a good amount of folds but again you don't want to over mix or under mix I'm gonna scoop the batter into two bags one has a little tip at the end this is a number two a four the main part of the cookie and this one will be four Yoda's ears you're just gonna open a piping bag place it into a cup a little spoon and scoop it inside and that's what you want you want your batter to be really thick but still moving that's the perfect consistency we've got our batter in the bags and they're ready to pipe so in front of me I have a cookie sheet which we're gonna be baking the cookies on a piece of parchment paper and what's this a little Yoda template you can make your own or if you'd like to download this one you can find it in the recipe on my website that's at Rosanna pansino dot-com I'll put a link down below all right so we're gonna place the template down you could also freehand these but I wouldn't suggest it sometimes it gets a little crazy it's nice to have a little guideline and then place your parchment paper on top and it's very important you want to use parchment paper not wax paper we are ready to pipe you're gonna place the piping bag on top of your shape apply pressure while hovering boop boop until you reach the outline and then give it a twist then do this for the rest of your cookies we piped all the cookies and now we're gonna pipe ears with the rest of the batter I'm just gonna cut off the tip and follow the outline once you've typed all the cookies we're gonna give them a tap to release all the air bubbles alright prepare yourselves this is going to be loud next let them sit out at room temperature just right here don't touch him for 30 minutes this will allow our cookies to develop a hard shell before they bake alright these are set and they're ready to pop in the oven but remember before you pop them in the oven remove your paper template just be gentle just be careful oh now now you're gonna pop them into your oven at 300 degrees and bake for about 16 to 18 minutes and watch them puff up while the cookies are baking in the oven we are gonna make a simple from scratch raspberry buttercream I wanted to incorporate a sweet fruit into the filling so that the taste will pair really well with the bitterness of the matcha it's a great combo and this recipe is really easy so in a mixer you're just gonna add 1 stick of butter you'll want it at room temperature this is half a cup plop it in there well whoa well wow this is really room temperature nice and soft just like we want this is a warm day in California I oh my goodness I don't have to get a spatula you don't want any butter to go to waste then you're gonna beat the butter for four minutes all right that's looking good now slowly add your powdered sugar to the butter mixture while it's mixing until it gets a light and fluffy you're gonna add about 3/4 cup of powdered sugar now we're gonna add our raspberries and to do so we're just gonna we're your fresh raspberries this is one cup of fresh raspberries into a sifter and I'm gonna put it over the bowl and then just using a fork I'm just gonna mush him up like mashed potatoes helpful tip you'll want your raspberries to be room temperature just mix this process a little bit easier you could also throw the raspberries in a blender if you wanted but I just didn't want to dirty up my blender so sometimes I'll do it by hand that's okay just keep mixing up your raspberries and letting the fresh raspberry juice strain into the bowl we've got our fresh raspberry puree and then you're just gonna add it into our butter mixture and mix it up look at that mmm taste test mmm okay perfect now you're gonna scoop your buttercream and do a little piping bag oh yeah little tie on here and set it off to the side once your cookies have baked and had plenty of time to cool it is time to decorate this is my favorite part we're keeping it really simple today we're just gonna be using some cookie icing to pipe cute baby Yoda's face this recipe makes a bunch of cookies it makes 40 cookies but 20 total cuz there's 40 of these but then you pair that in together you to make little Yoda's head the good news is you don't have to pipe half of them the bottom ones just stay plain this is our goal this is what we're going for I kept the lines really simple we put some little creases for yildiz little wrinkly brow I call it his wise brow Yoda's very wise and I think he thinks a lot so he is like a lot of frozen his brow you know cuz just always thinking and being smart and stuff because these are such a petite small cookie I wanted to keep decoration very simple so for the eyes and the cheeks in the mouth there are literally just little dots over here we've got our royal icing that I've scooped into piping bags and dyed some different colors we have green black and pink and they all have number one tips at the end for a little bit more control number one tips are the smallest tips and I decided to use those because we're just making very small dots and lines all right let's get started with the green we're piping on his cute little wrinkly forehead I'm just gonna pipe two little lines even though he's a baby he's 50 he's seen some stuff these are some wisdom lines right here this is what you would call the 11s and then the thinker's oh yeah perfect all right now you're gonna do this to the rest of your cookies then using the black royal icing super easy you're just gonna pipe two little dots for the and a little lime for the smile and placing my eyes a little further apart cuz I want them to look super adorbs then do this to all of your cookies oh my gosh this one looks like that guy from the gum bees oh no this is Goonies vibe this is not Yoda 500 never happens mmm that was really good last but not least we're gonna pipe two little dots for the cheeks right underneath the eye look how cute now it's time to put these babies together look how guys are all decorated they're ready to assemble you're gonna flip over the cute little circle ones boom if I'm upside down to see those beautiful feet did you and you're gonna take your raspberry buttercream icing pipe a little here ant place one on the top to make little mackerel sandwiches now we're gonna do this to the rest of your cookies and they're ready to serve end it all there you have it baby outta French macaron cookies I really hope you guys enjoy this much of recipe they're so cute and they're perfect for Star Wars day I'll be posting a bunch of cute pictures all over social media and of you guys make these or any other Star Wars treats and don't forget to tag me I love seeing your baking creations it just makes me happy it makes my day and if you have any other ideas for any other nerdy w's please let me know leave me a comment down below and I will do my best to make it happen if you guys are enjoying these baking videos and nerdy nummies give this video a thumbs up click

[Music]", "H1fRXFcxVkE": "[Music] hello guys welcome back to my channel so you guys all know that I am an avid user of rice water for hair growth but actually over the last two weeks I've stopped using rice water and I've started to use onion juice for hair growth instead yes that's smelly food that gives us really bad breath actually has nutrients and properties in it that make your hair grow and in this video I'm gonna be showing you guys the best way to make and use onion juice for hair growth so if you guys like these types of hair growth videos make sure you subscribe to my channel and also follow me on instagram at Audrey Victoria X and before we get into this video I have a huge disclaimer onion juice smells like onions that's obvious I know but I don't want anyone to watch this video thinking that there's gonna be a magical ingredient that will get rid of that smell because unfortunately there's not so make no mistake onion juice 100% absolutely smells like onions but as long as you guys use a good shampoo and conditioner to rinse out the onion juice which I will show you guys in a few minutes the smell will all go away but just while it's in your hair it is gonna smell now that I got that out of the way let's get into the video so first I'm gonna show you guys how to make onion juice so I start off with two medium sized purple onions it's important to use purple onions because they have the most juice compared to the other types of onions so if you're about to comment can I use any type of onion unfortunately the answer is No next I peel the onions and I chop them up also to avoid burning your eyes you can wear sunglasses while you're cutting up the onions so onions are rich in sulfur which is found in keratin and keratin is found in hair the sulfur and onion juice is said to potentially help provide nourishment to the hair needed to promote hair growth onions also have antimicrobial properties which help to fight scalp infections that can contribute to hair loss like dandruff and a healthy scalp equals strong hair follicles which equals an optimal environment for hair growth and finally onions are rich in antioxidants which help to reduce damage to hair follicles again supporting hair growth so once the onions are chopped up I rinse them thoroughly two times to remove any bacteria or dirt that could be on the onions then I place them in a blender with some water so because I have a small blender and I don't want to overfill it I separate this into two batches so for the first batch I blend together half of the chopped onions with 2/3 cup water then once that's blended together I put that in a mason jar aside and I add the remaining onions again with 2/3 cup water but obviously if your blender is bigger or more powerful than mine then you can just add it all in at once so the total measurements would be 2 medium-sized purple onions blended together with 1 and 1/3 cup of water so once everything is blended together I transfer everything into a mason jar and then I grab another mason jar and I grab some cheesecloth which is a very weird word but this product is like super helpful for making onion juice because it allows you to extract as much juice as you possibly can from your onion juice first is just using a regular strainer with cheesecloth you have full control over how much juice you are squeezing out basically I just pour the blended onion juice into the cheesecloth over a mason jar I squeeze as much of the onion juice out of the bag as possible and I spend a few minutes doing this just to make sure that I'm extracting as much juice as possible just so that I don't waste any of it [Music] then I take a funnel and this applicator bottle I don't know what these are called I want to call them just like a hair applicator bottle but that's what I'm gonna use to apply the onion juice in my hair so I pour all of the onion juice into this bottle via a funnel and usually I have to split it up into two bottles the applicator bottles that I use although they're really helpful they don't fit all of the onion juice that I use and this is what the finished onion juice looks like so I always apply an onion juice before I'm about to wash my hair so for me this would be day 3 hair so to apply this in my hair I'm really just gonna focus mostly on my scalp so I section off my hair and start by applying it on my roots and the applicator bottle makes this really easy to apply on your roots versus using a spray bottle which I used to use because with the applicator bottle you have so much more control over where you are putting the onion juice I then use a scalp massager to massage it into my scalp this will help to increase circulation to your scalp which promotes hair growth and it's also going to help your scalp to better absorb the nutrients from the onion juice which will also promote hair growth [Music] so even though it's most important to apply the onion juice to your roots and scalp you can also just spread the onion juice throughout the strength of your hair because it is also beneficial for the overall health of your hair so I just like to use a brush to brush everything out just to make sure that the strands of my hair and my scalp are fully coated in the onion juice you also want to make sure to wash the hair tools that you use afterwards because you don't want them to smell like onions so once all of the onion juice is thoroughly massage onto my roots and throughout my hair and then put my hair up in a bun and I wait an hour before rinsing this out whoo it is very hot so that's why I am sweating anyway so one big tip for you guys is when you are putting your hair up after you've applied the onion juice in it do not use a regular scrunchie or a hair tie instead I would suggest you to use one of these butterfly clamps so I will link these below in the description and the reason why I suggest these is because as I said onion juice does smell so you don't want the onion juice to saturate your scrunchie or your hair tie you can just wash it after using it and it won't smell alright so it has been 1 hour and I am ready to rinse the onion juice out so whenever I rinse the onion juice out when I'm washing my hair afterwards I always use lukewarm water I've just found that when I use hot water or even like warm to hot water it makes the onion smell stay on my hair longer whereas lukewarm to cool water helps to get rid of the onion smell I don't know the science behind it but that's just what I found from trial and error so I rinse my hair for about 1 to 2 minutes just to try to rinse all of the onion juice out before shampooing then I move on to shampoo and I like to use a shampoo that specifically caters to improving scalp health because that goes hand-in-hand with this recipe so today I'm gonna be using derma e's scalp relief shampoo and conditioner I also like to use my scalp massager to massage everything into my scalp not only does it help my scalp to absorb the nutrients from the shampoo but it also just helps to ensure that my scalp has fully absorbed all of the nutrients from the onion juice before I thoroughly rinse it out [Music] so once I shampoo of course then I move on to conditioner to condition my hair I just apply conditioner throughout the strength of my hair I leave it in for about three to five minutes and then the rinsing of the onion juice it's done [Music] then after getting out of the shower I just style my hair as usual so I like to use the Revlon one-step styler and these are my onion juice hair results so as you can see my hair looks extra shiny and healthy but I've also found that my scalp just feels extra clean after using onion juice and I think that's one of the main reasons why it has really helped with my hair growth because as I mentioned earlier a healthy scalp contributes to healthier and faster hair growth so now I just want to discuss how often you should be using onion juice for hair growth since I know that this is a question that a lot of people are gonna have so the good thing about onion juice is that unlike rice water you can pretty much use it whenever you want as often as you want I haven't read any restrictions or warnings on the frequency that you can use onion juice so really it's up to you but of course because everyone's hair is different and everyone's body is different you may find that using it too often may not suit your hair for whatever reason so just make sure that you pay close attention to how your hair responds to onion juice to really figure out how often you should be using it although I haven't seen any horror stories about using it too often just be careful because you never know how your hair might react personally I've been using onion juice once a week and I've seen amazing results I'm actually gonna start using it in combination with rice water so I will use onion juice once a week in rice water every two to three weeks and another thing to keep in mind is the frequency with which you use onion juice is all so gonna depend on how often you wash your hair so for me I wash my hair about two to three times a week and I always shampoo and condition my hair an hour after using onion juice so because of that I couldn't even use it more than two or three times a week if I wanted to but if you're someone who just like doesn't even care we'll walk around with onion smelling hair then yes you can use it every day unless you have a bad reaction to it as I mentioned so that is just another factor to take into consideration when figuring out how often you should be using onion juice for hair growth all right you guys I hope you enjoyed this video again if you guys are not subscribed make sure you subscribe

single item of food or drink best summarizes its regional identity it is found in every restaurant grocery store and home kitchen from the Gulf of Mexico to the mountains of West Virginia if you are southern you are surprised when it is not offered publicly or privately if you are visiting the south from parts beyond you are surprised it even exists but how did the sweetened iced version of what is in arguably a global beverage come to exist in the u.s. south east in its current form in order to understand this we must take a look at the larger history of tea tea specifically the plant that spawned the two major varieties of tea camellia sinensis started in China where people have been using it in all kinds of ways for thousands of years from their tea spread to nearby Asian cultures in modern-day Vietnam Korea and Japan in each of these places teas history is deep in its production methods shrouded in myth and ceremony tea became almost gleefully infused whatever culture touched however tea usage wasn't uniform in all these places it underwent an array of transformations in each of these ancient cultures this century's long process created a rich assortment of recipes and preparation techniques that have only made the global addiction to tea stronger for example during China's Tang Dynasty 1400 years ago people preferred a whole leaf variety of tea that was mixed with fruit pastes which was then stored in the form of a cake when preparing to drink this tea cake recipe bits of the cake were portioned off tossed into a pot and boiled China's father of tea Lu you who wrote the world's first book about tea and astonishing 1,200 years ago preferred a more humble alternative to the popular tang tea cake method he felt that tea should just be enjoyed plain none of the fruit and ginger that Tang society insisted on adding to their tea later when the Mongols came to rule over China the preferred tea was a dark pungent low-quality Borderlands tea made from clippings and tea twigs taken with fermented mares milk not the complicated tea leaf concoction Chinese high society had been enjoying for centuries t use continued to transform in a similar fashion during these early centuries but how did tea reach the rest of the world the answer is Europe Europeans started bumping into tea possibly as far back as Marco Polo in the 14th century but certainly by the 16th century when Europeans began traversing the world's oceans then in the early 17th century the Dutch East India Company brought the first Chinese green tea leaves into port in Amsterdam from there tea began the slow cultural uptake in Europe finally making its way into Britain's drinking places in the 1660s around the same time as Arabic coffee and chocolate from Mexico the British really took an obsessive lean toward tea so much so that by the middle of the 18th century it might as well have been the national beverage Brits like their tea very much like the Mongols did with milk and since Britain had major skin in the global sugar game by way of sugar plantations in the West Indies cane sugar also saw increased consumption in Britain during the same time period leading in evitable to a precursory version of the beverage we now know as sweet tea although versions of tea had been variously sweetened thousands of years prior in places like China and Japan it is important to note the addition of cane sugar in this version of tea as it directly relates to how the us-south wound up with sugar in its own teeth although sweetening tea in this way was very expensive at this time from Europe tea leaves landed in ports all over the world including ironically India despite India's proximity to China tea didn't become a big commercial thing there until the British made an attempt to establish their own tea industry that China did not already control the British through acts of international espionage worthy of a motion picture succeeded in India went on to become one of the leading tea producers on earth for a time the tea experience in India also produced new varieties and flavors of tea namely Assam and Darjeeling among others naturally tea followed the British wherever they went including North America where the Brits and other European powers were busy planting towns and ports among the dizzying array of cultures and nations already present there as a result tea was just as important among British subjects in America as it ever was back home by the time American colonists began to assert themselves against the British Empire tea was an intimate familiarity among people of all classes and locations in English America in fact disagreements over the taxation of tea and the famous Boston Tea Party helped spark the fires of revolution after that revolution end to the dismay of the newly self-anointed Americans tea importation was initially cut off despite America's love for tea it never came back into style in America the way it used to be over time Americans turned toward coffee with such patriotic dedication that today Americans drink three times as much coffee as tea nowadays about 85% of the tea that is consumed in America is iced tea but how did the ice get in there it turns out humans have been harvesting ice for thousands of years before electric refrigeration beginning in the 19th century there was an entire profession of ice cutters who collected ice in the frozen parts of the world and shipped it to the warmer parts of the world via the global ice trade people of certain income levels owned personal ice boxes or cold closets in their homes where they stored ice once it was purchased from local ice houses just like cane sugar ice is a crucial ingredient to any southern glass of sweet tea for the United States modern sweetened iced tea was probably born out of what were called tea punches this is an alcoholic concoction using tea and some type of wine or champagne a specific tea punch recipe from 1839 called for tea sugar rich sweet cream and red Bordeaux wine sweet iced tea recipes by themselves specifically popped up as early as 1879 such as in a book called housekeeping in old Virginia by Marian Coble tyree this particular recipe which counts as one of the earliest sweetened iced tea recipes we know of is not that unusual from today's southern beverage except a call for an optional light froth an additional ice on the side served with well washed grape leaves that and it probably called for green tea not the black or dark tea we are all familiar with nowadays this is an important distinction which we'll come back to in a moment tea punches in early sweet tea recipes did call for sugar but last we left off cane sugar was very expensive no worries by 1750 several Caribbean islands became the greatest producers of sugar in the world with modern-day Haiti leading the pack which fueled an ever-increasing sugar addiction in Western Europe and its colonies as a result sugar production kept getting bigger and sugar itself became ever available and more affordable everywhere including in the United States so we have the ice and the sugar in place but why aren't alcoholic tea bunches still popular in the United States how did the alcohol get removed even though there are sweet tea recipes in cookbooks since at least the late 1870s Americans prefer the aforementioned alcoholic sweet tea punches until the National alcohol prohibition experiment came along in 1920 Americans were then forced to switch to virgin teas for roughly thirteen years after which prohibition was ended however at that point it was too late Americans had picked up a tea habit that did not include alcohol but there is still the matter of green tea versus black tea where Americans were primarily drinking green tea and not the black tea that is ubiquitous now green tea has always been a mainstay for the far east the difference in green and black tea is a difference in preparation techniques and green tea much preferred in the east did not last much longer than a year on a sea voyage to Europe tea leaves that were prepared as black tea were able to last much longer in storage and were perfect for those early long sea voyages once the Chinese figured out the exact recipe for black tea they began selling it to the Europeans who developed a clear preference for the darker variety green tea was still the jewel in the tea drinkers eye so you bought it whenever you could especially as ocean shipping times continued to get shorter throughout the centuries the United States consumed both green and black tea throughout its history an early tea recipes typically called for green tea that being said black teas increased in popularity throughout the 20th century until world war ii when supplies of green tea were cut off from asia and americans were forced to subsist on black tea from british associations like india there you have it sweet iced tea China and nearby Asian cultures created a thousand different ways to consume it Europe came along and was instantly addicted to it especially black tea Britain went so team mad they cut in on China's action by setting up a competing tea industry in India also dominating the cane sugar trade at the time Britain brought sugar and tea to North America where would be Americans promptly used tea as a convenient way to break up at the British Americans began putting ice and alcohol in what was preferably green tea to make sweet tea punches then Along Came Prohibition to take the alcohol out of the tea and then World War two to switch Americans from green tea to black and there you have it a perfect glass of Sweden iced tea thank you for watching please feel free to leave comments below and subscribe to the channel

there and go eat some dinner and we will see you all on the next one thanks for watching", "DqJJGVSwhEI": "[Music] in my previous video I actually used the water of boiled beets that I had boiled obviously and I just added coconut oil to it and my hair was bleached blonde so this time around I'm doing my ends and it's more like a faded out ombre so it's like a little bit of blonde light brownish Hill I know most people were asking me questions does they work on brown hair so this is going to be the answer to those questions [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I tied my hair up like this that way it's easier to tie these ends because all the light colors abend so I'm gonna wash this with a oil removing like shampoo to get all of the oil and dirt out of the end so that it's dry and then I'm gonna actually just keep my hair kind of moist and then put the day in every one thing to note you want it like slightly damp and not like dripping what so just towel dry it until it's you know a little bit drier but still kind of wet because you want the follicles to still stay open and make sure that you do not condition after washing it so this is almost there I'm gonna ready the dye and get started I'm gonna do these in sections probably gonna divide it into like four so half leave this back here and then do this half again so you can kind of work in these in sections my hands are still died from earlier after even washing my hands a few times and it didn't even stay on that long so that just shows how Ola dice we could just dip it in there see how this goes [Music]", "LgPGv8hpkjE": "hi guys I thought I'd show you really quickly how to make a tea latte so I didn't take black tea it's really really hard but I closed it on my personal I figure when people ask me how to make it it's so easy so I just seat or heat up some water and I just wanna fill it okay I like to put a heavy hand of let's turn the mouth in there I will take liquid stevia this is really hard to do and so you see that tells all I put in there like the tiniest bit have to do to make a block tea latte you can use different heat I just listen cuz that's what I have I really do like luck Brooke this one and Earl Grey so um definitely you do yeah if you use almond milk he'll be like Scotty you", "o2EUgod-aK8": "hi welcome to low-carb cocktails I'm Frank today we'll be making a zero net carb sugar-free monk fruit simple syrup a lot of things to say there but basically we're doing a monk fruit simple syrup which you can have 0 grams and net carbs but before I get started if you want to learn more about making cocktails low-carb Aikido friendly make sure you click the subscribe button and the bell icon you'll be notified every time I put a video out so that's gonna get started mmm and if you haven't saw the video on my savory whiskey smash check out that video right here later what I'll be using is the lucano monk fruit sweetened and with your throat on and I have played around with this a little bit and I will say this I don't know if monk fruit reacts like your wrist at all but I tried this in a very small sample and it recrystallizes just like your throat all and that's one thing when you see your throat all simple syrups all over the internet and even on YouTube but they don't tell you is that it does recrystallize even though the packaging says one-to-one sugar substitute if not you may have to bring this up to a 1 to 3 ratio to keep that your throat all from recrystallizing what it is 1 ounce of water 1 ounce of the month free sweetener and it recrystallize within 2 hours it was solid again so back to using this as a erythritol this is gonna be treated more like your wrist at all because it says you with your throat all the first ingredient on a package is erythritol with monk fruit extract so i don't know if i can you looked and maybe i'm not looking in the right place but I can't find just monk fruit sweetener everything I find is as your throat all in it so we're going to show you how we do this first thing you need is a pot something's going to hold about 3 cups of water we're gonna go ahead and use you know today we'll do about a half a cup will do like a half a batch and do a half a cup the sweetener and we'll do one part sweetener three parts of water so that's going to be one and a half cups of water so we'll go with one cup and a half cup now the one thing that did fun is it does not take as long to dissolve once you put on a stove and heat it up I don't even think it got to a full boil it was just a barely a hard simmer so I'll be right back I'm gonna put this on the stove for you know maybe five minutes I'll let you know the exact time when I get back and we'll see how this comes out all right guys we'll be right back Anna back so overall it took just barely over three minutes to dissolve all of the mumphrey sweetener or your word haul and monk fruit blend so that's kind of where we're at so let's go ahead and bottle this get yourself an airtight bottle and just put it in [Music] now I did let this cool for about 10 minutes you don't to put anything hot directly in the glass it'll shatter it and there we go and let's see here so we're going to put a little bit in compare this is the Laconte monk fruit with your throat all and this is monent your throat all sweet in there so it's going to see and compare it's just like putting sugar in your mouth [Music] that's that's good - they're about the same sweetness but I do fondness of the moanin it's more like a true or syrup where it's got a little thicker viscosity this is you know these made with water simple syrup so that's you know water and sugar and watery that's it guys we have a zero net carb monk fruit sweetener now what I do with my sweeteners when I make them is you want to add a little bit of vodka about half an ounce quarter now somewhere now just to keep it as a preservative this will keep in your fridge rater for a couple of them a be a week or so with out the vodka putting the vodka in it it's gonna let it last for about you know three to four weeks usually it doesn't last that long on my house anyway so guys that's it so we got a new simple syrup so if you watch my other simple syrup video we need to check that out right here on that's we're using Splenda to net grams of carbs swish that around I've talked about a couple of my other videos play with the recipe guys down to one net gram of carbs but now we have the monk fruit erythritol blender from LeConte oh and zero net carbs it is four grams of carbs for sugar alcohols if you're counting net carbs zero net carbs mmm I think it's time for a whiskey sour all right guys y'all have a great night umm because how did you see I'm done

put um a couple of sewing schools up uh end of july beginning of august there's a weekend showing score at the end of july that's two days where you can come along and make anything you like and then the following week there's a three day wednesday to thursday friday three days ten till four where you can come along and make anything you like oh julie wants to come and look at needles oh yes that's fine yeah you can't be sewing with rusty needles julie yeah that's no good you need some tulip needles that's what you need jimmy the lovely tulip needles you can just see them at the top of the screen yeah just behind just behind and yeah so have a look on the website i did just put those up so as well as the um the couture retreat which is now up as products um there's also the uh a couple of new sewing schools and a new um i do i don't know how much time i want to ones but i do have what i call mini fit and finish classes on a monday morning when we're open back here in may um where the maximum of three people just for two hours on a monday morning and i put a new one of those in on the 24th of may i think jan's already booked on that one so there's two places left a little bit of help with fitting or finishing a garment um yeah you come along to midhearth and see me on on monday morning from may how often should you change your hand sewing needle well there's no real general rule about that i think it's just when you can feel them just not sewing nicely when they're not going smoothly with your fabric with machine needles after eight hours of sewing it's a general rule although i tend to think once you start skipping stitches that's when you change your needles but hand sewing is i don't i don't know there's a general rule about uh hand sewing needs i just think once you you know if they feel they're not going smoothly through the fabric and they start to walk yeah it's amazing what we put up with isn't it you just keep going and think oh no this is my need that i use and then you put have a new one using the tulip needles and you think oh goodness me it's so much easier tulips are great because they don't bend like they don't flex they say flex so they won't bend or warp like other needles do or when they're like or when they're rusty jilly says yeah no especially if you're doing silk or something you don't want musty needles do you no so yes a few few new things obviously fingers crossed that we can open back here on the 17th of may so look out for that few new workshops new retreats what else have we got new there's always new things we'll be telling you new things all the time so today i thought i would do a little demo uh a bit of pattern cutting today um so one of the things when we're doing any of our classes we talk about measurements going around the body so bust waist and hip very important to do any fitting but measurements going down the body are just as important and one of the most important ones are is the measurement from the shoulder seam at the neck to the apex of the bust this measurement here so if you measure i'll just move my ridiculously long hair out the way from the shoulder seam at the neck here down to the apex of the bust there that measurement there we're all going to be different there but of course the pattern companies have to pick a standard and often it's much higher than where we are so if you're making a garment with a dart or something like that if you don't have that um equivalent point of the pattern the point on the pattern equivalent to what your measurement the darts are going to be pointing above your bust um or it could be below but mainly i find that commercial patterns um their patterns their darts are too high and that's because they're made for 19 year olds or 17 year olds or someone who likes to really wear their bras very tight so most of us like to be comfortable and we maybe need to lower the bus point and the darts by about an inch so i thought i'd show you how to do that today it's one of the most common things we have to do it's one of the first things we check as well i'm going to amy's going to come in and i'm going to show you a little bit of pattern cutting today so no sewing machines it's funny we don't use sewing machines for the couture zones you're over here now let's do something nice and calm this afternoon just get this cake so if you're doing full brush adjustments or anything like that before you would do anything before you would do a full bust adjustment you would come out i need to put the thing to come in yeah and you can see how i'm just moving stuff out of the way there we go right there we go so yes so um when you're checking your measurements the first thing you would do is check the size you're going to make so which width size you're going to make and if you decided you need to do something like a full bust adjustment before you would do that you need to check that the measurement from the shoulder seam at the neck to the apex of the bust is correct because there's no point adding more fullness in the front here if it's you're not in the right place so most commercial patterns would have the bath plus point marked with a circle with a cross in it like that so um butter simplicity can you see that okay yeah we'd have a circle with a cross and the dart whichever angle it's coming from would be pointing to that um that point so if you put a ruler through the middle of the dart there you'd see that the dart is absolutely pointing to the bust point and that's what it should do it should point the bus point it shouldn't really finish at the bus point because that's not very flattering unless you're madonna or you're doing you're doing something jean-paul gaultier or something like that but mostly we like our darts to finish about an inch and a quarter inch and a half back from the bus point so the first thing to do is to check the measurement of the pattern and the shoulder seam at the neck to the bust point and see if it matches yours and if it doesn't if you're measuring and your bust point is actually here i'm being i'll exaggerate here on this small scale pattern but say you've measured and your bus points there it's no good having the dart pointing above so we need to move it so to do that what you need to do is do some cutting and sticking i'm going to need the masking tape so the first thing you need to do is draw a few lines the first line you draw is parallel to the grain line at the point of the dart like that and then let's draw another line at the outside edge of the dart so again parallel to the grain line at the outside edge of the dart so on wednesday night we were talking about this we would we're doing princess seams and we had to move the bus points down so that's another thing i'm just showing you a nice easy way to move a dart today but uh whatever pattern you're doing you need to check the bus point and then we're going to draw a line above the dark perpendicular to the grain line and another one below so we've basically drawn a box around the dart like that i'm going to take my scissors from my lovely new storage stand over there and i'm going to cut this box out so i'm literally just cutting up the box you can i have seen instructions for doing moving darts where you cut the actual dart out and that would be fine on a great big dart like this but if you've got a little skinny dart it's much easier to draw a box around it because you really want to think about keeping the same angle so there we go so i've cut the um cut the dart out and then i'm going to slide it down so i'm sliding it straight down there so whatever amount i've moved the bus point down i need to move the dart down so i've moved that down that was a random amount that i just did but i've moved it down three quarters of an inch so i need to move that box down three quarters of an inch so the dart will now be um sorry for me thank you the dart will now be pointing at my bus point thank you and then we stick it back in and then you need some paper underneath to fill in the gap this is not very sticky this masking tape i remember using i've used it the other night and thought it's not very sticky i do like to use masking tape because you can draw on it and uh and also if you make a mistake you can peel it off and also the other thing is if you do hit it with the iron or anything it doesn't crinkle up okay so the dart is now pointing at our bus point and we need to chew up the lines there's two ways of doing this you could fold the dart out which is more tricky on this thick paper that i've got here or you can just draw the line through the lines up so above the dart you draw a line from the shoulder seam to the top of the dart that way and below the dart you're just going to draw it sort of smooth it in to the waist that'll probably use the curve to do that one because it's more curly there so when you're chewing up patterns you'll notice that we chopped a little bit off here but we've actually gained it here whenever you're chewing patterns you often find that you lose a bit one place and you gain a bit another place so that's how you know that you're chewing up correctly and now your dart will be in the right place so there you go that's all there is to it and then you would go on if you needed to do something like a full bust adjustment does that make sense everybody everyone's gone so quiet i can't tell if anyone's if they were watching you busy watching taking note it's one of those things and if you if you have a larger bust and you're working with one of the patterns that's got what cup sizes it could be all you need to do is just move the dart down to make sure that you are um darts pointing in the right place ali says yep on instagram oh thank you very much that's really clever good good good there you go so when you come to a pattern with the dart always check that measurement from the shoulder seam of the neck if you have um a pattern with your seam allowances on you'll often find that there's a little triangle here susan's drawing diagrams says yes that makes perfect sense oh janet yes your jacket yes that's what we were talking about weren't we the dark we thought your dart was a bit high on your jacket the other night on your 12. julie says thanks great good good good there we there go go bit of a quick one today it was yeah speedy dinner i don't i don't like to give too much i'm doing pattern cutting don't give it too much because there's a lot to take it all that's right sorry it was a bit of a close-up stream close-up oh hold on suzanne's asking your question before you disappear how do you attach the pockets on the sample in the corners oh it's just a foul stitch suzanne that's one that's on the chill we're doing this morning and i thought you weren't going to ask pattern cutting i was going to get anything to come back in so on the on the uh pocket suzanne just you're doing your fail stitch all the way around and i normally just go across the top a little bit about a quarter of an inch across the top because they're not really pockets you're going to use very much so does that make sense let me know if that makes sense i can send you a little picture later good good i'm liking my good cover yeah we're running a bit early today does anyone have any sewing questions they need anything anything we've been doing lots of talking any issues to crop up this week that people need some clear top tips for oh yeah do ask me any questions that you've got oh we could talk about the joe license thing oh yes that was good did you see that the um the uh television awards this week joe likes it there's lots of good things actually swimming while sort of there's one and joe lycee he won an award for his own show then he won also best presenter for the great british sunday right how exciting is that made it into a sewing award into a tv award uh right janet is asking what needles should i order for the couture course so i would suggest um the tulip uh basting needles um and also they're called quilt basically needles yeah and then some of the standard sewing is we normally have a salty but we have at the moment so i normally use number eight size eight um so needle size size eight for couture two lipsticks lorna is asking on instagram assume if i have a waist dart and when you lower the apex it interferes with this you might just reduce the size of the waist yeah yeah so keep it the same width but just reduce the height of it longer yeah absolutely suzanne can i use viscose linen for the hep burn dress yes i would think so that'll be lovely because the viscose makes it a bit more drapey um yeah that would be lovely suzanne for the hepburn debbie claire is that the makes the telly sundress behind you it is debbie yes this is the megatelly sundress which we're going to be making so long on tuesday um it's a lovely dress so he's gonna have those needles also amy yeah is it the quilt basting ones you need suzanne or the sewing ones or both though amy needs to i need to find them do you want this one oh yeah you've been right on the back of my hair oh thank you this can be my taking orders page okay yes what did you want both suzanne yeah it's gonna be lovely making this dress that i made the sleeveless version here and i made it in white uh white crinkled double gauze so i did line it but i probably won't line the one i'm making on tuesday so i've just got a pin which ones are the number eight sewing needle that's the uh general sewing needle so yeah tulip sewing needles and then it will say eight yeah um if you get a box down there is a code on them i mean eight seven eight or nine will all be just as good they're just very minutely different thicknesses eight to the middle of the range nine are a bit bit shorter i think the nines are a bit shorter the eights are nice because it seems to be the slightly sharp tip uh do they say sharp tip on them yes yes they do yeah so we normally have assaulted but then when i you know at home i've got a sorted packet but i tend to find the middle the middle uh size i use a lot which are the um number eights so that's the tulip slowly needles we are getting some more sorted in but we're just waiting yes um annie on instagram says she's bought some lovely salmon pink linen to make a wrap dress but it's heavier weight than she'd expected are there certain patterns that might be better than others i was going to make the wild wood oh if it's if it's heavier it's the wild what's wrong with the tears isn't it um i know it's the wrap joke that's the wilder i was just trying to think this thing is with it it's like if it's slightly heavier annie you want one that hasn't really got too many um things like pleats or gathers that sort of thing so i'm trying to think that there's a vote quite a nice vogue one that one that i made just very quiet no that was vogue i think it i mentioned it last night yes because sally's made it as well i can't search it because both phones being used but yes basically you'll want one that hasn't got too many gathers or um please i'm just trying to think of the one that i've got that's it's a it's a vogue pattern but i kind of what number is i have to think on that one annie well we'll get back to you we'll put it we'll put a um we'll um put some ideas up on the facebook page if you uh join midhurst sowers annie if you're not already on it um we often post hints and tips on there as well so um we'll put some on there julie if i place an order online order am i able to collect after the 12th please rather than post so i can look for other things yeah of course you can jilly and he says thanks that's helpful i'll have a look too yeah that's the main thing i just can't remember like i tend to make a lot of the best atelier wrap dresses which are stretched so that's no help at all there's a new paper cut pattern one which is a wrap um but it's got big it's got quite big full sleeves i don't think that would go with a heavier linen uh suzanne's asking please can you go through the different weights of jersey fabric and what they are suitable for on one of the lives i get it wrong sometimes yeah it's really difficult with with um weight weights of fabric suzanne but yeah i have got some different ones you could go through and i'll have a look but uh the top the difficult thing is that different fabric shops call things different and i don't i don't work on ounces of fabrics it's got to be on fill hasn't it's a lightweight medium weight heavy weight it's really difficult and different fabric shops call them different things um so yeah we'll have a little look oh jenna's placed her order i might have something else to show you janet [Laughter] did you get the link for the full bus adjustment workshop janet i think i said that just after this one is class um cezanne's saying stitch fabrics catherine sorry uh um so i'll be very fine cotton almost muslin to line very fine cotton fabric but i can't find it for the tunic class um it sounds like it should be like a cotton lawn cotton for this unit class i have very fine silk cotton with the outside recommendations for the lining underlining yeah cut lawn i would say definitely muslin's a little bit fine and double gauze can be hit is a bit coarse so yes i would say cotton lawn would be lovely for that catherine for underlining and you can get it i i always have white white or black here um which we use for all sorts of things but underlining victoria's got quite a few colors i think she calls them others she calls them cotton voile v-o-i-l-e oh does she yeah she's got a mixture of while and lawn tough very good of you yeah thank you just janet it's always nice to be sending things out uh helen it's the new pattern company called trend yes trent they've been going for quite a while trend patterns and we always i always chat with her at the shows um but uh yeah i haven't done i haven't made anything here in the sewing room yes i think we should do a sew along or a class with some trend patterns because they are lovely really nice catherine says thank you you're welcome very welcome yeah good cotton um i was gonna say something else then i completely forgot it's gone out of my head it's gone out on my head yeah summer sun next week we have the sun dress so long sorry where did you go then i don't know i don't know the busy week i kind of think what i was thinking of what are we doing this week tuesday we're doing the sundress which is the mega telly pattern here and then wednesday and thursday we're doing the papercut patterns um private pants which i've got to finish my twirl off this week because i've read a few reviews and a few of the reviews saying there's not enough ease in the seat anything like that so i'll make a 12 so we can all work on those this week i will be carrying on with our shirt dress on wednesday and then we have the dungarees merchandise dungarees class starting on thursday evening so it's very busy next week lots of things going on so do you want to come in and show us your comments yeah yeah so he's going to pop in now can you move along sorry i need to move over [Music] that's good i thought it was something serious you need to check behind the camera today so amy's going to pop in today amy's got her lovely new skirt on today i do i didn't have anything to wear on the top so it's just um this is topshop although you have made one of those i have made one of these but i couldn't it's a bit it's in a thick jersey i've got another one um so this is my skirt everybody um i made it in mine's a short one i made it in a pu faux leather um there we go i know jeans is her first face mask was from train patterns yeah they're good aren't they her patterns and she sells all the haberdashery and the elastics and the thing as well um so yeah amy's um amy scott's lovely yeah when you ordered it didn't you i ordered it quite a bit so oh it's built something on it already luckily it's white lovely it's like clean yeah um i altered it quite a lot the fabric didn't really like uh the front darts it just didn't work and it made the skirt sort of kick out into an a-line shape so i actually um took the darts out and then i cut straight down the middle when i measured it and i did two seams down the front and you top stitch together and i've top stitch i then pressed it open and top stitch down each side of the seam so they've got please stand up again okay can you see me now stay down okay it's actually a bit big it's a bit bigger isn't it i think it might have stretched so it's a bit it moves around a bit we've got a nice deep hem on it as well yeah i put a big deep hair onto the hands to there yeah this fabric was really easy to work with and i'd say for anybody if you do use it i have to do i did all my top stitching from the ins from the wrong side because i wanted to get it make sure that my seams were flat because they spring open but um i'm glad i did because it punctured the fabric so from the wrong side you had i had all these little white holes so if i'd done my top stitching from the right side the white part would have been there dude do you have to line it i didn't like this one because the back of it is a fabric it's like a just a sip i don't know what it is some sort of fabric do that how did you do the canvassing let you just machine them didn't you yeah i overlapped around the bottom and then i just pressed up and top stitched round thank you jay so when you're pressing with this sort of fabric you have to you can press this pleather but you do have to be a bit careful so i normally suggest using something like a canvas pressing cloth so like heavier pressing cloth and a bit of steam and then using a clapper that's what i usually worked really well it did work yeah it worked fine on the darts the seams just kept bouncing back so i'd already decided i wanted to do that double top stitch yeah design detail but i would have had to if not um or i'd have had to overlock it or i'd have to press to one side or something so you do top stitch it down you can glue seams that's great yeah it's really nice the other thing i use when i'm working with leather sometimes i use like you know the little rollers you get for doing wallpaper oh yeah i wonder what they were in the when we pot for leather jacket we use those i forgot to say those thanks i did use a leather needle um because it's got like a the tip of a leather needle was like a triangle isn't it it's like a little dart and or like an arrow at the end of an arrow so it pierces through so that was good yeah it was easy i've got two other colors so i'm excited now to make stuff in the other two colors i was hoping to have got two done yesterday but then i had to do on pick bits and stuff yeah because you did the seams in the front pocket on but it isn't quite square oh no that's the linton one well it was a practice one and i did i just sent you quite a small piece didn't i so we're only making like four inch pockets so quite smooth yeah oh i would say one thing with this fabric when if anybody decides to go for it once you've decided that's your seam and you press it if you then want to unpick that seam you can't do that well you can do it but the pu glues itself together with the heat of the iron sometimes i'm like peeled it's quite funny luckily it's all being enclosed in my new scene and also it's like if you're taking insulin but you can't un-pick it and re-stitch because the holes are visible so unless you're taking it in yeah which i'm definitely going to have to do jan's going to make calico dungarees [Laughter] you can make your jungles out of anything you like jan okay i'm doing silk i'm doing frescoes yeah yeah yeah and i think jamie's doing deadly ones and so it's wendy so yeah yeah well yes today's cocktail was a request a special request from joe we're gonna have uh jan says bed sheet then uh we're having harvey wallbangers today because joe requested requested it last week myself and of course versus her friend and of course everybody has a bottle of galliano in the back of the table and they have no idea why in fact actually this bottle was um my aunt emma or carolyn says tie dye the calico that's a good idea oh yeah my aunt uh emma donated this to me the other night so i couldn't remember if i had one got home and we did have one so we had a mini one but i thought i'd bring the big one because this is the original so nice yeah a big bottle of galliano the reason you're always left with a big bottle much like the saint jermaine that i had for the other week um you only use the teeniest little amount joe oh my friend's special birthday next week cocktail party perfect oh margaret says harvey wool bangers are my favorite well that's good excellent um so yeah galliano it's a vanilla flavored liqueur um i'm sure everyone already knows how to make this but we're gonna go for it anyway i they're supposed to be in a straight glass but the ones we've got here are really small all colored so i decided we're gonna go for the copper gin glasses but i'll just turn it around so it doesn't say bright and gentle there's no gin in there so we're going to have big glasses yeah we have got quite a few glasses here we didn't have those ones differently does it matter how old the guarana is no it's not going to go off it's um all right pretty sugary pretty high oh it's 30 so no i'm sure it'll be fine it's not like the only things i would say drink within a certain amount are things like baileys and tea maria anything cream-based don't drink those if you've had them in the cupboard for over i think it's nine months uh you shouldn't drink those um which i think my nan always finds quite pleasingly she has to finish the bottle yes yeah i'm sure this is very old i'm pretty sure emma hasn't bought this recently no just call it mature yeah i'm sure the flavor gets better yeah now as with any spirits you can have a bottle of vodka in the cupboard for 20 years i'm sure it'd be fine um so you need vodka galliano orange juice from tesco's but other brands are available and you need an orange for garnish and uh you need traditionally it's marachino cherries i couldn't get any they're quite difficult to get hold of you can get them on amazon my favorite brand is luxado they come in a little jar luxado maracino cherries i just couldn't get them in time for today so if i'd ordered them today they would have come next week so have a look if you can get them maracino cherries you can use glossy cherries but the maracino ones are really delicious so in your glass this is a build it in the glass drinks for ages everyone's shaking today they're sort of like oblong this is my new ice cube tray that everyone amazon i'm very pleased with because they just pop out of the tray right so nice quite a lot of icing lots of nice lovely day here today actually um we then want it's a shot and a half so uh 25 it's like 37.5 ml you could do a double if you're at home just do a double that's like a trade standard because we're not allowed to serve more than 50 mils so you could say a double shot of vodka i'm going to do that's just a little bit under i'll do us the trade standard because we've got to drive later on yeah okay here goes your vodka you then are going to do three shots so 150 ml of orange juice does it matter if it's smooth or it doesn't matter it would be nice bitty but um smooth would be better so three shots of orange juice three double shots 150 nails okay and then comes the galliano bit i meant to give my other little shot measure but it's fine because i can just wipe this out because this is why shots shot measures have another end oh that's most of you if you use that yeah that's a little shallow bit this one isn't actually that accurate most of them have on this end a 12.5 mil measure which is a half a shot this one's a little bit less i might need to do two but basically what you do i don't know if i'll be able to actually a bit small so i'm gonna do it in here you basically do half a shot so 12.5 mils of galliano and you just slowly like this might be difficult it should float on top i might have to put the thingy in and just pour it so that it floats on top of the orange juice and it would look better in a tumbler to be honest because it would separate um yeah separated a bit has it yeah you don't want to pour it from a height because it won't do the separation yeah sort of there we go and then you get your orange and with an orange i always cut a segment and then i do a diagonal line cut through the flesh so you end up with a little talky bit and you can stick it on your butt technical term talk a bit talk a bit it's like a mouth oh yeah you know i said that that's really funny there we go that looks lovely there's your heartbeat and then you would put a cherry in as well we don't have cherries oh cheers cheers that's a lovely summery looking drink yeah i'm going to knock myself out with a lemon oh yeah that's nice with the vanilla yeah yeah that's love that's a really nice thing stepping up your screwdriver that's what that is and then of course you can put your orange in is that a screwdriver yeah pretty much it's one of those uh you're welcome joe it's screwdriver is one of those cocktails that bartenders like it's not a cocktail it's just a bucket it's like a cuba libra that's a running pack don't need to put a name on a ramen coat it is really lovely jackie it's really nice yeah that's very nice one and i do how long does open galliano last i think i'm sure i mean that tastes perfect yeah it's nice and this will have been actually there's a recipe for a harvey wool banger on the back ah the same as yours uh no they use more galliano they actually say you can have it served on ice or with um cranberry juice it doesn't say on there when uh i've [Music] that just last forever it's just like having you know a whiskey or a brandy or a yeah saint jermaine or something yeah there's always a spirit that's in the back of the cupboard for years oh that's nice it's just so nice that little sort of tang of vanilla it's lovely yeah and you can smell it have you not had a healthy movement i don't think i have one i better screw you they're very simple to make really who says i said for 25 years claire i have a bottle of 25 year old oh how have you kept tequila for 25 years well that's going to be a fun evening that gets opened uh margaret i was just working out that mine's 18 years i love this let's all drink our ancient galliano yeah i didn't eat i don't think i even knew it was vanilla i thought we thought about what it didn't even think what it was no it's just it would have been you buy it for something at some point for a party or a dinner sometimes it's a recipe for a cake or whatever yeah this thing and now you can get small bottles of it but obviously originally you were stuck and the most annoying thing about it doesn't fit in the cupboard it's so tall so it doesn't fit in the alcohol cupboard it's fine yeah it's very pretty and it's tasty yeah it's lovely squanas means two worms don't know claire oh margaret's saying that she missed the beginning would you stand up and show us something yeah again is it supposed to be vanilla that would be my clue if it's okay yeah yes it is it's supposed to be vanilla e yeah it's got a vanilla taste lovely there we go there we go margaret let's keep going spin all the way around you can't see the back okay see the back there looks lovely and this is my skirt this is the um this is my oh my still got a tucking thread oh yeah there we go taylor's attack this is the um the uh skirt we made on thursday as well suzanne says she thinks they have loads of spirits and liqueurs in the garage they're over 30 years old still taste nice yeah of course they will yeah oh sorry there we go so there you go yes it's really nice really nice um uh market the main thing we found with this jacket is check the arm with because i actually made mine bigger on the arm but most people do as well in fact quite a few people did to make it bigger on the arms because it's quite it's quite narrow here joe says that's where she found her galliano she had to clean the carriage i had to clean the bottle yeah this one was a bit dusty when emma gave it to me actually must look the fabric yes have it with a bit of body that's all you need although you could underline it if it's not quite thick enough so it's a great jacket very pleased with it so that's that's what we've got for you this week yeah yeah it is you've been through everything i've been everything through everything on my list so we're looking forward to next week lots of as i say lots of nice the new s and retreat pages that we've done as well yeah um yeah couture retreat is now live if anybody does look at the consumer tree yes that's right um it looks a bit confusing the way the hotel can we take over the whole hotel basically that's what that's the package that we do so the residential uh packages are split up based on the room type that you booked because they have four different because they have different they have feature bedrooms they have which have you know big some of them have roll top bars and four posters and then they have uh the classic bedrooms and then they have tower rooms and the tower rooms are literally in turrets there are two of them so they're great and they're you know beautiful rooms but you need to be prepared to go up a tiny little staircase so they're on separately just so um if people don't mind that great the views up there were amazing the views are lovely we have to say anybody with mobility issues or vertigo not not for you but um yeah just so there you go and then there's obviously a non-road there's a twin option there's only i think two twin rooms at the hotel and a non-residential option as well which we only can only take four non-residential so there you are so lovely okay i have to go i was enjoying my drink yes it's very nice yeah we've got lots of work to do this afternoon with our drinks so thank you so much for joining us again this is always lovely to catch up with you on a friday oh hang on we just got a question on instagram um from flower hi claire i've booked i'm not sure

basket of bloom stamp set this little one says hello i don't think i've put anything on the inside oh just hello and some more stamping and i did that one but i thought it would be great to have a happy easter on there it would make quite a nice bright spring easter card so we made that one and we made this one using the same set two sets so this is the basket of blooms set and this one is the not blossoms in bloom i was getting them mixed up bloom something you've been cutting down brambles oh mum please don't do too much will you and hurt yourself i know it's that time of year where we all want to get in the garden don't we and we all want to get everything done and i have been out and mowed the front lawn and done some weeding but that's as far as i've got um bloom and grow i knew it would come back to me that little it's backwards but it says you are simply wonderful is yes it's always back to front on the live there's probably a way hang on i don't know if that does it let me see oh no that gives me lots of options that i don't want there is a way but when i turn the camera around and you see me crafting you'll see it the right way around so yeah but uh that says you are simply wonderful and they were a bit of fun and we made those at coffee and cards on tuesday but i've got some news um stampin up news hello joe lovely of you to join us as well how are you is your day been okay are you feeling any better because i know having that vaccine is all wonderful and it's what we're all grateful for but it can knock us for six sometimes so a little bit of stamping up news we have a special on today for one day only it started at about 11 p.m last night till 11 p.m tonight and we've got free shipping so we've got free postage and packing on all orders of 35 pounds or over so i thought i'd come in tonight and share that with you um in case you didn't see that and let you know so that if there's anything on your wish list you could save yourself some money and you don't have to pay your postage and packing so yeah but that does end at 11 o'clock tonight so but i would get your ordering by about 10 30 if you're choosing to do that good evening shirley lovely to have you thanks for your pictures shirley's been sending me some uh photos of her walks and they're amazing oh well done well done carol you've got your order in you're going to craft tomorrow joe just give yourself time there's no pressure is there you'll feel so much better soon i love seeing the photos you put on of your birds and your dogs it's fabulous i've been trying to get some photos of birds out of my window i've got the bird table over there um and we've always got robins on it we get a few all sorts we get um great tits um i'm not sure what the other ones are we got big ones magpies and we get uh pigeons i think we've had bull finches but i'm not sure every time i take a photo it's not that great linda i got your order thank you so very much that's very kind of used place in order uh you'll be very excited won't you when all your goodies come never get you at your craft spot so yeah i'm going to be crafting tonight with the mini catalogue this one this is the mini this is what we used to call the spring summer and that's what we've got it's called the mini catalog january to june mini um catalog i'm just going to quickly talk to you about the catalogues before i crack on it's very quick i won't bore you um this is the big book this is the annual catalogue and this one runs until the third of may so this one finishes at the end of april beginning of may and the new one launches on may the third so the reason i'm telling you this because next week we get the retiring list the retiring list hi anthony the retiring list is everything in this big book that won't carry over next year and that comes out a week today on the 24th of march um and i don't know before you do we all get the same information at the same time the big long list of what's retiring and what's carrying over now the reason i'm telling you this is because it then goes on it's then when it's gone it's gone so when stocks are gone you can't get it anymore so if there's anything that you want in this big book um you need to place an order and get it i don't know what's carrying over until next week but if you worry that something isn't near your eye on something grab it before it's gone get your free shipping on it today if you want to do that or wait until the retirement list comes out but i wouldn't hesitate um if i was you so and then demonstrators next wednesday the same day as the retirement list comes out we get to see a pdf of the new catalogue oh pretty peacock yeah you can let it go now anthony because you've got lots it's your favorite isn't it i love pretty peacock um yeah and i'll talk about those in colors in a second yeah so we get to see the new catalog pdf which is so exciting and then on the first of april demonstrators get to pre-order so we can order some things from that new catalog and then on the 3rd of may it gets live to customers so when that pre-order happens on the 1st of april i'll be able to order all my catalogs and send them out to my customers as soon as i get them so i'm hoping that i should get them and then send them out to you guys as soon as i can so hopefully they'll come to you before the catalog goes live on the third of may so you can get to see all the goodies in there and that's the idea um yeah so as soon as i get them you'll get them so if anyone has shopped with me in the last year i will send you a catalogue if well if you would like a catalog or would like to shop with me and would like a catalog send me an email and i'll send you one out easy as that now the thing about the in colors that anthony was just talking about the pretty peacock let me show you i have got my little swatch i keep a swatch i make all the stampin up colors here these are our color families and we've got the brights we've got the subtles and we've got the regals and we've got the neutrals and then on the back i have got the in colors these are the 2019 to 2021 in colors and these are the ones that are retiring next week on wednesday so we've got rococo rose terracotta tile pretty peacock which is anthony's favorite hi louise rococo rose is the one that joe got today or yesterday this is anthony's favorite this one i was using at coffee and cards on tuesday and then this is one of my favorite seaside spray and then we've got purple posey now when that retirement list goes live that is what goes literally by a couple of hours in the morning all of the cardstock and the re-inkers and the ink pads of these will be gone from the store and that's the reason why i'm telling you so if you have any of these if you have the ink pads you won't be able to get the reinkers unless you order them soon so you get them on the day they retire or now with free shipping because they'll go out they're the first things to go and i always get see size spray is gorgeous isn't it i always get customers saying i wanted that reinker and i can't get it and i can't get it either i i can't you know once they're gone they're gone so get your ring because if you have got these these uh ink pads and you want them or even if you just like the colors and you want them get them before they're gone get the matching cardstock to go with it and anything else you want that matches so there's a heads up for you next wednesday they'll be on retiring lists definitely because they are the outgoing colors and we get to see the new colors that are coming in we still got our 20 to 20 to 20 22 colors they're still current until next year yes i'm putting an order in louise absolutely has to be done it'd be rude not to wouldn't it little cheeky little one that goes in your basket why wouldn't we so now i've told you about the catalogues i'll be sending those out when i get them hopefully the middle of april hashtag get your in colors early absolutely this catalogue will stay until june so you've still got a couple of months of that one so that's all good and i'm going to be using something from this catalogue tonight i'm going to be using the pretty perennials just to make a quick card who else is putting an order in today tell me or are you all got loads right the fun part now is me turning this camera around so i'm going to try and do that because i've got it really exactly where i want you so i don't have to hold the camera but the fun part is turning it around so i'm really sorry it's a bit clunky i'll try my best i had to readjust the whole tripod so i'm sorry we'll just give it a go oh definitely you know what if you want um blends cardstock glue adhesive and you know that you're going to want it why not get a free postage and packing why not why not indeed right i am going to take it out of the tripod here we go the fun bit will be me getting the tripod back around i'm going to put you down [Music] i think we're getting there oh i absolutely love seaside spray and i was a bit annoyed with myself joe because i went to re-ink my seaside spray this evening and i don't have the reincar i am very happy and excited tonight carol i don't know i sometimes get a bit like that usually over paper crafting goodies um yeah i went to ink my seaside spray this evening and i don't have the reinker now the only advice i can give you about that kind of thing is don't do as i do do as i say when you buy your ink pad buy the reinker at the same time they're very inexpensive and then you will always have it even if that color retires you will have your reinker and you don't know when your impact ink pad is going to run out until it's run out and then that's when you need it and if you want to then order it and wait it's a bit of a nuisance right let's bring that around how is that is that any good the light is not great is it i don't normally craft in the dark these days how is that is that all right i can't tell what the light is doing is it light enough would you let me know i know wasn't it so i've got the highland heather out because it's a bit similar so i picked some colors out tonight and the way i picked my colors to use was i got that swatch out that i make i make one of these and give them to my team members when they join me so i got this one out because i didn't know what colors to use and i was having a little peruse and i picked out petal pink so sapphire on a soft seafoam to start with and then i realized actually my petal pink wasn't showing up enough as an ink color so i swapped it out for blushing bride the light is okay oh thank you thanks so much that's good news auntie's just joined us okay so this is my palette and i popped in the highland heather just to give it a little bit of added interest so i just thought i'd go for the subtles in fact interestingly the petal pink i swapped out for the blushing bride the hallowed heather is in there so these are all subtle so they we know they go together because they're in the same color family oh i feel like i'm talking a lot i had a lot of caffeine today you might have noticed alfie says hello [Music] so i absolutely love this bundle this is pretty perennials i love it you might have noticed i use it a lot and i thought i'd use it tonight as well so i've got the stamps i've got the dies i've taken some of the diesel that i'm using but i'm only using literally a few i've got four of the dyes out and there's lots in there yes i read a christmas card with this the other day can you believe that good evening shirley oh hi jew that's lovely i won't be on here for terribly long so i'm glad you managed to find me thank you or had time to join me so i've picked out four of the dies that we're going to use right okay let's have a bit of fun yeah i don't know what i did with that card i put it away if i can't find it i won't keep looking no i have to find it i need a christmas card for the christmas blog hop that i'm part of which is a bit bizarre isn't it but it's interesting because it was a real challenge to show how you can use something that's definitely not christmassy but for christmas okay so here is my colors that i have used i have got so saffron yes i know anthony honestly it's a monthly blog hop so it's not like i'm getting ready for christmas in january or february but um i was invited to it in january and i thought it was a an invitation a facebook group invitation i'd received late so i got it in january and then i realized it was intentional and every month we make a christmas card for this blog hop and it's just a bit of fun to be fair so yeah sorry i have so saffron card base i've got a bit of basic white for my layer inside i have got the blushing bride layer and then my whisper white is on the top okay now i'm going to do a little bit of a dry embossing with this one now i've got my embossing folder i picked up this one this is the subtlest one you can just about see it's got kind of a texture i don't know if you can see it yes that's exactly right is it okay if it's a blog hop to actually do a christmas card i've never done a christmas card early before so um most people will tell you i'm not you know i'm not a christmas crafter in the wrong time of the year but uh yeah it's great fun to be honest to do it at the wrong time of the year so i'm just changing my place i've got my stampin cutting emboss next to me and i am going to run it through i don't know if i should put it on the desk i think i might have to change the height of my tripod if i bring it in so you can actually see it a little bit right okay so we've got our base plate i'm gonna put this one in make sure it's in the folder straight um it's a big thick dynamic one so i'm slightly veering from the sandwich recipe that is here so if you think that's a little bit different that'll be why so i'm just putting one of my acrylic plates in with it and passing it through sorry it's making you move so you can see how my stamping up cutting and embossing machine works and it comes out beautifully can you see the texture in that let me hold it straight how is that it's lovely it looks like the old-fashioned basil cardstock i love it all right let's move this out of the way the thing i like about this this machine is that you can lift these up and it folds up flat how cool is that isn't it it's fab i've got it on a little trolley next to me a little holds lots of things and it's very handy it's one of those ones i got mine from hobbycraft you've got the same ones in ikea so you might know which i mean right okay so i've got that that's my embossed layer so i don't need my embossing folder i can get that out of the way i put my other mats back in did you know if you get one of these these come clear and lovely these these cutting plates they're pristine when you have them and then when you do a cut it cuts into the plate they are a consumable item um i thought you know this was because i've been using mine for years and i it didn't even occur to me but some somebody on my team bought one and she was concerned that she'd made marks on it so it's worth knowing that this does get very mocked and it is a consumable that embossing powder is called the subtles the subtles embossing folder might be in here let's see here they all are it is called subtle 3d and it's right there in the middle on page 185 the subtle one it's really good it's really useful one okay so that's going to layer on there i'm actually going to stamp on here after i've embossed now normally i would stamp and then emboss because i always think it'd be quite difficult to stamp on an embossed piece but i tried it earlier and it worked and it may be just because it's very subtle you know it's not very indented but it worked so i'm going to go for it so let's get my stamp out now i'm going to use this lovely big happy let's make sure it's clean just get it clean because i was using it earlier on hey helen how are you jim's got his vaccine on friday is that tomorrow no that's tomorrow's thursday isn't it jim's got his vaccine on friday that's exciting so there'll be two adults in the house who've had it that is exciting i've got blue on there how is that i haven't even had the glue out yet there we are so that's really exciting hi maria so i'm gonna stamp the big happy this is one of my favorite stamps in this stamp set and i'm gonna stamp it near the bottom but i'm gonna leave room for birthday cause it's gonna be a birthday card it doesn't have to be that's just what i chose it to be you can make this card anything you like because it's just a floral card you can see it still shows up even though i've embossed it so there's a hint for you you don't actually have to do it that way around so if you forget to stamp and you emboss it you can still go back in because that's what i did birthday and this is where i swapped out the petal pink and my original decision because the birthday didn't show up so i'm going for blushing bride and i think this would be a bit better yes i'm really happy that jim has got the date for his vaccine that's really exciting see that shows up quite well happy birthday okay so we've got those all right and now i have got these dies and i'll show you i've cut some out already just to save a little bit of time so this big lovely frond all the bits are still left in there look i have cut out this one and that is out of the soft seafoam color i cut that one out and i only want one and if you want to get those bits out you can just use your pick tool and they'll pop out and you can put them in the bin like that so that's that one all the bits now and then i cut some of the others out so i cut this one out out of so saffron that one and i used that one to cut that one out so those are done and then i did the same with those same dies in the oh is that pink that might be petal pink because that's how i designed it i think it'll be fine i don't think it'll matter so um there we go so those are in the petal pink or blushing bride whichever you use and then i'm going to do a little bit of stamping and i'm going to cut this stamped image out you both had your vaccine dude oh brilliant jude i'm very pleased for you that's great news it is reassuring isn't it don't you just feel a little bit better knowing that that's good news right i just need to grab some white cards i've got quite a lot of my scraps out next to me always useful this one will do and this big flower image sorry my arm's in the way isn't it right so i'm going to clean that because i've been playing with these stamps i need to make sure they're the right colors on them so i'm going to stamp in so saffron it's kind of lovely yellow isn't it and i'm quickly stamping the pink in the blushing bride as well yeah i was saying about um joe's birds joe uh posts pictures on her facebook every morning and she often posts pictures of the birds in her garden i never managed to get really good photos like she does i must keep trying and it's quite nice just to uh work out what they are so i'm just going to work out which way up this die goes just swivel it around and it'll pop into place i may move it more than once is that right not quite is it ah let's keep going it's not that it's not that how many times have i been round now let's have a look at it i think it's that that's it look perfect so i've got a piece of washi tape i like to stick mine down like that stop it moving about once it gets in the die cutting machine it's trial and error to be honest with the birds okay yes i must sit there i think i'm a little bit impatient and i'm like always hurrying off to do something but i think i need to sit quietly because obviously if i move they can see and they fly away so i'm not there for too long and i think i need to be a bit more patient so i've cut out the pink one let's cut out the yellow one so saffron you can see how it fits exactly when you get it right you know it's right once it's there and to have a good tip for you if you i don't want to work out which way up it should go you can put a little sharpie marker dot on the back of your uh flower and then line up the dye um on the stamp i mean then you can line up the dye and put a little sharpie marker dot where it lines up on the back of the die of a permanent marker and then you'll always be able to line it up with it working it out you do get a nice selection of birds though joe don't you do you put out any special bird seed is it kind of posh bird seed so i've got my flowers and i'm going to layer them up i've got my glue i've just been buying tesco bird seed but maybe i should be buying something a little bit more exotic just a little dot on the back um is there anybody on there live tonight from overseas be nice to know what kind of birds you get in your gardens there we are let's put the little one i like the little one i think this stamp and die bundle is great value now do i offset it i think i'll just leave it like that that suits doesn't it right let's do the same with this one just layer them up it's very simple and you don't need very much glue just enough to show it and i like to just do it in the middle because then it lets the petals move about i think it's probably better to line that up like that oh i've got those that's good i've got those kind of bird seeds oh and i'm quite happy that the squirrels seem to have gone i mean we had a whole posse for weeks and weeks on end you wouldn't believe it unless you saw it six of them every day the dog was going berserk they haven't been around for three or four days maybe a bit longer than that right so we got that that's not lined up is it there so we've got those got our flowers made so i'm going to put this on here and decide where it's all going to go and i can hide my stem behind there so i think i'm just going to stick the stem down mum you put birdseed out don't you i think shirley's on their life um shirley um brought me some lump had delivered me some lovely lemon curd on tuesday she's been making it amazing i've got a nice recipe for i think it's from tesco's magazine for making little cakes with lemon curd inside like lemon meringue cakes so i will have a go and if it's any good i'll let you all know what i need some dimensionals here they are right um i think i'm going to put the yellow one flat just put a little bit of glue on the back and i'm going to pop up the pink so it's so easy with these dies to make a really pretty card you don't have to emboss i just sort of gave a bit of interest and just pick those colors out and match up your cardstock to your um inks cheap from home and bargains do you get lots of nice birds then i bet you do where you are bit of glue there we go happy birthday that one there and i think we will add a couple of jewels on there i'm running out that needs to go on my order and i gotta make sure i get it in on time what time is it ladies i got until oh i think i use the big ones i've got until um um for free postage and packing i think i want to get it in by half past 10 just in case so i think we're good let's only be about half a state or something you have a 10 feeders suet pellet sunflower hearts and sunflower seeds if you're the bird the bird i can't read it all it's kind of stuck in my tripod i will read all the comments there i think that really finishes off the front of that card that's so nice i like that now where's my middle piece did i just stamp on it oh no here it is this would not have surprised me if i had so i think what i'm going to do is do a little bit of stamping in the middle so where's the stamp set and then where's the happy so we've got the happy and i'll just swap around so i do the yellow happy i think i'll do the pink happy inside there we go and then i'll take out hmm so you don't mislead this oh no i haven't here it is sending lots of so i'll do that in the yellow in the so saffron color i can't wait to find out what our new colors are going to be i'm really excited anyone got any ideas i've got a feeling they're going to be bold we have been given a hint that we are going to have bold in colors this year i'm quite excited it gives us a lot lots of fun to play with sending lots of and it just fits in between there the loop of the h and the y oh i made a splodge you can't see that splodge can you no oh dear oh dear do you think do you know what though anthony you know when they do a um every sort of five or six years they do a little reshuffle of all the colors just to make sure they're all on trend um i'll bet that'll be one that they'll bring back in the future i'll bet you any money that will be what they'll bring back it'll be that pretty peacock it's so beautiful i think it's a really popular color i'm hoping they do with the the seafoam i think we need a bit of flour in there just a little bit i can't remember what color i stamped it in there we are it's clean i have a pink one and then we'll pop it in and that will be completed the dog just sighed he loves being in here he's more settled in the evening than he is in the day because he can't see out the window and you bark at people going by there we go sending lots of happy let's put that in there i'm not going to worry about my little pink bit the last oh the last reshuffle i was trying to think about when it was um the other day now i was at an on stage convention and i want to say we were in amsterdam uh which is a stampin up yearly big convention where they launch all the new products i think it was 2017 or 2018 it was one of the two we're not due another one for a couple of years at least so we've got sending lots of happy inside and then i've got that one on the front happy birthday so there's our first card made with the pretty perennials so if you like this you can buy it as a bundle and you can buy them together so if you buy a stamp set and a die set together as a bundle you save 10 percent if you want to buy them separately they're just yeah you can they're just a different item code that is worth knowing uh i think it's on page 31. so page 31 pretty perennial so the stamp set is only 17 pounds that's in there and that's the code on the bottom and then you can buy the dies they're 30 pounds so you can buy them separately because they would stand alone really well but if you buy them as a bundle that's the item code and you save ten percent so if you put that item code in and that item code in they would not save you ten percent just you need to use that one so that's worth knowing about okay let's move that out of the way i'm gonna make one more card right here we are um where is the little bits i've got out ready here it is oh i've got the envelope so we mustn't forget those here we go so i'm going for the same color combination very simple very easy and i thought we'd do a little bit of stamping i'm not using the dies so not using the die so i just thought you could see what it's like if you just have the stamps you can use it on its own so i am going i'm not even going to emboss this one i'm going to take the happy and i'm going to go for this highlight heather color i was very happy though when they had the reshuffle it was very odd because we saw loved colors leave but then we saw some absolutely stunning colors come in and we saw a few favorite in colors from years past that had proved very popular come back into the mix so that was really nice and it's exciting happy birthday they don't do it very often it's every few years just to make them really make sure they're still sort of on trend what people want so i am going to stamp the happy birthday or happy right here can you see it i can't see what your view is in that gorgeous color and then i think i'm gonna do the birthday in the blushing bride if anyone can tell me whether it was 2017 or 2018 coastal cabana how did you know i was acutely aware a couple of weeks ago that i had been using it constantly coastal cabana and bermuda bay and so i've kind of given my ink pads a rest i absolutely love those colors happy birthday so mint macaron was an old retired in color and that came back in the reshuffle a few years ago and everyone was very happy so happy birthday okay so we've got that now i'm going to do a little bit of stamping with the flowers from this stamp set and i have also got this piece of grid paper that i'm using to save my big one just a little bit save the planet right let's do it i'm going to bring this one out you're so polite right let's go for it and i'm randomly stumping now not i know random isn't for everyone but be brave because it's just a bit of fun it's all good um i think i'm gonna bring it in the middle in the middle at the top that might have been a mistake it's fine all right let's put the lid on that one and then i'm going to clean that stamp i'm going to use it with a pink same pink as we've been using welcome everyone i'm glad you're joining me tonight for this impromptu live now my facebook friday live i was explaining at coffee and cards on tuesday would always be obviously on friday it's a facebook friday um but we have a birthday in the house this week so jacob is 14 on friday so tomorrow i'll be back instead so yeah tomorrow's uh going to be facebook live instead of friday oh yeah look at that that is so pretty and then up here like that so we've got those colors let's just stick my finger in it remove those okay and then i'm gonna come in with let's see i can come in with a soft seafoam but i'm going to come in with the so saffron as well pretty colors aren't they helen i love them right i'm gonna use some of this yellow and just fill in some of this space like so and all it is is a little bit of simple stamping like that i might come back with that and a leaf and i did get a leaf stamp out oh i think i just dropped that one never yeah i have it it was alive yes i'm doing a live tomorrow as well i was just like oh it's a free shipping day let's do a spontaneous live just maybe inspire people if they uh you know let them know that they can get their free postage and packing with any orders they place today or tonight so i just thought that would be a bit why not and i'm gonna do my regular one tomorrow because i get to escape everything else and come on here and talk to you lovely people this is just a little bit of that green i don't know if you can see that in there breaking it up a little bit see where else i'm going to put something here i think i'll put that right there nearly stuck it in the wrong ink color there we are and then we need a couple more of these big yellow one right here yes now i need to decide am i going to make the centers of my flowers black do you know what i think i'm going to be brave and go for it so i've got my memento ink i think mine needs to be inking oh let's take that stamp off there see this really uh brings the flower alive that's what i'm trying to say see how that makes it pop oh what have i missed what happened there what have i missed what's blowing your mind i need to have my mind blown no lock down here but it's still thursday days of the week don't exist anymore hashtag lockdown absolutely oh thank you sylvia what time is it there please remind me we've gone international haven't we how nice happy birthday so this is what we call simple stamping it's a term we like just to show people that actually you don't have to have everything or be able to do everything to make a beautiful card as in you don't need to have all the fancy techniques you don't have to have a die cutting machine you don't have to emboss you don't you can just have stamps ink and paper it is thursday somewhere else that blew your mind i did the same thing joe i saw an australian friend of mine um very early yesterday sort of tea time or whatever time it was post the postage unpacking special the free shipping special and i was like what how did she even i didn't even know about this because it obviously only got released to us yesterday but they're way ahead aren't they over there ahead behind the head definitely she is okay i know 9 40. oh your daylight savings don't end yet ours change on the 28th of march are yours the same or are they different so this is probably a good time for you oh well i hope it's a good time for you sylvia it's not crack of dawn oops for you getting glue all over the place that is such a pretty card all by itself isn't it i love that thank you joe so easy random flower stamping um i did have a layer where is it here it is we need to happy birthday inside and i'll do the same as i did last time just switch it up a little bit now i very often like to stamp this happy fussy cut it with my scissors and stick it on so if you wanted a little bit more depth but you don't die cut that's another option for you that makes it easy our little snips our scissors are great for that because they are very sharp so we're going pink for the happy and i need the little birthday stamp so i think i'll just move that one put on my little a block happy birthday to you has anyone got a birthday that's watching has anyone got a birthday soon who would like these cards or one of these cards who

copycat DIY black tea\nlemonade, just like you can get at Starbucks? We'll keep on watching and I'll show you my\nversion of how to make this DIY black tea lemonade, right at home. For more DIY drinks, as well as snacks and\nmeals, hit the watermark down below or the big red button and get notified every time\nI launch a new video. Black tea lemonade is by far my favorite drink\nat Starbucks. And I thought to myself, hmmmm...what if I\ntried to make this right at home? And this is the recipe I came up with. For this recipe, you need Earl Grey tea. At Starbucks they use Tazo, I prefer however,\nTeatly. One can have frozen lemonade from concentrate\nand simple syrup for taste. First, you want to bring three cups of boiling\nwater to steep two tea bags. Allow the tea to steep for five minutes. While the tea is steeping begin to make your\nlemonade. I personally let my frozen lemonade thaw out\na little bit before deciding to mix it up. This way it's easie and there's less chance\nof any frozen pieces. Add two cans of water to your lemonade from\nconcentrate. After giving that a mix and letting five minutes\ngo by for steeping it's time to add your tea to your lemonade. Freeze! Quick question. Have you ever tried Starbucks Black Tea Lemonade? Comment down below. Place the pitcher in the refrigerator for\nat least two hours before serving. And now here's the Starbucks secret! Now the secret to the most authentic tasting\nblack tea lemonade from Starbucks is in the tumbler. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the tumbler. If you notice, when you go to Starbucks, they're\nnot stirring your drinks. They're shaking it. So I'm going to give this a good shake -10\ntimes- pour it out and tell you how it tastes. Let's see. So I can tell you right now, it already smells\nlike I'm at Starbucks. Now time to taste it. That is delicious. Absolutely delicious. Can I just tell you guys a secret? I never knew until making this video Earl\nGrey was the tea of choice for black tea lemonade. No clue, because I actually really don't like\nEarl Grey, but like this, I think Earl gray is absolutely perfect. Looking for more summer drinks?

Bye.", "jDZH2Y4fwCc": "hey everyone today I'm going to be showing you three ways to use aloe vera gel to get softer smoother hair the audible gel that I use is by Patanjali it comes in the packaging like so and it's really good I really like it you can obviously use natural aloe vera gel which you can extract from the aloe vera plant itself I just use this one with so I have this gel right here it is natural but it does have a little bit of permitted color and I think it has fragrance as well and press the weight is so if you are if you want to be organic you can obviously get it through a plant I just use this and other waste any more time let's get started with how to use aloe vera gel to get softer smoother hair the first way to use aloe vera gel for soft shiny smooth hair is to use it as a mask the things that you want to require for this mask are obviously allegorize gel this is about 2 tablespoon full of allegory gel I use the Patanjali aloe vera gel and don't worry I have another one so don't worry bunk pad but yes this is about two tablespoonfuls of aloe vera gel right there then you're going to need about one tablespoon of honey this is pure raw honey so you're gonna need that and then you're going to need 2 tbsp of curd or yogurt or how they you wanna say it so you gonna need that now we're going to mix this all in together so right now this is what it looks like it looks like some ice cream doesn't it then just use a whisk or to whisk it all in so all you want to do after that is that you are comb through your hair so there are no knots pull up your sleeves and then you want to start applying this to all over your head including your hair just like a mask so once you've applied this mask to your roots and legs just pile it up on top of your head and tie it in a top knot and let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes after that you just need to normally wash off your head with a shampoo just like you would regularly do and once you have dried your hair you would see you have soft smooth shiny silky hair just like you've always dreamt off and this mask is amazing for your hair you can do it about once in a week or even like a once in a fortnight if you want and if you want you also wear like a shower cap but this doesn't require a shower cap you can just leave it like this as well I'm going to leave it like this and just roam around the house like I just don't care the second way to use aloe vera gel for soft smooth hair is to use it as a leave-in conditioner I genuinely do this as well and I think it works really really well so why I do is why the hair are still damp do not like drippin wet but damn and their air drying you can even use a blow dryer or anything after this I tend to split it into two halves so that I can get an even section alright so once you split it into two halves all you wanna do is take some aloe vera gel on your pants except out this much a dollop of aloe vera gel you can use natural and I just use the patanjali one and you want to spread it between your palms like so and then all you want to do is that you want to take your hair and this just go on to your ends and length of it so you just want to go through it this will honestly make your hair so much more smoother and softer and whatever with whatever is left on my hand what I like to do is that I just go on my scalp because it's amazing for the scalp and it keeps dandruff at bay so I just go through my scalp as well but just what I was remaining I don't use excess of it and once your hair is dried you would realize that it is so soft and smooth and just on it so I'm gonna use a little help us move this off to hair is to make it into a smooth Ning spray for that you're going to be needing a spritz bottle like so and I have filled it up to half way with water you can use any water anything is fine and make sure that you use a smaller bottle because you don't want to store huge quantities of this so once you have about halfway of it with water you want to fill the other half with Alverez and then mix it up together something like this you want to close back your bottle and you want to give it a good shake you will end up with something like this now all you want to do is that you want to spritz it on to your hair so my hair was previously in the greats it looks a lot more frizzier than it actually is so I'm going to show you right now how effective this tray is so you can see my hair right now lacks shine and is just blah so I'm just going to spray it and then I'm going to run my fingers through it to smoothen it out so you can clearly see my hair looks so much more smoother anna's frizz free after using the stray so those of the three ways in which you can apply a divergence you get softer smoother hair I honestly felt such a big difference ever since I've started using algebra gel for my hair because it has amino acids or a Mindwipe that's how ever you pronounce it I'm not really sure amino acids which closes down the cuticles of your hair so doesn't split into two ends and it stays frizz free for a long period of time I knew that mask about once a fortnight and I always apply aloe vera gel after i gorge it so my hair is softer and sleeker and shinier but yes I definitely feel there's a massive tremendous difference in my hair texture and I really really really like it so I hope that

brisk a sweet tea iced tea and lemon ice tea and I have their lemonade it's called juice drink so this is eliminated these were a dollar each at Walmart and they're pretty good size for a dollar yeah they are they're a 1.5 quart right one liter they're a one liter bottle oh there are seventy calories per 12 ounces and there are three servings in this container so 210 calories for this bottle the maker's is a person or 70 oh okay and there's three so 210 Cal what's your 79 eliminate is only 45 so this is just sweet pain there's four so yeah this was already we were at the checkout the man checking us out at Walmart he said have you ever tried that he said it's really good apparently he's bought it several times this weekend it's goofy it is it has a little bit different flavor than these stupid it's good it is it it's made by lifting it says on the by yeah and you know what I could taste looking tea in that because we use it on all Louisiana yeah this it does taste different than if you make it yourself oh yeah yeah in that for me could have a lot to do with the sweetener that I use because I don't use traditional sugar I use packets but still even when I use sugar this just tight it has a different flavor to it when they make it like this but you know what it's got a really good tea flavor and it's got a touch of that tea bitterness but not bad it's it's it's not bad at all I like it I think it's really good and this I'm sure a lot of people wonder would you ever heat this up you would these are made yourself to serve cold yes okay so this is the lemon and the British way that was that's why I'm thinking if we have any bricks that were watching that you may be wondering how could you heat that up I don't think it would be bad but they don't drink I don't think the British drink iced tea or cold tea it's always high we're over here especially in the south we drink iced teas yeah I spit yes I like the lemon I think it's nice you know they didn't overpower you know you still get a lot of the flavor of the natural tea the natural tea flavor but with a splash of lemon in it and yeah it's not overpowering it's not like a cleaner or anything like that it's just a nice fresh lemon tea mmm yeah I like it that the lemons not like in-your-face limit yes a little white flavor if you like if you squeeze a lemon in a glass of water or something like that it's kind of act like yeah overpowering just adds a little bit of flavor right it won't make you pucker it's not yeah okay so this one has four servings in the model at 45 calories Wow so there are only 45 that's not bad and this is not tame this is just lemonade it's only it's only 180 that's really good lemonade I think it's not my favorite lemonade it's not overly sweet like cool a lemonade right for her but Cole like lemonade just because I do likes really sweet lemonade but that is very good they taste like freshly squeezed lemonade yeah yes man and I think if you if you we're gonna like have a cookout or something or just be outside and on a hot day if you were outside working in your garden I think that would be yes very nice yeah I like them it says the artist on these is Tom Rogers and it is some interesting art water graffiti you like yes you have a lens on the lemonade and I'll have a closer picture of all these bottles at the end and then you have I don't even know what different faces on them and then this is faces as well but this is more like cartoon Conan comic book yeah comic book style oh very cool oh I'm sorry this one is Tristan Eton is the artist this artist is JT Daniels okay and then this one's Tom Rogers so they all have different artists well we bought three other brisk drinks to try so I'm sure they'll be totally different artists and they are completely different flavors than these so I can't wait to try them so I think that's neat that these are all made by Lipton so they're good yeah they're good they're all three good if you could only pick one of these will do a minute lemon tea and I would pick the lemonade right yeah yeah the lemonade so I hope you enjoyed getting to hear about these and thanks for watching [Music]", "hIh4avIz5JY": "today Kevin and outgoing betraying three Arizona T's these were 75 cents at Big Lots which is a really good price because they say great buy at 99 cents on them and I actually bought some Arizona brand at CVS and they were 99 cents so it's great if you can get them at Big Lots and only pay 75 cents a piece I have the sweet team and then this one is light half and half a half ice tea and half lemonade mine is iced tea with lemon flavor but the limited so this says just southern style real brewed sweet teen the this is these are all 23 ounce containers and it is 250 calories for the entire Pam it contains no preservatives no artificial colors or flavors drink Arizona calm is their website if you're interested Arizona brand has so many beverages to choose from not just tea yeah things yes we've reviewed their fruit juice cocktail I think that's what they were called and there were all different flavors of those so they don't just do tea that's not bad - you could actually place are gonna have a little limiter or something it tastes like maybe the sweetener the reason whatever these yeah it it tastes like your your typical routine that you would get already made like this day right it tastes like my stutter yesyes yes I prefer it made I'm spoiled because growing up we always had a package of tea in the cabinet and we would make our own because it doesn't take very long at all it's really simple and so we would always make our own so I'm spoiled that way but this is very good if you want something quick it's very good um also when you make it yourself a down though you can add sweetener pockets and it's zero calories instead of 250 calories but if you don't pair this is good sweet dish so this one is the is does that say Arnold Palmer okay yeah and he's a golfer because I've seen him swinging and yeah okay it says oh okay here we go special golf achievements it says the name Arnold Palmer has legendary roots is an original beverage combination of half ice tea and half lemonade Arizona beverages makers of one of America's favorite iced teas have teamed up with Arnold Palmer to bring you Arnold Palmer lights have been high so I guess maybe that's his special drink as they said I mean that's that's known as an Arnold Palmer Wow I would have not known that like a Harvey Wallbanger something you know is that mean our Charlie temple these these drinks have these names and I guess Arnold Palmer is how I see you have lemonade it is because it's a light it is 150 calories for the entire pan [Music] difference that smell of lemon yellow lemonade gives a torrent showing us it's very very very tart but it's not tarnish its you're shocked by how black it really hits you at times it takes but it it's okay that's what I'm wondering I don't like it at all I would never read that I can and that was the only thing to drink at a party I walk and I could drink it I would rather have water and I'm I don't drink water if I drink I do drink what I drink flavored water but I don't care what I don't it's just way too too tart for me hey if that is not good so I'm excited to try this one because this is just a well I'm wondering I don't know maybe I can pinpoint more what it is and this I don't like once I've tried this one because this is the Sun Brut style iced tea with lemon flavor so what's gonna be I know this one's white I guess this one's lemonade lemonade and this was limited flavor and this is 270 calories so it's no it's a lot more calories it's darker that's a much better that does not have that that tart I mean it has just a hint of the lemon to where it tastes like tea with lemon Verity and squeezed a couple lemons in that's what it tastes like yeah in most restaurants when you get tea they they ask you do you want lemon Iran that's what that tastes like it's not too much it's not too heavy I think in in the Arnold Palmer is that his name I think they were just it's so heavy that it's so tart that yeah I just would never do that again I don't prefer it no the original I maintain I would I would definitely I'm not a lemon with my drink person anyway so like a lot of people order water with just lemon or something like that I've never been one for a person to do that anyway so but I did want to try these because they've been out for a while they sell them at Dollar Tree I'm assuming they're a dollar at Dollar Tree so Big Lots has the best price on them as far as we've seen now if you see them cheaper somewhere else you'll have to let us know but we yeah we like the original to relate tea so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "NBatkVBYdEg": "alcoholic Arnold Palmer's boozy tities and white peach Bellinis today I'm here to talk to you about iced tea cocktails first that we have these minty tea cocktails so this is basically a chilled orange pekoe but with some citrusy elements so we've added in some orange juice and some lemon juice to give it a bit of zest and a lot a lot of mint so it's definitely gonna be refreshing on your palate and a great option this summer next step we have this alcoholic Arnold Palmer so named after the American golfer this is a mix of not just lemonade and black tea but we also have some bourbon thrown in there so if you feel like getting maybe a little buzzed on the golf course this season this is a great way to go this white peach Bellini is made with green tea gin and Prosecco it's also garnished with huge peach slices and a sugar rim so it's fun it's fruity its festive and it is sure to be a new summer feed in the runner-up spot we have these boozy tities this is a more exotic alternative for your classic black iced tea it's made with a Thai tea mix heavy cream and bourbon so it's a fun adult twist and great if you want to add some Asian Flair to any seasonal beverages and my personal favorite is this mash-up between a mojito and a margarita this recipe from David's tea uses a specialty blend of theirs mixed with all kinds of alcohols so we've got tequila we have triple sec and it is just a really refreshing and fruity option garnished with a sugar rim you're gonna want to get your hands on this one so those are my favorite examples of iced tea cocktails let us know in the comments below what your favorites are or you can tweet me at alie wires you", "n6HI-FaM4E4": "hey guys Callum here and in today's video I am going to show you how to make cold brew tea in the simplest way possible [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Sokol brewing is the process of extracting tea into water over a long period of time either at room temperature or in the fridge and this is in contrast to hot tea which is typically ready in like five minutes so because it's a slower extraction it actually brings out a much more delicate full-bodied flavor profile in the tea and also it brings out different medicinal compounds that are not present in hot tea plus because it's cold refreshing and easy to drink you can actually taste and experience the team much better than if it was a hot liquid so first get tea so T's are incredible because there is so much variety as far as what you can brew you can go from anything like your basic green or black tea to your more unique caffeinated teas like your Vermont air guai yousa all the way to your more unique medicinal herbal teas like hibiscus meadowsweet nettles or ashwagandha you can Col brew tea bags or you can co brew loose tea personally I prefer a cold brewing loose tea because you can get much higher quality herbs and you can actually see and feel the quality that you're getting versus if it was hidden inside of a tea bag it is so important to make sure that you're using the highest quality filtered water you can get not tap water and so for this I fill up five gallon jugs at my local grocery store and nearly every grocery store in the United States now has a water dispenser outside of the store inside of it where you can get reverse osmosis water and it usually costs about two dollars for five gallons then you simply put your herbs into a mason jar or a French press you add in your water and then you put it in the fridge for a faster extraction you can leave it outside of the fridge at room temperature and then put it into the fridge to cool off so the easiest thing to do is to make your tea at night and before bed and this will give you 8 to 12 hours if you filter it in the morning of extraction time which is perfect for most teas so flowers like hibiscus and blue lotus flower need the least amount of extraction time and then leaves like your Vermont a or black tea need a medium amount of time and then roots like ashwagandha need the most amount of time so for a leaf like your Bramante the absolute minimum amount of time that I have done that works is three hours although ideally I would like to do it for eight hours or 24 hours and then four routes like ashwagandha I definitely want a cold groom for 24 hours so the easiest way to filter herbs is with a French press so either brew it in there to start or you can brew it in a mason jar pour it in the French press press it and you're good to go and this works well for herbs that are looser cut so bigger particles but if you have a tea that is finer cut like your Bramante which maybe has some small particles in there sometimes is nice to have it go through a second pass for drinkability to make it very smooth and for that I use a simple funnel and a coffee filter and I'll just do a second pass after the French press and that will lead to a really smooth drinking experience so how much tea do you brew it's super simple just eyeball it so if you want to make tea for just one drinking session just picture putting one to two tea bags worth of tea in your jar it's more convenient to make a more concentrated version and then to dilute as needed so if you make it too strong it's not a problem just add water to your tea and that's it so making cold brew tea is super simple and now you know how to do it and you can start enhancing your health your lifestyle and your day by drinking these beautiful medicinal or caffeinated herbs and lastly some of the footage that you saw in here was have some incredibly beautiful rare medicinal herbs and it's become so rare today to have high quality herbs because most teas most herbs are grown on large-scale factory farms which makes sense because we have such a large world population that it's necessary to have it that way however for your own health it's important for you to secure really quality herbs that have grown in great soil and that's why I'm so excited I found this very small beautiful 10 acre farm in Northwest Idaho that grows ancient medicinal herbs and I reached out to them and partnered with them these are by far the highest quality herbs that I've ever come across and I felt so inspired that I reached out to the farm to get you guys a sweet deal so

you guys soon ciao", "RRfhxt0IAto": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so what I'm going to do today is make a Starbucks passion icy lemonade so as you can see here I have a mason jar I have this passion iced tea from bite as oh it's their teabags I got this at Walmart this box here that I'm showing you I ordered off Amazon it's spite as well but the teabags are a bit different but they both still taste the same I ended up ordering some off Amazon because I went back to Homer and they weren't they did not have those anymore it's really hard to find this iced tea so if you can't find it in stores you can definitely order it on Amazon so for this size mason jar I'm just going to take out two tea bags as you can see like I said they're a little different but it doesn't affect the flavor I'm going to start warming up some water so cuz first before we make the passion iced tea we just have to make the tea so I'm just gonna dull my tea bags in there like so very simple this tea literally takes five minutes to make if you have everything ready so I'll just like make this tea in this mason jar and just let it put in my fridge and use it every day when I feel like having some and I don't want to go to Starbucks or whatever so when my water is done I will pour it into my mason jar and just let it steep until it's nice and dark so about three to five minutes so we're all ready to go [Music] so I'm gonna go ahead and pour my boiling hot water you need it to be boiling hot and if you don't have a kettle like this it you can just boil water on the stove or a warm of water in your microwave whatever it works for you just let this steep so for the lemonade you can buy lemonade pre-made but I actually am just gonna make my own lemonade mix so I bought this one it's just like lemonade powder it's already sweet and you just mix it with water so I got my jug I'm just gonna yeah I showed you I made it already mm-hmm so it's already made I need to make some more it's almost done it's really easy to make so like I said you can buy it at the store already made but I like to make it myself so as you can see I have the Starbucks classic syrup you can just go right into Starbucks and buy one they sell them you just have to if they have enough they'll sell you one and they're about 12 bucks and I bought this at Starbucks as well it's just like a reusable plastic cup it was like three bucks I needed buy more just to have them on hand because they're cheaper to buy these and I've seen reusable plastic cups with straws on Amazon so start to make this up we're going to throw our ice in our cup I already have some ice that I pulled out the freezer so I'm just going to dump it in my cup like so maybe I'm gonna add more I want to fill it up with ice and then I'm gonna take my tea I already had made some for my husband and my daughter so this is what I had laughs so I don't know how far you have to fill it I just usually fill the tea up to like the last line like right there and I feel the lemon fill up fill it up with lemonade the rest of the way and I add one pump of the Starbucks classic sugar excellent got a little too close and got it into my drink because I want to make sure I made it in the drink and not on the counter but anyway I just put one pump and this is like a venti size if you have a smaller size you might not even really need any sugar because the lemonade is already sweet for me just one pump of that classic syrup stuff is good and when you go to Starbucks sometimes they don't want to give you the pump to go with it they'll just sell you the bottle so once again you can order the pump off Amazon and it's like I can't remember how much it was maybe like $5 or something just for the pump if you don't want to pour it in a teaspoon or tablespoon thing it's more convenient you can order enough Amazon so anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial and I hope it was easy for you to understand and happy making your own passion I see lemonade at home it's because the next one thanks for watching bye don't forget to Like and subscribe", "g-WA64UWaC4": "hey y'all it is tea tasting tuesday and i know week

really guys I like it as a reason I love the channel Rosie's know loads of use loads of subs I think we had over 40 50 subs the last four weeks which is absolutely brilliant okay do that every month we're gonna hit that thousand at the end of the year so let's get this bloody channel rockin guys anyway Stephen stop waffling on this so if I'm looking down at no sir all the time guys because the samisen survives to come in and I don't to put so much on here to start with Monica we buy seat we want to keep it simple and that's the way we're going to go so first of all as with every Wednesday night we're going to try the juices that we did last week I did to last we didn't over the lemon line one and the berry mix one now during the way I've actually just adjusted them slightly added a bit of sweetener into them you know I've put it all on the notes and everything because your boys sweetness as well as sign notes to sweeten things up whether it's a cotton candy you'll learn that as we go along or Donna going to too much but just on those two under the berry mix that we did last week and remember mimicked in that live last week it was 10 percent my cup of the berry mix just to one mix flavor and with her three nicotine strengths or my liquids in this unit strength and I 80/20 very joy ratio on this one we did attempt since I think when I tried it because we did it last Wednesday I tried it the weekend and berries weren't quite popping those so I've it I've added an extra 2% of berries in there and I've also added 2% of ethyl maltol which is a sweetener or you can buy sweeteners or whatever sweetness tend to public cause of its there's loads of sweeteners out there I think it was shiny suggest dude I can't inside the bloody we were brought in tried before I didn't quite like the ties to that one shine I think it was a arias tuck any three top sweetly that's a little bit of enough to taste then it's quite strong as well quite strong sweetener I didn't quite like one I do like a camel toe I think it's abyss but anyway added to percents of ethyl maltol to that as well so let's give this a shake let's see how it's doing another four days later this is a way cult juice now it's only a fruit juice so it shouldn't need a lot of steeping or your bakeries you could stirs your caramels all those will need longer steeping they're not shaken by juices that type of juice but your fruit juice ones or fruits generally will evoke straighter I so give this a tough go do tell me how old glass RDI I've got a single card or D in that one for you and it's the fishbone one that one there guys you can see that nice picture of a bone fish on there I think it was Paul from ESCO vibes it's Steve you got the around Bolivia tease now with you go go on with the carp on there yeah we're getting that big now I've got me able to do vibe line we can logo on there yeah I do wish but anyway we've got a single-car build on there I'll go start on the smoke do proof again it's 80 watts and we'll try it this first one from last week which was a berry mix just put a bit of that juiciness on there so give it a good shake give everything to shake we're doing juice abuse cause I got so much information on this in my head you know I can't put it so just get confusing guys you'll come along as a way to go boy it's like any questions any help from anyone who's a mixologist any mixes out there put the info in guys any tips ideas whatever as I say I'm no bloody mixologist I'll mix my own juice I have been for six months and I love it I love the whole concept and the excitements and the passion that you know just the thrill of making something that you are creating which is absolutely beautiful mouseland cirno's you get some ones that are pretty shy but you find amid seminal so you're not wasting anything wisely like 20p and probably check your pound one pound fifty is worth of juices 10 ml bottles till you get to the final the final juice that your buddy love but it's just trial and error guys like any you know anybody any chemist you like a chemist in a way it's just trial and error you go do a trial of that one trial then top it up with something to a trial it's just lovely doing it course it really is love when you come over the name product that you can vape or die I've got some lovely or died vibes here you know hundred mil of that one bit of that down at 100 middle of that lemon custard 100 mil of that cheese cut you can most of those I'm tried I got out 100 flavors there don't expect us get I want you start with just get 5 or 10 put them in you staff go for press what can I make out of this just go from there to start with anyway stop gabbing on there's some what bloody Viper seviche look she got with you I hope you all had a great comment lies lies halfway through the way you can fly close to the weekend I'm gonna go fishing I think oh yeah get on the beach tomorrow it's warmed up slightly he's been frozen out the last four days start to warm up a little bit now so I'm gonna get my backside out these bloody ice and get on that beach and do a bit of fishing probably bit of bloody white Zin on the beach build a tempura batter bitter lemon bit of water or fall rise let's give this a berry mix which we did last week guys on the channel this gives us to some soothe this and I've improved this anyway by topping up that concentrate by 2% and out of you a bit of Swing there which is the ethyl maltol here we go my beautiful daughter on there with my gorgeous beautiful girl all those noise that is me when I try this on the weekend four days after mixing it from last week it was just a bit just a bit harsh a bit sharp putting that sweetener in has just carved everything down because sweeteners tend to do that's whatever it's when you use well it's a smooth whether it's a cotton candy whether these ethyl maltol which is whether it's sweetness or whether it's an ice cream it just calms things down a little bit and that's still treating that one that extra fiber in there as well that's left or lingering basket of fruits on my tongue those nice oh that's Mickey mean lick my lips absolu pack out that is nice no just one fruit flavor is what you see you know that they're not these complex nice rounded beautiful vibes you can make those you really can but that's future down the line guys but that is a lovely fruit vibe that's all it is it's a fruit to Vitamix fruit vibe I've got a bit of sweetness leaves are lovely I mean high on it it's got a sweetness of the little bit of depth in it that's nice and our lovely fruitiness can we improve that one of course I can improve that one cotton candy I think it's not too bad actually that's not so bad I might leave that for another week I might not touch that next week till next week I'll have real quick roundabouts sir next weekend see what it's doing but Sir that won't be alright and that's good I'll put that back on my black cupboard right the other one we did last week was the lemon align again with this one I tried it three or four days after we mixed it last week and this one just needed again lift it again because a lot of the flavors sometimes only 10% of that flavor to populate sometimes it will need 15% and sometimes it might need 2% it depends on the depth of the actual concentrates and all concentrates from all the manufacturers they're all different they've all got their density of strength there they've got their own complex because these are actual mixes these are concentrates their mix is in themselves so they're all different from different manufacturers anyway Steve stop rapping on Java ashell yeah we're off put something back on there for you guys to watch a few vices on there they've got muscle a Steve a few vibrant faces there take that bloody advert off there as you know so got adverts on the channel no guys just let them run if you can sometimes piss all incomes I'm going to give all the income away from my advert revenue we'll see how that person will give it right to this Children's Hospital right let's try snus I've just dropped the adjustable bike bang which is all explained on this video talk about loving your own bloody face back on there it'll put someone juice on there no I didn't see that we destroy thanks somewhere that's give that another toot try this once a lie they've all bloody confused their guys here I go again lucky dip you can't like of course it is yeah whatever do we just wanna have a look at this during the week and this one just needed sprucing up a little bit I'll put an extra 1% of flavor in there and I'll put 1% of cotton candy in there just to try and smooth things off a little bit because just made your branding off a little bit anyway give this [ __ ] off surely I to us here we go with our lemon and lime which will mix with last Wednesday nice tank a nice fresh vibe that cotton candy is just smoothing things off a bit it's a ditz added a little bit of sweetness to it as well that one think that laser even a bit more of the fly around there what did we start off last week I think it was 12% was there I'll put 1% in on the weekend so it's got 13% in there peep notes as well when you adjust your recipes keep notes lose Tommy do it just add that onto a recipe joins the rest way otherwise you're gonna you're not gonna remember what you did guys so keep your notes that needs a bit more lemon and lime and I think or perhaps just a bit of lemon on its own just - I'll do I'll probably just pop the concentrate on that one boys right savage juice this lemon custard yeah we're doing Little Mix Oh drop your band again we do a live mix now guys what are your suggestions thanks Ross adjustments guys got the lads come through Adam happy very percent one through four coconut butterscotch that'd be interesting one I've got the constant rise to that so I won't do that one there next week for you Adam lemon sherbet from piping the live diddle I de lavit are from Simon 18 Simon I think Sonia for Lemon looks from the demon vapor which will go it's all of those but the one I'm going to do tonight is for vaping live which was the lemon sherbet one that'll be interesting mistress pro-business whoops-a-daisy it's the lemon custard solo company video be past two videos no moaning you know as I said before I kept saying I'm a bit raw so just the way it is it's just why I do things I think people like it that wise to be honest okay to give this a chuff about this one now it's been working for about six weeks I believe and it's New Year to perfection lemon custard nice nice top notes lemon smoothie nussle custard on the inside oh it's nice nice sweetness coming in there that's full got double cream in there we've got juicy lemon got vanilla custard and we've got Sicilian lemon in there that you've noise oh that's coming on the truth that might be better in another week to our new tried it anything to that I'll make the version one that I dealer that was good that's why I've done it so no hundred mill bought off that's the version two and that's just just a bit more brighter that's lovely okay we'll do a mix now guys up to one side have a quick over write a quick slurp as a cyber juice with the concentrates you know we're not doing my juice review guys I don't do all this tasting smelling stuff I want to bloody vibe the bloody juice i don't--it iced tea or somalis in the bottle thanks regard to do that a lot of people do that and that's the way they get their senses working I don't do that I'm certainly no tasty because on the shelf Juicy's they've got Nick in an awkward but Nick on my bloody Tom Tom or dive in it but I'm not going to bleep piss on Tom that's one of the reasons are down to it quit sir you know people do it that way and that's up to them you know ads action that's all why they want it do we but with concentrates you don't need to taste and smell them to see what strength they've got in what body they've gotten what intense five they have in order for you to know what to put in the mixture whether to put you know 4 mils in or whether it's put forth sensing or whether to put five or even ten or even twenty percent team you get that from tasting it and that gives you some idea of what the potential of that actual juice is say let's just pick a fruit one any fruit one a trunk flavor art but on the right give it a shot always give them a shiny keep everything look good shake as I say if you want to add books because there's nicotine involved its diluted because today if you're poor dick then I have a little I need for a few days you've got a problem diluted nicotine I doubt by the way enclosed with damp do is I'd bloody side noise if you want we're Bushmen please I advise you to weight loss chug up to you but while I mix he says I said on the other videos there's a to me there's no need to but if one away it goes you want to be safe balmains wear gloves get yourself and like a box of gloves I start the ones before disposable plastic gloves make sure they're not the ones with a pair of in size that will contaminate what you're doing always when you're mixing do it clean spotless hands sterilized and sterilize bottles sterilized a whisker make sure everything's nice and clean guys because it's going down near the end of the day and I wanted to paper said I've got you know I looked at my two videos from last two videos I made a couple of mistakes that's why I'm guys you know I do bugger up now the game boy I'm doing I'm going to stick the menu up now so it's nice and precise and you can see exactly what I'm mixing I mean grab and that's your growing they have a tweet within a great conversation right guy and it's give me a few tips as well you know I'm not a big salad dish guys I'm just mixing juice Claud mixing juice and I love the juices that I mix and I want to just to show you and bloody easiest tease if you want all the technical advice about all the complexity of bloody DIY there's loads of channels out there guys but we're just there to mix I just want to mix with you I want you to mix with me I want to touch your Vic's in so sense on through if you're made anything or try another Channel any other I've got any ones that turn that noise I'm a cup of batter of about 1000 these 1000 bottles and send them out to anybody that wants to try them guys you know want to work together we want to get this channel interactive especially the DIY party anyway going on to tasting and smelling this is a banana ripe it's an ass smell I wouldn't do this with actual juice mixes you know off-the-shelf juice pipes david concentrates because there's no explaining we're now working banana bloody alley or what and that is it says banana ripe and that is a squeezy squad you perhaps a little blackness on the that is it ten sisters advertised alone I mean I never taste quite like they are when the diluted because DC's consulate right so it's going to be a bit of a he's bit harsh sometimes bit tingly on the tongue but I love life that is a that is a true ripe banana man you don't need much of that solution in to get your banana fiber let's say about five maybe three five percent on the one vape juice that would make a what a single vibe noises single vibe that would so just try a juice ease put that back in deflates I'll give you a flash on my table I'll put it up there that's good guys just a quick view from my side of the my side of camera looking at it you guys just a quick view my desk my slice yeah well get set up ready my DIY desk was such plus well do all my bills and everything as well as y'all dragon they're upside down ready for the dragon ready for the camera yeah I'll tell mr. dragon we haven't been down and seen her in the in the solos like though blue lady my lady there well let me say like crazy I just said view around my desk guys I've got all my mixes out of there my VJ my pager my nicotine I've got my wish carrier it's in what I've just done a mixing tutorial I've got all my one shots there guys and throw those away or washing out if you once I've got some they're ready to wash my mics over there got a lamp types and machine type and stick oh I've got my stickers here for my boss if I want to use those or I've got some ready-made stickers which labels which look like that for us yeah I think I showed those on the video so you can put the mixture on there the dye at the time and everything ready for libel the old bottles up I've got all my whites there for color bright summer scales there's my sister's girls there guys watch and cheap I was on the sixth grade that is only sixth grade the wish that was about the wish that was about eight quid so cheapest chips that massive bottle of VG PG is about knowing quid I think me he could say there's about twelve quits there you go and I've got lousy juices on I expect you to get all those juices like this guy that's got about a hundred juices there of all different types or combos Orfila juices softeners sweeteners by curries cakes fruits all sorts of stuff going on there guys so delicately skip that many there be one or two yeah they were all though she's no days so hopefully it could make up anything that you guys want me to make on our Wednesday specials guys and I'll do whether you recognize that there that I've been wrong for a bloody long a long time that's my whoopee-doo D 5 out of 5 juice review Bell I run that for me but I saw the wrong it lets you be honest don't know what really six months ago anyway that's why we juices are all overcome all on racks they're all I bought life that's where all the samples are kept that's where all my new that's stuff there was only based on the video the cupcake world right I'm going to give those a choice you know those workouts those all mix is already done ones ready for steeping and all the flavors you see there guys they're all labeled up I've got fruits and hot drinks and all the chocolates there guys fruit working down the line got the cookies down acai screens we lose question of sweeteners coal all the various sweetness can get as well there ethyl maltol you know colada the artificial sweeteners as well I've got graham crackers soft drinks everything as well that's my voice for building that's quite a few there guys don't spit you scam I know you only need five six baby 10 flavors as long as you got your very JPJ your nicotine your scales and your whisk and you know why ego and if you want to wear books that's Tagliapietra guys let's look at my desk there there's me I'll skin your knees and that look at all that will be underneath God Almighty okay guys and we'll catch you later I'll do shoe min on my lovely girl and she's Christine sadly mr. guys okay I'm with a video okay that's just a flashing my timer works up there's no tools no babies there's no washing up there's no needles now bloody syringes nothing that's or if you wanna wear gloves like way close anyway cracking on yeah also you get the constant rise but you can also get one shot combos as well when it's got the shelf bought a juices just in concentrate for use that the nicotine some of those about like 10 quid will be expensive a lot cheaper than the at reduce my drop and put that explains if doing it this way doing your own combos your own why much more cheaper to three paying 400 mil so tried be a bit more precise in the videos specifically with the measurements and with the NIC measurements as well you know you've got to be spot-on what I'm doing if we smell not that critical but because people are watching what I'm doing I need to be a bit more precise I'm going to try and be a bit more precise in the future guys yeah shine was one about mentioned to me message me of those sweeteners they want cord every R it up every through talk I think it's cool sweet I've tried that in the past church right yeah thanks for putting tip through want to purple like it but I thought just a little bit of an ass stuff aftertaste the Simon's we've you know sweeteners they item a of the aftertaste ever have a sweetener type of thing whereas ethyl maltol doesn't come cotton candy doesn't or a bitter Bavarian crave doesn't you know but it is whatever whatever pleasure reflects what suggestion anyway shine and thus I will crack on with a which one did we start we're going to do one of my reviewers requests which was from my P live which was the lemon service on ask a Thomas green here on my applet from my liquid recipe sighs just bear with me a second guys I'm introducing Viper ice I'll just show you this just Park up nice and close our actually nine the title of this one Ave Powell sherbet for

grams which we do in honor yeah just give you a quick look at that guys coming out nice and clear that's the rest of you if you want to freeze a frame and follow along or whatever it's there but I'll also put a freeze frame of this recipe up there now so that's the rest place I wouldn't get this one spot on this time guys let's have a shrub yeah I'll be alright guys I feel that a couple of days where I'll fight further away weekend's coming off it's getting a little bit warmer let's get our backsides out of these blue you see sitting out there in the countryside you have Ashley and I want to do in the future on all videos as well on all reviews or whatever I'm doing I've got loads of do I go about 20 juicy not they're stacking up a bit now so it's all piling in there which is lovely I've

survived shall we go is this have ashlar tape thinking I've left some but I have this to talk about guys but in our daughter God so much Brazil just get confusing on our donor confuse anybody I really want to show a bloody simple this DIY mixing is they all I mix into me as a future it really is I don't know what the big fight companies are going to do in the future the Lord's producing on the shelves Corsa will vary but who do you always company now with a bloody vengeance there's lots of people trying to do it and there's lots of people doing it out there but there is a lot of people that I'm going to clue what they always all about and this is what this challenge before that was a lot of you air that they are looking both in what you know and they're seasoned mixers nothing you want to play the hell's that bloke doing I'm just I just want to show you how easy it is I don't get too technical on you know exact precise precision bloody measurements and combinations of juices you know if I go down that line a bit further down alive and we will get used to what we're doing guys with we're both here to learn you know I'll be mixer for a long time now I'll mix some lovely juices I really have choked up on me so got the old drip food on there it's give me some gardening juice spring back up for a second guys blow blow Cory to for I've got one two three got four hours to get yourself might be a bit late he's coming up tonight guys so it might be past seven o'clock might be closer to nine o'clock yeah okay bye pal sure best for you vaping live this one is or get some juice on top of there now because this one it's got a rare our way we've got a vanilla custard in there Guster than the smooth mix in there so I take awake two weeks too steep and that's when these coasters really take off you need to be patient with the custards and the by cruise and the you know the caramels it's I should be those just put away for a week two weeks give them a bit of a shake up the cap now and again put the cap back on another shake just be a little bit more passion with those I will see what this is doing good job we're down to do that at [ __ ] 50 watts Stephen let's work out there and try this and see what she's doing straight off the bat I don't expect too much with this without it's sleeping because the sides got those creamy other Mancini's here we go piping live this is your lemon service now this could be nasty it could be nice you could be going I'm sure so nice that was really quite a nice guy straight off the bat and that will be if that steep sort of two weeks or a week that'll be even more intense that will be lovely he's bloody pretty well on the spot there I've got four cents of it custard trying to think what the top note is there now that I've got in there perhaps it needs just a little bit more lemon because of custard he's on the top sherbert the Bureau of fruitiness from the sugar that's in the side the lemons in the side is well above the easting vanilla custard the top layer it's the top notes on that well you skim out hints of that lemony sherbety that is quite nice oh good fact that all died now as that is a lovely creaminess left on your tongue it's not very sweet face noise no libel that one up I've got the recipe on the side I'll put some knife now something here and I'll have a look at that in a week's time I can guarantee you in a week's time that'll be even more of a a deep bold intense creaminess in that and the lemon just might pop up a little bit but I'll try it in four days time and if the lemons not coming out I might put a touch more 1/2 percent more juice lemon in that that is nice I'll put it in my ready to steep file I'll make some notes on that and whatever look at that later on oh just coming to the end of that video as well which is nice time you guys what we got on there anybody that's great [Music] you know I've got what I want to do as well as I said I want to put some notes up of comments made every other video as well just pop that down yeah I want to put some notes down tissue juice makers best friend or a good roll of tissue especially or not my bloody stuff all out of the bleeding place I tell ya his spies everywhere when I start getting bitter soapy up water to get through the juice trust me he's not too bad I mean the kanima ones can stay up a bit this gets some more of that on there because that is probably leaving a taste in my mouth that is that is quite bloody noise that's waving lovely smooth taste in my face not sure I like these bottles of course I have the tenth one pok\u00e9mon mill ones that I've now bought about 50 50 ml ones the caps on that maybe that's alright though it's not too bad put that in the ready to steep I'll go in the cupboard we'll give that a shake everything down again at the top at the top I can't give a shake and we'll try that make sure you can see that's doing well I'll probably try it weekend let's give it another go anyway I'm gonna stuff this we're bloody volume up on this one because I think it's going to handle it a pretty creamy Viper's well straight off the bloody bath shaker vibe which most have a good combo yeah oh I see better noisy watts watch your back watch your back for good that's lovely rice we going up for IAT so they no longer been going off all guys if you enjoyed that so don't get too

"YK82Wf7jeLA": "hey guys summer is just around the corner so today I'm going to show you one of my favorite ways to cool down when the weather gets warm we're actually going to be making some iced tea and in true domestic geek fashion we're going to be making it five delicious ways just before we get to that I did want to let you know that I am finally on snapchat so if you're on snapchat be sure to follow me at the domestic geek I'll be sharing lots of behind the scenes photos and videos and of course lots of tips and tricks there and I'm really excited it took me a few weeks to get the hang of it so I was secretly snapping for a little while but I think I've got it so follow me at the domestic geek and otherwise it's time to get started with some awesome iced tea ideas we're kicking things off today with a really yummy orange and rosemary iced tea if you've never tried the combination of orange and rosemary you were in brewery it's super super refreshing of course as with any great iced tea this one starts with some tea and we make teeth by combining some boiling water and some tea bags now for this process I'm actually transferring my boiling water to a heat proof dish emphasis here on heat proof it's really important you do not pour boiling water into non heatproof glass because obviously it could shatter and cause a really bad accident and that's not what we want because it's iced tea day and that's a day we're celebrating so we're pouring our water into a heatproof dish into that we're going to add some tea bags in this case I'm using just traditional orange pekoe tea but go ahead and use any kind of tea you like once our tea is steeping away we are going to add even more flavor with a few sprigs of fresh rosemary and the zest of one orange now if you prefer your iced tea unsweetened you can go ahead and get this next step but I really enjoy a sweet tea so I'm gonna go ahead and add some honey to this and stir everything around until that honey is totally dissolved then I'm going to let all of this deliciousness steep away for between three and five minutes depending on how dark you like your tea and then I'm simply going to strain it and let it cool completely once my tea has cooled completely I'm going to pour it in a pitcher over some orange slices and then into the fridge it goes to chill for at least an hour when it's ready to serve I'm simply going to pour it over some ice and then garnish it with another sprig of fresh rosemary next up I've got a really yummy black fairy mint iced tea so once again I'm going to get started with some hot water into that I'm adding some green tea bags you could do this with black tea bags if you wanted to but I just love the idea of incorporating green tea and all of its awesome antioxidant power into this yummy summer drink to that I'm also going to add some fresh mint leaves I'm just going to tear them apart to help them release some of their yummy flavor and I'm also going to add a little bit of sugar I'm going to stir this all together until the sugar is completely dissolved and then I'm going to let it steep for about five minutes just keep in mind you never want to over steep any of these teas because they will become a little bit bitter and that is not delicious once my tea is totally steeped I'm going to strain it allow it to cool completely and then I'm going to pour it into a pitcher over some beautiful fresh blackberries I'm going to put that pitcher in the refrigerator for at least an hour to let all those yummy flavors come together and then it is ready to enjoy next up on today's iced tea adventure I've got an idea that is a little unexpected but will definitely appeal to you guys out there who love a little bit of spice it's my strawberry jalapeno iced tea and I promise you don't knock it until you've tried it once again I am getting started with some boiling water in a heatproof dish and to that I'm going to add some teabags in this case I'm using some rooibos tea which is one of my very favorites it's just got such a beautiful color it is loaded with antioxidants next I'm going to add about half a jalapeno that I've just sliced up this is going to transfer some nice heat to this tea which is really going to complement those lovely sweet strawberries we're going to be adding in at the end I'm going to add a little more sweetness with some sugar to this recipe you could also do this with some honey or some agave or if you prefer your iced tea unsweetened you can go ahead and leave it out I'm going to stir it all together until the sugar is dissolved and then I'm going to let it steep for five minutes after five minutes I'm going to strain it let it cool and then transfer it into a pitcher with a heaping helping of beautiful strawberries into the fridge this goes and it's going to chill for at least an hour or until all of those yummy flavors are incorporated then it is ready to serve over some ice with some jalapeno garnish I guess we could call this spiced tea get it spice tea iced tea is it landing at all no everyone's laughing my next iced tea celebrates two of the best flavors of summer peach and basil once again I've got some boiling water standing by and to that I'm going to add my teabags in this case I'm using white tea to switch things up a little bit to that I'm going to add some beautiful fresh basil leaves what I'm going to do is just tear them up to help release even more of their incredibly fresh flavor I'm going to sweeten this up with a good squeeze of honey I'm going to stir this all together until the honey is dissolved and then I'm going to steep strain it and let it cool once it's completely cool I'm going to pour it into my pitcher over some beautiful sliced peaches I'm going to give it a good stir and then into the fridge it goes to chill out until that peach and the basil have come together in holy iced tea natural pine last but not least I've got an incredible flavor pairing for you today that is loaded with antioxidants and also totally caffeine free it's my pomegranate hibiscus iced tea for this we are using hibiscus tea which has a really nice floral flavor to it it's beautifully complemented by the tartness of pomegranate juice so we're getting started once again with our boiling water in our pitcher to that we're going to add our hibiscus tea bags and we're going to sweeten this yumminess up with some honey I'm going to stir it until the honey is dissolved let it steep strain it out and then let it cool completely before mixing it with my beautiful pomegranate juice then I'm going to serve it over ice with some beautiful fresh pomegranate which is basically like nature's candy I really hope you guys will give some of these awesome ice tea ideas a try and if you do don't forget to tweet or Instagram me a photo because you know I love seeing your creations remember that all of these yummy recipes are available in the description box below so you can take a

where this came from", "mBCXH46kWWU": "[Music] okay guys here I am starting off with ten cups of boiled water and I have 70 bags here that I am moving around in the water and I'm just gonna do this until my tea bags are completely covered I'm gonna go in with my spoon to kind of help with that then just kind of push those tea bags under the water and then I'm gonna let this sit for about 20 minutes or so and then I'm gonna go in with my sugar this is four cups of sugar and then I'm gonna get that mixed in so now I'm gonna take my tea concentrate which is pretty much what we made and go into my pitcher here with it and then I'm gonna top that off with cold water okay so now I have one of my mason jars here with the handle with some ice in it and I'm gonna make you guys a cup of sweet tea and top that off with a lemon slice so that is pretty much it guys on how I make my homemade sweet tea I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did don't forget to hit that subscribe button and share and until next time you guys take care bye [Music]", "qbHkyk6w9_Q": "hey i'm kate wheaton director of hospitality from first united methodist church and i'm adrian bush director of 50 plus ministries at first united methodist church and today we are celebrating all things eggs and easter with our extravaganza um so let's get started with that little intro song welcome to pandemic pantry we know you might feel fancy but we wrote a new up extravaganza extravaganza extravaganza stay tuned oh that's so fun thank you adrian yeah and then we just have a quick devotional adrien actually picked out something from isaiah excuse me 55 verse 2. yes listen listen to me eat what is good and you will delight in the richest affair yummy well that couldn't be more appropriate for today great for the season um and cooking today we are going to be making lots of foods that have got um easter symbolism in them and we'll explain some of that as we go along so we're making an italian easter bread we're going to do a wreath and we're going to do some individual presentations that you can use on your easter table we are dying eggs too to go in those so that's really it's beautiful really fun then we're going to do easter brownies just throw all your um wait whatever's points yeah they are yes gooey gooey delicious and covered in chocolate eggs so yummy yummy we're doing a delicious deviled eggs just a um not to their southern tradition everybody loves at a party we've got a flowerpot brownie so actually cooking in a flower pot a little springtime happiness and we'll show you some ways to um to interpret that recipe and make that your own and then last but not least we're going to do an english hot cross bun and uh we're actually going to do a chocolate and orange hot cross bun so just stay along and um let's get ready yay okay so we are getting ready to dye our eggs for our italian easter bread now you're usually familiar with dyeing the hard-boiled eggs but these are actually raw eggs look how pretty they're going to be so we just have cool water a squat of vinegar and i'm just using just little food colorings that i had in the in the cupboard so we're doing a blue one in there as you can tell we're doing pink i have that on my hands and the longer you stay in there obviously the longer it's going to color and then this is just another little liquid um food coloring it's just cold water just stir some of that in i've put as i say a little bit of vinegar and then i'm just going to stir that around i'm going to go somehow helps it stick but it's going to take a minute or two but we'll leave those in there and we can come back and check them i might just put a little bit more in there and then while those are dying we are going to start making our italian bread thank you goodness very pale but you can see that's already beginning to take some color these have been in here maybe five or ten minutes so not a tool long to wake um and you don't want to do that too far in advance because obviously the eggs are raw not like when you've hard-boiled them they don't have a long shelf life after you've messed with them so that's it for dyeing eggs all right and now we're gonna make our italian easter bread um we are gonna make a brioche dough and we're going to use the dough hook and our mixer to do this if you don't have either of these um you can work it by hand but obviously you're in for a um it's going to take you a little bit longer so let's pop our day hook on the ingredients for this are we've got um you'll have the ingredients to print out but i think we've got two thirds of a cup of milk and we've got two tablespoons of butter which has been sitting on the side here so it's melty and smooth i'm just going to stick that on a over the stove for a second just to melt it and get it to blood heat you could just pop it in the microwave but i'm happy putting that there for a second and we're going to look at the other ingredients that we're going to be using today so we are going to take a cup of all-purpose flour add that in there we've got a quarter of a cup of sugar so just tip that in at the side of the bowl sugar helps feed the yeast but then in contrast we have a teaspoon of salt and salt sort of stops the yeast working so you want to put them on opposite sides of the bowl in here and then our yeast packet just check your date there's always a a good by date on the back of your yeast check it's not one you bought early on in the pandemic that's been sitting at the back of the back of the cupboard like the one that we used earlier you want a good active yeast and then you want to tip that into here so that it's not on either the sugar or the salt so you've sort of got three like a triangle your ingredients in three different places so as you can see our milk has warmed and our butter is melted and i can still touch the bottom of the pan it's it's not super hot so i'm gonna put my mixer down switch it lock it switch it on and pull my milk in down the side [Music] the recipe says to stir this let's see it says to give this about 125 strokes if you were doing it by hand so i think we can just guesstimate that for a minute i'm going to stuff it for a second and just wipe down that flour there's not a lot in my bowl because there it goes make sure it's all together mmm and if you could smell that you could smell the yeast um that lovely warm yeasty smell and you can see that's quite a wet a wet dough it tells me to add another half a cup of flour so i'm going to stir that in and then to add my two eggs and wait for that to get incorporated before i add the eggs because i'm going to get lumps my eggs just gonna lightly break them up actually gonna put a little bit more flour because there we go so we've got about two cups of flour in there we're just gonna let it do its thing so this is going to keep going for approximately 10 minutes but we will check back in periodically so you can see how it's doing so we are going to turn this off so you can have a look you can see that our dough is much getting much better and if you've watched great british bake off you know you want to do the window pane test like where you can stretch your dough and see through it without it breaking so i would say we're just going to give this a couple more minutes it's got a lot of elasticity and it's almost done hard to believe that it got there but it did just sprayed a bowl with some oil just lightly coated i'm laughing because the dog is in the front of the frame here so we've sprayed it and lift our dough out it is still sticky but that's okay we're gonna pop it into the bowl flip it one time and then i'm just gonna cover that closely or tightly i should say with my saran wrap saran wrap i got my cling film there it goes and i like to write the time on it that i put it in so for us right now that's it and i'm just gonna leave that to one side for about an hour to double in size and then once it's doubled in size dump that on you're gonna have something that looks like this adrian and i are gonna knock this down and i'll show you what that means in a second and we're gonna start to braid it into our wreath and then place our dyed eggs inside i'm so excited making bread black was obviously a good choice for flour okay all right so here is our lemon dress so lemon so we are going to put a traditional italian seasoning in here we may use a nice extract i'm not terribly familiar with using mine let's have a smell let's take the top off but i can tell you as you can still see from my hands that wear a glove when you do your eggs because i think i might be like you have pink hands for a while you might be looking biscuit for a while oh yes so annie's is like an anisd taste like licorice so you can use raisins um i'm actually using cranberries because it's what i had and i like cranberries me too um and i have got some almonds some flaked toasted almonds about half a cup of each and we are just going to put our seasoning in there actually so it can start to grab a little teaspoon and then give that a mix up one teaspoon i remember gobstoppers as a child did you have god yeah that turned your mouth that bright red color yes both the smell and the hands reminded me of that [Music] i never have been a fan of black licorice i guess i can't imagine a world where that people like it so it's funny i like red licorice do you like brandy yes i don't think we had that as an option we just had black licorice and mostly it came in something called licorice all sorts do you know what those are yeah um and they're just um gosh we might just have to get some to share but they're in english an english treat in fact elliot's my son's favorite sweets candy um and you can get yeah they're all different bright colors and um anyway they have black and crushed and they're delicious so moving on um so this has proved so it's more than probably slightly more than doubled its size i'm not sure what pool hollywood has to say about that i think i would say it's lovely so we are knocking it down knocking it down means pushing the air out of it um but i'm going to divide it in half because i are both ready to get our hands in clean hands that we have and we are going to incorporate our fruits and nuts and we have just little extra flour here so we want to be able to shut that drawer there we go flour our surface generously and then half we may not be able to do it all at once but ideally we want half of that filling each okay and we're really just working the dough until we've incorporated it there's not really another reason for this stage so i'm just folding my edges into the middle okay it's my chosen technique okay and stretching it out what would kate do that's what i'm going to ask you myself okay this is where i have to confess i didn't actually measure the ingredients so it's hard to get it all in maybe because we have a little bit too much but the recipe does tell us that it may be challenging to roll with all the goodies in so we want it to taste good so no regrets on my part no me neither so once we've incorporated that each of us needs to roll our piece of dough into a 24 inch rope beach okay so that's some serious rolling mm-hmm all right i think i'm ready go in go in i'm gonna move my baking tray out the edge we were talking about why we chose this italian easter bread and um one because it's very beautiful and two it's got a fair amount of symbolism in it including the fact that it's unleavened the rising is or is this lemon it's left it's lemon which is um rising bread and hence the proofing and um it represents uh christ rising from on the third day and it's gonna be shaped like a crown which represents the crown of thorns that you are during crucifixion yes it has eggs in it which symbolizes new life yes and we are going to braid it now we're actually just writing it in two pieces um but you can braid it in three and that would represent holy trinity yeah it's got a lot of fun elements that you can talk about with your family as you're doing and it's also very hard to roll [Laughter] so i do find myself collecting um the cranberries and almonds as they pop out yes i'm on the struggle bus over it smiling and hoping it looks like it's working really smoothly instantly regretting wearing a black t-shirt i'm baking damn covered in flour but you know we're keeping it real yeah how are you doing i'm feeling that they're rolling it's more of a sort of squeeze and pull and less of a roll it is squeeze and pull yeah so i don't know if i need less perhaps i need a little less flour a bit more traction i'm just trying to keep my stuff in there so why was this at the beginning of the pandemic we need bicep workouts oh here here it goes where's this going okay yeah yours is coming along goodness it's coming the mine's going all right but 24 inches doesn't work isn't it i think there's room for adaptation i'm trying come on gosh maybe wishing i hadn't done curls this morning you need curls this week yes i bought some new weights i can't walk i'll do some weights well that's good i went to walmart to try to buy a few weights the other day and they were completely out completely yes they were on special at target oh i think i might have to go by there today i need blackout curtains we still don't have curtains now that we've sprung forward uh i am gonna need to get some bedroom curtains i mean now that we have it's gonna be more helpful because at five o'clock i'm not waking up with the sun in my eyes yes although it is lovely it's meant to wake up to the sun singing yeah i do enjoy that i do too i like getting up early too when we first moved into this house there was a cardinal that um flew into our bedroom window daily oh my god continuously early in the morning so we wake and then somebody told me you hang something shiny oh and i guess eventually he just moved on with his life several weeks that was what we woke up to he just thought he was going to be able to get in that inside i guess like we must be in the country you have really clean windows i guess you're not for long with me on the inside get going okay i know that's not close i'm just wondering how far away i am oh same okay so that's actually 14 inches just to give us a rough idea of where we're headed you're somewhere similar japan so yeah so talk amongst yourselves just i wouldn't say rolly it's not like rolling yeah because when i roll i lose my ingredients it doesn't like it's it's slipping need some tips paul where are you hold on yes my husband and i have been watching a lot of great british bake off lately and he is longing for me to bake him some of those cakes yes i've been watching that new series of nadia bakes and yeah she definitely has films yes it is and there's something i want to try maybe we can try it together she has a upside down cake i guess you might call it yeah yeah there's one way you pour in the bottom and then put the top on and then when it cooks it kind of flips its way ever yes yes oh my gosh it looks does well once we've got this underways we're going to start our brownies and we've got some yummy brownies for you okay your wedding i see that no i'm not hurt you are i see you i'm not winning but the gluten as fast as we're rolling it it's if you could do it shrimp it's fun but somebody out there is crazy come on technique people oh yeah sure it'll all be worth it how long twenty-six twenty-four he clicked i'm at seventeen it does smell nice i can smell the anastasia developing something's something's happening [Music] all right and we're back to braid it so let's say pinch our ends together and braiding would perhaps not be quite there twist twist it together and hold that end still and try and amalgamate yes a bit of a two-man job it is two-woman job and then we're gonna twist him round into a circle and pop him on our baking tray and we've just got one of those silicon mats at the bottom it tells me to pinch that together sometimes to stick dough on dough if you wet it a little bit um that will help it just like you would with pastry it will help it to stick together all nice you better put an egg right there you would be able to see that funny bit yeah all right so we are going to let that rise i think that's a bit steam to poke our eggs into it yeah i can double check there it says um yeah and then let it rise so we're going to let that rise and come back and check on it in a little bit so off it goes okay so now the moment this has been sitting on the side i've peeked at it she's not squealed and i get to look at it now ready steady oh my gosh so it's popped right up i would say that that's doubled in size it's very exciting yeah about i'm going to re-melt the butter like ice skating with her brush and i'm going to stand here and tell you say that we have the oven um yeah turned on to 350 degrees and we are going to brush it with butter and then slide it in and bake it for 35 minutes gonna be good uh one of our other service opportunities for the great 50 days is writing letters to veterans so if that's something that you're interested in our trusty friend skip dotharov has been helping me on that and he has been awesome and so we're super excited to present that to the congregation as a service opportunity as you know veterans this could really um brighten their days so yes that's a lovely thing to do yeah and do people um they just pick them they can use their own stationery do they have you can use your own stationary or the church can provide it to you we will be providing envelopes and of course the mailing labels so all you need to do is um there will be instructions on this but um you're going to email sydney carol barnhart and then she is going to connect you with your veteran with the labels and the stationery if you need it that's fantastic i'm going to nestle that back in that little cheeky chap okay so remember these eggs were raw so they're going to bake in their shells in the oven why does that sound so delicious doesn't that sound good so wish us luck oh bye yay so now while that's proving we are going to make delicious chocolate um easter time brownies very decadent so we've got a 20 centimeter so about an eight inch um square i didn't have a tin but we're going to just bake in this station that will be fine and adrian is going to line it sometimes they're a little wider at the top than the bottom to get a good fit she's going to measure the width and just do two strips of paper that get criss-cross to go down inside it and while she's doing that i'm just going to cut my butter we translated those recipes in a slightly odd um odd quantities but we're going to use six ounces six and a half ounces of butter and i'm just adding that to six and a half ounces of dark chocolate and then i am gonna step off the screen for a second and microwave that you could melt it together over a pan of warm water you're more confident so four ounces obviously is one stick and then i'm gonna do half a stick for my six and then just now should i cut this so it's just a square no that's perfect because you really want to be able to lift it up so it's going to do exactly the same to go the other way okay then we're going to help it stay in by spraying the pan with oil so away from the microwave i go yes and i just want to say that hopefully you're participating in the 50 the great 50 days that we have going on at the church is very exciting we um have all these different types of mission projects that you can participate in there's so many service projects that you and your family could do um or what have you i mean i think there's there's something for everybody there and our knitting group is actually doing 50 handmade items of comfort and so if you wanted to knit a prayer shawl or crochet or if you wanted to do a um a cap for newborn babies or a baby blanket that's what we're doing for that though in stitches group which has been super fun um kate and i have each learned how to make a prayer shawn now we're learning how to knit the baby blanket yes so don't be intimidated if you're a normal knitter or even if you just have a willingness to learn super simple and we're going to have a kind of support check-in every week for you yes and if you've got questions so you don't get stuck and that we can kind of knit with the community together so um yeah i've got several people signed up that that don't know how to knit so i'm really excited it's good um very good okay so this is just had 30 seconds in the microwave remember when you're melting chocolate and butter you don't want to leave it in there until it's melted because that won't happen it will just all freeze up so you stop ahead of the game and then you want to just stir in the heat of the bowl nice we'll just take it to where it wants to be so how about we switch okay we have a bit of a stir it may just need another 10 seconds that looks beautiful so i'm just going to undo agent candy work for one second and spray so i've just got a canola oil spray spray the inside you can't really overdo it i don't think there's nothing worse than your lovely project being stuck and also that just helps the paper stop slipping so that as you're putting your nice mixture in and push it all the way down into the corners so you don't get ugly ugly corners you want a nice sharp okay and then that's ready for our delicious brownie mix what do you think adrian does it need a little more time it's hard to say i still have quite a few chunks in here it might need a little bit more so i can give it another dance item yes thank you okay and while i'm doing that let's think what you could do um you could go ahead and just sieve the cocoa flour into that bowl all right great and by seb she means sift they call it sieving in the uk and this is what you learn when you work for months and months with your friend on a show where you end up having to translate for each other it funny that we still learn so many words yeah and then we sing together so often yes um but yes so we're these brownies are gonna be so good i'm gonna have to eat at least a little bit of one of them okay okay we're gonna do the cocoa chips yes we're gonna do the cocoa too so not a lot of course as you know when you do a brownie we've got about an ounce and a half of cocoa it's just it's very lightweight so it doesn't um get a lot of it smells good okay we're kind of prepping early on um because now we're gonna backtrack we've got this which we want to cool our flour is sifted and ready to go and i'm just going to grab the electric whisk and uh we're going to whisk up our eggs and our sugar together okay all right so we are going to crack our three large eggs yum we have eggs in it and on top of it and while i'm doing this you know you could just go ahead i know it's very hard but could you open the cream eggs yes i can well and by open i mean actually unwrap let's do two large eggs and then wrap five small ones okay and the reason you want to get on and do those is because we're gonna partially bake our brownies take it out decorate the top and then slide it back in so that they you know if you put one at the top they'll just cook down into your hair so two of these two over here um okay so eggs and my sugar i'm using golden cross [Music] and the other job is preparation after you do those is to grab um you know a small handful of those other eggs those are the little cabbage mini chocolate eggs pop them in here and then you could use a rolling pin from the back you want to just lightly crush okay um so you can still sort of like crack it [Music] just a little bit yes perfect and that's how they'll look kind of natural and natural um we are whisking this is not quite done yet we're actually going to whisk it kind of to the ribbon which means that you will see a little trail that stays on the top [Music] okay we're gonna pause whisking for a second because we need to nestle our eggs into our bread so everyone's going to bring that food and those easter eggs that we had showed you how to die it says to use five of them blue and pink blue pink reminds me we had a gender reveal party this weekend for my eldest son and his wife so henry and natasha yeah so blue or pink it was pink second granddaughter and i'm so excited okay so it says just to pull this apart and to nestle our hex in whoa i did say you should do that yes you did so go ahead okay and then it will hopefully grow up around it this is so neat i don't want to break an egg or mess up this is nestle enough isn't it is it there yeah people could be vicious you use the braids to wrap yes right here and that's make the see like a pocket there we go okay we need blue okay whatever you like and what another green one maybe we'll just stick that one down and then green yes cute okay and then we're gonna cover it back up and let it continue to grow a little bit longer and i'm gonna i think we're pretty much here it's wanted doubled in volume and my ribbon is almost done [Music] ribbon is a new whisk but i have to say kitchenaid i don't love it it's a little slow um okay so now to our plumped up mixture we are going to stir in and we don't need this shifter anymore what do you sieve what do you use that word for do you serve anything i don't i don't i think rocks to look for eating maybe maybe rocks i'm not sure but i know that we sift in bacon this is that's a sifter different strokes for different countries all right so there we go our chocolate is in almost in it looks lovely oh well you can't see his little face now we've got little bunny but okay and then you and you come okay floppity flop just all in and there we go now we're just gonna build that in so true brownie tradition lots of sugar not much flour hmm lots of sugar there's no way of having a healthy brownie you're either having a brownie or you're right which we've had to accept and grapple with but some days you just some days you need a brownie or a pizza last night my husband and i got a salad and pizza i ate a lot of salad i ate two little pieces of pizza it did it was delicious and i have no regrets [Laughter] so that's our new motto no regrets okay so do you want to hold that for me which is actually more important than it sounds flat and then we just pop that in goodness we can't lick the bowl well not on camera actually having said we have these sweet spatulas they are sweet they're not very flexible hmm i've got a lot of give hold on we're going to upgrade upgrade getting a flexible fat look no one that's like a whole portion yes it is that's quite a difference yes it is there we go yay and then we can slide that we've got our bottom oven set for 350 degrees we're going to set a timer for 20 minutes and we'll be right back to show you what's in here so we're cutting these in half while our brownies are in the oven just the best we can so that when we lie them on the top one for me one for the cake um so we're just going to have an assortment of deliciousness and as we cut it into the squares you know there'll be something for everybody not everyone will fight hopefully over just the big egg there we go let's set those yes you don't want them straight out the fridge i can tell you that because they're quite hard to cut all right so we are ready and just waiting on the timer oh my goodness so we've had our 20 minutes here it comes mostly done but it is still a little wobbly and nice and dense so we want to arrange these oh my just any which way on the top um [Music] just no wrong answers on how to do this and if you're um you know a reese's peanut butter person you could use any eggs i do think the colored shells are attractive and you want to put some okay nobody wants to be the person that doesn't get an egg on the top of them we are just look at that and then this is just going to slide back in the oven for just a generous five minutes i think there i would say there's a little something for everybody so back it goes for five more minutes and it goes and i must say i would think that's been five minutes let's set this for 35 going going once let's set it for 30 and then check it and then i should think this has had its magic extra five minutes let's have a little look at our melty brownies my gosh so really that has just allowed them to be glued to the top really they've oh look it's still got a little jiggle oh my gosh so we now need to just let that cool as hard as that is not touch it and then we'll come back to you and show you how to cut it so we're going to slide that to one side and we actually have a second italian bread dough that we're going to make into some smaller wreaths so we're going to have a go at that while this is cooling it looks amazing i can't look at it [Laughter] right yum so you watched us make that day before there it is we put it in at 11 41 so oh well our time so it's had about an hour an hour and 20 minutes um and you can see that that is beautifully doubled yes flour our surface and we're going to divide it into four lumps four lumps well let's just do it all right tip tip tip go buddy go whoa that'll be three beautiful [Music] mmm oh it's so fluffy yes doesn't that feel different actually the last one so let me think about that so just give it a little need and then each one of these is going to be a little braid so i guess i'm going to cut these into two okay we can do what we did before or you can cut it into three if you'd rather do i'm going to try one of each one as a third okay remember it's like trying to figure out how much hair to use in each of my braids we're going to be even okay so we can learn from this that i followed the recipe much more closely second time around um and had a little more faith in the process so sometimes that's just what we need i i'm not in danger of not following a recipe i mean i'm staring at the thing the whole time she's a lot more brave than i am like let's just add it add too much more flour now you just have to believe that it will it will come together yes and how long are we going for on these okay so we actually have under here we've rolled out look some sweet individual ones so these are adrians and these are mine so this was our second brioche dough so we have done some of them with two strips some with three yes and i think what where they were about six to eight inches yes i would say pitch the end and the dough was a little bit easier to work with at this time yes we were saying if you follow the directions exactly which i didn't in my first one i think that's why it was harder for us to roll for us i had put a little too much flour snapping back but this one was was perfect so we are now going to pop them under here and let them rise until they're double those would be good place settings yes they're really really beautiful actually yes we had talked about that so if you lay your table you'll see when they're done you can put one in each place and people can just enjoy that with their appetizer or for breakfast i mean it's kind of versatile you can you do it any brunch can't wait till it's finished and when they're done we're going to drizzle a little white icing and sprinkles on them they're going to be super festive oh i love it yes okay so we just need a cup of tea but let's show you what we're doing so our um our little ones look have proved to double in size now and note just things that we're learning as we're doing this is you know just to be a little careful with our coloring as you put it in because it obviously does stain everything it touches but we're gonna as i said before we're gonna be drizzling this pretty white icing and sprinkles over the top so i don't think it's gonna be a problem so we're gonna slide these in the oven for about 20 minutes 20 minutes 20 minutes again 350 degrees and they go oh my goodness okay so pretty so we've got some confectioners sugar i've just got maybe a cup of confectioners sugar i'm just going to slide this under here a slightly quicker clean up look how pretty they turned out they are beautiful they're so colorful so we just have milk um just a tablespoon of milk a little bit more maybe and icing sugar you can just kind of guesstimate and a little bit of vanilla let's say we're drizzling i'm gonna do the big one and then we're putting um easter sprinkles on so yum i like the big one although it will benefit from a little decoration but i think it's gonna make a pretty centerpiece just don't drizzle it on the eggs and you want it so that it runs a little bit but you don't want it to run off all right i'm going to get these sprinkles hey winston a little puppy love down here ever hopeful there we go a few sprinkles for you right and then adrian is going to have a go so you're two you're those two not that it matters particularly but aren't they pretty they turned out just they couldn't be more perfect so cute yeah i can do one just a little bit of happy there's no real right or wrong whatever looks good to you and then these are slightly smaller sprinkles i think these are all little bunnies i'm gonna think all my bunnies and chicks around the edge obviously you can't make these too far in advance because you've got your egg in the middle but look how pretty oh i'll sprinkle [Music] yes yes i can always make a bit more okay there it goes no not as good at glazing as cake [Music] yeah that's enough just a tiny bit just to touch yeah those ones have got more pink in them maybe those are so sweet all right so we're going to plate these up so that you can see them um which one should we do let's do your pretty pretty green one so we're gonna adrian will come around and take a picture and put it on top of that so you can imagine that on your place setting at the table for everybody just how pretty that would be and then this big one go on your easter buffet let's move the stickiness away winston we will princeton's had a bit of a haircut it is still winston if you don't recognize him he doesn't look like the same dog but he eats his personality is just the same but yes he's a perhaps he's had a little more than we would have liked taken off but we learnt something yes okay so that's still a little bit sticky but there is our pretty easter bread that lovely and you could i don't know what else you could do you could put a little posie of panties and the little lord really just sit that on the table so i am excited to tuck into that and i can't wait to try it i know let me get a little closer our brownies are still chilling but things are going to be the next look at these yeah so those were all and then we did do some you might like to look at these while you're here we did some easter eggs that we dyed naturally so these ones have been dyed with onion skins and you know the greek easter eggs are traditionally red but this was a greek it was under a greek website for how to make a more organic greek easter egg so um i have a challenge for adrian i challenge you to the great easter egg contest okay okay come and join me and i'll tell you a bit more all right so greek easter is at the beginning of may um but these easter eggs just were fun when we were researching as we're doing our extravaganza so i'm gonna give you that one okay um and it said that they dye them red to symbolize the blood of christ shred on the grass that they're trying to get that from a naughty dog no that they are they represent the stone that was rolled away from the front of the tube and then cracking them of course represents new life and resurrection so they have a little fun game uh in their traditions where you you try and tap each other's eggs in england that would be conquerors you know when you try and get the champion winning eggs so we're going to tap our eggs and the idea is to crack the other persons without cracking your eggs so i guess you go first okay oh i did it it didn't crack here but it cracked me sorry there we go game over i'm just gonna have no but i've cracked mine again i'm not cracked oh adrian is the supreme winner of easter egg dye but we dyed them just in a more organic way so just to recap on that these were dyed with red onion skins so when i was peeling and shopping for something else catch all the skins put them in water with some vinegar brought it to the boil boiled it for like 20 minutes then put my eggs in nestled them all down cooked the eggs took it off the heat cooled it and left it in the fridge overnight and then they came out these beautiful mottled colors and you can rub oil on them just you know different i think you can make patterns you can tie string around before you put them in to make pretty pictures but this is what we have yes a little bit of easter trivia from yes to you that's right okay so now we're gonna make um these delicious flowerpot chocolate chip brownies so a little taste of spring just a different kind of presentation i bought these little teeny tiny terracotta cubes yes i don't if you've got some in the garage you know buy some new ones um and you can see there is a way you'll see online you can like season them with oil and bake them and you can do that like three times in order to season your pot so that you can bake directly in it but today we've just washed and dried adrien is just going to oil them with vegetable oil and we're going to stick just your regular little cupcake paper down inside um and honestly we're probably going to eat our muffin from inside our little flower pot so the fact that it doesn't easily pop out wouldn't be a problem um if you don't have those and you still want to make them you know you could do a fun little presentation with just a ramekin and of course you can make them in like a little tea cup too a lot of people like to make that's true i brought you a teacup candle from my honeymoon i love little sound objects and teacups and that is by my bed with water in it right let's move on um okay so we've got just plain flour i used an unbleached flour um so that's just going in there we've got four and a half ounces we've got just some cocoa powder we have a dog um who's whooping in the hallway and we have a teaspoon full of baking powder so that's going to go in there too i'm just going to mix those rounds this is just super super easy we've got um i'm using a golden caster sugar um i have to check double check with our recipe but we'll have the recipe at the bottom for you but i think we've got about three and a half ounces of sugar so that's going in let's give that a little stir so all our dry ingredients combined in the bowl we have one egg and i have 100 milliliters which is about four ounces of milk i'm gonna whisk my egg dip it in my milk and then really just quickly combine that in there sweet i'm trying to cover these and oils they they do soak it up quite well i'm gonna go all the way down with these yeah just the best you can so that the mixture prep stays in rather than going around the side and i'll help you in a second okay so you want to combine that lumpy's okay you know for muffins lumpy muffins and then we're gonna stir in chocolate chips but not these ones or is it these ones and the reason i'm looking is we bought some of those new like disco chocolate chips that have the glitter in them and we were going to try and use those to decorate the top and i was just second guessing myself but these are regular so these are two ounces of chocolate chips that looks a fairly stiff mixture i have to say i'm just going to put a little dribble a little dribble of water just to lighten that up a little bit and what's the difference if you were brownies versus muffins like how do you what's the consistency change there you probably got more chocolate and a muffin i mean a muffin is is lighter and then the brownie is like that dense heavy chocolate you've got a lot more sugar and much typically bigger than a tiny bit of flour here we've got more flour as our base okay okay yeah interesting yeah it was as quick as that yeah so i'm going to start i think this may not be as quick as i would like it putting this stuff in here but we're going to just use a little teaspoon and wash my hands i think clean finger will be the easiest way to do it now some of these the oil really likes to soak in some not not as much yes and i think that's why you know they encourage you to season your pots ahead of time because that terracotta is so porous yeah that it does do that but we're going to hope that it's doing something oh yes it is i'm sure and it says it will make about 10 of these so oh look how cute oh that was delicious sometimes we've practiced ahead of time when we do this and sometimes we wing it and today is a winged day yes um looks like a solid recipe which is far more exciting than the practice to head today isn't it yes yes it adds a sentence [Laughter] certain sense of tension around here okay now we're in chewbacca mode oh so chocolate would be my first choice of flavor to do this obviously because you want it to kind of look like mud hello really giant winston it's just like an overturned flower pot [Music] and then we're going to put some melted chocolate on the top and i ordered some beautiful butterflies to decorate with so i'm looking forward to popping these together yes i feel like spring has sprung a little in our garden i'm sure for you too i planted bulbs for the first time this year yes for the first time because we had quite a lot in our garden but i don't know they don't always bloom every year and they're not reliable you know my daffodils are so many last year i have not not a one that's yet but now i have beautiful red tulips and um orange tulips and our flower pots and of course adrian is all about gardening she spent the last weekend at the insco house yes we had a good little two-day gardening extravagant extravaganza of our own and um we i got a lot done and if you drive past the property you'll see i am yeah thinking that that is it so we think they look great we've got our oven set to 350. so fingers crossed chocolaty fingers crossed 30 fingers crossed about 15 minutes here we go yeah oh so i think our timer just went off in all right oh super cute [Music] so there they are right back to working on our flower pots adrian look how cute they are so cute and if you wondered they do come out look good and they look like cute sweet little muffins but considering that so here's our this is the disco chocolate that i talked about as having bought now i might save our money i don't know perhaps when it dries it will be sparkly but for now it's not and then we went on to amazon and bought these little um butterflies edible butterflies i think they were maybe um five five dollars for 24 butterflies and they're made of rice paper and they're flat but to give them some you can kind of bend them and they have a bit of a snap like they've broken but but if you break them it will smell like a real mushroom like a real butterfly so we are simply going to we're gonna do one and adrian's gonna design we're just going to put melty chocolate on the top a little butterfly that is precious and then we have our little chenille chickens and other chenille chickens how cute with eggs yes with a couple of eggs that is cute i've got some different sizes look at that that shoes monarch let's say again it's just this is three ounces of melted chocolate just going on the top like that here's a bigger oh that's pretty one okay ready this one's more fragile it's got a lot of little fractures all right you go for it oh this one's pretty bad oh my goodness that is so cute presentation you maybe could put some garden flowers in the middle and then put your butterflies around the outside of these but hopefully that will give you an idea you know you can make all sorts of things in flower pots you could do i've seen cinnamon rolls you can put cinnamon roll dough down inside and make a fun cinnamon roll i love a good cinnamon roll you could do you know bread dough you could either make your dough in here and then pop it in here let it rise and cook it that way that would be a fun way to serve anything wouldn't it yes do you think two's two straps we could do a flurry what about two butterflies here here's our a wannabe flowerpot but still pretty that's cute there it goes so that's what we have and i think you know you could really i had some primulas over here so my hat would be the operative they faded they were the most beautiful bright pink but you know you can add a little you want to get really creative you could add a little garden flower to the top you could just put a fresh pansy on the top would be and you could even do that instead of shall we run and just have a little flour on the top so we'll let's have those are really sweet so that is just another fun spring idea to add to today's baking all right so while there's a cooling um we are going to make dappled eggs a good southern traditional favorite um so we've already hard-boiled our eggs they've had about 10 minutes um and in fact i've peeled them as well and then adrian is going to just cut them in half you know there'll be people who haven't made these before you want to cut them the long way and then we're going to scoop out the yolks from the middle and then our recipe for this one um we're gonna add just a quarter of a cup of mayonnaise and i'm gonna just do it in the mixer over here so a quarter of a cup of mayonnaise our yolks and then i've got um four ounces of cream cheese and in fact we've got a cream cheese goat's cheese mixture that we're using today but just plain cream cheese would do and then the part that makes it deviled and i were talking about that earlier is um these seasonings so traditionally you would use just the most basic part would be the black pepper and the cayenne cayenne coin cayenne cayenne um and of course we were looking this up so it dates back to the 17th century i think when they would devil food and of course these would have been you know quite expensive spices back back in those days true um and now we like to add a little worcester sauce um we're using paprika and a mustard oh sorry yes we were talking about some of the other things you can devil yes like that would be the sort of the the list of things that you would need to add to make it difficult yes yes bloody mary's we talked about and that turns out i've had deviled bloody mary's but didn't know it and is that related to devil's food cake no no that's devil food cake as opposed to devil's food cake okay so um you know devil food cake has got it's not like a red velvet cake that's got the red food dye that deviled food cakes just rich and dark um and in fact it's that reaction between the baking powder and the baking soda it helps give it that deep dark rich color and it's just sort of devilishly good oh it was definitely good and i can't i can't think that these ingredients on top of devil's food cake would be very good no but devil crab would be good oh yes lobster seafood salmon general lends itself to that and i love that you've put that on that um oh but we are going to do just a little i love what you've done there but no um we had talked about buying some quests to go at the bottom which you call alpha elf alpha um because i don't actually have a devil's food plate to put them on but if you give it some texture at the bottom to stop them like wobbling around um then as you head to the table with your plate you won't lose one um so we were trying to see what we had available so what we've got are butters so i'm going to chiffonade it so very very fine and while i'm doing that actually if you want to take those to the sink and just wash them okay and then we're going to pat them dry with some paper towels so that we haven't got that kind of ugly yolk residue yes oh i made it challenging with the largest knife and the smallest chopping board that i am um but that sounds like something i would do yeah nothing if not creative in this kitchen okay so this is just very fine so this is going to be our kind of grass at the bottom so the alpha alpha shoots are pretty [Music] so while adrian is finishing off with those i'm just going to whizz up the filling that's going to go in here so again just to recap we've got mayonnaise our egg yolks we've got cream cheese we've used pepper cayenne a little pinch of paprika splash of worcester sauce squeeze of mustard you know just that precise and if you didn't want to get the mixer out you could just use a fork to do it but i want to pipe mine today so i really do want it to be smooth here we go [Music] add a little salt that was the one thing i didn't have on that list there it is squeezed its sea salt actually ran out of molden that was our favorite remember we had been using all the pandemics we need to get some more and i usually order that on amazon all right fantastic so there it is just pureed up so i just have a star nozzle in my piping bag that i folded over so i can put my hand inside to get that here's my bunny spatula oh get in there get in the mood okay thank you for doing that is that do you want more on there no i think that's okay if you have some of those i might be able to trade out some uglies i might slightly rearrange see okay one more attractive one one more evenly i don't know the yolk was more than the center oh they are going to look amazing either way yes this smells tasty it does smell quite there we go all right so just sitting down in there and just go down and do a spiral beautiful so it just jazzes them up a little bit my husband and i have been watching a lot of british great british bake off and he kept we've both said to each other at least once now we need a piping bag oh yes in your easter basket winston agrees and i personally whenever i'm doing this i would do a couple more eggs than i want to serve because i'm probably putting back in a generous amount these are so old-fashioned to me i just love them though they're so cute they're timeless delicious they're timeless and who doesn't love a good deviled egg that's true we can probably just go look two more two more pretties and then these can be just they well they might just fit in the middle all right wait's not one notch there it is last one perfect now if you wanted to you could sprinkle you know a little crumbled bacon on the top you could put a little blue cheese i think that's quite popular on the top um but we are gonna just put good old-fashioned pinch of cayenne of pimento oh wait no what is that paprika paprika smoked paprika but yes it's just just your classic little party eggs i think they're gonna be delicious and then i think you pop them in the fridge just to firm up beautiful but if you haven't tried making them they're pretty simple and they'll be delicious yay now we're just going to finish off these hot cross buns we started earlier this morning i have a bread maker which i don't use as often as i wish i did i know a lot of people had um fun with their bread makers during the pandemics so maybe you're one of those i am so we just used the raisin dough setting to make our hot cross buns it tells you all that in the recipe um and instead of making a citrusy one i've got orange zest in there but we're going to add chocolate chips to now we've been busy cooking this morning i think maybe it beeped when we weren't listening but normally when it beeps you tip your fruit in and then it finishes off the dough so we're just going to incorporate our chocolate chips ourselves in a second um traditionally our hot cross buns have got citrus fruits in them but they're really i find them a little harder to find in your supermarket when it's not christmas time you know the candied peel that you might use for a fruitcake yes um it's not like the candy ginger kind of well kind of it comes in that clear plastic tub and it has the glass a cherries in it sometimes too and it's all sort of syrupy um so that's delicious in the hot cross bun i made some the other day when we were practicing and i used cranberries and um what did i use cranberries and apricots oh that sounds good so that was that was really good let's say the traditional is the citrus and raisins but today we're having orange and chocolate chips yeah so yum yum that'll be good too so there's our yummy dough and i think we'll do one orange yes i think we'll do what eddie and i did last time and hide and conquer so i'm [Laughter] um so you take that piece okay and we're just gonna incorporate our chocolate chips um as we haven't making a bowl we've got about half there's not really a right or wrong way to do that just the best we can under the circumstances that's right we're doing our very best that's right give that a little shove now this is going to get a second pruning so it's lovely and squishy but um so it's going to make 12 hot cross buns so we've got two giant ones right now so i need to cut mine into six and as will you okay so six we're not going to get the scales out we're going to do just our best guesstimate poor hollywood is not here he's not here there we go and then we're going to roll them into individual little dough balls so i would just bring my edges in okay from the outside just to make a smooth little ball and then we're going to place them just a little ways apart so as they prove they join together oh these aren't the same size there we go i'm sure mine are not perfect doing our best we're pinching it in from the outside giving it a little roll and popping it on could have something it's fun to find over here i know so we've got our oven on um it's quite hot i think we've got our oven at 425 okay okay i'm just trying to compare these sciences this one has a lot of it's mainly chocolate chips in there yeah okay maybe don't squeeze them squeeze them squeeze them and okay back in those escapee purple chocolate chips this is a little like i'm going to do the um italian bread i'm going to keep all those lovely nuts inside there you're gonna be able to tell which ones are mine and which ones are kids look at that it's so ugly it might have to help you just a tiny bit because you need a smooth top so look so yes that's good but it needs to be that way out okay okay i'll just give them a little round and round so so put them down and just lightly pull your edges to the middle it doesn't need quite so much love okay that's gosh this one looks like a garlic from doctor who so many chocolate chips and it's going to be a good one mm-hmm okay a mommy one and a daddy one one i know that's definitely they're definitely not uniform perhaps we'll put the little ones on the ends towards the middle let's see a little protection that's better you know why you guys are not both the same size because i'm not good at cutting she did seven so we've got like a little extra so you know what we can just marry these two together okay that makes sense as to why you are struggling grandpa easy fix okay so now an oiled piece of um cling film over the top that would work we're just gonna put a fresh clean tea towel on there okay yes and why are they called hot cross buns they're going to have this beautiful cross on the top obviously just symbolized symbol of easter crucifixion so once they've risen a little more we're going to make a flower like a flower and water paste that you maybe make the child for glue and drizzle it over the top to make a cross and then you bake them and then we'll glaze them so under they go and we're going to leave those to proof for about 45 minutes or until they've doubled in size okay doubled so now we're going to make the crosses mixture the mixture for the crosses for the hot cross buns so this is just the two ounces of plain flour that we reserved at the beginning and we're adding in just enough water now you can do this two ways you can add in enough water to make a pliable paste that you can roll and then slice little strips um to make your crosses to get on the top i'm going to do it like another old-fashioned way and i'm going to make this a runnier mixture see you could stop here and roll this out and cut strips or you can keep going and you think it won't work but then it does don't know did you used to use it like this as a child for um when we we don't have glue and we make a glue project or we do papier mache or paper mache as you would call it we would use this mixture we would just do all these strips i just i don't remember not having elmer's or as my nephew used to call it because of the bottle cow glue well this might not be wrong right back in the day used to use this for a variety of projects i guess if you don't have glue this works just great all right so that's almost looks kind of lumpy doesn't it and that's because it is okay now you can put that in a piping bag or if you don't have a piping bag handy i'm just going to tip mine into a little sandwich bag it's messy and um making the bronzes doesn't take a long time but you'll be glad you're done when you finish be one less thing to wash up so you can zip like that for a second so it doesn't run everywhere and we'll bring our buns forward all right so these have more or less doubled in size and they're going to grow more still in the oven so now just going to snip the tip all right and we're going to go across and down to make these crosses on the top of our hot cross buns too over it goes and then you'll see i think they look so cute [Music] definitely have that homemade look but they'll be sweet when they're done how neat there we go right-handed is so much better i don't know why i was trying to do it i guess camera angles you're probably trying to yield to the camera very good yay so now those are going to go into our hot 425 degree oven um and we'll be back to see how they turned out hi we have just pulled our hot cross buns out of the oven they smell so good and until they create that technology i'll just tell where you can smell on camera's video it smells really good and they smell like obviously chocolate and orange i may have been a little cheap with my um here would you like to continue pasting so this is golden syrup that we're pasting on the top might be a little bit sticky but you're not going to have enough so just do them whole and i'm going to go and heat a bit more up okay you could probably use corn syrup yeah instead or you can make a sugar glaze just by you know cooking up your two tablespoons of sugar and reducing it down until it's all sticky yes okay this is a great sheet have decided to start a hot cross buns family it's the grand the mom and dad and grandpa oh and the baby that we talked about before okay i'm going to pop this thing join together and they really did just take that 15 minutes of cooking that was exactly right yes kate says there's a hot cross buns song so i'm gonna grab my ukulele and see if we can sing it in a minute look at that that is a hot crossband song and this is how i remember it going it goes hot cross buns hot cross buns one a penny two a penny hot cross buns if you have no daughters give them to your sons one a penny two a penny hot cross buns and i'm not sure if there's another barbecue but that's just it yeah so this is our little the supermarkets you know for us he might feel like a bonus brush oh thick and they are the most delicious now you can freeze them um but i would wait and glaze them once they come out the freezer delicious once they've cooled a little bit we'll just pull one open another just fresh butter on the top would be delicious um and then should they not all be gone today you know a day or two you've got a slightly stale one left you just split it and pop it in the toaster oh my gosh delicious they um they are they're lovely so we've made several treats today um we've we've filmed ahead so not everything is all in one place to show you but we've got some photographs um but uh yeah hot cross buns i hope you enjoy them yay well we are going to hop along now [Laughter] um but i'm so glad you joined us hopefully that you will come and join us at church we have many services over there easter period all of the details for which are on our website and facebook page but in the meantime thanks for joining us for extravaganza yeah okay okay and thanks for joining us for extravaganza [Music] five", "3dObh-JKk-w": "It's hot outside. Forks are melting. Lasagna noodles spice racks are falling apart. The only way to cool down is with a drink made of boiling hot water. The first step to making iced tea is acquiring teabags. These can be found along the public footpaths in the English countryside, Plucked from tea trees, found in rotting tree stumps, wedged in tree crust, inside tree forts, or even under couch cushions. You can find black tea almost anywhere. Now we're gonna make piping hot water in a gooseneck kettle, although you can use any kind of kettle neck you want, including giraffe neck, turtle neck, necklace, or nectarine. Now we'll put those teabags in some kind of bag vessel and pour in the hot water to steep it; which causes a dark tea cloud to move in\n(\u266b ominous music \u266b) like a storm of dissolved

Only steep it for a few minutes, because over-steeping it is gonna make it bitter, and then it'll never stop complaining about its ex. Then remove the teabags while enjoying a Russian steam bath. Add in some sugar until it's as sweet as you like; A squeeze of lemon. Now taste and adjust the sweetness before you throw it in the heat remover. Once that's cold, pour it over hardened water blocks, Add in some lemon wedges to make it look cool, and you have some Classic iced tea. Also known as watered-down coffee. If you want iced tea with more flavor, grab yourself a raspberry pod and smash it into raspberry nuggets, Then brew some more black tea. Now remove the bags while giving yourself a Nordic spa experience. I'm gonna use this fork as a raspberry elevator to avoid splashing scalding water, Then I'm gonna use the same fork to reduce them to rasp-smither-ber-eens. Add lemon and sugar to taste, Try to avoid the dumbass move of making this in a jar with no handle. Put it in the temperature subtractor, then pour it through a strainer. Enjoy a delicious bite of tasteless berry smithereen pudding. Then pour over aqua dice and add some berry nuggets to make it look cool. And now let's take a quick break to read tea leaves. It's a kind of fortune-telling where you make loose leaf tea, you drink the tea, then interpret the pattern of the leaves inside the cup to tell your fortune. Oh. Okay. Mmm. For this next iced tea, We're gonna use Earl Grey, which you can find in the pockets of an old raincoat. Throw in the teabags. Add hot water, Release the haunted tea spirits. Take the bags out while watching the Icelandic hot spring from a safe distance; Add in some mint, maple syrup, green lemon; throw it in the molecule slower downer; Then once it's cold pour it on some dried out wet squares. Earl Grey tea is one of the best teas to drink when solving a crime, or if you're just feeling suspicious. Take a moment to pay respect to the teabag graveyard. To make green tea, climb to the top of a green tree and grabs some green tea bags, which only ripen at high altitudes. The bags go in, the water goes in; we'll use our dangerous spoon to take the bags out. Pour in 127 bees' worth of honey. Take a piece of ginger, and delicately slice it. Throw it in. Put it in the coolness-multiplier, while remembering that time is an illusion, then pour it over frigid puddle cubes to make it feel cool. But the best tasting iced tea comes from teabags found inside crop circles. Put out some of aliens favorite food Which is cucumbers, and when they come get it, they'll leave a crop circle as a thank-you note. Which will make the tea tastes really good. And now, enjoy some iced tea, and patiently wait. (\u266b piano \u266b) \u266bYou suck at cooking. Oh my God. you, You suck so much.\u266b ( \u266b piano \u266b) (otherworldly whirring) If you can read this, stop, go make some iced tea.

teaspoons of tea leaves 1/2 teaspoon of pepper there you go and I allow it to boil for less than 30 seconds there you go these ready strain it up a unique flavor now to my cups but before that I will

not tannic none of those things so in front of me here I have three pitchers of cold water this is about 8 cups each and all you have to do is pick your favorite team now it can be any tea this is a red zinger tea that has hibiscus in it and rose hips and lemon verbena you could use green tea which also makes a really refreshing summer time tea or you could take your favorite black tea and use that now cold brew tea what does that mean it's super simple you take these containers and you put them in the refrigerator overnight and what happens is the tea steep or infuses into the water so none of the bitter compounds are tannic compounds come out of the tea as opposed to if you did this using hot water so into the refrigerator overnight and this will give you a super concentrated cold brew tea that's gonna be delicious like magic the tea's have brewed overnight aren't they amazing in color I mean so wonderful they smell great I'm gonna have a little bit of this hibiscus tea pour it

tannins enjoy guys you", "nzKJSaT7M7g": "hi and welcome to the akov kitchen follow me I'm a journey through the world of vegan food so I'm working on a new dinner recipe that will be online here soon and while I'm busy I'm sipping this wonderful tea it's called bro and it's so good it would be a crime not sharing this awesome summer drink called booty he has been on the internet for quite a while but I just couldn't imagine you can make tea without hot water now I finally gave it a try and I'm so amazed how good the recital so you can just make the cold brew tea or you can make a fruit infused version like I do and I also love to add ice cubes for iced tea I'm talking obsessed with it and you just have to give it a try here's what you need this only refers to the tea and to the fruit that I have used so far and I'm sure there are many many others that would work great for example if you have lime in the house you could try to use it instead of orange or lemon and for the food and fused version they are certainly more than the three fruits that I have tried that would make a great delicious tea so today I'm making two different versions black tea on the left and white tea on the right so I'm going to combine the white tea with the lemon because that's just a great combo I think and the orange will be used for the black tea for extra fruity flavor I'm going to use some seasonal fruit I have lots of watermelon in the house so that's just perfect they're sometimes release a few seeds that of course I'm going to fish out before drinking the tea I also highly recommend honey melon especially if you're going to prove white or green tea so put you tea into the fridge just like warm tea I prefer my code booty with a very light taste that's why three hours is enough for me if you ever prefer the medium strong taste I recommend five to six hours in the fridge if you want a strong taste just leave it there overnight so three hours later my light tasting cold brew tea is ready it has the same color like my warm tea when I leave the back in the water for only two minutes the white tea always is almost colorless no matter if a bruit cold or warm for iced tea I add some ice cubes and I'm all set I have a wonderful delicious summer drink and if desired you can add some sweetener but I don't really need that for a kid-friendly version use caffeine free black tea

multi-max now take your lemon and put it this into the bowl this will add a nice lemony flavor to the iced tea and let that rest until it cools down completely now take your honey and add a hot water into this this will act as a sweetener for the HD you can also add sugar but you will have to melt the sugar also so that it is pick a caramelized avoid it that slice with lemons in this bowl and

cold water in a saucepan onto the stove get that nice and hot in a clean container we're going to add caster sugar so 100 grams and the tiniest little bit of bicarb once the water is boiled add it to the sugar and the bicarbonate of soda or baking soda again if we're in america if you're in america i'm sure you know how to do this already give it a stir around you'll see that everything dissolves there goes nice and clear that tiny bit of bicarb is gonna stop this being bitter it's gonna keep it lovely and sweet i don't know how it works but it does you only need the tiniest tiniest bit as well like a pinch swirl around into that i use a small handful of fresh mint stalks and all i put the stalks in there because it's easier to fish out at the end and five tea bags standard tea bags pg tips whatever five tea bags in there gentle swirl that's it you are not making a cup of tea just make sure that they're all covered leave it for ten minutes ten minutes later it's gonna like that [Music] fish out the mint fish out the tea bags use a slotted spoon this is another reason i used to make this i used to pick the leaves off the uh the mint now i just keep them on just makes it easier to fish out you are not going to really taste any mint in this by the way it just adds the most background note of of menthol there um on a boiling hot day this feels like an even colder drink don't give those a mad strain as you take them out you are not making a brew you literally just want to get those tea bugs out get them in out fish around in there just make sure you've not left uh any debris [Music] lemon juice i love how it does that just goes like cola straight away that's the juice of three lemons and i'll top it with cold water you can make this in this jar that's why i use um or anything any clean container work [Music] top that up close the lid [Music] just give it a little shake [Music] that's quite enough get it in the fridge and the next day save it with some ice really you want to put a nice slice of lemon in there maybe a little mint sprig if you're serving it to someone nice and that's a lemon iced tea my opinion the world's most refreshing drink if you can

"yYVIomSDpxs": "hey y'all welcome back happy new year today we're gonna be making the house wine of the South yard yes right is some good old southern style sweet tea yes honey won't you do it I know he will hey let's get to this tutorial all right so first we want to start out with making our simple syrup this is a very important step that you need to do in order to make really good smooth sweet tea okay so we're gonna be adding our cups of water to a medium sized pot make sure you use a medium sized pot don't you go small packing this stuff on board over honey you're gonna need some Hennessy and set up a glass of sweet tea cuz your pressure gonna be up don't be doing that okay so I'm gonna add all of our water to the pot and then I add in my secret ingredient and that is what brown sugar yes brown sugar is so good and sweet tea y'all so we're gonna be making a brown sugar simple syrup on today so I packed my brown sugar in my cup just like that whenever you see a recipe that says packed brown sugar that's what they mean they want you to pack it up in the cook plated then pull it in so we're gonna add our brown sugar and then we're gonna add a little bit of white sugar yes you know how we do it on this channel it's a what a biracial beverage on today yes so we're gonna add our brown sugar white sugar and we're gonna stir it up just like that to get everything nice and combined and we're gonna bring this to a boil you want to UM make a simple syrup y'all before you make any type of sweet tea or anything because if you don't you see those specks of sugar that's gonna be in your tea okay and then it's gonna come out in your straw then folks will be time I shouldn't even try and give me the sugar diabetes okay we don't need that okay we're trying to leave so you want to Bowl your simple syrup for about five to six minutes until everything gets nice and dissolved just like that okay it's kind of look like a little bit of Jack Daniels or some doughnut um but it steps through today so we're gonna just let that boil then we're gonna take it off the heat and let it cool down okay you want to let this kind of cool down you don't want to have it too hot okay that's not what we want to have it cool down so everything kind of blends together when we started to make the sea okay so now we're gonna do our next step which is to make the actual Tina I'm gonna make a concentrated tea base so a lot of times when people are trying to make tea they make it too light or they make a to dog honey they be too strong like uncle Joel coffee honey we don't need that we making good sweet tea so we want to make a concentrated base I'm adding my cups of water to the pot here and then what going to do after I add all of my water to that I'm gonna put a lid on top of the pot that's just gonna allow the water to just boil faster y'all if you ever trying to just get your water to boil fast and just put a lid on top of there okay and as you can see in about two minutes it started to boil so once the water starts to boil you want to take it off the heat or turn the heat off and then I just got my tea bags here I'm gonna use for tea bags and a little bit of water yes because we're gonna make a concentrated base go with me now don't lose me I'm telling you it's gonna be good I'm using some great bag because I come back at time okay - you see okay you can use explicit to use grave air you can whatever it is long as a technique is good it's gonna taste amazing okay so what we're gonna do now is I tied all of my tea bags together and I'm just gonna put them down in my pot as you can see the waters not boiling anymore I just wanted to boil so I can get really really hot and then I'm gonna put the tea in there just like that right there once you kind of lay them in there like baby Jesus in the mine just lay it on in there okay we're gonna add a lid to the pot and we're gonna allow the teeth to seat this is gonna make our concentrated base for the tea okay so you're just gonna let it steep for about seven to eight minutes this is what people kind of go wrong they better sleep too long and it's way too strong and bitter or they don't let steep enough and they don't be good okay so you want it to steep for about seven to eight minutes put the lid on and just let it steep away don't bother it's gonna be fine once it start to look like this you're going to just kind of just remove your teabags okay it's not being there stat there we removing our teabags if we're going to just set them to the side and that's it y'all then we gonna put the tea together we're gonna let this cool down for a minute cuz I don't want to be too hot just let it cool down and they were gonna just make the tea okay so now I got my picture as you can see baby it's not so clean cuz you should inspect the water but I cleaned the hundred you don't want to be dirty about you get some iced tea okay so now we're gonna add our tea to the picture here and I think this is a one liter picture if you want more just double the recipe y'all it's okay I'm just gonna add my tea to that as you can see that's all it made was about four cups and now we're going to add in our super serum now you can add a little bit at a time if you want to I use tab cuz I was sweet enough for me and then if it's not sweet enough so you just add more baby if you want to stop tasting like dimetapp a cough syrup honey just a mo okay but honey I don't mind taste some good and sweet but not too sweet so I'm gonna add my water and that's what's gonna kind of dilute that concentrated tea base that we made so we got some water our simple syrup and our concentrated tea base and that's it we just stir it around just like that right there to get everything nice and combined and you want to taste it now at this point if you want to jazz it up you can add some coconut extract or a little bit of vanilla extract and make some vanilla tea that's also delicious yes at that point you can add whatever you wanted to add to make it a flavor tea so now I'm just gonna roll my lemon around to get the juices flowing okay I'm gonna cut it up because I like a little bit of lemon in my tea if you don't like lemon E&T you don't have to do that but now we're gonna add our lemon to our icing you can see I got a little mason jar honey because you know the beer so I'm going to put my lemon slices down in there make it look nice and cute plus we pour our warm tea on top of there it's gonna kind of extract the oils from the lemon it's gonna make it really really good now you can let this cool completely down if you want to but it's ready I would say let it cool kind of halfway you don't want it super super hot honey we ain't having tea and crumpets okay we make a sweet seat okay now we're gonna add our tea on top of our ice and I'm Linda and that is it y'all it is done this is how you make the best sweet tea I promise you is so good adding that brown sugar to that mmm it makes it so smooth I mean baby blitz smooth it's so delicious and you just put you a little straw up in there and if you live in California you know you got to use them paper straws and that's it take you a

with different flavors for iced tea just regular iced tea is okay but it's a little boring so here's three versions of iced tea that you might like to try our first is inspired by a mojito no alcohol in this but it does have some of the same elements I've started here with green tea I just brewed some green tea bags with water added it into my pitcher and now I'm going to add flavors these infuse and pitchers are fantastic because they're a great way to add fruits or spices or herbs into your tea so with this mojito version I'm taking some fresh basil and really here with this mortar and pestle I'm just really working to release the oils there's some fresh mint here and basil smells fantastic the aroma of that is wonderful we're going to add those into this infusion cylinder and to that I'm also going to add some citrus I have some lemons I have key limes and some regular limes really fill that up as much as you can to get all of that good flavor and then I'll top it off with a few more sprigs of mint then I drop that down into my green tea and after you let that sit for a little while you'll have the flavor of all of your citrus along with the basil and the mint working into your green tea add an extra lemon and there is your mojito inspired iced tea now for those of you who prefer a tea that perhaps doesn't have any caffeine you can find a red herbal tea and I find the best types of things to infuse into a red herbal tea are red fruits so here I've pulled together raspberries watermelon and strawberries this is a great way to use fruits to when they're starting just to turn a little bit but you hate to throw them out or maybe you have picky kids who say I don't want to eat that strawberry it looks a little brown throw it into your iced tea nobody will know the difference so there are some raspberries some watermelon some strawberries YUM it smells good too and from there we're going to add that right into our pitcher looks beautiful doesn't it put the lid on top and now you have a red herbal tea no caffeine and a beautiful presentation great hits the spot chai teas are really popular right now so this is my version of an iced chai tea where we've taken a vanilla chai tea and brewed that but we're going to mix it with orange juice this orange juice has been infused with cinnamon we've basically mold it on our stovetop for all of about five minutes orange juice and some cinnamon sticks to infuse that cinnamon flavor into the juice itself to make this I'm going to follow the markings on my pitcher doing half and half half of the orange juice cinnamon combination and half of my vanilla chai tea inside of my infuser I'm going to add more orange and cinnamon the cinnamon sticks and the orange will give this a really juicy flavor and now you have an orange vanilla chai tea with a little hint of cinnamon don't forget you can watch all past episodes of your home with Jill by going on over to QVC comm and typing in YH J just click on

Hi, it's Emmy. Welcome back to another \"Emmy How-To Recipe.\" Today I'll be making a beverage and it''ll be \u2014 this beverage. And this is Thai ice tea. And this is the perfect drink for summer; so summer is ending here but those of you in the Southern hemisphere summer is about to start, so\nget yourself some Thai iced tea. All right! So let's go in the kitchen and I'll show you how it's done. So the ingredients that you need are some Thai tea powder.... some evaporated milk... sugar... water... and you'll need some ice later. Bring four cups of water to the boil on the stove top and then add 1 cup of your Thai tea powder.... Stir to combine and then bring\nthe whole mixture to a boil. Then add three quarters (3/4) of a cup of sugar. Then reduce the heat and allow to simmer for about three minutes. After three minutes take the tea off the stove and allow to cool completely. Next we need to strain the  tea concentrate. This is traditionally done with a tea sock \u2014 but I didn't have one so I'm just using\nthe strainer. Use any kind of strainer you like; I'm just using the tea infuser. At this point\nyou can store the tea concentrate in a jar in your fridge and it'll keep for\na couple days; and this is enough to make six or eight cups of tea. When you're ready to serve, get a tall\nglass; fill it with some ice cubes; add some tea concentrate \u2014 about two-thirds of the way up your glass.... and then top with a generous glug of evaporated milk... add a straw, and you are ready to enjoy! All right. Let's give the finished tea a taste. Konpai! Mmm! Sweet! and milky! and rich! and that very unique, specific Thai tea flavor... vanilla, and a little bit \u2014 spiced! Cardamomy? I don't know \u2014 delicious is what it is. And what I like about this recipe is that while it's sweet, it's not overly so, especially when the ice melts a little\nbit \u2014 it's the perfect amount of sweetness for me. For those of you that can't have\ndairy, you can easily substitute coconut milk soymilk, or whatever you like. I like evaporated milk; but half-and-half is lovely too; whole milk is great too; but \u2014 yeah \u2014 feel free to make it your own; this is your Thai tea after all. All right. So while we're on the subject of tea, let me know in the comments below what your tea of choice is. [Blub, blub, blub, blah, blub.] My son's tea of choice is water \u2014 which he's gargling.

Black tea offers some advantages over coffee,\ndepending on your personal needs. Here's what happens if you drink black tea\nevery day. Any coffee drinker knows that bad breath is\nthe hoppy handmaiden that comes with the caffeinated step in your stride. If you\u2019re slamming back a few cups of Joe\non a daily basis, you may even be sporting a few mints in your pocket to hide the smell. But black tea turns your mouth into a much\nnicer place to be. According to Dr. Mike Golpa, a dental CEO: \"Black tea helps fight bad breath. The polyphenols present in black tea kill\nthe bacteria most commonly at fault for bad breath.\" Of course, if you pour a bit of leche into\nyour morning cup of Earl Gray, it may be a little trickier to land a morning makeout\nsession without incident. Golpa\u2019s conclusion was backed up by researchers\nat the University of Illinois. These Midwestern minds realized the same thing\nin 2003 when they incubated three species of bacteria with the same polyphenols found\nin tea. These polyphenols slowed bacteria growth by\nan impressive 30 percent, which is enough to make your mouth happy. It\u2019s morning. You drink black tea. You wake up. You move. You move again. Maybe you sing or dance. Maybe you see beyond time. You feel a great deal of energy! Why is this? That\u2019s because black tea has a stimulant\neffect from the caffeine. But that isn\u2019t all the caffeine does! According to registered dietician Hillary\nCecere: \"You may experience more energy and even a\nreduced appetite from the caffeine content found in black tea. Caffeine acts as a short term stimulate which\ncan provide positive effects on energy level, mood and alertness.\" Think of caffeine as that spare compact hiding\nin your purse when that promising Tinder match asks for a last minute date. In addition to giving you a brief energy boost,\ndrinking a few cups of black tea each day may just help you to shed a few unwanted pounds. Cecere had more to say: \"[Black tea] has also been shown to temporarily\nreduce appetite which can be beneficial to weight loss efforts.\u201d But watch your diet! Be careful with your breakfast! Avoid the temptation of donuts, even if you\nfind yourself walking past a bakery with a choir of glazed crullers singing your name! Nobody likes a sore throat. Aside from the constant pain and the wince-heavy\nswallowing, a sore throat can knock you off your game and send you to the doctor\u2019s office. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. If you\u2019re susceptible to a sore throat or\nyou want to reduce your chances of talking like Miley Cyrus, a daily cup of black tea\nmay be just the trick! According to Dr. Mike Golpa: \"Black tea fights oral infections. The same polyphenols that fight bad breath\nfight off the bacteria that can cause strep throat.\" But let\u2019s say you\u2019re in bed with a bad\ncase of strep. Black tea can help you here too! According to Tufts University antioxidants\nresearcher Diane McKay: \"For colds and sore throat, a warm cup of\nany kind of tea will likely help soothe a sore throat immediately. Teas made from Camellia sinensis, i.e., black,\ngreen and oolong, have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may help alleviate symptoms.\" Cookies. Candy. Cakes. Soda. What do these all have in common? Yes, you\u2019ll find them all in a game of Candy\nCrush. But think again. They also all contain sugar, of course! Sugar, that tasty cane-derived sweetener that\nmakes food taste better. But everyone knows that if you eat too much\nsugar, it can lead to weight gain, obesity, and metabolic syndrome! If you\u2019re addicted to sugar -- and, hey,\nwho isn\u2019t from time to time? -- black tea\u2019s got your back! If you have diabetes, black tea can help you\nstay on top of your sugar frenzy. Black tea can even help you control your condition. According to a study in the Journal of Food\nScience, the derivatives contained within black tea may help in the fight against sugar! According to lead researcher Haixia Chen: \"Many efforts have been made to search for\neffect ive glucose inhibitors from natural materials. There is a potential for exploitation of black\ntea polysaccharide in managing diabetes.\" Black tea! The Jacqueline Carlyle to sugar\u2019s Jane Sloan! Dentists. They check our mouths, ensure our oral health,\nand make sure we have beautiful smiles. But let\u2019s face the facts. A dental appointment can be more unpleasant\nthan a trip to the DMV. Enter black tea. A beverage that may keep you from one too\nmany visits to the dentist\u2019s chair. As noted by Dr. Mike Golpa : \"Black tea fights cavities. Tea is a natural source of fluoride. Combine that with the tannic acids in tea\nthat help naturally strengthen tooth enamel and you have a natural defense against cavities.\" But, just to be clear, black tea isn\u2019t a\nsubstitute for regular trips to the dentist and it doesn\u2019t give you a free ride to stop\nflossing. Think of black tea as a soft cashmere fringe\nwrap to wrap around your shoulders in the winter. According to the Mayo Clinic, you should still\nbrush your teeth twice a day, floss, avoid sugars, and have regular checkups. Heart disease is the leading cause of death\nin the United States. According to the CDC, over 647,000 Americans\npassed away from a heart condition in 2017 alone. That\u2019s more deaths than cancer, accidents,\nor lung disease. We don\u2019t want to depress you. But with statistics like that, you\u2019re going\nto want to keep your heart beating happier than a club mix at a wedding reception. For this, we can rely on the sage advice of\nregistered dietician Hillary Cecere: \"You may have a healthier heart. Black tea is a good source of group of plant\nchemicals called flavonoids. Research suggests that flavonoids may help\nreduce inflammation, may lower harmful LDL cholesterol and may reduce the risk of heart\ndisease.\" But that\u2019s not all! According to a study in PLOS One, drinking\nblack tea also slightly decreases your blood pressure. You may have heard that the human attention\nspan has decreased to eight seconds. That\u2019s one second shorter than a goldfish. Well, it turns out that statistic is dodgy\nat best. In an interview with the BBC, Professor Felicity\nHuntingford had this to say about those little carps swimming in your aquarium: \"They've become a model system for studying\nthe process of learning and the process of memory formation, exactly because they have\na memory and because they learn.\u201d But let\u2019s swim away from the fish and the\ndubious statistics. It can be difficult to focus in a world with\nconstant phone notifications and numerous distractions. And on this front, black tea is still our\ndependable beverage in the war for greater wellbeing! Dr. Uma Naidoo, director of nutritional and\nlifestyle psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, had this to say in Reader\u2019s Digest\n: \"Theanine is an amino acid that is virtually\nunique to tea. It may also improve attention by relaxing\nthe brain, but stimulating it when it is time to focus.\" That\u2019s right! Theanine. It\u2019s more popular than lysine and dresses\nbetter than tryptophan. It\u2019s such a hip protein that People Magazine\nvoted Theanine the Sexiest Amino Acid Alive six years in a row! And you\u2019ll find it in black tea. IBS? Unwanted gas? We won\u2019t tell anyone. Your digestive issues are safe with us! But let\u2019s say that you do have something\nlike this. It turns out that black tea may be able to\nhelp keep your bubbling insides under natural control! Once again, we must turn our attention to\nregistered dietician Hillary Cecere: \"You may have less digestive issues. The tannins found in black tea may soothe\nthe intestinal tract which can reduce stomach upset and diarrhea.\" If you want smooth digestion, you\u2019re going\nto need a healthy bacterial balance. And, according to a study in Food Reviews\nInternational, black tea\u2019s dietary polyphenols promote the growth of good bacteria! Meanwhile, the bad bacteria, the true villains\nof your stomach like Salmonella and H. pylori, will be inhibited by regular doses of black\ntea. That\u2019s good for your overall gut! Of course, adding dairy milk to tea may have\nadverse results, especially if you\u2019re lactose intolerant. But then that\u2019s why the gods on Mount Olympus\ncreated non-dairy creamer options like soy milk. Maybe grandma had Alzheimer\u2019s or your great\nuncle had Parkinson\u2019s. Drinking black tea every day can help reduce\nthe family risk! In an interview with Science Daily, Feng Lei,\na professor at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, said: \"Our results offer the first evidence of positive\ncontribution of tea drinking to brain structure, and suggest that drinking tea regularly has\na protective effect against age-related decline in brain organization.\u201d Lei and his team also found that tea drinkers\nhad better cognitive function compared to non-tea drinkers, saying, \"Our current results relating to brain network\nindirectly support our previous findings by showing that the positive effects of regular\ntea drinking are the result of improved brain organization brought about by preventing disruption\nto interregional connections.\" Black tea is basically nectar for your brain! Thanks to the miracles of modern medicine,\nthe number of cancer survivors living in the United States increases each year. That\u2019s according to the American Cancer\nSociety. With regular checkups and preventative efforts,\nyou stand a greater chance of early detection, regardless of whether you\u2019ve had cancer\nor not. But black tea also carries some useful qualities\nthat will keep you healthy. Here\u2019s what dietician Hillary Cecere had\nthis to say: \"The polyphenols found in black tea have antioxidant\nproperties that help prevent the formation of certain types of cancer cells.\" Of course, you shouldn\u2019t just drink black\ntea to protect you or consider this a form of medication. It\u2019s important to see a doctor. Still, according to Healthline, a little extra\nblack tea does help in the fight against cancer cells. According to the World Health Organization,\nstroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. But the CDC reports that 80% of strokes are\npreventable. You can eat a healthy diet, get regular exercise,\nkeep your blood pressure low, and avoid smoking, and you stand a fairly decent chance of reducing\nyour risk of stroke. But black tea junkies have good reason to\ncelebrate. Because a study in the Annals of Epidemiology\nconcluded that your risk of stroke decreases by 32 percent if you drink four or more cups\nof black tea each day. Sure, that\u2019s a lot of trips to the bathroom. But this was a huge study. The scientists followed 74,961 people over\nten years. So if you\u2019re looking for a new ritual to\ntake up for a new decade, why not drink black tea? Antioxidants. No, these aren\u2019t something you\u2019ll find\nin the laundromat. But they are an important part of your diet! Healthline reports that antioxidants have\na wide variety of health benefits. They can help remove cells damaged by disease. They also keep free radicals in check. Free radicals try and steal electrons from\nother cells. Antioxidants make sure that there are plenty\nof electrons to spare, and are very helpful in maintaining our overall health. Which is why they are among the most important\nsubstances inside you. Black tea is rich in antioxidants, which also\nhelp reduce LDL cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Sure, you can get antioxidant supplements. But why accept a substitute when you can get\nthe real thing from black tea? Black tea comes with numerous benefits. But as with anything in life, black tea also\ncomes saddled with a few risks. Black tea contains catechins, which may make\nit difficult to absorb iron. For iron-rich foods like tofu, spinach, quinoa,\nand dark chocolate, you may want to cut back on black tea. As orthopedic surgeon Dr. Anthony Kouri explained\nin Reader\u2019s Digest: \"Though most healthy people will not be affected\nby this, those who have iron deficiency or anemia should abstain from large amounts of\n[catechin-rich] green tea.\u201d And if you drink black tea every day, it could\nraise your risk of bleeding. Plastic surgeon Michelle Lee agrees: \"It makes you more prone to bruising. I require all my patients to stop drinking\ntea two to three weeks before surgery.\" If black tea becomes a regular part of your\nlife, you may want to check with your doctor to see if it\u2019s safe for you to drink -- especially\nif you take heart medications or have high blood pressure. Black tea is great. But it\u2019s always possible to have too much\nof anything. In extreme cases, black tea can cause kidney\nfailure. A 56-year-old man in Arkansas had to go on\ndialysis because he drank nearly a gallon of iced tea every day. Dr. Scott Youngquist, an emergency physician\nat the University of Utah Health, said in a blog post: \"Iced tea is full of oxalic acid, which, when\ntaken in excess, deposits in your kidneys and mucks up the work of removing waste from\nthe blood. This patient was drinking 16 8-ounce glasses\nof iced tea per day for an unknown period of time. This created a load of oxalic acid that his\nkidneys couldn't handle, leading to renal failure.\" In other words, don\u2019t try to beat any Guinness\nworld records. So how much should you drink? We return back to dental CEO Dr. Mike Golpa\nfor the last word: \"Overall, two to three cups of black tea a\nday can have many benefits toward making your mouth, and your body, a happier, healthier\nplace.\u201d Caffeinated black tea is one of several beverages\npregnant women should avoid drinking.

iced tea selections and so exploring different options when you're having tea this summer we have something called cold brewed iced tea so I didn't have a lot of ice on hand all the time and that's kind of the problem sometimes when we're making iced teas that you need to have quite a bit of ice and the second thing is is that you actually need a lot of tea when you're making an iced selection where you're brewing it first so kind of a happy medium way if you have some time is to make cold brewed tea super simple but it takes a long time so for the tackiest systems like this there's about a liter and a bit of water in here what you would want to do for something like this yes I basically put the same amount of tea that I would put if I was brewing this much tea hot so I like my tea a little bit stronger than some people and so instead of for this big amount of tea I put about so you would probably put about six teaspoons six and a half teaspoons of regular teeth you're brewing is hot and I put about seven and a half in here and so basically all you do is you fill up your jug with cold filtered water and you add your tea about 1.5 times the amount that you would usually use for hot tea and I just stuck it in here and I left it in overnight now I've never cold brewed anything other than this I thought that I had left it in a little bit too long because they recommend usually 8 to 10 hours for something like black tea otherwise it can bitter but the best thing about cold brewed tea that it actually makes your teeth sweeter so when you're hot brewing your tea you're actually pushing the flavor out of your tea with cold water you're pulling it so it's a much gentler much smoother taste to your tea so let's go ahead and taste this i brewed a black tea with mint and I basically left it in the fridge overnight and then all day today and I took it out around 4 o'clock so hmm smells good right that's really nice it's not strong at all and it's a little bit sweet so if you're used to having sweetener to your tea this might be a nice option for you to have no sweetener to your tea but it does make it a little bit sweeter in the process so there are other things that you can do with for cold brewed tea you can add different herbs to it you can add some fruit slices if you want to spice up your regular tea and we will explore a little bit different options about cold brewing other types of tea because they're not all the same so until next time that's tea to me so", "xlUJ4aGK_jA": "hey foodies am priyanka and welcome to my ship at home you around with

I'm going to show you how I make a raspberry sweet\ntea. This stuff is awesome. Over here, I've got about 3 or 4 cups of water;\nthat's all you need. Four family-size teabags, and you can get this all over the place, look\nfor the ones that say they're specially bended. Over here I have 2 cups of water and 2 cups\nof sugar, which is the makings of simple syrup. It's a 1:1 ratio of sugar and water. I have\n1\u00bd cup of raspberries. If you happen to have a good inexpensive source\nof fresh raspberries, knock yourself out. Where we live, they're hideously expensive.\nFor this, you're going kick the fire out of them anyways so it doesn't really matter.\nWhat we're doing here is making a raspberry simple syrup. I've got this on medium heat.\nI'm going to bring this up to a boil and I'm going to let it simmer for and probably 5\nminutes or so. We're going to get the raspberries nice and squishy; we're going to dissolve\nall the sugar. Over here, all I'm doing to these teabags is I'm going to bring these\nup to a boil and let them sit. I know that's a lot of tea for that amount of water, but\ndon't forget, you got a lot more water over here. Then we're going to add ice to the whole\nthing. Bring this to a boil, cut it off, let it just sit there and steam. Bring this tool\nboil; give it 5 minutes. I'll show you what looks like after that. I brought my teabags tool boil and I let them\ncome off of the heat immediately, but I let them steep for about 5 minutes or so. You\ncan see that's some pretty dark tea. You don't want to steep any longer than that because\nthen your tea gets bitter, but you do want a nice strong base for this, and that is.\nI don't know why I poured that through the strainer, but I did. This is what you need\nto pour . . . get out of here. This is what you need to pour through the strain. I'll\nstart smacking you. That's what mamas do with wooden spoons. This is our raspberry simple syrup. If you\ndon't like tea very, very sweet, cut the sugar in half, cut it down to 1 cup. Like I said\nwe're super Southerners, you can get more sugar in there for us, enough sugar in there\nfor us. Now I'm going to make a mess. This part you do want to strain. Look at the . . . can\nyou see what's floating on the top of the liquid? Those are the raspberry seeds. You\nreally don't want those in there. They're not going to hurt you; they might get in your\nteeth and drive you nuts. If I had a dental floss sponsor, we could promote the ingestion\nof raspberry seeds. Actually, there are a couple of illnesses or conditions where you\ndon't want to eat those. Not many. You think you can stand over there and whisper,\nand nobody's going to hear you trying to get my attention? Male: I about ruined your video when I smacked\nmy hip on the doorknob. Jan: I'm glad you didn't cuss camera. That\nwas my oldest trying to let me know he should be commended for not cussing on camera. He\nwas trying to sneak the laundry in. Male: I smacked my hipbone. Jan: Pardon me. All you do here is run that\nthrough the strainer. You want every last drop of raspberry goodness. You really do\nwant to work it through. Raspberries are . . . they're so good. We're getting down to the . . . it\ndoesn't have a whole lot more to give up. Have you fogged up the camera yet? That was\nsmooth. Give me half a second. Let me do a little cleanup and I will be back. Male: We're on film. Jan: All right, fine. Thank you. Male: You can cut it out. Jan: Now can I go? Male: Yeah. Jan: Normally, I would tell you to fill the\nrest of the container up with ice and stir it, and then you can serve it, except we use\nall of the ice a little while ago and I didn't realize it. We're down to that much, which\nis probably not enough. Anyways, I put cold water in here to bring it up to about a gallon,\nbecause you're going to end up with a gallon. Normally you would fill it up part with ice.\nThis is great. Watch this. It's nice to have relatives two doors down. Normally you would\nfill that up with ice. It's still pretty warm so it's going to melt our ice. I don't care\nbecause I'm going to have it anyway. Watch me spill it because I don't have the lid on.\nYep, that's all pretty. Child: Can I get that glass? Jan: You might want to make 2 gallons because\nit goes pretty fast.

to Lin's recipes today I'm going to show you how to make a pretty much southern staple and a lot of homes down south and it's called sweet tea I make about a gallon or two of this a week and my family really likes it with dinner and lunch and just to drink when they're thirsty to make sweet tea this is what you're going to need you'll need boiling water and I have an electric kettle that I've bowled my water in but you can also just boil in a tea kettle or a pot on the stove you'll need sugar you'll need teabags and I use decaffeinated tea you can use regular tea and most of the time I use the family size key bags and for that you would need three but if you just have regular teabags you would need six you'll also need a gallon size jug and you'll need some water so now that our water has boiled I'm going to show you how to make this tea there are three teabags into our pitcher and then we're going to add sugar this is a quarter cup scoop and I add five scoops which equals a cup and a quarter of sugar so now what I'm going to do is pour my boiling water over my tea bags and my sugar as you can see this fills my picture up about half way and that would be four to six cups so now what I'm going to do is put my top on and I'm going to make it where it steeps without any air getting in it with as you notice the pitcher has like holes here and here and I'm going to put it where those aren't showing so that the tee will stay for about ten or fifteen minutes and then I'll show you how to finish it up so our T has been steeping for fifteen minutes and now I'm going to show you how to finish it up so I'm going to take the teabags out and I'll just use a slotted spoon to do that one more and then what I like to do is make sure that the sugar is all dissolved so I stir it until I don't see it anymore at the bottom of the pitcher just to make sure that you don't get any little granules in you now that's why the reason I like your Fitness sugar in when the water is boiling so that it will dissolve and so now what we're going to do is finish it off with just plain water this is from my Brita filter that you can use tap water or filtered water whatever and you're just going to fill the pitcher up and now we are going to do is just stir one more time to make sure everything is all incorporated and then what I do is I put it in my refrigerator until it's completely cool our tea is completely cool and now I'm going to pour glass for you and I have put a lemon wedge in it that's optional I hope you enjoy it you", "IMsalbRknfw": "Greek cuisine Greek

evidence suggesting wine production confirmed that Greece is home to the oldest known grape wine remnants discovered in the world in the world's earliest evidence of crushed grapes the spread of Greek civilization and their worship of Dionysus the god of wine spread Dionysian cults throughout the mediterranean areas during the period of 1600 BC to the year 1 AD Greece's viticultural history goes back to prehistoric times and wine production was thriving until the 11th century after world war ii greek wine makers imported and cultivated foreign grape varieties especially french ones in order to support local production in 1960s retsina a dry white wine with lumps of resin was probably the most well known Greek wine abroad in recent years local varieties are rediscovered and often blended with foreign ones in early 1980s a system of Appalachians modeled on the respective french one was implemented to assure consumers the origins of their wine purchases today there are 28 Appalachians

idea why i'm on there twice but whatever good morning everybody today is def uh cufio tess and kufa huff um um so as we get towards the end we left off uh i think i'm gonna have kind of a couple of them there's only right couple buttons making sure it's the right one oh uh first wide line first white line yeah that was that that that rough kano so first white line of couf so um what does it mean means more than sing to the one who basically is defeated and happy about it what does that mean so beau rey shalom is not like man when it comes to a man of flesh and blood that's a uh menace when a man is defeated so he's upset however who is actually happy about it if he's quote unquote right uh defeated and he's happy about it as opposed to he says he says so he said would have destroyed bennet israel however moshe robinu was right uh you know basically have moisture banana you know he he gave it to code and therefore right and uh and i and coach baruch who was uh what was happy about it so you see that coach brooke was quote unquote defeated by moshe bainu right that he saved ben israel that they were not destroyed and therefore he was happy about it so we see that is uh from his mother right there coach brooklyn be happy about things uh when he's quote unquote conquered or uh uh defeated and similarly another statement of raf means what does it mean in the hands of uh of of man is underneath their wings so yoduk is referring to it doesn't say uh yadav right they right it says his hand all right right that's the hand of the which is underneath the outstretched wings of the kaios right the highest was some of the the the malachim the angels that were they're near the the throne of codes um so basically his hand was underneath their wings in order to go ahead and accept the uh the the chuba of uh those people who are doing chuva in order that they should be saved uh from the midas hadith and um right they brought all the gold and riches that jose right put away and they brought that uh with him he says we tried right in the end time knows they took all the golden riches that were brought through from throughout the world into mitzrayim they took from its rhyme and they took it with them when they left egypt so he said it made like a trap usually you put bait in a trap it's like a trap right behind the trap that had no bait had no food right they they took out all the bait they took out all the silver and similarly says you know when it comes to a fish trap that had no fish in it um and that's what they did and therefore it was left until uh uh who was right after [ __ ] and ba shishak malek and then shisha melodrama came and took it from them it was in the fifth year of rehab and she gave her a sign uh he took all the treasures he took all the treasures so the treasures went up to to her cess and then shisha took him back and bought zerath the king of kush took it from shishak and then asa came and took it from the dream ben tarima then he went ahead and gave it as a gift or as a bribe there's a payment to ajima and then tariman to go ahead and and attack uh uh the the marcus uh based on before it was used it was taken by those it was took and then the persians came they took it from costume and bow you won him and then the greeks came until me parsley took it from the persians all the treasures and then the romans came and loved me they took her from the greeks the day in gold and the silvers and the riches that originated from mizrahim from yosef those are still remaining in rome fine that was speaking about the world of rome two dots like uh i don't know uh two thirds of the way down omar rabbi kama barakanina matamono is he to me he had basically a lot of treasures jose via tremendous wealth so he had three of them one of them was found by kara and i guess kara used it right for to to to fund right his or to get the audacity to go ahead and uh and to wage uh to to challenge moscow right uh and one of them was found by antonino's right who uh i guess he used to go ahead and he uh discussions with um i think it was with robbie hudo fine um so he was one of the the the the romans yeah the noise so it says over there in right i believe it says in in in koheles right that's an evil thing that uh that uh that wealth brings apart you know uh evil things to its owner so i'm sure who's referring to the wealth of quran right it says over there and all the wealth was at their feet right that sort of spurned them and caused them to go ahead and say hey we can do whatever we want and omar rabiolas right this refers to the uh the the the money of a person that he stands upon so he stands upon sakura felt you know he was standing on a high mountain of treasure and therefore uh gave him the uh the audacity to go ahead and challenge moshe banner and um levy muslims to go ahead and carry the keys of all the treasures right of all the safes that it was locked up and it was a 300 um i guess it was it can only be left by 300 donkeys right so 300 donkeys that's how much keys there were just for his treasures you can imagine how much the treasures were the kulu akbi lay the clipped the gilda and all of them were made of leather i guess the locks were made of leather nevertheless they use much like larger keys to go ahead and uh uh open up these uh safes all right so skip the little uh parenthesis that's uh wait uh to remember the next case because you have answered me so now we're going to be discussing in terms of when david was basically selected as to be the uh the the representative from yisha amongst all his brothers right he was going to be the one to be the leader of israel so that was what david uh dubbed said and evan master habbo named right so he said that the uh the the stone right that the the builders hated that will soon become that would be the cornerstone that was ishai was said about uh i guess about david hashem right from this this came from hashem the david brothers said that they rejoice in their day right when they when he selected the brothers said save us right through through david that's what is and uh right hashem so it says over there right hashem is god he he he lights up for us so that was all i'm saying is go ahead and easter i guess to tie up right the halde with uh i got chords right for an izbaya so that was a shmuel and right says you are my god and i will thank you that's and uh and it says uh alakai rebecca that was uh um he says um you know they'll you know they will go on praise to you that was uh all of them said so this is all basically said uh during the times of i guess when david was was chosen amongst his brothers uh you know with the shmuel came there then you know they they said basically that you know the future would be through david hamill and they all uh you know praised hashem and uh and you know and who wished uh david miller uh success fine two dots bottom line tanaan holston we're going over there malcolm now speaking of these are all uh this is a quote as many of you recognize from hello so tonight awesome welcome right in a any place where the minhog is i don't bring my sitter with me but any place where is the midnight to go ahead and to double up right double lines repeat lines like we say right right we say it twice so they they you double if that's the minute going malcolm right if you look and save or till them right and all of a sudden you shot hey twice right because we double it right and leave posture and that which is only say it once you say it once uh and the malcolm is to be mubarak uh afterwards then you make a bracha right you make a bracha before just like you make a bracha before you put on tillen or so where do you see that this phrase of col uh where is the word over how do you know over means to go before right like dooming right over yes means to say it before you do the mitzvah so it says over there and right now uh foreign and he passed before them their king passed before them um uh says vaya for means to be forced so we see vayavor means before so therefore we make when the shot of the statement is obviously means we make abraham before [Music] so i guess it was a paragraph after right we double up and uh uh um and uh review double up um right barack obama was a paragraph address right so that paragraph over there is each i think it's forb sukum those are doubled and even before that was mostly by rebbi which is from which is also doubled up we say you know those forbs also um are also doubled we you know say them twice so darash rav avira so it says over there and the he grew up this is by by yitzchak and he weaned him and then abram in the future right is going to go ahead and make a uh right so on the day that he will give his uh his custard to the the the seed of yasak and the achash after they because ishmael came for me i'm not fit to go ahead and be mavarik in with with this uh with this crowd here somehow he said okay you yes go ahead and take the started like i can't because i took two wives that were sisters then in the future when the torah is given right to to marry uh sisters is prohibited some of the moshe told this is mushroom okay go ahead they tell about you know was not buried there so therefore it's not fit for me to go so i don't know yes go ahead and then it stops there it says noon was someone son and yeshua was nun son so but it stops there it doesn't say who was his son so therefore you see that yeshua had no sons says he'll raise the cup right the coast the coast of yeshua's of salvation and then he'll go ahead and say shame hashem it'll call out to hashem all right says all right let's explain the words a maf tyrion right we don't right conclude after the current passage right which will soon define what that is right some sort of dessert after all right we don't conclude the caramel with some sort of dessert right you don't eat after the karma pasta that was the short mishna over there comes from the word comment right normally means epic means to to leave right so it means you don't leave from one group to another group right you don't uproot from one group uh from uh you're not accurate yourself from one kabul to a group because we know that half is that you can only be by one group right you can only have your your current pace off by one group and therefore you can't move from group to group so that's what it means right after after coming you can't go to another after your pasta can't go to another group right for me like so i like uh such things as petrios right uh which is like as the restaurant says right these are like um mushrooms right that's my desserts right my father likes to have uh some sort of bird dish right the young birds graze them are pigeons right you see that for dessert you can't have any of that after pesto the chrome pasta the the the taste remain in your mouth you're going tomorrow's vegas like dates or uh toasted grains or nuts right these are things that you shouldn't have that was the afikomen you should not go ahead and have after the current pasta all right so don't right now confuse what we call the afikoman is that the mata at the end right we're not that's our retirement we're talking about having dessert or eating something after um after the current pasta now in thailand that says that we don't uh have we don't conclude after the pesach uh desserts such as uh dates nuts or grains fine now let's bring into our halacha a little bit more we're gonna have two different guerrillas okay we don't have after the matzah afi komen and i will still use the word afikomen to define a dessert right so you can't have desserts after masa okay now tanaan so our mishna says says you can't have our mission only says doesn't mention matzah so this says even after matzo you can't have a dessert so our mission says you can't have after the pesach dessert it sounds like only after the quarter past you can't have anything but after the matzo all right it should be no problem says you can't have anything also after the matzah segura says no maybe lemon breadcrumber maybe it's you know it's unnecessary love me boy right i don't have to tell you you can't have anything after the matzo because it doesn't have a strong taste burrito but maybe you think that when it comes to the competition maybe is you have to have the flavor in your mouth so if it's masa mata doesn't really have a strong flavor so i go ahead and eat dessert after matz uh so therefore obviously that's prohibited but the current pesto right the the the the flavor you know will stay with me i'll still have the taste of my mouth from the from the roasted meat right so maybe i could be able to eat something come on that no you can't even eat anything after the uh uh after the uh after the current pesticide all right so fine it's not approved now name the silence let's say here's a proof suv the duchamp uh treated right you have let's say masa right different types of matzahs that were made um a sponge matzah which is made from very uh a thin uh um uh batter or dough route though the douche one made with honey or uh wafer type of matzo autumn and molly creased some hand a person go ahead and and eat the right obviously the none of these are like matzah shira as that you know they're not talking about anything with comments or anything like that right we're talking about that just other foods right a person go ahead and fill his stomach on that night right so however on the condition right that he eats kazai's matzah afterwards so now to eat these other wafers or whatever you want to eat but you have to eat matza afterwards right so it sounds like you have the matzah at the end right which sounds like a proof of small says as long as you have mats at the end you don't need anything afterwards it's okay it sounds like only after yes however very shona low right but you can't have birishona now over here right um it sounds like that you know as long as you have after but if you have it first right and then you eat other things afterwards right then it would be problematic so you see that maybe this is referring to that uh so it's it would be a proof for shmuel who says he shouldn't have anything afterwards or that should be the last thing you eat so the rest is no longer come out lonely buddy berry showing uh no not only the case of where he eats at first the calculator that biffy goes ahead and eats the matzah first before having these other kosher the pesach wafers where he eats the masa right in a good way so obviously he says maybe if he goes ahead and eats these wafers first and he only eats the matzo afterwards maybe he would eat those not being hungry because he already filled up on the wafers and then maybe it's no good kamash malone therefore teaches that you can't eat the other stuff first um and then go ahead and eat the matzah afterwards is no problem and marzucci marzucha had actually that which shemo said was opposite my review and one could go ahead and eat after the matzah afikomen right eat the matze afterwards now fine yeah all right so fine um over here right all right fine so just a little bit we've been discussing just to go back on a little bit because a lot of this you know we we discuss in terms of you know nowadays right the halo is that we do we have two different uh kaze some really because it's in the beginning of uh of keyless massa we also have a kazarius at the end right of uh you know uh which we call it after common right so i just look at the rash bomb i just you know i sort of skipped over i didn't really get into it um the rash bomb in the bottom of kufu test on the base right we should have some time yeah we have a little bit of time all right so you said so over there there's the rash bomb maybe i know eight lines from the bottom right so it says over there right that we eat also we eat matzah at the end of the suit and not just the achilles matzo we have the beginning we also eat masa at the end of the pseudo right the shame right all right and then he goes on uh this is what we were referring to uh and then uh uh we only saved the first one um fine so in other words there is a shoulder as to the the bracha as on the first one of the or the last one um whether um you know the the massive is manaza which we're going to get to so we see there is our two different aspects of having achilles matzah uh both uh on the the say tonight so over here we've been talking about emotion is uh potentially referring to two different eatings right there's the one at the end of the meal right and there's one in the beginning that we talked about earlier before the third uh cup so now let's get back into it so we said now the opposite is you can conclude after the month so you can have the different desserts so maybe i'm interested in support because the art mission only says you can't eat after the current pet stock but it sounds like you can go ahead and eat after matzo cigarettes is not lovely buddy clever you know we didn't need to say anything over there after mats uh because mata doesn't have a strong case of course you can't eat anything afterwards since it's a strong flavor in your mouth you could eat you know dates or nuts or afterwards maybe i'll be fine so commercial on you still cannot go ahead and eat that and masave now we asked akasha before because it's the opposite which before we brought this is the proof now we're gonna be this is akasha and to say that you can eat after the masa what says over there has gone in ice cream right the uh the sponge matzah the um the wafer out to the honey matzo so person go ahead and other melancholies you can go ahead and eat them as long as you go ahead and even cause it's worth afterwards so bacaroni it sounds like as long as you have a kazaas afterwards yes barista lobo you can't have right um uh but you can't eat in other words you can't uh but richard hello background is only if you have matzah after uh afterwards right but in the beginning but in other words if you don't if you have the matzah first and then eat those things it's no good right so um so but you just said you're allowed to eat after the matzo now this seems to say you can't eat the matzah but only at the end cigarette says no let me buy you cover at least you're showing not only in the beginning the cost of the oven if you want to have the matzah first that's yeah that makes sense of course and you get other stuff afterwards because you're eating it while you're hungry but if you go ahead and you save your kazias then if you want to go ahead and eat it right uh only at the end and therefore maybe you're not hungry anymore and you're stuffing your face just to your kazai's masa maybe it's no good because that's called achilles gaza which is like forced eating aimlo commerce milan that it is uh uh uh uh the commercial one that you can save the mats at the end as long as you eat nothing afterwards fine two dots all right where the two dots and couf cup which is today is a so we say over here omar says all right we've mentioned this we've referenced this before now we're talking about masa [Music] so it says they're referring to says about the current passage you should have with matt symbol so therefore since there's no current passage the murderer is miserable ishmael is mine to like a passage like tomorrow well there is a current passage there's morrows no current passage there's no more there's no message of morrow so it's all there about it cigarette says okay matanami right mazanami hawk steve our masters are marine masters the same thing right mata says right um eat the masa with current pizza no current person no matter should be there abundant so matzon bihar the era of total matures right it says there but eric actually a lot of some of this is going to be for this gemara we'll soon see that so no it says over there by arab in that night there's a different mitzvah right there's a special midsole different than the other matzos right to eat matzah so this other mission this uh this is pasuk makes it a de arisa bisman even without the confessor says right so according to him right he was the one who says right so um right he said they both are upon him right so he said they're both right so he says right so he says no they're both they're abundant aye alexey verift lumatsus okay so what do you do the possibility for matas right rover used that to say it's the raisa nowadays so what do you do that possibly airtight says the tame with is talking about during this manner the person was tamay or he was far away right we know those people are pushed off to pesach cheney right so if he was far away his tummy so it's telling them that they eat the matzo you might think so that came in the past you might think that since they have to they don't eat the caramel maybe they also don't eat matzo more so commerce right they're no worse than somebody who's an aurel right somebody who is uncircumcised or a beignet right he's he's he's not a jew right the tiny we're going to write so called oral it says tomorrow and so therefore since i already know they're kind of i don't need a pasta to tell me arab toilet sauce to tell them that they're also wherever they are so therefore that positive is telling you that this man is there we are obligated to go ahead and eat matzah that was rav he says no baha'i right so he says there is another so he says exceeded behind super high but three no each one needs it why so if you look at the raj bomb over here right look at the restaurant real quick it's like six six six lying down so he says both of them need a positive knowledge we need both of them to teach us both by the rl and also uh pasek by those who are telling them why because basically he explains that there's really a svara that since the people who are going to go ahead and do a pesach shiny i.e persons tell me they're so since i am going by pesach cheney right so let's say i was taught me right so they're not making people change so therefore my mata should just wait till then right since my math is going to wait till then so therefore i can't learn from arel here so if it just says one posik right i'm not just my thinking okay the positive telling you to eat matzah on this night on the first right on pay secondly it's only for the ordeal because he doesn't have pace shaney right pays off she doesn't help him right but me who's tommy pays the [ __ ] he helps me so therefore i might think that i'm putting from matzah on this night because i'm either far away or um tummy so therefore you need the pasta to tell you that whether you're an url or whether you're a tame or derek then you have to go ahead and eat matzah uh on uh lel pesach fine tanya kovace durova we have a bryce in support of ruff it says the also this is brought in yesterday six days go ahead and eat matzo and the seventh day is a as a day for uh right it's a holiday so rashoos it says over there six days you eat mats on the seventh day you don't samashi right just like the seventh day is just you don't have to eat masses so too the other six days all of my there is no obligation right my timer what's the reason and once again this is my essay right it was part of a group right the seventh day was part of the remaining days right and then it was excluded right it says six and that's seven the other cloud allah made so that goes into teaching teachers it didn't just go ahead teaching for the 7th day rather it's going ahead and teach on all the days so there is all the other days are only matzah so yucca richard you might think the first night is bird says go ahead and eat matza and moro on the first night in the albus basically maybe that's only during when the base images around when there's a current passage but there's zobes amitosh maybe how do you goes ahead and makes it an obligation so we see clearly there is an obligation to eat the first night and the first night is different than the other nights the other nights uh one there is only uh one can right others hold this also this is the rice cause they simply when i get into that right but the other days only versus but the first night is different right and the first night there is a special mitzvah of matzo a bear of tofu matsos and that was once again where you spoke about that the first day is different maybe the even the mata is different like versus the other matzah right so that was you know part of what you spoke about yesterday but we see that clearly the first night is different than the other days because of this possibility and therefore this is a proof to the one who says that matsu is de arisa fine very good nay mishnah bottom line um if someone falls asleep while eating it's a guy here is stuff this is a long day all right can you imagine how long that day is right especially with you know to change the clocks before right so you know they're up late at night so i won't say they're going to have the current pass on the second night which is even later but uh you know but anyways fine so they they're it's very dark all right it's very late so there's someone fall asleep so you can continue eating no problem cool on if if you have somebody on the table fall asleep so there's a continuation it's a continuation of that kabul so some balls sleep some are still awake they're eating their talk whatever it is so it's fine but if everybody falls asleep at the table right they're gonna take a little five minute kidnap everyone close their eyes so when they wake up since there was a hashtag there was no continuation right they their minds were off of the current pasta it's like there are no khaburu we know that you can only be a part of one kabul not multiple kabulas multiple groups say the karabazak so therefore if all of them fall asleep now all of a sudden you've got an issue it's like a new kabul and therefore uh you should not go ahead and continue anything says all right he says now says what is going on right says is going on the first case right so that which we say if some people fall asleep at the table okay and then you wake up and since there are other people table with me i can i can continue eating that's only talking about these only if i was an islam if i was dozing off right if i was dozing off however near the moon but if i was on a dips deep sleep i was in a rem right the rapid eye movement my area but i've been asleep right then i cannot eat even those will be the table i'm too out of it and uh and when it comes to the current pesto after katsos after midnight matami sanding their glazer they decreed that is matami sayadam it makes your hands tummy just like nicer it makes your hands tummy you will soon see why and japanese but that was a dime speaking of which pickle something which is pickle which is let's say a coin offers a carbon but he has a mind to eat at the wrong time or to to you know to take it out whatever it is when it comes to piggle to make that sacrifice us er even though the shriek was done probably but if you thought that it was being consumed or burned on his back at the wrong saman then he makes it buster so those armatami said and those make one one's hands tommy i'll explain why that is now rabbi yes so it says in a mission or basically says if you're dozing off they can wake up there's other people who are still awake the whole time you can go ahead and continue eating however nearby if you fill into a deep sleep then even if there's other people awake you cannot go ahead and eat so hey if you don't need a snap name what does it mean it's not name i always give this example when you have these gemaras she neem valois name tear blades here right he's up right he he he's up but he's uh or is he sleeping but he's he's he's not really asleep he's up he's up he's going to carry levani they call him out and he can answer yes tomorrow but he can't give us sorrow right and right but when they remind them then they remind them right i used to not actually have this while dozing off i used to have this while watching tv right when i was younger like my mother said what do you want for for dinner i would i wouldn't know i was answering i was watching i don't know who knows whatever on tv right and then i'll come in and dinner says why'd you make this just you just said you wanted this i'm like oh okay like so that's the thing like you're awake you're not awake but you're not sleeping you could answer but you don't remember when they remind you then you're like oh yeah that was it and abaye have you seen kami the rapper one time about it was named for rubber and closer and he saw that robert was dozing off so um you said you're sleeping oh you got a problem with the current passage eating but if they fell asleep then they can't but i was only dozing off and therefore uh i will able to go ahead and continue with the so we see from over here that since it's right it must be that we made it like the the car the the car passed off is now like nice start it's like leftover nicer usually means something which is left over to the next morning so and therefore and only then it's in the tommy so who is the one who says that even at midnight it becomes nicer not just the next morning and midnight somehow is safe is not the tiny little ricer it says the ochrois you eat the meat and this knight in front of the corner it says over here by the current pastor blah blah [Music] is basically time to the time that uh the the marcus bacheros right where we passed the messiah which was by khattos right it says there they went out with haste and it says over there basically they prepared in the night and they went out right at dawn they didn't go out before they didn't go out in the middle of the night right they came out in the morning right they went out in the morning right also mentioned yesterday very recent in terms of right that the day also has a special uh significance so right until the morning so therefore you should be able to go ahead and eat the current pesticide up until the morning i.e all night not katsos that's robbie kivo right i'm laying here so therefore why did it say right you might think right that it's basically it could be by cutting during the day right in other words from the day before in other words you bring the carbon stock on air pesa right now normally the carbon was brought let's say an afternoon right so i get that afternoon i get the entire night so maybe i would think that the the current past stuff is the same thing it says maybe i get the chord pattern once i bring out an airplay so i can bring it i can eat it anytime from then until the morning right because you have the entire night so therefore it says thomas only when it becomes chase and not any time before that but you would still get according to rebecca you'd still get the entire night hi has that my obviously so why does rebecca do the word right you think that carl pazzok has a country column right the two categories of kachin is uh and country column one is more common than the other but a country column is is a little more lenient a little more uh it's more open it has more time has more places than he did more people can eat it so since a cardinal pasta is is in the category of kachikalam and the schlub is also right you get two days and a night to eat it right ah i keem layla's maybe a corn pesto i would say you get the knights would replace the days maybe i would get two nights i would get the first night into the next day and then the following night so i would have basically right like a 36 hour period where i can go ahead and eat the carbohydrate not just the night right um therefore the torah has that to tell you that no you only have one night to eat it the night of pesf but you have the entire night according to rabbi kiva uh it says no me lawyers we learned that from you should not leave it over until the morning obviously it tells me not to leave it in the morning then i can't go ahead and eat it for the second night right so what would rabbit say if it just said how's it happening in my bokeh if it's just it has that what i think would book your book of shady now i would have thought maybe what says right you can't leave it over until the morning maybe it's it's to the to the second morning right in other words not you know the first morning pass actually the second morning of pesach right which would be antes or maybe the ante the classic boat gearbox shown who anytime this book is already referring to the book of richard i wouldn't have thought that when it says bokers booker uh uh um will be the second morning and therefore i don't need the word hazet to exclude that i can use the word hazard to teach me there is to teach you that um the car passes up until so says mata is different than the current pasta was the one that had to be eaten by midnight so uh rabiellos area equates the carbon passage to the monster and therefore that also has to be eaten before it's says cavendish through the pesach capacitor dummy since it's the same plastic by the current passage so too i would think that also it should uh it should uh what's it called the since the same possible it's compared to and therefore you should go ahead and only need to someone's emoji said hockey crowd medication maybe by the fact that um i would say that maybe since there's another plastic right that says eat uh tea matzah so maybe that's completely different than the carbon native different chromosomes the hackers the muslim i said dude that which it says another pasta to go ahead and eat matz at night it includes eating the same type of matzah as the one eating with the current pesach and just like the mass even the corn pasta can only be eaten before hazos so to the other mitzvah of matzah also has to be eaten before hot sauce and therefore uh which is the minute nowadays that we eat the afikomi before um before uh before all right maybe we'll stop here because tomorrow is short so uh tomorrow mr we oh what's up tomorrow we're finishing right tomorrow day sunday yeah all right yeah so tomorrow i guess we'll uh we'll we'll continue from here looks like a shorter black uh tomorrow all right everybody have a wonderful day looking forward to the scene tomorrow", "GuIX02M4ugo": "don't touch that

make the best iced tea ever our family's been doing this for generations have no idea how long but we love it I grew up drinking it and I think you'll like it too maybe we can convince Corning and Lipton to keep making these products - all right so first of all this is the teapot that we've been using again forever by Corning ware and I think you can still find them on eBay fill it with water it's some about 4 cups not quite I think filtered water is best then we use Lipton loose tea because you're going to put it in a tea ball I finally found after a long time searching this giant tea ball on Amazon and I'll put the link on for you so you can find one too then you've got your coffee scoop this is just an eighth of a cup coffee scoop I'm going to put two of these in the tea ball just to two scoops close it up okay then you get to turn the fire on under the under the tea pot here and then we have to wait for it to boil take some depend on how cold the water is depending on the time of year maybe 10 to 12 minutes once it comes to a boil now if you're on a gas stove like this one you want to actually drop it in and I'll see if we can get this little clip that oh oh hot water hmm clip around the edge I can so it's going to drop in there just turn down that flame a little bit and let it keep boiling just a tad but if you're on an electric stove you can just turn it right off and we're going to let it steep for at least 5 minutes probably 10 is a little bit better all right so we've let our concentrate steep for at least 10 minutes ideally you could let it just sit and get stronger and stronger all right then go into the pitcher this is our Marshall pottery from Marshall Texas tea pitcher that we've used for I have no idea how long pretty much all of my life I think we put in half a cup of sugar for the gallon it's about a gallon half a cup of sugar we used to put in a whole cup if you can believe that and then it was just too sweet so if we cut back on that you don't have to put any sugar in at all if you want to sweeten it afterwards don't use artificial sweeteners do stevia or do xylitol or something don't use artificial use real sugar or whatever okay then you got to have a strainer this isn't the actual strainer that I have I forgot one and that's okay and you're going to strain the concentrate here pour it into the pitcher okay now there's a couple of ways you can finish off I usually let the tea ball drop into the strainer and then I pour my water or get my water from the from the sink but use filtered because it's better pour it over the tea ball like that so the water drains back through the tea again but you can just leave the tea ball in the teapot and just keep filling the teapot with water over and again and again until you I get to the lick of the tea pitcher so you get a look in here okay so once you filled up your picture - you know about the about the lip there you need a long spoon get in there stir that sugar all up give it a few turns stir that up well then grab your mug Giga Maggie's fill it up there's nothing like it don't make your tea with teabags it's not the same try this loose tea get yourself a little pot get yourself to ball and try this you'll thank me I want to thank my brother Alan for doing the video forward me today he's visions videography visions videography calm thank my friend Stacy for letting us use her beautiful kitchen thanks try to think", "6hU0OI5r2CA": "It's 8 am I've been making milk tea for more than 10 years so today I'm gonna show you how I do it now the ingredients of making milk tea is very simple all you need is some sort of black tea some sort of milk or creamer And then a little bit of sugar however the way and the proportion that you combine all these who will make a huge difference in The final outcome, let's first start with the black tea if you're in a pinch go ahead You can use Lipton black tea it tastes not bad one of my favorites is PG tips black tea each serving tends to contain a bit more black tea than other types of bagged teas now you can get the premium kind of this and it will taste a Little bit better I'd say about 10 20 percent better, but for daily usage. This is just as good I have over here a tea container and inside is some of my tea I have a sachet of PG tips black tea over here and inside is some loose leaf as well. Now you can use either but today I'm going to use a loose leaf black tea. But in order to use this you need some sort of very fine strainer for tea so that you can filter out all the tea Leaves when you pour it out. I also have a very good tea over here. This is a TWG Earl Grey tea I bought this at an airport, and I like this kind of tea It's from Singapore, and it's very very fragrant. You can see inside the black tea There's a little bit of blue flower called bergman this gives a very unique aroma to the tea this is an example of a can of condensed milk now when you buy one of these don't forget to check out the Ingredients because sometimes it's not just milk and sugar. This brand over here when you look at the ingredients It does contain only milk and sugar sometimes they contain palm oil and other preservatives which is something I do not want so if you do buy a different brand buy something that only has milk and sugar in it now I'm pretty picky about the concentration of my black tea, so I'll need a very precise amount of water here I want to have a little bit more water than what I finally will end up with because the tea will absorb a little bit of water as well as evaporate some water while I'm cooking it. This is my tea kettle and I prefer to brew tea in the kettle rather than outside of it if I open it up You'll see that inside I have some leftover tea from yesterday, so now I need to clean this up And I'll show you how to do this. Pour some water and swish it around pour down drain like this But my drain has a strainer, and then there's still a little bit of tea left, so I'm going to do again Okay, so now it's all clean. There's no tea left in there now. I'm going to turn on the heat I'm gonna add my cup of water here. I'm only making one serving now. I'm gonna add a little bit of tea here I'm very particular about the amount of tea. This is the amount of right tea. Now I would say this is too little okay, if you add this much It's not gonna be strong enough of flavor, so just know that like a difference of this much can matter a lot I'm going to take my measurement of what I normally eyeball like this and then I'm gonna measure it for you guys, so you guys can see how much is in here It's roughly a level one tablespoon But you got to realize whatever tea you use it may be a different concentration, so you need to adjust it according to the taste I'm gonna put it in the hot water here Going to put the lid back on. It's already boiling, so now I'm going to turn off the heat Right now I'm gonna start a timer for five minutes because after it boils I want it to brew for five minutes inside this teapot, now I don't want this thing to get cold so I'm leaving part of it on the heat still I can tell that it stopped boiling so you can kind of move it a little towards the heat more To keep it You know at a hot temperature because if you take this teapot and completely remove it it's gonna start to get cold That means it's not gonna brew as well, black tea for milk tea you want to brew it very strongly now the final temperature at which you drink your milk tea matters a lot as well if you put your hot milk tea in a cold cup it's gonna suck away all that heat from your hot tea so what I prefer to do while the tea is brewing is to add a tiny a bit of water into my cup It just maybe a quarter ways full and I'll put it in the microwave for about 45 to 60 seconds to make the cup hot Now if I'm not recording right now the tea takes five minutes to brew I might just start this up And I might go wash the dishes or something so I'm gonna do something in between Rather than sit around and wait for the tea. That's the timer saying that the tea is done in five minutes. Here I have the microwave water now. I'm just gonna dump this out. This cup is fairly hot right now. Hot cup Tea strainer Gonna pour it in here It's slightly more concentrated than usual today, but this is a good color. It'll still taste very good. Now over here is a new can of condensed milk I already have some over here. After you open this you pour it into a plastic container like this so that you can store it in the refrigerator Now remember when you pour this out into a new container don't heat the condensed milk in this can in order to try to get it out. Just put it upside down and leave it somewhere like this and let it fall out over here I'm gonna put some condensed milk here, and what I do is stick my spoon in there and the amount I put in is very specific. this is how much I want to put in I don't know how much this is I guess I can go and measure it hold on I guess what I'm using, it's also roughly one level tablespoon of Condensed milk. Okay, so I can just stick this all in here and it'll melt off of the spoon You can see as it melts, the color of my milk tea changes to a very rich color. Now you can indeed just drink this if you're okay with very, very low sugar What you may find is that this is not sweet enough, and I drink a very, very low sugar type of tea. So I don't even need all that much. What I like to do is add another half teaspoon of sugar into this concoction here So you can say this condensed milk is not very sweet But you don't want to add more condensed milk in here because this is the maximum amount of cream that you want in here already if you add too much cream then it'll taste kind of weird. One tablespoon is good enough over here. This is actually the second milk tea I'm having for today, the first one the camera was out of focus so I have to do this again Anyway, when you're making this milk tea You got to make sure the black tea is strong enough in order for the flavor to come through which brings in an important point if you don't want to have that much sugar you can drink this black tea again, and again throughout the day. If you want to make another black tea with the same tea you can actually brew it again. I'd brew it for a little bit longer. Maybe seven or eight minutes in order to try to get the flavor out more. Now I've used a lot of different things for the creamer including; powdered creamer, half-and-half, full fat milk, and now I've switched to condensed milk. I would say out of all of those half-and-half is pretty reasonable, but when you use regular milk it actually dilutes your milk tea a bit so it does taste not as rich. When you use condensed milk there's less water content in there so you don't dilute your tea as much, therefore it tastes more rich. of course the second brewing does not taste as good it tastes a little bit more diluted than the first of course. Now What can you do if you don't have any creamer at all if you have ice cream you can actually dunk one tablespoon of that into your coffee or tea and you can use that as your creamer when you use a certain kind of tea it depends on which kind of course you'll Taste the aroma sometimes it tastes almost even chocolaty. What I find is that if I have the milk tea by itself And I don't do anything else. I'm not reading articles. I'm not on the computer I'm not recording a video or anything I get the most enjoyment out of it because I'm just sipping it It's at its peak in terms of temperature, and it's not cooling down really, really fast And I'm concentrating on the flavor instead. When I'm doing something else what I find happens is that yes I do get enjoyment from the tea, but then my attention is focused on something else And I'm just you know having it as I'm doing something else. When I'm in front of the camera I actually do enjoy this almost just as much as not doing anything at all because essentially after every time I talk, I do take a sip of this this. This loose leaf tea you might be wondering, what brand is it? It's Ten Ren's tea. I often go and shop some loose leaf tea whenever there's something good I don't always stay with Ten Ren. This is the only bag I've bought. Ten Ren is a tea shop, and they happen to also sell milk tea it's popular in Taiwan They also have a store in the Bay Area So thanks for watching this video it's taken me 10 years to get to this point, of making this type of milk tea.

Thanks for watching! :)", "Ak2FWFLXYgE": "hey I'm Kristy Jordan a southern flank calm my family's lived in Alabama for the past nine generations and today I'm going to show you how we make our sweet tea senators are known for our sweet tea and with very good reason we drink it all day long but you're just going to have a nice glass of iced tea to get you through our summers down here to start with all we're going to need is some teammates some sugar whatever sweetener using some water then we're just going to use a plain old pot I'm using Lucienne tea bags they have a really good southern flavor to them it's that perfect sweet tea flavor but you can pick up another brand if you can't find these just look for orange pekoe which is a nice black tea and if you look even this is specially blended for us too on the sides it says ingredients Orange Pekoe Pico cut black teas that's what we're looking for so I'm going to show you how to make two quarts normally I make a gallon but I realize that some people may not go through as much tea as we do so I'll just show you how to make two for two we're going to take five of these regular-sized tea bags and I'm just pulling off the little tags and I'm going to put the bag string and I'll just toss it into my pot here okay now I've got something I love the smell team we have five in here now it's going to put a little water and you know there's not a certain recipe just pour two or three cups of water be fine if you're 4 or 4 cups that's fine we just want to get some water than 42 bolian I'm gonna put this on my eye and put it on medium to medium-high heat what you want to do is bring that to a bowl once it comes to a bowl we're ready to make our tea all right arty is all done what I did is I just brought it just to a bowl and then I removed it from the eye now I'm ready to make my team but if you want a stronger team you can let it sit in that pot and see for a little bit longer and if you'd like a little weaker tea just don't use five teabags use 14 bags or three two days this is real something that you need to play with to suit to your personal tastes it's very much the same when it comes to sweetener I'm going to use 3/4 of a cup of sugar for a 2 quart thing of tea some people use a lot more especially restaurants so you might want a little bit sweeter then again you might decide that a 1/2 cup is good for you so really take this recipe and play with it until you get the perfect blend of sweet and strong for your team today I'm showing you how I do it at my house now anytime somebody tells me that just can't make good tea it turns out they're always doing the one thing wrong everybody does the same thing you add your sugar to your hot tea this is a bad idea because it scorches your tea and it gives your tea a very bitter taste and we don't want that we want a nice smooth glass of tea so what I want to do to prevent that is I always add some cold water to my picture beforehand and then I add my sugar to the water itself then I go ahead and give that a stir once I pour my hot tea it's still plenty of warm enough to dissolve the sugar but it's not going to scorch it and give you that bitter taste and I'm a nice smooth mellow tea that we want so right at this point you would add your sugar 3/4 of a cup I actually don't use sugar in my team I use either a Splenda or ideal ideal is my favorite because it tastes just like real sugar to me but you can't actually get it where I live so it's kind of expensive for me I'm going to use it today though because it's a special treat right um most of the time I use Splenda or actually a generic version of Splenda ain't no shame in my game the cheaper the better so I'm going to use ideal and I use the exact amount that I do when I use sure I'm adding about 3/4 of a cup put that in there and I'll give it a little bit of a stir and now to add my tea and I've got my teabags still in here I'm just going to be careful not to touch the pot to the glass this isn't a 10 glass jug ears trim another reason why we don't want to add hot tea directly to the jug I'll use my spoon to help push those tea bags back see it's up definitely wonderful ready okay perfect tea and now of course give that another stir and then we're just going to pour it over ice see how easy that was all you need for two quarts five teabags orange pekoe tea 3/4 a cup of sugar bowl your tea bags bring it just to a bowl pour a little water over Brady just to a boil remove it from the eye fill up your jug about halfway with cold water add your 3/4 cup of sugar and then pour your tea into it poured over ice we have perfect I see mmm that's just child like it if you like me most later add a little more sugar if you like a little weaker use one less teabag just play with it just remember the tips and tricks that I taught you today and most importantly enjoy a nice glass of iced tea with your family this summer I'll see you soon southern play calm

tea mix review and it came from the grocery store called Aldi's dice tea mixes this right here is pretty much gone I decided before I finish it here tonight to make a review out of it because maybe not all of you know about the size tea mix number you know the first thing off the bat it does not come with a scoop second thing off the bat it I ain't the best tasting and the third thing it side it actually is quite expensive I mean it's cheaper than buying you know for an example for sea iced tea but for sea iced tea for the price get to a much bigger container in my opinion for see also taste a little bit better and 4c is only about a dollar fifty to two dollars more but you get a lot more in it you get a free scoop and it tastes better so my go-to is a for CI steamy unless I'm very if I'm like very short on cash then I'll pick up this Aldi's version but that's a very rare that I'll pick up the L DS version of the ice tea because it's not my go-to but I put it in this cup and I'm about to stir it up which I'm doing right now it also has issues breaking down and water more so than 4c but a smell test you know for my from the time I've been drinking this it doesn't really give in my opinion it doesn't give much of a scent even though it's supposed to be lemon iced tea mix and it is pre sweetened but doesn't really give much off the scent so taste test not much off of the taste of this either there's a hint of lemon but that's really about it you do get the tea coming you know behind it slightly I mean it is about a month old and I've noticed that the Aldi's version also it go it could still its tells a lot faster than for see where for see I've had four she lasts six months and then starts telling where I've you know this Aldys version stills within like a one month so I'm going to finish this here I'll give you my review score so here so my review score for this I Aldi's the lemon iced tea mix I'm going to be generous and give it a 7 out of 10 you know I've seen people give it higher scores and I've seen people absolutely bash it and give it like ones and twos and threes and fours out of tens I don't think it's that bad I mean granny you know it's not the best iced tea out there but it's definitely a more so affordable option so I give you know I'm giving it a 7 out of 10 you know I love alby's it's an amazing grocery store and they have a lot of really good foods and really good prices but this just um it's not one of the better priced options that they do have you know like through Dorito chips completely blows Doritos I have the order for price and the flavor and how many chips you get but this lemon iced tea really kind of will fall short of that marker but it's still an affordable option and it's still an option there that you can go for in this horrible tasting if you well it becomes horrible after than one month which I don't know why they still in one month I think that's I think that they need to look into why that still so fast and fix whatever is causing the stanlon if it's the container if it's somehow air leakage into the container or if it's something that they put into the you know iced tea mix itself because for sea ice tea can last like I said I've had mine I've had four series tea lasts up to six months so thing in my opinion and they need to figure out what that issue with Aldi's iced tea mix is but other than that seven out of ten I would still recommend if you want iced tea for at alby's I would still recommend picking this up it's just not my go-to if I have the extra spending cash I will always go for four see over the l DS iced tea mix but as I said again it's still a very affordable option if so my review scores seven have ten guys thank you all for watching I'll catch you on my future video is bad

using sweet light cheap black tea now most people were making coati they tend to be brewing tea with double the quantity and half the water amount but I think the best way to extract the sweet flavor of black tea is to actually do a cold infusion now in this pot I have some large black tea that has been fused in cold water over night over at least four or five hours outside I have here also a glass of ice there is no sweetener as you can see some mint to decorate because liegt is like a black tea is a transit black tea that's naturally sweet so you do not need to add any more honey or sugar or syrup so it's a very healthy drink so after infusing for at least four hours I will pour this with a future threw into the pan now this infusion here can be used as the base for a lot of alcoholic drinks so in British summer if you like this can be a base for pins when decorating it with a sprig of mint if you want you can add fresh lime juice that were x.x until a cheap black tea

Blake Schusterman and I'm a real doctor with a real passion for cooking join me as I share recipes that are healthy you need to make and most important delicious let's get cooking one of the things that drives me crazy here in South Carolina is that I cannot get people to stop drinking sweet tea no matter how many times I tell them that it would be better for their health if they quit it each glass of sweet tea has anywhere between a hundred to two hundred calories and people don't just drink one it's multiple when they're out to eat and I understand why it tastes really good but those are empty calories they just make it much more difficult to lose weight and keep your diabetes under control so here is a five minute alternative you can make it home really quick really easy okay so for our alternative we have orange and we have mint and we're going to mix that together with our unsweet tea in the refrigerator overnight so let's slice up an orange all right we're going to put that orange in our pitcher and depending on how much flavor you want you can even put two oranges in there and to that picture we're now going to add four to five little sprigs of mint and we're going to pour unsweetened tea directly on top that's going to sit in your refrigerator overnight and in the morning you'll have a delicious alternative to your normal sweet tea now it's going to take you some

to do our demonstration using an arrow latte French press first pre warm your cup and your French press by pouring hot water into it this will help to keep the water temperature even as the tea brews we recommend that you use a separate French press for tea and coffee once the French press and the mug are primed dump out the water measure the correct amount of tea into the French press for the number of cups that you'll be making next pour the hot water into the French press and allow that loose tea to steep take a look at this chart for the proper steeping time or check the description all right while the tea is steeping I'm going to give you a few tips for better tea alright the first tip is when you're using loose tea to measure the tea according to the package and if you're going to be making iced tea double the amount the second tip is in general for an 8 ounce cup of tea you'll want to use one level tablespoon of tea if your tea is fluffier you'll want to use a rounded tablespoon tip number three if you want a stronger cup of tea you can use more tea leaves but make sure that you stay within the recommended brew time to avoid bitterness from over steeping and our last tip if you don't have a thermometer to check the temperature of the water just keep in mind that boiling water will cool down to about 200 degrees Fahrenheit after 1 minute and 185 degrees Fahrenheit after about 2 to 3 minutes when the tea is done steeping press the plunger of the French press and pull into your cup and the last step is to enjoy your perfectly brewed tea you did you

coffee you can substitute it too with having an iced tea so how do you make an iced tea or rather I am going to show you how to make a lemon and mint iced tea very simple very few ingredients so what do we do to make this I need some lemon mint sugar and some tea leaves so before we begin we need to first put some water to boil okay and in this water my recipe of iced tea is really very simple or it is not like what you would do if you want to make it in a restaurant this is something that you can make at home and yet have the same result I can guarantee that the iced tea that I'm going to show you right now is going to taste exactly how you would get at a restaurant so it's a very simple recipe now in this we'll add in some sugar now this sugar has to dissolve well and this sugar or this water solution has to be sweet because that is the base of our iced tea of course we're going to top it up with a lot of ice so automatically the level of sugar will get diluted before that this needs to boil let the sugar boil in the meanwhile let's get the lime ready now we need lime to add to the glass at the same time we need some lemon juice as well so we'll first cut some lemon rounds so cut as many lemons roundels if you like your iced tea lemony you can add in more of these so here I have my lemon slices ready my glass is also ready we will just put in some mint leaves some lemon slices inside a little bit of line here because we need to squeeze it in the glass I'm now going to muddle this believe it just as it is what we can do is we can take a wedge give it a slit here like this rest it on the glass so your hourglass is ready so the glass is ready all that we're waiting for is the tea solution the sugar is also getting dissolved what we need to add in now is the tea leaves the tea is not supposed to be very strong so this is light golden in color when the actual flavor that we will have here in our iced tea is of lemon mint and of course a hint of tea the tea leaves are well Drude let's strain this [Music] now this solution that I have here the T solution is not very strong as you can see the color it's quite like honey and once you add lemon to this it will go even lighter or that is how I prefer my iced tea but this is currently very very hot so we may not be able to add this to the lemon right now but it's a very simple process all you have to do is stop up ice into this glass and just for this decoction once it goes cold and serve your iced tea chilled I am sure you'll all love this recipe do try it just the way I have shown you and you will definitely not want to go and have it in a restaurant cause making it at home is going to be super easy [Music]", "jg01JoFfjp8": "all right so today we'll be making some Thai iced tea you know we're gonna be doing this at home style I'm sure most of you guys have a French press boil up some water and we're gonna be using this Thai tea it's called cha cha Chi as you can see it's produced in Bangkok and you know this simply gin stuff here my girlfriend works at a Thai restaurant she brought this over I've seen these in the Asian grocers summation groceries I haven't seen it we'll put a link down below where you can get some for yourself so real easy to do right so here I'm just adding in about two heaping tablespoons worth of this tea mix here and then I'm gonna grab the sugar let's just put in about one tablespoon of sugar so uh yeah you just fill it up with water here don't feel it too much just fill it to about there because you got to remember we're gonna press down on it and we got to do just stir it up all right so I'm going to be making three versions of this Thai iced tea this first version is authentic Thai we use evaporated milk and condensed milk all right here we go this is the first version next one sweet condensed milk and I got the organic kind now for those of you that are lactose intolerant out there try some coconut milk this one's unsweetened so when you add in your teabag mixture with the hot water put more sugar in it alright guys so this coconut milk here kind of settles in so what you want to do is kind of stir it up alright so now that this has been steeping here I'm just pressing down all the herbs to the bottom so all we get is the liquid all right now I'm just gonna transfer it into like some kind of mixing pot put it into a glass I'm just gonna put in the pot and mix up the milk in here but man look at that orange color like this is like iced tea time when it's orange color like that's how you know alright guys so now what I'm doing is I'm taking that sweet condensed milk and I'm putting in let's say about two tablespoons there's two all right and then the evaporated milk just added in just for the color ink you know as much as you like but you see how he just turned all of a sudden orange there that's what we're looking for I just gave it a little tape taste test and that's like spot-on right there now you it works best with crushed ice into the top transfer it over nice and sweet beautiful color you gotta try it all right so now we're gonna do a version of the Thai team you are allergic to milk and here I'm adding in two heaping tablespoons tea per person now since the coconut milk is unsweetened we're gonna add in more sugar than the previous than the previous version so I'm adding in more sugar but you know don't be scared because this trick is meant to be sweet [Music] [Music] we're just mixing it up all the sugar all the herbs let it steep in there for a couple of minutes all right here we go we're gonna try out two different versions I got two crushed ice here push down all the herbs there all right so this one will be with the coconut milk alright guys here we go give it a nice little more stir [Music] this one just add in the half-and-half alright guys so this here is the authentic version this here's with the coconut milk and this here is what you find out you know the American Thai restaurants with half-and-half as you can see they all look very similar in color and I gotta admit they all taste great try for yourself let me know which one you guys like so once again guys I

those on their own or you can mix it up with a syrup and have for example peach and cucumber raspberry and hibiscus for our first one we'll just be doing a normal peach iced tea on its own so using 30 mils of monning peach iced tea top your glass up with ice followed by water give it a quick stir and then add to garnish which is just going to be a peach slice and a little bit of mint give it a little bit more aroma finish with a straw and that's your simple peach iced tea so as we said that's just the base moving on to our next one you can also have pumps on top of the bottles these are pumps of five mill pumps so for the same sort of recipe we start with our tea as a base using 30 mils so six pumps and then for our flavour we use 15 mils so just three pumps fill your glass with ice

Now it has a stronger\ntaste and more caffeine than other teas, but less\ncaffeine than coffee. Black tea also has a\nvariety of health benefits and in this video we're looking\nat five of the best ones. Number one, has antioxidant properties. Antioxidants are known to provide\na host of health benefits. Consuming them can help\nremove free radicals and decrease cell damage in the body. This ultimately may help decrease the risk of chronic disease. And groups of polyphenols,\nincluding catechins and theaflavins are the\nmain sources of antioxidants in black tea and may\npromote overall health. In fact, one study in\nrats examined the role of theaflavins in black tea and the risk of diabetes, obesity,\nand elevated cholesterol. Results show that theaflavins\nreduce cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Another study examined the role of catechins from green\ntea extract on body weight. It found that those who consumed a bottle containing 690 milligrams\nof catechins from tea on a daily basis for 12 weeks showed a decrease in body fat. And while many supplements\ncontain antioxidants, it's best to consume\nthem through whole foods and beverages, of course. Number two, may boost heart health. Black tea contains another group of antioxidants called flavonoids, and these may be beneficial\nfor heart health. Now alongside tea you can also find them in certain vegetables, red\nwine, and dark chocolate. Consuming them on a regular basis may help reduce many risk\nfactors for heart disease, including high blood\npressure, high cholesterol, elevated triglyceride levels, and obesity. One randomized control study\nfound that drinking black tea for 12 weeks significantly\ndecreased triglyceride values by 36%, reduced blood sugar levels by 18%, and lowered the LDL-to-HDL\nplasma ratio by 17%. Number three, may lower\nbad LDL cholesterol. When there's too much LDL in the body it can build up in the arteries and cause waxy deposits called plaques. This can lead to problems\nlike heart failure or stroke. Now fortunately, some studies have found that consuming tea may help\nreduce LDL cholesterol. One randomized study found that drinking five servings\nof black tea per day reduced LDL cholesterol\nby 11% in individuals with slightly or mildly\nelevated cholesterol levels. Another randomized, three-month study in 47 individuals compared the effects of traditional Chinese black tea extract and a placebo on LDL levels. Results showed a significant\ndecrease in LDL levels in those who drank black\ntea compared to the placebo without any undesirable side effects. Researchers concluded that black tea helped improve cholesterol levels in individuals at risk for\nheart disease or obesity. Number four, may improve focus. Black tea contains caffeine and an amino acid called L-theanine, which can improve alertness and focus. L-theanine increases alpha\nactivity in the brain, resulting in relaxation and better focus. Studies have found that\nbeverages containing L-theanine and caffeine have the\ngreatest impact on focus due to the effects of\nL-theanine on the brain. And this may be why many individuals report more stable\nenergy after drinking tea compared to other caffeinated\nbeverages like coffee. Two randomized studies\ntested black tea's effects on accuracy and alertness,\nand both studies, black tea significantly increased accuracy and self-reported alertness\namong participants compared to placebo. This makes black tea a great beverage if you're looking to\nimprove energy and focus without relying on lots of caffeine. Number five, may improve gut health. Studies have found that the\ntypes of bacteria in your gut may influence many aspects of health. The polyphenols found in black tea may help maintain a healthy gut by promoting the growth of good bacteria and inhibiting the growth of bad bacteria such as salmonella. Further research is needed in this area but it's interesting nonetheless. Ultimately, black tea is a\nhealthy, high-antioxidant option if you're looking for a\nlow-calorie, non-sweetened beverage that has less caffeine than\ncoffee and energy drinks.

more effective ways to lose a couple of pounds so when I read that lemon water can make it happen I didn't really hold out too much hope however this little experiment quickly turned into something that changed my appearance completely but before you hear about the rest of my journey don't forget to hit subscribe and ring the notification bell to join us on the bright side of life before I began my experiment I did a little research as it turns out lemons are packed with numerous vitamins minerals vitamins and antioxidants according to the world's healthiest foods just a quarter cup of lemon juice contains 31% of our recommended daily vitamin C intake with an additional 3% of full weight which is good for your heart and 2% of potassium which balances your blood pressure so it seemed like a great idea to combine it with water to not only maintain bodily fluids but control calories as well this hot combo was quickly named one of the best homemade drinks for detoxifying the body moreover as more and more people started to get involved it turned out that lemon water can shield our bodies from some serious problems kidney stones for example as the source of citric acid that according to UW Health decreases the risk of getting new calcium stones a half cup of lemon water alone contains the same amount of citric acid as prescription varieties experts from the Edison Institute of nutrition also confirm lemon waters beneficial effects and recommend drinking it in the morning on an empty stomach and that's exactly what I did I woke up squeeze the juice of half a lemon mixed it with 1/3 of a cup of boiling water and 1/4 cup of cold filtered water to reach a perfect balance drank it and ate my breakfast and it wasn't long before I started to see some serious changes the first thing I noticed was that my digestive system started to wake up instantly even before I finished my drink before the experiment I was rarely hungry in the morning often skipping breakfast even if I did eat my portions were very small now my belly growls and asks for food almost immediately and I started to enjoy breakfast way more as I later learned this is all thanks to lemons ability to jumpstart our digestive process after a long night's rest another thing that surprised me was how much my mood changed after drinking lemon water I used to be a hardcore night owl who couldn't stand mornings but after 30 days of the experiment everything changed so I guess lemon water not only wakes your body up but also lifts your mood and I never thought that I would say this but morning hours really started to grow on me after the second week of regular lemon water consumption my skin significantly improved it's not like it was terrible before but I still had blackheads post acne spots and occasional pimples now the condition of my skin is way better and I'm still working on it but here's another nice fact according to dermatologists lemon water can help with wrinkles too the antioxidants that lemons contain prevents cellular damage and protect the skin from free radicals that lead to aging lemons are also rich in vitamin C and have some powerful antibacterial properties that work wonders when it comes to fighting infections unfortunately I'm one of those people who often get sick but I feel like drinking lemon water regularly has made my immune system a bit stronger since the moment I made it part of my daily routine I felt sick only once and it quickly went away another nice effective lemon water is fresh breath nothing much but it's still very pleasant finally the biggest achievement of my experiment was something I was looking forward to a whole long weight loss after just three weeks of drinking lemon water I lost nearly 20 pounds I'm almost at my ideal weight and I can already see my body changing especially my belly the thing is one of lemon waters endless benefits is that it cuts down the bloating that we can wrongly perceive as excess weight as a result there's a good chance that drinking it daily will make your stomach perfectly flat either way you definitely won't be disappointed with the final results if you want to follow in my footsteps and try drinking lemon water daily there are a couple more things you have to know in general lemon water is safe for your body however it still contains citric acid which can hurt sensitive tooth enamel the solution is simple always drink lemon water through a straw and don't forget to rinse your mouth afterward if you have any teeth problems it's better to visit your dentist before proceeding with this experiment drinking simple lemon water for 30 days straight can become boring from time to time so whenever I got tired of it I just replaced it with different variations don't worry it won't hurt the weight loss process or any other improvements that your body is going through on the contrary every lemon water variation has unique benefits that your body will certainly love first off try cucumber lemon water thinly slice half a lemon and a quarter of a cucumber and add them to water with a bit of ice let it sit in the fridge for a couple of minutes and it's ready cucumbers are loaded with potassium which lowers blood pressure reduces puffiness which let's be real we all need in the morning and boost metabolism and lemons to the mix and you'll get the perfect detox drink another one of my personal favorites is warm lemon water with honey if you want to try it boil 1 cup of water and add the juice of one medium lemon and 2 teaspoons of honey if you do everything right the honey will dissolve let it cool for a bit and it'll be perfectly fine to drink it's better to use organic honey for this recipe since it has more healthy elements and nutrients which your body can use as fuel this low-calorie drink will detoxify your body just as efficiently as simple lemon water and it will provide additional help with melting fat and making your skin perfect pairing lemon with mint is also a good idea it's the best option for giving your energy and mood a double boost if you're interested juice have a fresh lemon add it to warm water and finish it off with a few sprigs of mint finally if your main goal is to lose weight choose lemon ginger water both lemons and ginger can significantly improve your metabolism plus this is the type of drink you can consume throughout the day to get rid of toxins you should start with washing peeling and slicing one ounce of ginger root when that's done put it in a jug filled with water and leave it like that in the fridge overnight the next morning pour the water into a glass and heat it until it becomes lukewarm add the juice of a medium-sized lemon and drink the finished mix during the day it's better to keep it cold but lukewarm ginger water will work too so you have quite a variety of options here pick the one you like best and go for it so what do you think would you like to conduct this kind of experiment

fell to me too me [Music] you", "_X7Ejj5DFdA": "hey there i'm terry from tri-marie soapworks and today i'm going to show you how i made this batch it's an ultra thin line swirl and it's the technique we learned for the september of 2020 soap challenge the soap challenge is hosted by amy warden and this time we had a guest teacher named tatiana serko and i've given information in the description below for amy and tatiana before we get started i just want to let you know that i have tips throughout this whole video and all my videos and i usually do a section at the end of my videos of what i learned and kind of troubleshoot and find out what i would have done differently or what i will do differently for my next batch so it's notes to myself but notes to you all so you can learn through me and my experiences so just hang in there for the end of the video okay let's get started first i use about a third to a half of my water weight in distilled water ice cubes and then i top off the remaining water weight with distilled water for the next step we'll be measuring the lie and that's a step that you must be geared up for safety before you make any kind of soap using lye you need to make sure you understand the proper safety procedures i've linked a video about life safety in the description below next i add the sodium hydroxide to the water and i stir that until it's dissolved make sure especially when you're using ice cubes that you get it all dissolved and don't let any settle on the bottom if that happens it's really hard to break up so just make sure it's all dissolved in the beginning next i measure the sodium lactate sodium lactate is a totally optional ingredient it's a natural ingredient and it helps your soap to release from the mold much easier and cleaner and it also helps the soap to last longer next i set these ingredients aside in a place that's well ventilated and safe for many kids or pets my next ingredient is sustainable palm kernel flakes and palm kernel oil is very similar in makeup to coconut oil but the difference is it has a lot more stearic acid when you use palm kernel flakes and coconut oil you usually use it for the hardness and for the lather and it can be a bit drying well palm kernel oil would add a little more moisture than you would get from your coconut oil because of the extra stearic acid next i measure the coconut oil in the lard this ingredient is kind of shied away from and i understand if you're a vegan or you're staying away from lard for religious reasons but if you're not and you're looking for an ingredient that makes your bar hard and also slows down your batter lard is a great ingredient for that it has a lot of steric and palmitic acid but not a lot of the lauric and myristic acid so it's not drying and it's making your bar hard and it's also a substitute for palm oil if you're trying to get away from palm oil okay next i measure my liquid ingredients and for this one all i have is the castor oil and the olive oil now that i've melted those three hard oils i go ahead and add the cocoa butter and i just stir it until it's melted and if it needs microwaved i just microwave it until it's just barely melted next i measure the fragrance oil and today i'm using black tie fragrance from wholesale supplies plus it's a very slow moving fragrance and it actually decelerates your batter so this is a very good fragrance to use for this technique because we need our batter to stay fluid while we work next i measure kaolin clay into my fragrance oils and i'm using a rate of one teaspoon per pound of oils since kaolin clay is so absorbent it sometimes causes acceleration but since it's really diluted with this fragrance oil i never notice any acceleration because of it next i'm going to prepare the colorants and i'm starting with titanium dioxide i've already pre-dispersed this in olive oil i used a rate of one part titanium dioxide to three parts of olive oil and i'm using this for my base color and to figure out how much i need i go to elements bath bodies coloring calculator and i'm using a rate of one teaspoon per pound of oils i put the information in that it asks for and it gives me the results of how much dry colorant i need and also if i'm predispersing it and gives me the information of that amount predispersed in teaspoons and also in tablespoons my next ingredient is smooth coconut carbon and i'm using it at a rate of one and a half teaspoons per pound of soap and all of these colorants come from elements bath and body all of the rest of these colorants i'm using at a rate of one teaspoon per pound of oils and next one we have black onyx mica i'm using two ounces of batter for each of these so when i go to the colorant calculator i look under per pound of oils and i look under when you're using a specific amount of batter and i just fill in the information and i get out the amount that i need that was smoky black and mica it makes a really pretty gray color and then next we have faded blue jeans mica which is also a gorgeous color you see these little colors samples that i made i used the rate of one teaspoon per pound of oils to test these colorants and they kind of came out a little differently when i made this batch because some of these color samples didn't go through gel so the celestial blue color ended up coming out darker when i actually made it into soap which is more what you would expect by looking at the color of the mica i know you're used to me using my palette knife and my plexiglas to mix my colorants but really for this one the only one that's difficult to mix is the titanium dioxide and i did that ahead of time so the smooth coconut cavern is very powdery and that's easy to mix and then all of the micas are easy the palette knife and the plexiglas are really helpful for when you're using pigment colors like your oxides and your ultramarines and neons that's when i like to use them because they tend to clump a lot more and then you'll have them in your final batter and there'll be specks and streaks when you cut them and it's just really annoying so that's why you need to get your colors pre-diluted and dispersed before you mix them into your batter next i add the liquid oils to the melted hard oils and you notice they look a little shimmery in there and that's because olive oil contains some palmitic acid and a little bit of stearic acid and both of those are saturated fats so when you stir them a little bit that causes them to melt because of the warmth of the other oils and you always want your oils to be clear if they are starting to cloud up and get solid you know that you need to microwave them again i don't worry so much about temperature i worry more about having all of my saturated fats melted and completely clear otherwise you can get steric spots on your final batch after that i strained my lye solution into my melted oils and then i realized that i forgot to add my sodium lactate to my lye solution and so i just added that too it's not a big deal but i usually do add it to my lye solution first for reference here i'm showing you the temperatures but again for me it's more important that my oils are completely melted usually my temperatures end up falling between 85 and 95 degrees fahrenheit or that's between 26 and 35 degrees celsius next i stick blend until an emulsion is reached and you can kind of look at the edge all the way around the bowl and you can see that there's a slick of oil and that's what needs to be mixed in and when you find that all of that is mixed that's when your mixture has reached an emulsion you can see that when i stop and then when i start again you can see those slicks of oil kind of get swirled into the center and that's not quite mixed yet so you just pay attention to that you can pull your stick blender out and look at the stainless steel and you can see whether it's starting to break apart or get kind of wavy or if it looks really thin and uh even film on there if it's even film that means that it's emulsified [Music] next i'm pouring off two ounces of batter or 56 grams and i'm just figuring out the first one and then i'm just going to eyeball the rest of them to get it about the same height in the container once i have these all measured i use my stir stick and stir them by hand until i get them all dispersed evenly and i do that before i add the fragrance because after adding the fragrance you don't want to be stirring too much to get your colorant dispersed because once you add the fragrance usually your batter will move along a little more quickly and for this recipe we need it to stay fluid just as long as possible so we can get our designing in i gave my fragrance and my kale and clay a little blend and then i scooped out seven milliliters which happens to be a half a tablespoon into each one of these little two ounce containers once i get the fragrance and clay in there i just make sure it's dispersed evenly after everything's dispersed i go ahead and get my mold ready today i'm using a nine bar slab mold next i'm just pouring stripes of color and i'm trying to get them to break through to the bottom of the other batter because that way we'll have color all the way through the batter to get the color to go to the bottom you just drop it from a little higher and that helps it break through for this technique we had to achieve really thin lines and to do that we had to swirl the lines really close together so for this one i used a popsicle stick and i used a straight edge to help me which i really recommend but one thing i would do differently right here i would have pulled the skewer out at the end and reinserted it because you notice at the blue part especially that i drag it to the end and then i drag it back and it pulls it back and the line doesn't go all the way to the edge so that kind of messes up the design on those bars that are on the very edge also i really liked the straight edge and the popsicle stick and possibly i would even consider using a tongue depressor to do the swirling the popsicle stick really helped as opposed to when i just used a round glass stirring rod i usually like those for swirling because they really glide on the bottom but i think the flat skewer pulled a lot more soap [Music] for this soap challenge the rules were that for the advanced category you have to design each individual bar and you have to use the same design so first i'm sectioning off the bars and making the vertical lines to delineate each one of the bars and if you would swirl the other way it wouldn't make a swirl so i can't delineate the bars in the other direction this part is the part that made the difference between the regular category and the advanced category we had to do a little design and make it consistent throughout each bar once i was finished with this i just covered it and i forced gel like i normally do in the oven by turning the oven on to 170 and just for a few seconds just to get it warm and then i just turn it off put my soap in turn the oven light on and leave it on until i go to bed and i turn the light off let it come to room temperature naturally and then i leave it covered for a few days and then i cut my soap first i have to divide these bars by three and in order to do that i use the trick of slanting my ruler i have an architect scale and i pick a number that's divisible by three that's a little bit bigger than the width of my slab in this case it was 30 so i divided 30 by 3 and then i marked on every 10 and i joined those lines together and that's how i equally divided this slab by three if you're interested i made a video on why i slant my ruler and it explains that in a little more detail okay i'm just using this jig that my husband made to cut these lines vertically with my wire cutter next i just use my planer and get that top layer off so it's a smooth bar this is totally optional but it often enhances the design a little bit after this i just divided each of these three pieces into three and i got my nine bars okay now i'm just going to highlight a few of the things that i would like to remember for next time and that worked and some of the things that didn't work it's very important to use a slow moving fragrance and even a decelerating fragrance and this black tie fragrance from wholesale supplies plus is definitely a decelerating fragrance and there's energy from bramble berry and i also use pink grapefruit from wholesale supplies plus those are all good ones yuzu is another one from elements bath and body sometimes fruity ones have that citrus in them which is a degreaser and that slows down fragrances also after you get your soap to an emulsion don't use your stick blender after that just wait on your batter and stir it by hand that will really help it not to accelerate and don't get in a rush if you get in the rush and decide to stick blend it a lot of times you get it too far and you can't go back my next tip is when you're swirling move your swirl tool slowly i know in my video it looks like i move it fast because i speed it up but i think you get a better swirl if you move it slowly another thing to remember with your swirl tool is that wherever you pull it out it's going to leave a little pool so when i designed these individual bars every spot that i pulled it out kind of has a little muddled spot and if i was doing this again not for a challenge i wouldn't individually design each bar i would pull through and that way there wouldn't be so many spots that are pooled as i mentioned earlier when you're using your swirl tool to drag your soap in one direction and then you change and go in the opposite direction it kind of drags your swirl back so your swirl won't go to the edge so if you want your swirl to go all the way to the edge just pull it out and reinsert it i think i need to remember that a lot for my designs when i'm doing this kind of soap making another tip that i have for doing this design when you're pouring your color on the top you really need a pour spout i tried it with a paper cup and it just ran all over the place and my lines were terrible so if you have a pour spout that helps a lot i just got these beakers on amazon and they have any size you could want do you ever find that when you're doing designs for these kind of soap challenges that you wouldn't have done otherwise that you kind of get some ideas for some new ways to do things new ideas for designs and i have gotten a few and it's gotten me

beginning of this video there is a drastic change that I can see at least hey guys welcome back to my channel today I am gonna be showing you what happened to my skin as I rubbed a green tea ice cube on it every day for one week if you guys are new to my channel hello my name is Audrey I make a lot of these experimental skincare and hair videos so if this is the type of content that you're interested in make sure you subscribe so green tea has so many benefits for your skin when applied topically it's supposed to be a great remedy for puffy under eyes it also helps with your skin elasticity and firmness it protects against sun damage it helps to reduce rosacea it even apparently helps to reduce the oiliness in your skin which as we all know can often lead to acne and by the way literally all I did to make the green tea ice cubes was I took some Newman's Own organic green tea and I just brewed an entire mason jar full I waited for it to cool down and I poured it into an ice cube tray I put it in the freezer and there you go now throughout this entire video I always washed my face first using the youth to the People superfood cleanser then I used the green tea ice cube for about 15 to 20 seconds then I applied jojoba oil on my skin oh and I always did this in the morning so I started off this week with some yellow-red dark circle discoloration around my eyes eyelids etc also I had a few leftover red spots on my upper lip from some acne that I had in the previous week it's cold let's focus on the under-eye bags here now it really felt refreshing to rub the green tea ice cube on my face just to start off my day and actually it felt much more refreshing than using a regular ice cube with just straight-up water so after I rubbed the ice cube on my face I just pat dry with a towel and then I applied jojoba oil that feels amazing and this is what my skin looks like on day one I actually noticed that my skin was not that oily throughout the day like it usually is and I think that is obviously because with green tea apparently it helps to reduce oiliness so on day two I did still notice a little bit of discoloration around my eyes but I actually thought that my skin looked amazing on the morning of day two I started off this week with some red spots from a few pimples that I had in the week prior as I mentioned and by day two the red spots had already gone down also applying jojoba oil on cold skin feels incredible also something that I haven't mentioned yet but the green tea ice cubes smell amazing which makes this experience so much better I thought it might be helpful to show you guys a day-by-day comparison here I think that the biggest thing I noticed is that on day two I look so much more awake and just refreshed now we are on day three so I just want to mention something that I haven't talked about thus far but whenever I use an ice cube on my face I always either let it sit out from the freezer for about ten to fifteen minutes or I just run it under hot water for a few seconds and I do this to let the ice melt a little bit because if I use the ice cube fresh out of the freezer without a barrier between the ice and my skin it will probably irritate my skin also I make sure to keep the ice moving on my face I never leave it on a certain part of my face for more than like half a second because you could burn your skin that way so just some things to keep in mind when I am using ice on my face I hope that this is translating on camera but my dark circles are pretty much gone wow I feel like there is a really stark contrast between what they looked like yesterday and how they look today which is very interesting considering the fact that last night I didn't even have a good night's sleep so it must be the ice cubes so for day 4 just a heads up my lower back was hurting so bad and that is not an exaggeration so if I look just like disheveled and out of it it's because I was anyway on day 4 once again my complexion looked fresh and glowy I also actually discovered that if I apply the green tea ice cubes on my lips it really plumps my lips and obviously this is short-lived but I was still amazed and I think it's a combination of the caffeine in the green tea and the coldness of the ice cube I can tell the green tea ice cube works not only to almost make me look more awake but the green tea itself works to fight the morning puffiness as well as the redness and discoloration that I have when I compare day 1 to day 4 I'm able to see a visible difference in the brightness of my complexion also once again I look a lot more awake on day 4 than on day 1 and similarly around my eyes it's not as yellow as it is on day 1 hey guys I realize I haven't really done much talking as I've been using the green tea on my face so I just decided today I will talk through this one so I just wash my face with the use to the people super food cleanser and now I'm gonna rub this oh my god it's cold sorry I think that maybe today it's like extra cold even though that's impossible oh my gosh it feels amazing on my skin this is honestly just a really quick super inexpensive way to wake up your skin in the morning it feels really really nice now I'm gonna apply my jojoba oil I don't know what it is about my skin but every time I rub the green tea ice cube on it my cheeks are where it feels the most smooth and the coldest look at how smooth it is oh my god that's Wow and look at my under-eye bags I feel like they're pretty much gone and I literally just woke up which is crazy compared to the beginning of this video there is a drastic change I really like this 10 times better than regular ice I'm just amazed Wow love it love it love it I feel like it gave me a glow it's just an awesome way to revive my skin and just like wake it up in the morning so for day six I actually wanted to switch things up I wanted to try the green tea ice cube at night and I also wanted to try applying it onto my skin after oil cleansing anyway first I all cleansed with jojoba oil and castor oil and oil cleansing essentially just deep cleans your face the oils and dirt on your face bind to the oils that your oil cleansing with and you'll wipe it all off after with a wet hot washcloth and your skin will be dirt free you know bacteria free it's just it's amazing and then after I all cleansed I just used the green tea ice cube but like I had been using throughout this entire week so I actually think that day six yielded the best most noticeable results on my skin oil cleansing and using an ice cube after and better yet a green tea ice cube is just an unmatched combination my skin actually felt like baby skin after I was done applying jojoba oil on my skin after rubbing the ice cube on it my complexion was so evened out there was no puffiness now for day seven the very last day so I used the ice cube in the morning on the last day and I don't know if I've emphasized this enough thus far seriously applying a green tea ice cube on your face or on my face in the morning is just amazing like let's just say that it doesn't even do anything to my skin just the sensation that it gives me on my face it's just so refreshing it wakes me up and not only is it that the ice felt good but there's also something about the green tea that just feels so refreshing and clean on my face and here's my skin on day seven so although from what I can remember I was completely exhausted on the morning of day 7 I feel like my skin actually looks really bright glowy and healthy and compared to the first day I see a huge difference in the discoloration around my eyes so now let's go day by day to see what the huge major differences were if any by day three I think I started to notice it in my under-eye bags or the discoloration around my eyes the most also I started to notice that although I do have rosy cheeks I think the green tea really helped to reduce inflammation in my skin that I often have in the morning which just made me look overall less tired and then of course my acne spots mainly those on my upper lip visibly went down by the end of the week interestingly enough though as I'm looking at the images from throughout the week I do kind of feel like in the middle of the week my skin started to look a little bit more red that may have been due to the fact that I took a hot shower before filming those clips also I was dealing with really bad back pain so I just wasn't feeling well in general but the day one versus day 7 contrast is very visible and again not that my skin looked horrible to begin with because it didn't look terrible but maybe because I see my face in the mirror everyday I am more able to just pick up on these small changes anyway these are my results of using the green tea ice cube on my face every day for a week so in the future will I continue to use green tea ice cubes on my face definitely but just once a week and of course in the morning I really like the way that it makes my skin feel it's just amazing so if you guys would like to see a video where I rubbed a regular ice cube on my face every day for a week I will put that video right here and if you guys would like to see a video I did recently showing you how I am treating and getting rid of my acne scars I will put that video right here so thank you guys so much for watching I love all of you and I will talk to you guys next time", "iT-JNGaUoBE": "[Music]", "EkVAcen03Vg": "it's been blistering hot here in Minneapolis and I'm going to show you guys how to make one of my favorite drinks that keeps me cool all summer look it's one of my absolute favorites it's Thai iced tea and after I show you guys I make this you will probably never purchase it again at a Thai restaurant cuz to be honest I feel like it is quite pricy I mean a big of this is like five dollars and you could probably make gallons of it for the price of just a few cups you only need a few ingredients to make it and it's super simple so I'm going to show you how to do that today I always like to keep things super simple the less dishes I have to do the better I purchase this nylon bag from a brewery if you don't have one of these you can certainly use like a mesh strainer or a tea sock which I have not been able to find but I do find that it is so much easier to just use this to steep the tea and then I can just remove it dispose of it and then I'm done although I do recycle these so I don't always toss them out after one use what I have here is a pitcher I have 1/2 a cup of the Tai Chi leaves I'm also going to use sugar and some hot water that I already have going go ahead and get the tea leaves into the strainer get that into your pitcher and I just tie it to this I've already measured out 4 cups of water in this pitcher so now I'm just going to fill this up and then we're going to add a half a cup of sugar if you guys like it sweeter you can add more but just keep in mind we are going to be adding condensed milk once this cools down get your sugar in there give that a stir and then we're just going to let this cool and I'll show you guys how to serve it once this has cooled down you can go ahead and remove the tea bag I lined my counter with some paper towel because I'm super clumsy this stuff stains everything it touches so to avoid having an orange counter top I just put a different towel down to make the drink just fill a glass with some ice then you can just pour this into your glass and then just leave a little bit of room at the top for the condensed milk you guys can add it as little or as much condensed milk as you want I have it in this jar here because I already open the can kind of a messy stuff but go ahead and just drop that in there I'm going to do two big spoonfuls of this I'll stir it around and it will turn this gorgeous shade of orange kind of like my shirt I did not plan that I'm going to grab a straw pop that in and

down the hot fruity and the drink is ready to enjoy in just minutes you'll start with two bags of the Lipton iced tea brewed family-sized teabags you'll have two cups of boiling water one twelve ounce package of frozen mixed berries one cup of orange juice and 2 cups of chilled seltzer so let's get started first take your teabags and place them into a heat proof pitcher or bowl simply let those brew for five minutes with the two cups of boiling water after your teas done brewing go ahead and remove your teabags but give them a nice squeeze against the side of your glass to release all that extra good tea flavor there you go and then simply place the hot tea mixture right into your blender again the beauty of this recipe is you don't need to cool down your tea at all so it goes right into your blender then you're gonna add your 12 ounce package of your frozen mixed berries and you're one cup of orange juice simply cover and process it until it's well blended that look great Oh such a beautiful color once it's all blended simply pour it into your pitcher no needs dirty any more dishes we'll just use the same measuring cup we have the orange juice in give it a little bit of a stir look at that this is a perfect drink for maybe breakfast time or even an after-school pick-me-up it's really perfect the whole family will enjoy and because there's a little bit of orange juice in there go ahead and feel free to garnish it with a slice of orange there you go very quick citrus iced tea mmm it's delicious and I love the flavor of the berries with the tea enjoy", "Y-kx8JEDgnE": "I'm going to show you how to brew the perfect cup of tea using a tea bag now when people using tea bags they're often in a rush and they don't make the tea properly so the first thing you should do is take your tea bag and put it in your cup some people would actually also like to warm this cup first so that it will help the tea brew next we need to take freshly boiled water if the water is already boiled it will have lost a lot of oxygen and that means the tea won't brewed properly and the resulting infusion will be flat and dull so you must always use freshly drawn water and allow the water to come fully to the boil it should reach a hundred degrees Celsius for the tea to brew properly so as the kettle is now coming up to a rolling boil we'll just turn it off so again it doesn't over boil and lose all the oxygen and pour that straight on to the tea bag so you want the tea to brew as close to 100 degrees Celsius as possible so that it gets a really good infusion my managing director always tells me that you should treat teabag as you treat a loose tea so give it as good a brew as possible and one of the things you can do if you've got a saucer is cover that over to help keep the heating this is where people often go wrong with a tea bag they'll stand and dunk the tea bag and as soon as the color looks about right they'll think it's ready to drink well tea bag tea is the same as any tea it needs time for the full flavor to come out and for Tebow's we say you must give it a minimum of three minutes to brew it properly so we've now given the tea a good three minutes to brew to take the saucer off and we'll just give the tea a little bit of a dunk to help it mix even better now it's looking like it's got a good strong color but the flavor will also come out and take this teabag out also give it a little bit of a squeeze to get all the flavor out and there again is your perfect cup of tea you can drink that however you like you can drink it black with a little bit of milk or lemon or sugar that's up to you but you should now given the tea the chance to develop the full flavor which we intended", "A8xDU1Eqoho": "[Music] you [Music] you",

watching you", "le6vodQGeVI": "how to make a perfect cup of tea leaves master blenders at tea leaves go to great lengths to make you the very best teas be confident that you are preparing and drinking teas made from the highest quality tea harvests herbs spices and flowers please follow each of the following steps paying close attention to details from water to steeping time and final presentation water the famous Chinese poet you loo around 800 BC wax poetic about the best water to brew tea in Vancouver we like to make tea from glacial mountain springs fed by whistlers iced milk this water is icy cold and super rich in oxygen the fresh of the water the more you taste the delicate and complex notes of your tea in the real world we suggest water that is cold low in minerals and filtered we particularly like reverse osmosis filtered water high minerals or hard water is not great because it makes your tea taste flat and oily fire it is important to use the correct water temperature for the different types of tea some teas like whites and greens are best infused at lower water temperatures if you use overly hot water with whites or green teas you can bruise the tea leaves resulting in a bitter cup of tea however other teas you fooding blacks and herbals need water that is boiling hot to properly extract all of the flavor if the water is not right a boiling black teas will not properly infuse and you will miss out on all the wonderful middle notes of the tea the Chinese actually have a term to signify the proper water boiling point when you see fish eyes the small string of bubbles or simmering that is the correct water temperature for whites and green teas if you continue to let the water boil for a few more seconds you see a string of pearls this is the right water temperature for oolong teas wait a few more moments and once the water is at a rolling boil this is the optimal water temperature for black teas and herbal be warned if you are heating water using a kettle do not over boil your water just as soon as the water comes to a full boil immediately stop the heat as water boils you lose levels of dissolved oxygen the more dissolved oxygen you have in your water the better your tea will taste purify if you are making black or herbal tea pre-heat the teapot by swirling with a little bit of hot water this ensures your high temperature to use steep precisely at the proper temperature say you have a glass or porcelain teapot when you pour boiling water into this teapot it will quickly absorb the heat and thereby cool druing tea remember you need boiling hot water to make the perfect cup of black tea if the glass has cooled the water the water is no longer at boiling the tea will infuse at a lower water temperature and will not taste as good as we had intended leaves to select your leaves let's turn to the relationship between fermentation and caffeine content these traits help distinguish between our five different varietals of tea caffeine is related to each to use level of fermentation white and green tea leaves remain unfermented so they contain a low level of caffeine ulong's as well as black teas are both fermented for varying amounts of time creating medium to high levels of caffeine our bowls are made from anything but tea leaves and so do not have any caffeine in them having selected your tea use one teaspoon of tea leaves tea per cup of water for example a two cup 16 ounce teapot requires two teaspoons of tea leaves tea a four cup teapot requires four teaspoons when you finish preparing the tea make sure the tea tin lid is tightly closed tea leaves teas are stored in custom airtight opaque food safe tins to protect the precious leaves inside store teas and herbal infusions in a cool dark dry low humidity place never store your teas on top of a hot surface such as an espresso machine or a coffee maker awaken ideally you should always rinse the tea leaves by pouring a little hot water over them swirl and discard this wash this removes any small pieces dust and coaxes the leaves to unfurl readying for steeping the remove little bits of tea and herbs have been overly exposed to oxygen anticipate for the appropriate temperature hot water over the tea leaves and steep for the specific instructions for each varietal please refer to your steeping charts now or tea luscom for tea specific instructions although these are our general steeping times each individual blend has specific instructions listed on their web page tea bag or on the bottom of the tin this is the most important technique the difference between a perfect cup of tea and a bad cup of tea is often only a few seconds please carefully follow the infusion time that is listed on our instructions steeping times are the difference between a proper balance of flavors as our blenders intend and incorrect emphasis on certain flavor profiles of different ingredients though we want some tannins to taste the structure of a tea if you steep tea leaves for too long you damage the leaves as it releases too many tannic acids into your cup creating a bitter palate when people taste bitterness in their tea the natural reaction is to either dilute the tea with hot water or worse add a sweetener such as sugar or honey this dilutes the intended palate entirely instead follow these strategic guidelines to make the perfect cup of tea leaves tea white tea with low caffeine and high antioxidants is famous among connoisseurs for its delicate yet complex flavor it is an expensive and luxury tea whites have the Feres liqueur staying within pastel greens off whites and fair goals green tea is known for its mild subtle taste it is fragrant and refreshing and often known as a superfood for its high antioxidant levels and vegetal palate this is the tea that is most frequently made incorrectly from steeping too long green tea no cures are a range of greens from pale green to bright emerald boolong teas are recognized for their orchid like aroma layers of complexity and benefits to the digestive system with medium caffeine and fermentation boulogne surprised by aficionados who Long's results in a warm brown liquor black teas are high in caffeine fully fermented with a brisk full-bodied flavor black teas have a rich bronze The Cure as with wine at ease character is determined greatly by subtle differences in soil climate and elevation cool nights dry weather and bright sunny days combined provide the optimal conditions for growing tea this type of climate forces the tea Bush to expend all of its energy in the growth of new shoots the finest teas come from gardens of high elevation or cooler temperatures slowly grow 'the producing leaves with a more concentrated flavor and aroma finally turning to herbals because herbals are not from the tea plant but a compilation of herbs spices fruits and flowers they do not have any tannic acids as such you can steep herbals for as long as you would like as they've principally do not become bitter we recommend steeping herbals for at least 5 minutes as the longer you steep them the more powerful the infusion becomes when you steep herbals for a long time they release more of the health properties into your tea cup herbal liquors resulted a variety of colors ranging from fuchsia to deep purples and golds so what did we learn varied steeping times depend on the tea leaves rate of infusion oxidation levels and recommended liqueur blacks and alongs present a bolder flavor with extensive steeping while greens and white teas require a shorter steeping time to retain a mild balanced flavor perfecting your steeping time perfects the flavor of the delicate teas and prevents bitterness or bland flavor let's talk about using different types of teapots to control infusion time different cultures use a wide array of tea ware though some are more traditional than others depending on the varietal of tea and the ceremony each teapot can be used universally and interchangeably today we will be using five different teapots but again these can be used with any of the five varieties of tea if you are using a teapot with a built-in infuser simply remove the basket of tea leaves before serving if you are using a teapot with an exterior strainer you have a few choices choice number one in some hotels the traditional English tea service calls for a teapot filled with tea leaves there is a second teapot that is filled only with hot water you pour half a cup of tea into your teacup and then depending on the desired strength of the tea dilute with hot water from the second teapot this is not a great system and although it does have much historical significance we do not recommend it choice number two if you are using a teapot with an exterior strainer you may use the exterior strainer to strain off the loose tea leaves by pouring the tea into a second teapot we call this the Tootsie Pop method this is the absolute best way in order to make your loose tea the tea ends second teapot has been perfectly made if you are using a French press or tea leaves tea press your tea and herbals will continue to steep until you gently press the plunger down to the bottom once the plunger is at the bottom you will notice the tea will stop infusing the tea or herbals are pushed all the way to the base where the water cannot easily pass through the leaves to produce more flavor if you press down on the plunger and then decide your tea or herbals are not strong enough simply pull the plunger back up the great thing about a French press is that you can easily control how long you want your tea to infuse and if you change your mind you can simply restart the infusion by pulling the plunger back up present to the guests differing varietals of tea may be served plain or with various condiments including sugar honey milk or lemon when you are choosing health consider which condiments you might use with your tea or herbals we suggest using honey instead of sugar lemons are also a healthy choice because they are rich in vitamins if you like milk try using soy or rice milk we recommend whites greens and alongs to be served plain blacks and herbals may be served with a variety of condiments serve the tea with pride confident that your guests will be enjoying the finest tea leaves bespoke blended for their discerning palate you", "1BSwUyJwvKw": "in this video I'm going to show you how I achieved these two looks by just using bleach let's start with the t-shirt this is an old t-shirt from a husband that I decided I would spice up a little bit what you'll need is a pair of rubber gloves some rubber bands scissors a squirt bottle and bleach you can choose your favorite way to tie-dye your shirt you can accordion it you can twist it and gather it like the traditional tie-dye look I'm going to go with a scrunch method what I'm doing is scrunching gathering and then holding the t-shirt in place then to secure it I will take my elastic bends wrap them around the shirt and just continue to do that so that if the t-shirt is nice and tight [Music] I transfer the bleach into this old sriracha bottle to use as a squirt bottle and I'm going to use this tray to store the shirt in while I bleach I'm gonna put on my gloves and then just begin to start squirting the bleach all over the shirt front and back you want to make sure that you cover the entire shirt and that it's really soaked in once you're finished set it aside and let the bleach do its magic for at least two to five hours once you have the color that you like take off the elastic bends and rinse out any of the excess color and all the bleach before it you put it through a full washing cycle and dry it to get the length that you want for your crop top just throw the shirt on and tuck in the bottom until you have the length that you like then take a clip or a bobby pin and just pin it on there so that you know where you can mark it in order to cut now all that's left is just to flatten out the t-shirt grab your scissors and start cutting this step is optional but I like the look of rolled-up sleeves so I'm just going to do that really quickly and tack it down with some thread so here is the final look I love the length and the color came out so cool now let me show you how I got this look with this cropped hoodie would you have guessed that it started off blue I was so impressed with the color so let's start with the same method with scrunching and I'm going to gather it and instead of putting it all together I'm going to leave the sleeves and the hood out and do those separately I found that folding at the sleeve in half and then bunching it together in one bundle actually worked the best for the sleeves now it's back to the squirt bottle in gloves making sure that you cover all areas of the shirt coated with the bleach you can already see the pink showing through once I was done I let this one sit for at least four to five hours I put it back in the sink and then rinsed off all of the bleach and any excess color until the water ran clear then threw it in the washing machine and hung it to dry with a hoodie you can use the edge of the pocket on there as a guiding line but I actually wanted it to be a little bit longer so I decided to take off the pouch before I cut it so that I could give it a little bit more length just making sure that the sweater is laying completely flat before I start cutting [Music] here's the final look I love the color this one turned out so nice you never know what you're gonna get so I hope you have fun doing your own", "jSenv0XtImA": "now let's see if we can't figure out who you are my little friend where you come from I found part of the recording as I seemed to have found it general lick with your face years ago you served my father during the cola wars now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the misconception about the difference between iced tea and sweet tea this is our most desperate hour help me review immigrant in your face [Music] you must learn the ways of the tea [Music] you hey folks review emic review phase coming back at you thanks for tuning in just wanted to do yeah with the new Star Wars trailer coming out I thought I cannot have a little fun with my intro and you know this week I wanted to talk about something near and dear in my heart and that was I was down in the United States from America recently and one of the things I love although going to the US is sweet tea now whenever I go I find the nearest Trader Joe's and I get the largest jug of sweet tea that I can find and I don't get a glass I chucked that baby I get that like biggest thing I could find and I just chug it as fast as I can I love sweet tea but when I come back to Canada we don't have sweet tea like that we don't have good american-style sweet tea and I had someone asked me recently they said review e you always go on and on about how great sweet tea is but really what's the difference sweet tea iced tea it's all the same right no no no it is not the same and how dare you how dare you say it's the same so this week on review emic review face i'm going to review sweet tea versus iced tea the tea wars and we're gonna talk about the differences between the two now first off let's meet the Canadian challenger iced tea iced teas in the half [Music] now this is your typical Canadian when you ask for an Icee this is what you're gonna get you're gonna get your nestea your lemon flavored sweetened cold black tea beverage right this is for all you Canucks this is a familiar sight you know what we're talking about right here and the champion this is our American counterpart boom Trader Joe's sweet teeth and I've had people say all right so what exactly is the difference between the two really simply this sounds obvious but you know it's like one of those things and what rates krispies made from the difference between sweet tea and iced tea is that sweet tea is sweet and iced tea is iced in the most technical sense now you can have sweet tea that's not iced you're good vice tea that's not sweet it's basically the difference now in this format this is an iced sweet tea you know serve cold and this is a sweet iced tea served sweet the biggest difference I have found of course in more you know practical terms is that when you get an iced tea here in Canada you tend to get it flavored with lemon let's take a taste test shall we so we're gonna crack open the Nestea iced tea first well you know just just to compare the information here per 355 milliliters so a slightly larger serving size than is recommended of the sweet tea looking at 110 calories on the sweet tea for a 8 fluid ounce or 240 milliliters serving I don't know why sweet teas supposed to be served in a smaller serving that doesn't make any sense to me you are looking at 60 calories so let's let's pour our take glaze or our nest tea natural lemon flavored iced tea now again ideally these are served iced with ice in the glass but we're going we don't want to dilute the flavor so we're just going to pour them as is in our fun light up glass you know if you look at the coloring here it's it's pretty clear light brown color now kind of caramely smell wise the first thing you sell is that lemon that's the overpowering scent on iced tea is that lemon and then you get that little bit of black tea behind it and now crack open the sweet tea now now that this jug is open it will be gone in this household probably within three days I can't stop drinking this stuff it's amazing alright so pour out our sweet tea alright so placing them side by each here you can see the sweet tea is a little cloudier a little murkier looking then the iced tea the iced tea is nice and clear now there you don't get a strong of a scent off of the sweet tea and get that a little bit of a black tea smell but it's a very subtle smell and now taste tests so Canadian ice tea Cheers a there is sweetness there but it's the lemon again the length the sourness of the lemon overpowers pretty much everything and that's the predominant Canadian iced tea flavor is that sweetened lemon iced black tea flavor and it the citrus of the lemon kind of sits on the roof of your mouth kind of slides down the back of your tongue and it does make it a less pleasant experience for me I'm not a huge citrus and tea person so that to me it's nostalgic but it's not my favorite and then we got these sweet teas so again we're gonna take a nice healthy swig of that oh and that that's more to me if you were gonna make iced tea at home you're gonna take black tea you're gonna let it sit in the Sun and then you're gonna dump in a ton of sugar and that's what you're gonna get the flavor is there and then it's gone it doesn't linger like the lemon it's it's sweet and brown and pleasant but then it's gone in a flash which I think makes it much more huggable because he could take a sip and then five seconds later you it's not on the pallet anymore now if you're mixing say fine bourbon putting it with the Nestea you're gonna get that sour lemon overpowering the Bourbon and competing with the caramel tones caramel and lemon is not a good combination in my opinion whereas the sweet tea is just tea and sweet and then bourbon and it's brown and brown and it just melds together in a way that's just delightful again my personal opinion so when it comes down to the tea wars the simplest way to look at it is sweet tea is sweet iced tea is iced but that's the textbook definition in reality it's Canada versus the US but that's proud Canadian you and I have to admit America knows how to have a cup of cool tea but hey love to know in the comments down below have you tried both of these have you tried sweet tea have you tried iced tea what's your favorite what's your opinion on this drop a comment down below would love to hear from from folks from US and Canada what's your favorite type of sweetened cold tea beverage thanks very much for watching and as always I'm not trying to sell you anything I'm just telling you my review I am reviewing it review face I'll see you next review [Music] oh yeah", "7-yMYQUBfQQ": "it's the freaking weekend video i'm up there having some fun sipping on them white clothes oh you know there ain't no laws i shouldn't take up singing oh hey folks didn't see you there anyway so today that didn't give it away we got white claw tees oh my camera so far away this heavy so at the white claw and 100 calories one gram of

seltzers how the salsa is their tea because shelters is water anyway so we guess we're going to start this out with raspberry um i recall the one or two other flavors that were raspberry was not a fan it's actually pretty pretty good i don't think the tabs gold gold is for the mark of excellence so i wouldn't say this is excellent raspberry is definitely drinkable all right peach let's see how we got peach here oh very peachy it's not quite like you're eating a peach but it's definitely is full on peach it's not the watered-down flavored peach all right definitely uh dabble with these [Applause] all right right there i got it actually yeah that one i didn't get any tea just tastes like raspberry that one had a little bit of uh tea flavor all right well we know that one is going to be probably my favorite so let's grab the lamone lemon i think yep lemon lemon lemon lemon i mean so far we got the single we got the double we just hit a triple or they just hit a triple they might hit for the cycle and go four for four for a home run i mean not four well still be four for four but oh yeah that one's really this one actually yeah for like how i guess most people drink regular tea i'm a sweet tea person if i'm going to drink tea but lemon tea that is actually like spot on yeah all right now last but not least we got the mango which i think from last video made it pretty evident i'm a fan of mango or two videos yeah either way but you want to correct me go back and watch them all let me know oh yeah now this this is like eating a mango they sell this in a 12 pack this will be my summer drink oh yeah delicious so oh i mean obviously mango is my favorite um probably just switch the peach the lemon i don't know how this goes for you guys this will be your right to left i think for your left to right either way angle peach lemon raspberry not that raspberry is terrible but someone's got to be last so it's raspberry oh and we got to see how it uh how they fit to the bs virginia slim koozies oh yeah look at that like a glove my hand is already so much warmer because i waited so late to get out here now it's like 40 degrees but oh excuse me a little exhaust coming out there but i gotta say white claw did a really good job and if you're a guy and you like tees drink some white claw teeth no one's going to shame you for it stop man shaming people for drinking white claws anyway that is my two cents on the new ice teas by white claw so as usual take care and drink responsibly nailed it", "sZGT2FkN_gM": "it was handing baby today I'm about to show y'all how to make a fantastic Meyer lemon sweet tea it is very easy to make it's my your lemon season and even if you can't find you some Meyer lemons but you can find you some fire regular lemons use regular limits the thing that makes Meyer lemons so special it's almost like orange and lemons may love and had a little baby all right so this is so simple all we're gonna do is we're gonna take some sugar and some water equal parts and we're gonna go ahead on and bring that up to a slight simmer to make our own simple syrup we just want this sugar to melt then we're gonna go ahead throw in our sweet tea packets this is just enough to make a half a gallon now while let's doing this thing I'm gonna take some ice and some water and put it into my pitcher and fill it all the way up well not all the way to the top cause we got the rest of the go over there and then we're gonna go ahead on and cut our lemons in half and then I'm gonna go ahead onto proceed to use the device I've probably used twice because I'm old-school and I just squeeze the lemons now looking at this and the way this machine is designed I figured that this is the right way to do it but clearly the juice is not flowing so I'm definitely doing something wrong hold on take two take two it all right put the lemon down flesh side down then squeeze look at how that flows so I'm gonna go ahead on squeeze all of my lemons into my water and make this lemon water alright and after all of my sugar has melted and I got this beautiful sweet tea simple syrup mixture going over there I'm gonna go ahead on and take the teabags and I'm gonna place them into the pitcher I don't like to discard the teabags I actually like to let it continue to steep as long as I have that sweet tea or this Meyer lemon sweet tea rolling all right now of course it only lasts about a few hours because it's so good so you don't have to worry about leaving the teabags and overnight but if you do make this and you leave it overnight please take the teabags out and discard tomorrow now after you pour your sweet tea simple syrup mixture in and your lemon water go ahead on and give it a stir pull those tea bags out the way so they don't get caught up in you and your spoon as you give it a good stir alright and that's about it we are done let this just sit there while you go ahead on and glut and grab your glasses alright and also I just like to tie it around not a super nut but just something to hold it over so those tea bags don't start floating in it you know people get weird about things floating in a drink now what I did was I did a sugar rim and the way you do a sugar rim is you take a lemon slice and you rub it all the way around the rim of your glass and then you just roll the glass and your sugar and it makes this fantastic sugar room design alright so going on fill up your glass with some ice because this is the southern thing you want ice in your iced tea key word ice all right then you go ahead on to just Sapporo serve up some glass of this beautiful Meyer lemon sweet tea alright this is a very easy dish to make something great for the springtime something great for the summertime you can go ahead on and use this recipe all yea long all right then after that I just gonna go ahead on and garnish this up with some sprig of mint and one slice of ma Mya lemon if I could get the mint to stop falling okay look at it make it look sexy quick huh you didn't go ahead on it put a straw in there and then give it a good old taste to make sure it's great as you want to if you thought that was a lot of sugar in that reduce the sugar all right I'm I'm from the South I like my sweet tea sweet alright so hit the link down below for the recipe notify yourself for the next recipe video and go ahead on to subscribe to your boy channel and tell your mom and them about me I see you next time you", "uHE2ockdgfs": "hello friends welcome again to my channel it's been a long time I miss seeing you all and I am glad and excited to be back today we are going to talk about one of the most healthiest and safest herbal tea it's called the queen of the tea and it is called the black cumin seed tea you must have heard about the black cumin seed oil for inflammation or tragic pain it has so much of medicinal values that we are going to talk about today as well but let's get started alright for this day we need three ingredients and if you don't prefer these two ingredients you can definitely do just the black cumin safety but for this we are going to take equal amounts like one is two onions to one ratio over here this is the organic to black cumin seed that I got from the Indian stores but it is always available enhancer also I share that link as well over here is the phenol seeds and over here is the carom since these are just the three ingredients that we need to make this black community and every ingredient over here has its own medicinal values heavy nutritional benefits and we're going to talk about that also and don't forget to look at the inbox to get more information on these hurts let's get started you the next step is I have taken like a tablespoon of each like we said it's 1 is to 1 is to 1 ratio so 1 tablespoon of phenyl saves 1 tablespoon of black cumin seed and 1 table spoon of carom seeds over here and if you are going to go and store it like the powder you can always have like a one cup of fennel seeds 1 cup of carom seeds and another 1 cup of black beans see and you can grind them all and keep it store it for your future tea but today we are going to make it from scratch make it fresh so I am just going to go ahead and dry grind it you may use a coffee grinder or you can use any and a grinder just to grind it but it has to be dried right and all right we are back now everything is ready and I have powdered them you don't have to make it like a fine powder it's just like as much as it is crushed it's fine but if you want like a tea powder you can make it really fine so let's get started over here I have 250 ml of water and I have my saucepan I'm just going to call the water and boil the water to some extent it doesn't have to be super boiling or like a bubble boiling you just have to be hot and a little boiling here and I will be adding the powder but I am just going to add one teaspoon of that for two people if you're going to make it for two servings all right here is the website for the organic black cumin seed for you to buy it so over here this is from amazon.com and if you go over here this brand is called Kerala and this is organic Tara black cumin seed and this is 1595 and it is not that bad for 1 lb because this is such a great addition to your kitchen whether you are using it for spices or medicinal benefits so this is the one and I will also show you the black cumin seed oil that I have used for my inflammation as well over here again at the Amazon all I have to search is that immune seed oil and I buy from amazing herbs so as you can see they have many brands over here [Music] many brands and I'm going to go ahead and search for amazing harps so it's easy for you to find it and did they have a lot of organic stuff very trusted company yeah I finally found it this is the one amazing herbs and I can even show you the bottle that I have right here and it has a story behind it and I am glad to share that with all of you all right like I said this is so the amazing hundreds black seed oil that I am using and if you look at the ingredients over here it has the blackening said it also has the curcumin which is a byaku come in and it is great for inflammation as well so the best thing to do is do it in the comfort of your own home because it is all fresh and all from scratch so I believe in that but this if you have to do a supplement this is a great product to try it and I try it every day and a quick story about what happened in the past few weeks I had a rib injury which was an internal injury not a fracture but still it was really really hurting and I have taken a lot of heavy match the cording to the doctors that I didn't yield any results all I felt was like side effects and drowsy and irritable because of the after-effects of these meds but I just made a decision that you know what I am just going to try my own way and I started doing the black community that I am standing with you today and also the black cumin seed oil and believe me it was such a miracle in four days I was able to just be up in about any no pain and it has literally stopped and even if you have like a stone cell in your body like kidneys don't gassed or drinking lots of water and consuming abaya codomain and consuming black cumin seed oil or tea really really helps with the inflammation any type of infections that your body is fighting that you are not even aware of even in the beginning stage this does so many things in the salon third level we are also going to talk about phenol size and also cumin seeds & carom seeds but today we are not going to use cumin seeds in this recipe so we are going to leave that for later but definitely for funa seeds and carom seeds talk about female six I always store in a mason jar because if the glass is the best way to store your products for longevity and freshness for sure so we have talked about many benefits of Venus it's definitely look in the description box the most benefits that I constantly hear from my choir and from other people around this the reduced asthma symptoms and it also regulates blood pressure level so it is really huge because to regulate their blood pressure a lot of people have to take a lot of medicines and the medications can give you side effects but I am NOT saying that you should not take medication but I am saying along with that you can reduce to your medication and type of med free right ok let's talk about the carom seeds right now okay the carrot seeds has many benefits also growing up in India carom seeds everybody knows if we call the match rain and in my place we call them woman so the warmer water was very popular for in digestion it's any kind of infection coughs toothache so in many air places they use it traditionally every day in their life because of warmer water or as the acad\u00e9mie see it's a key he is very very important it cut aids in digestion and like I said you know even for to think we have used to power TV can you have used Oman water and even for babies we used to give them in a tea spoon so it is very popular back in India and that doesn't limit us not to have it here in the US or any other country that you are currently in so let's get started with all these PE and let's get a healthy life and that is what happened to our tea right here all right you can say that our tears are really bubbling right now it is like a rolling boil and bubbles over here and this is the time that we stop it's been 10 to 15 minutes and then we are going to take a strainer and strain the residue and then get our tea going okay I'm just training it if you don't want to do it a hot strain or you can always wait until it's warm and then strain it but it really doesn't matter as you can see it is really really thick and you can split it into two because we made like a concentrated recipe over here but if you don't want too much you offer this a taste and after taste you can always divide into half or you can just add like a 500 ml of water and see how well he can handle the flavor and the taste and this is it and you have to wait until it's warm you can see that it\u00eds really fuzzy here with the heat but definitely wait until it's warm and you can have it and here we go our Black team in CT is ready to serve it's not about how long we live it's how healthy we live for a long time right so I'm glad you're here with me today and I can't wait to show you more videos and if you haven't seen any of my videos yet definitely like share and subscribe to my

we get started on our ice cream if you're looking for more asian-inspired summer treats one of my hot Thai Kitchen fans posted a great video on mango and papaya shake on this channel the cook and share I'll put a link to it at the end so you guys can check it out so at decaf welcome to hot Thai Kitchen today we are making Thai iced tea ice cream and when I posted a picture of this as I was recipe testing on Instagram and Facebook people just went nuts for it they've been saying please please PLEASE a recipe for this and here it is a recipe for Thais tea ice cream now as a bonus this recipe also does not require an ice cream machine and when I posted my coconut ice cream last time a lot of you were asking I don't have an ice cream machine what can I do well you can make this recipe so if you've been sort of researching ice cream recipes without a machine you may have come across a technique that uses condensed milk and whipped cream and putting them together and freezing it and there you go ice cream and so that's the technique I'm going to use today and it's perfect because sweetened condensed milk is the major ingredient of Thai iced tea anyway so I mean there's no other flavor that's more perfect for this technique so we're going to get started so I've got here just a pot and I'm going to heat up one and a half cup of whipping cream so I'm just going to heat this up until it's hot and I'm going to make sure that as its heating I am storing and scraping the bottom every once in a while just so that I don't get that layer of scorched bottom now when it's hot once you start seeing steam coming up go ahead and add your tighty leaf now this is a quarter cup of Thai tea and you're going to just keep stirring until it comes to a boil now as you can see it's turning a nice orange color if yours does not turn orange I'm going to tell you what happens as I found out yesterday in a moment of panic I found out that recently oh by the way once it boils just stop just take it off heat don't boil cream unattended when it boils it will boil over so you know be there with it it doesn't take a long time and then you're just going to let this steep in the hot cream for five minutes okay going back to the orange tighty so as I found out yesterday I made a batch of this and the Thai tea didn't have this iconic orange color and I panicked I thought you know the world was coming to an end I had the same feeling when the show friends was over what happened was the the equivalent of the FDA in Thailand has started to ban the orange food coloring that's responsible for this orange color so that happens to you you know panic but you know know that it's it's not like it's gone bad or anything I don't know if it's permanent this might be the end of orange Thai tea as we know it start up a new era of Thai food history but it'll still I think taste the same if you want the color you can add food coloring to it so it's been five minutes and our teas been steeping now you may be tempted to let it go you know for an hour and let it cool down completely don't do that because as I found out if you let this cool down completely before you strain the cream will thicken and it would be very hard to strain and you'll lose a lot of liquid in the tea and if you get little tea dust that's okay you're not going to taste it it's not going to make a difference it actually gives it that spectra nila bean look so now that you've got this what you want to do is make sure that you've got a quarter wait a cup and a quarter of cream left and that's why I wanted to pour it into a measuring cup and I do and most of the time if you don't let the tea leave steep for longer than five minutes you should have somewhere on a cup and a quarter if not just add more if you have a little more than quarter of a cup it's not a big deal it's just as long as they're somewhere around that ballpark and then what I'm also going to do is add a little pinch of salt as you may remember from my Thai iced tea episode a little bit of salt help gives a sugar a little more personality so that's what we going to do give this a stir and then we're going to let it cool completely completely in the fridge now when I mean cool I mean cold cold cold don't just put in there for a couple of hours we're going to whip this like whipped cream and if you are familiar with the technique of whipping cream the cream needs to be very very cold I would men do this the day before so it's had a full night or you can put it in for four hours I would say push it to the back of the fridge so that's the coolest part and then we'll be right back so what I've got here is a stand mixer but you can also do this with a hand mixer so here's my cream my ice cream mix that I mixed in yesterday I made this yesterday so we're just going to whip this and if I had thought about this I would have put it in the container that's easier to scrape okay and now we're going to whip this until quote-unquote soft peaks for you pastry people you know what that means if you're not pastry people just follow along once the beaters start leaving a trail that doesn't just immediately disappear you're close to soft peak so you want to kind of check this is a very early soft peak stage it's a peak you know you can see a peak but it's not holding its stiffness so once you're at soft peak you're gonna add your next milk ooh I just love commencement by the way if you've never had condensed milk on buttered toast try it and now my super secret ingredient flip it up Bailey's so Irish Cream Liqueur I'm using this the whole point is put some alcohol in there and it will prevent the ice cream from freezing super super solid I like to use Bailey's because the flavor works really well you can try other kinds of liquor just as long as the flavor doesn't clash with the ice cream and you can also eat put Bailey's in your tie see or taste coffee just as a drink it's very good okay so I'm going to go in with the Bailey's and I'm going to whip this up to stiff peaks the way I like to test for stiff peaks is not actually with the peak I just like to run my finger through it like this and because then I get to taste it and then if your finger leaves a trail that stays there okay that doesn't move then you're pretty much there and if you want to do the peak thing you just look at it look at this peak see this peak see how it's stiff I can shake it shake it shake it and it's staying a peak so there you are there's your ice cream and my god it was so easy and it had like three or four ingredients I don't remember and it's tasting delicious even when it's not super super cold yet so just going to put this into our tray what I like to do is make little ice-cream sandwiches so see these these Oreos we're going to put the ice-cream base in here and just sort of let it freeze in there and this is the thing when you make ice cream sandwiches normally it'd have to take the ice cream out let it soften and come to you know so it's spreadable before you do this but this way you can do it right now and put it in the fridge and I took the the filling out because I thought it's a bit of an overkill but if you like the the filling you can leave it in here and add a little bit of the ice cream base in here and put it on top and I'm going to put that in the freezer and I'm also going to put my other ice cream in the freezer so while our ice cream is chilling as you know Thai iced tea is always always topped with a layer of evaporated milk on top and that sort of white on orange look is what's iconic and beautiful about it so we're going to mimic that by making a topping you could just do evaporated milk and drizzle it and it'll sort of solidify upon contact and become a thin glaze which is what a lot of ice cream vendors do in Thailand but I wanted a little bit to be a little bit thicker so I like to mix it with some sweetened SMIL just in equal parts this condensed milk on its own is a little bit too sweet the ice cream is already sweet and the condensed milk on its own yes just overkill so just thin it out a little bit with the evaporated milk and it looks thin right now but when you let this cool in the fridge it will be thick enough that it'll actually stay and look nice and be an added feature on your ice cream so now all we have to do is wait patiently for ice cream to be ready okay so it's been in the freezer for a little while and now it's the exciting part where we get to scoop and dish oh it's still oh it's perfectly it's just hard enough for me to scoop actually and I'm going to dish it into this nice martini glass here and I mentioned that I'm going to show you how I like to serve my tasty ice cream here's to never put two round things together by something by themselves always make a three and yeah this could use a little more time in the freezer but that's okay we're in a rush and here we go the way I like to do it is I like to put cubes of bread on it so this is fluffy kind of brioche type bread I got this from a Chinese Asian bakery which they often have it in bread Thai tea ice cream it's a very type thing to do to have bread and ice cream but I highly recommend it it's super delicious I should have put the bread down first is what I feel like there we go now we're talking yeah okay and then nothing that's enough and then remember our little sauce that we made oh yes whoo-hoo I'm getting goose bumps if you know what Milo is do a little Milo a sprinkle of Milo on top and you'll be happy okay I'm ready hmm ooh so creamy so smooth that Bailey's has kept it soft but the Bailey's actually added a little wink of I don't know you can taste it a little bit but not so much at Adam that it overpowers the tightiy mmm mmm so good yeah the Oreos there they are I look so good so I'm gonna have one look how cute I mean if you set these out at a party people are gonna go nuts over them hmm oh man you have to try this I hope you give this try because it's so delicious and so easy it was like so few ingredients once you've tried this let me know how it goes take a photo and send it to me on Facebook

name is Lauren and today I'm here discuss how to dye your hair with black tea in order to color your hair with black tea you're going to have to brew some tea you want to make sure that you brew it very strong if normally you do one tea bag per cup you're going to want to do tea bag two tea bags per cup of tea depending on the length of your hair depend depend on how much you actually brew for your tea you're going to want to go into your bathroom we know vertebra lean over a sink because what you're automatically going to do while the tea is still warm the warmth of the tea will actually help open up your cuticle and help that color seep in make sure the tea is not too hot you don't want to scold your scalp while you do this you're going to simply rinse your hair with the tea it's going to be very watery that's why I suggest going over a sink or going over something so that way it can drain right down you're going to want to rinse your hair about 10 to 15 times with the same tea that you've made I recommend making enough tea in the beginning in order to cover your hair and do the full process that way you neat don't need to stop in the middle in order to reapply after you rinse it for the 10th or 15th time depending on how dark you want your hair to be or how much pigment you want to put in it you're then going to leave your hair for about 15 to 20 minutes with the last one on after about 15 to 20 minutes you're then going to rinse it out shampoo is usual in condition very well now tea is not a permanent hair color you will have to redo reuse the tea concoction at least every week or every like a week and a half it will not stain your hair permanently it will only last for a brief amount of time however it is a very natural way to change your hair color even briefly if you wanted to and just add a little bit more depth and that is how to color your hair with black tea", "yrOpFJnzXDI": "hey guys! I am Nisa Homey and welcome back to my channel and today i am sharing a powerful natural remedy that will help you to lose up to 5 kgs in a month provided you eat healthy drink lots of water and avoid processed and junk food this 100% natural remedy will help you to burn fat faster and get rid of stubborn belly fat along with losing weight and also detoxify your body now first let me show you how to make this incredible fat burning drink and then I will share the benefits and answer some of the frequently asked questions so make sure you watch the video till the end now into a saucepan add in 1 cup or 200ml water and then added two cinnamon sticks I will explain about the type of cinnamon you should be using later in the video so make sure you watch the video till the very end. Now allow this to boil and once it starts to boil simmer the flame for 10 minutes and as it is simmering you can see that the color of the water is changing to a light amber color after 10 minutes switch off the flame and allow the water to cool down and once the cinnamon water is warm pour it into a cup or a glass and then add in 1 teaspoon honey and mix well you can remove the cinnamon sticks and my 100% natural and effective cinnamon tea with honey is ready to consume have this tea on empty stomach in the morning and for best results have another cup at bed-time now let me explain the type of cinnamon which you should be using in this tea so these are the two types of cinnamon which is commonly found this one is known as cinnamon quills, ie the bark is rolled into small quills and this is actually the second quality these quills are made from the third or fourth layer of the cinnamon tree bark and it has less oil content and hence the benefits also will be less but these are very pretty to look at and usually used in food photography. Since the layers are very thin they can be easily powdered very finely now the second type of cinnamon which is on the left side these are not very pretty to look at, but these cinnamon barks are the best quality they are actually the outer bark or the first or second layer of the cinnamon bark tree. This cinnamon has more oil content than the cinnamon quills on the right side plus they have more benefits and this is a cinnamon which I recommend for this tea and for all other remedies where i am using cinnamon sticks or powder. Cinnamon helps to boost metabolism and reduces bad cholesterol cinnamon helps in stabilising blood sugar levels stabilizing your blood sugar is very essential for weight loss if you are diabetic cinnamon can help in managing blood sugar spikes it has antibacterial properties and thus it helps to fight various infections in the body cinnamon is often recommended for stomach upsets as it can help clear harmful bacterias from the digestive system. Pure cinnamon is a natural remedy to fight yeast infections cinnamon is one of the most effective cancer fighting food mainly because it has high antioxidant content and also because of its antibacterial property. Pure cinnamon has the ability to lower cholesterol levels and improve blood circulation throughout the body and hence cinnamon can help prevent heart disease the anti-inflammatory properties of cinnamon helps to reduce arthritis pain and lessen inflammation of the body cinnamon helps to balance hormones. Cinnamon is an excellent natural remedy for hormonal imbalances in women especially for health issues like thyroid, PCOS and other hormonal issues. So to get all the benefits make sure you use the best quality cinnamon now let me show you the cinnamon powder from the first quality cinnamon on the left side since the bark is slightly thick it does not become a very fine powder when ground at home so this is how cinnamon powder made from the first quality of cinnamon that is the cinnamon on the left side would look like so I hope you got an idea about the type of cinnamon you should be using in this tea and also in all my other recipes and remedies where i am using cinnamon so do try this miracle cinnamon tea recipe and share your results with me.

iced teas today we're going to move into the world of coffee which is very exciting because I am a coffee drinker so today we're going to make something called cafe yen cafe means coffee and yen means iced so it's just iced coffee but when you say that in Thailand it'll come a certain way now there are actually lots of other ways you can have coffee in Thailand and we will explore those options in the next thirsty Edition so for now let's take a look at our cafe in so first let's take a look at our coffee now what is Thai coffee and if you're a coffee purist you might want to you know turn the other way and close your ears for a second Thai coffee really is in addition to coffee beans you also have corn and soya beans so it's really not pure coffee that's why it's got a different distinctive flavor the back comes like this I want to point out that when you're looking for Thai coffee it might say only young powder now all young is a type of Thai coffee which we will look at next episode but for now just know that it might say Thai coffee powder or it might say alien powder mix or whatever it happens to be so that's the word you want to look for so any brand will do I've never used a brand that's not good so we're going to start with three tablespoons of this and I'm going to make this one glass okay and this is quite dark this ratio I'm using so you can tone it up or down as you wish so three tablespoons I'm using a cloth filter here you can use whatever kind of coffee brewing device you want and then 3/4 a cup of hot water okay and then we're just going to let this steep for about three to five minutes now in Thailand you may notice that the old-school coffee carts what they'll do is rather than letting it steep they'll take this coffee and refill tur it back through four to six times and it's kind of like a cool show for the customers waiting for the coffee oh you know they're pouring it all over the place I'm not sure what it actually dusts the flavor of the coffee so I'm just gonna leave it sitting there three to five minutes and so meanwhile we are going to get our mixing station set up so there's our mixing glass add to this two tablespoons of condensed milk sweetened condensed milk a tip on condensed milk if you let it sit at room temperature it will be more liquid and less thick and easier to take out and all that in addition to that we've got some sugar I'm gonna add a couple of teaspoons and of course sweetness of coffee is something very very personal so up to you if you want to make it more sweet or less sweet and then a little pinch of salt now this is my trick as well as a lot of coffee vendors do it a little pinch of salt just really brightens up the sweetness of the coffee and it prevents the sugar from becoming too cloying and that's it that's our mixing glass okay we're gonna go in with our coffee stir it up and this is when it's nice to use a clear glass to mix this so you can see if you've gotten all the condensed milk mixed up or not okay and now we're going to taste it you want to taste it at this point because you want to add more sugar more salt whatever happens to be doing it post ice is going to be obviously harder to stir pattern harder to get it to dissolve and you want to taste it to be a little too dark a little too sweet at this point so that once it gets poured onto the ice it gets diluted it's going to be perfect okay let's get rice and now so what I'm going to do is I'm going to transfer it back into my jug here because it's easier to pour you want a full foot full of ice because this is warm so it's going to melt it quite a bit there you are and then not done this is the best part we're using evaporated milk and we're going to generously because I like this coffee creamy and milky pour it over making sure I don't spill and then it creates this nice beautiful waterfall gradient effect and you serve it to your guests just like that and there you are this is cafe yen or Thai iced coffee let's give it a taste you can say goodbye to that three o'clock crash because this it's deep it's dark it's chocolatey it's actually reminds me a lot of eating dark chocolate covered coffee beans you know one of those really really good all right that's it that's all for our cafe and today next episode we'll explore other ways you can order coffee in Thailand and how you can make it at home so I will see you next time for another drink", "j-MxI-ErRkY": "hey my love's so last year I shared a video of iced tea five delicious ways and you guys really seemed to enjoy it so I thought it was time to bring you a five brand new ways to get your iced tea on today's flavor combinations are really flavorful and more importantly really refreshing for hot summer days today we are going to kick things off with a yummy strawberry peppermint iced tea now I love this combination because of course that peppermint is so refreshing on a hot summer day and strawberries always make everything better to set myself up I have got a heat proof glass measuring cup like this any sort of heat proof glass will do it's really important of course that you use heat proof theory because we're going to be pouring boiling water in to this dish I'm also using a metal sieve like this this is an optional step but it really helps you it when it comes time to remove all of the things that you added to your water for my peppermint tea in this case I'm using some tea bags but of course if you of loose-leaf peppermint tea that is always better to amp up that peppermint flavor even more i'm also going to add some fresh mint leaves to this basically i'm just going to rip them up like so pop them right in there and then over goes or water once you've added your water you can just let this steep away for between three and five minutes until all of those lovely flavors have transferred and then you can simply remove the sieve from the top and set it aside now while that water is still hot we really want to dissolve our sweetener you have a ton of great options here you could use some white sugar you could use some honey but in this case I'm actually using some agave and then give it a good stir until it is completely dissolved now this is the part of the process when patience becomes a virtue you're going to have to let this sit for at least thirty minutes or until it's cooled completely and then we will finish it off by adding all of our beautiful strawberry flavor once my cheese chills completely I am going to add about two sliced strawberries the longer you let this all sit and infuse with that strawberry flavor the more delicious it become so go ahead pop the pitcher in the fridge and feel free to leave it in there overnight it's only going to get better now that my friends is refreshment for my next iced tea I'm actually using a really tasty white tea if you're not familiar with white tea it's a really delicious and packed with antioxidants so a great option if you've never tried it I'm going to get started by steeping my tea in some hot water now that my tea is steeped I am going to pop it to the side and in this case just to switch things up I'm going to be using some weight sugar but obviously totally your call agave would be beautiful here so it's plenty I'm going to allow that to cool completely and then it's time to add our nice tart cranberry flavors because I want to maintain that really pretty white tea color I'm actually using white cranberry juice in this you could definitely use traditional cranberry juice and what you'll end up with is a really pretty in pink drink I'm also going to add a few good handfuls of cranberries for a little more color and a little more tartness you're going to want to let this chill out for 30 minutes to an hour in the refrigerator to let all those flavors come together and there you have it sweet and sour summer sippin at its finest and next for something a little more sophisticated we are making a lavender Earl Grey iced tea now I have to tell you I can not even hear the words Earl Grey without thinking of captain picard from Star Trek but I digress we are starting with some steep Earl Grey teas I love Earl Grey tea it's got such a unique flavor and I think is really beautifully complemented with some lavender we should warn you a little lavender actually goes a long way so you don't want to overdo it a teaspoon or so is usually adequate with about eight cups of water we're going to let that steep for three to five minutes depending on how strong you like your tea and then we're just going to remove our teabags and our lavender and stir in our sweetener in this case I am using honey find black tea really needs the additional sweetness once your sweetener is completely dissolved in your tea you can set it aside and let it cool before pouring it over a beautiful glass vase and enjoying it next up we have a delicious peachy green tea of course this starts by brewing some green tea once our green tea is adequately steeped we are just going to set it aside of course and then we are going to add our sweetener now I love honey and green tea but this is definitely one of those recipes if you wanted to keep it unsweetened you actually could sometimes you don't over seep your green tea because that makes it bitter once your tea is sweetened you simply want to set it aside and let it cool before adding it to the rest of your ingredients of course for a peachy green tea we need to add some peaches of course some gorgeous fresh peaches that I just chopped up and I'm going to give this all a stir go ahead and let that sit for 30 minutes to an hour or overnight is ideal once that type some time to reach its maximum flavor potential you can simply pour it over ice and you are ready to refresh finally we're taking a really classic hot tea recipe and making it into an iced tea this is a lemon ginger iced tea so it's actually really good if you happen to fall ill with a summer cold for this recipe I'm actually using some herbal ginger tea but if you wanted to you could swap in some green tea that would work just as well I'm also going to be steeping that tea with some freshly chopped ginger as well as a few pieces of lemon zest we're going to let this steep away for between three and five minutes and then we're going to strain our water and stir in our honey once that cools completely you can stir in some fresh lemon slices and it is ready to be poured over ice for more awesome iced tea inspiration be sure to check out the links in the description box below keep in mind the recipes are there as well if you give any of these tasty ideas a try I really hope you will tweet me Instagram me or snapchat me a photo because of

To enjoy these benefits, you just need to\ndo one of these two options: Lemon tea\nAdd 2 cups of water in a pan and bring it to a boil. Once it boils, add a lemon cut into slices. Let it boil for more three minutes and turn\noff the heat. Strain and drink it hot. Do you want to \"up\" your organism? Try adding ginger to this recipe! Learn how to make lemon and ginger tea Heat 2 cups of water in a pan. Before it boils, add 1 teaspoon of chopped\nginger.

because we really need to do this let me give you a little bit of background information one of my best friends is getting married she asked me to be one of her bridesmaids and the color scheme is nude kind of going for more like a warm nude so less of like a cream like this more of a real true nude I ordered a dress and it came and it straight-up was like great you guys are gonna see it in a second I decided that I was going to put my DIY skills to the test and I want to show you guys how you can actually stain fabric using tea I have done this in the past I've actually stained paper to give it that kind of vintage you feel you can do this with any sort of fabric it doesn't have to be closed it could be you know bedspread anything like that so before we get started let me let me show you the dress you guys watched one of my last videos I was a day in the life with me would have seen the dress and in all its glory and as you can tell it is just quite a bit too light for being a bridesmaid we're trying to do nude so I want to bring some color back into it it has this like beautiful Bardot top which I love it's hard to see I'm holding the camera but there it is so let's see what we can do with this guy so we need to go get some Chi I want to show you guys the dress and I want to show you guys how I transformed it so let's hop right into it good morning y'all this is literally the windiest day out there like can you hear that so we need to go and get some tea to start staining this dress I feel like this is gonna be like a two-day process truely let's go get some tea so here we are in the tea section if you were to get something like this which is a green tea this is going to produce kind of like a pale yellow pale green kind of look whereas if you were to get say something like this which is like fruity has hibiscus in it this would give you more like a pale pink even like lavender kind of hue and if you were to get something like this which is basically just a black tea you would get like that cream sort of tan Brown kind of hue I also saw some images of a girl using like the Tetley to you which tends to go more of that like reddish color so if you wanted something that was really warm orangie kind of red hue then you'd get something like an orange pekoe tea here we have 50 teabags this is a hundred percent pure black tea so I think we're gonna try this I think I might actually get two boxes because I'm not even sure like how many it's gonna take I'm gonna have to do some testing okay so the first thing I'm gonna do is I want to just test to see what color this actually is just because I don't want to go through this whole process and then be like wow this is a really strange black tea color so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna get a clear glass so that we'll be able to see if you don't have something clear just grab a mason jar do you like normal teacup size I'd say right there and this obviously isn't going to give us the perfect color yet I'm gonna let this sit for a while then I'm gonna come back and show you guys the color and we can kind of decide if if it's right I mean it's looking nice it's looking like a golden tea brownies okay guys so here's the color and I'm gonna be honest with you it's looking a little bit red like this is the color I'd assumed Orange Pekoe would kind of go so I think we should do a test on another piece of fabric so to test the tea I have this sweater this is a hundred percent acrylic the dress is I believe it's like 70 percent acrylic see that is going on like much of a warmer color than I thought and I'm actually really happy with the way that's looking it doesn't look red at all it has that nice Brown warmth that I want in the dress this is about a 32 liter pot and inside I just have it filled a little over half basically what I've done is I've just cut off the top of the tea bag which had paper in it I'm gonna scoop these all out after [Music] okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start to take out the teabags [Music] [Music] you don't want your dress to go in completely dry because you don't want it to attach to more parts than the other you want it to go in damp so I'm just gonna so cloak the dress in some water okay so we're all good to put it in its damp let's let's do it you guys and she's and the most nerve-wracking thing I've ever done maybe let's leave this guy for half hour we'll come back when it's one time's up okay so it has officially been half an hour so let's pull out some of this and see what she's looking I oh she's looking good I think I'm gonna rinse a small section of it just to see the real colour so you can see the color it was before verse the color when you're in stood out so that is way way way way too light still so I'm gonna say it needs to lis soak for another half hour we'll check it again then the next step would be to rinse it with cold water I'm gonna let this guy dry overnight and I'm gonna check it out in the morning I just I don't really want to put it in the wash I don't want to risk it not holding some of this color because this color is perfect yeah I will check in with you guys tomorrow we have done it finally new dress need a little Spanx action but it's fine very happy with this so I ended up putting my dress in the tea for three hours I kept checking it at every 30-minute interval and it just wasn't enough so I honestly thought that maybe I could even dye it again I wasn't really sure I didn't really know what I wanted to do but you could definitely die it again if it came out and it wasn't as dark as you wanted it to be if it were to light at an almost immediate wash into the washing machine will help get some of that color out as well so it really just depends what color you're going for what fabric you're using as to how dark it will go or how light it will go so I even suggest if you just want a little bit of a tint and you're using something that's gonna soak it up like cotton a couple of minutes probably max is all you would need so after you are done dyeing it you can go ahead and wash it I didn't want to watch my dress because I didn't want to lose any of the color that was in it you can also set your color using a vinegar salt water mixture again I didn't want to do that because the dress smells like tea I'm okay smelling like tea for the wedding but if I risk it and do sort of a vinegar wash I risk smelling like vinegar again because I'm not going to wash it after the wedding I definitely think I will do that for sure I've put all the information that you might need in the downbar below so make sure to check that out and good luck with your dying I hope that it turns out amazing thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you in my next video bye [Music] you", "CYvVO_L6AeA": "[Music] hey munchies welcome to the channel if you're new for a lot of us summer is mirror and it's warming up by the day so it's about time that I had to Starbucks craving cold drinks instead of hot today I'm gonna share some low carb options that you can get at Starbucks that are cold drinks we won't focus on hot today but let me know if you want that video mate these all have less than 10 grams of carbs and/or sugar per drink and I've got a free PDF that you can download in the description that shares the drinks and what to ask for so you don't need to take notes while watching let's keep in mind this 10 grams number is arbitrary there aren't really rules for low carb or keto because everyone's tolerance is going to be different but I had to choose a number to make the video so I picked 10 you should choose what suits your needs I talk more about low carb lifestyles and curve tolerances in my Kido 101 video and I do some crazy sugar comparisons in this video because 10 grams of sugar might be more or less than you really think so check them out using the links in the description if you'd like first let's talk about Starbucks iced coffee now many don't realize that by default the iced coffee at Starbucks includes the classic syrup so a venti or 20 ounce of black iced coffee contains six pumps of that syrup which is the 30 grams of sugar so if you asked for a black iced coffee that's what you get if you don't want the sugar you must request that it is unsweetened ask for no sweetener or syrup if you want it to not contain sugar or carbs the Starbucks cold brew is not sweetened so if you get an iced black cold brew it won't cost you any sugar or carbs unless you add milk same goes for the iced cafe americano as is it's just espresso ice and water so you're safe on carbs and sugar regardless of the size the iced tea is also sweetened a venti Teavana shake and iced black tea contains 16 grams of sugar now you'd need to specifically request unsweetened to avoid sugar for the iced teas more on those in a minute what if you like iced coffee or tea with milk let's spend a second talking about our options at Starbucks coconut milk is a common low carb favorite but the one at Starbucks does have added sugar actually every non-dairy milk has added sugar at least in the u.s. some locations can carry and milk without sugar but not all the coconut milk is 80 calories 5 grams of fat and 8 grams of sugar and 1 cup so if you're adding a splash it could just be a few grams of sugar like when you get a venti iced coffee unsweetened or an iced cold brew with coconut milk but if you're getting something milk based like a venti iced latte with coconut milk it's gonna be 11 grams of sugar if you get it as a grande however it goes down to 8 grams of sugar to keep sugar and carbs down though the better option at Starbucks is the almond milk it's 60 calories per cup with 4 grams of fat 5 grams of carbs 3 of which are sugar and 2 grams of protein that means you can get a venti iced cafe latte with almond milk for a hundred calories and 5 grams of sugar or a grande for three grams other iced coffee drinks at work an iced flat light a grande with coconut milk is 7 grams of sugar and 9 grams of carbs and with almond milk it's only 3 grams of sugar for a grande or 5 grams of sugar with 9 grams of carbs for the venti many people familiar with a low carb lifestyle know that black iced coffee unsweetened with heavy cream is a great drink oh man it is so tasty but it's good to know that they add a lot of that heavy whipping cream if you watch them make it you'll see that they don't measure and it ends up being about a third to a half a cup of heavy whipping cream and a venti iced coffee so back up one cup of heavy whipping cream is over 800 calories and almost 90 grams of fat so a venti black iced coffee with heavy whipping cream can rack up over 400 calories in almost 50 grams of fat now yes it's key on a low-carb diet to eat more fat but do I want 50 grams of my fat telly to go to that drink well you might but I don't and either way it's good to at least have the information if I get it I add heavy whipping cream myself and you can do this at Starbucks they will let you physically put it into the drink and I just add a splash just know that even 2 ounces or 1/4 cup is over 200 calories again I'm not demonizing fat or calories but just bringing awareness to the fact that heavy whipping cream really rocks it up another tasty summertime drink that is manageable for low carbs or anyone looking for less sugar is a passion Tango iced tea unsweetened of course make sure that you're not getting the lemonade version and I like to add a splash of coconut or almond milk if you get it unsweetened your only macros would be from the milk since tea does not contain calories or carbs and I'm not able to calculate the nutrition of this tea with milk on the website but I did the calculation on my own to show you with coconut milk accounting for two ounces or a quarter cup of the bilk and you can always use less of course the drink will only cost you two grams of sugar add a splash of heavy whipping cream to that passion tango iced tea instead and you end up with the low carb res version of the pink drink option to add a sugar-free syrup to any of these of course but I prefer to avoid the artificial sweetener and get unsweetened instead I personally go for the heavy whipping cream over the sweetener if you are a tea fan it's also worth noting that you can combine the different types of teas and infusions without sweetener in any ways like you just have to ask so they have a shaken of black green and white tea they paired each with an infusion peach with the white tea pineapple with the black tea and strawberry with the green tea they default come with sweetener pumps from the syrup but you can get them all unsweetened you can also mix and match so I often like to get the peach infusion with the green tea for instance and there are other infusions on their own do not contain calories or carbs so as long as you ask for the drink unsweetened you have a lot of combinations that you can try with those iced teas and infusions remember I am NOT talking about the lemonade which does have more sugar just the tea infusions on their own okay next I know a lot of people in the health and/or low-carb community try to not do dairy and coffee but if you're not opposed which I assume you're not if you're having heavy whipping cream and are solely looking to lower carb intake you have a few more options for cold drinks at Starbucks one is the iced cappuccino with cold foam now they need to use dairy milk to make the phone so you can't swap it out but if you get a grande it's got eight grams of sugar and nine grams of carbs the other dairy option is the vanilla sweet cream cold brew now if you are a sweet iced coffee man this is a very good drink but the sweet cream is premade with sugar and dairy and you can't swap it out if you get at all so the compromise is it's much smaller but still a tall size will cost 90 calories and 9 grams of sugar and carbs if you want the cold brew flavor with a natural sweetness without any milk or dairy consider the nitro cold brew the only ingredient is coffee but the slow steeping process makes it smooth and the nitrogen infusion leaves a naturally sweet flavor with and I quote a cascading velvety crema perfection is served is it perfect nitro cold brew is not my thing but it might be yours as I mentioned earlier if you want to add more than just the coffee in the milk you could add syrup they have sugar-free vanilla and cinnamon Dolce flavours they are sucralose based so if you prefer monk fruit erythritol etc you won't be able to hit the mark with the sugar free options at Starbucks you could also add light toppings the whipped cream and caramel drizzle will each add on about 3 grams of carbs the chocolate drizzle will add one gram of carbs and then you can always add the toppers like cocoa powder nutmeg cinnamon and vanilla powder which would each add less than one gram of carbohydrates so there are some drink options to give you ideas on what to get at Starbucks this summer for lower sugar and lower carb options and you can download the PDF that you can keep on your phone or print it out as reference for help determining which drink might be right for you with all of this information if you want me to do something similar later in the year for warm drinks that are low carb at Starbucks let me know in the comments below also remember especially if you're doing keto and need to be extra mindful of the carb intake no food or drink is necessarily keto friendly or banned it's all about your own tolerance and I discussed that in my keto 101 video check out my crazy sugar comparisons video if you want your mind blown on just how much sugar is in some of the regular stuff we eat healthy or not thanks so much for being here I'll see you next week and remember it's all a matter of mind over munch", "0KqlTyblcYE": "[Music] [Applause] I'm feeling better so

drinks what you end up with is a video about my five favorite iced coffee hats we're gonna get started today with the best way to add milk and sugar to an iced coffee it's actually sweetened condensed milk it's and gooey and rich and what it does is add a ton of sweetness and creaminess to your coffee without a whole lot of effort I like to just pour it into my coffee over ice and give it all a good shake until it's completely combined voila iced coffee is served and trust me it is worth a try you can also do this with hot coffee as well another great tip if you're looking to add sweetness without any additional milk or cream is to make something called simple syrup to make simple syrup it's really a simple I'm going to say simple about 700 more times here so everyone bear with me to make your simple syrup you were simply going to combine one part sugar and one part water on the stove I'm going to heat that mixture up whisking it constantly until all of the sugar has dissolved to make your simple syrup even more delicious you can add all sorts of flavors I like infusing it with some cinnamon or some vanilla or even some coconut then all you have to do is strain out the solid what you end up with is a beautifully flavored simple syrup that can sweeten pretty much any kind of drink but I think of course is best with iced coffee for my next hack I'm going to show you what I call an inside-out iced coffee in this case instead of using traditional ice cubes we're actually going to make ice cubes out of coffee and a little bit of chocolate sauce we're going to whisk these two together pour them into an ice tray and then into the freezer they go until they're totally solid when it's time for coffee you simply transfer your cubes to a glass and top them with the milk in this case what you end up with is an iced mocha latte that is totally delicious and super simple to make if you didn't want to use chocolate in this recipe you could also do this with some caramel sauce that would be amazing if you're looking for an iced coffee that's a little more on the decadent side go ahead and try my vanilla iced coffee which basically is a combination of a whole lot of vanilla ice cream and some hot coffee poured over it oh yeah yeah I know you want one right for my final trick today I'm going to show you how to sneak your coffee into your breakfast smoothie and that is a good way to start the day in my blender I'm combining some ice some coffee a banana some yogurt and some chocolate protein powder I'm going to blend this all up and basically what you end up with is a breakfast of champions with a little Java kick I really hope you guys will give some of these iced coffee ideas a try and of course if you do you must tweet me Instagram me or snapchat me

method that I use soaking large seed like bean seed or large quantities of seed is easily done in kitchen dishes but what about the small seed or small quantities of seed what's the best way to handle those I'll show you how I handle them in this video the first method uses small Ziploc bags you can get these at dollar stores or hobby stores simply add your seeds some water and zip up the bags and you're done let them sit for 24 hours the bags make it easy to drain the seeds oops one snuck out no problem just pick it up and put it back in the back if they need repeated washing or longer soaking add more water and continue I suggest rinsing every 24 hours the second method uses caps from liquor bottles some of the rum caps are nice and tall and make really good containers for soaking seed remove the inner liner before you use them you when you are ready to drain the seeds just use your finger to hold the seeds back inside the cap when you're finished with the cap rinse it with water and you can use it over and over again if you are doing several different kinds of seeds at the same time remember to label them I just set the cap on top of the seed envelope so I know which is which

antibiotics I'm going to teach you how to treat a sore throat at home It's a chilly one today so sore throats are very common and\nthey're usually nothing to worry about they normally get better by themselves\nwithin a week but 1.2 million people still visit their GP every year in the\nUK for a sore throat 1.2 million people and sore throats are the largest contributor of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in England and it amounts to nearly 23% normally I don't like to be the healthcare professional who's all doom and gloom but the reality is this inappropriate antibiotic prescribing is contributing to a rapid increase in antibiotic resistance which is a massive global threat for everyone so I really do hope my tips help you today but if you need further expert advice on\nyour sore throat then pharmacists should always be your first port of call now let's get to it for sore throats the first thing I advise nearly all my\npatients to do is to gargle warm salty water because it's actually really\neffective it's relatively inexpensive and almost everyone well most people can\ndo at home gargling warm salty water can help soothe the throat and reduce\ninflammation so to make your solution all you need is half a teaspoon of salt\na mug and then dissolve it in some boiled water once you've dissolved it let it cool and then gargle it make sure you don't\nswallow it and it's also not suitable for children tip 2 drink enough fluids\nto avoid dehydration I know it's tempting when you're not well and it's\npainful to swallow to maybe drink less water but when you're not feeling well\nand let's say you have a temperature you're at higher risk of dehydration\nbecoming dehydrated can make headaches and tiredness worse and can even\nlengthen recovery time so you need to aim for six to eight glasses a day and avoid hot drinks hot drinks can actually make sore throats worse tip 3 paracetamol\nand ibuprofen these painkillers are great at reducing sore throat pain and\nalso a fever now to keep sore throat symptoms to a minimum I'd advise you to  take a dose at regular intervals this is as directed by\na pharmacist or on the medication packaging tip 4 medicated lozenges\ncontaining local anaesthetics like benzocaine, hexylresorcinol or\nanti-inflammatories like flurbiprofen have shown some evidence to reduce sore\nthroat pain by a small amount these can also be taken alongside paracetamol and\nas always with all medication please always speak to your pharmacist and read\nthe information leaflet that comes with it to make sure that is suitable to take\nit there are also other tips that can help manage your sore throat symptoms so for instance eating cool or soft foods avoiding smoking and sucking on ice\nlollies ice cubes and boiled sweets I would avoid giving these to young\nchildren however due to risk of choking and last but not least if you can, rest and maybe watch Abraham the pharmacist videos too because they may make you feel better on a more serious note however that there are times that\nyou should see your doctor when you have a sore throat now I've left more\ninformation about this in the description

stick around here and subscribe to me if you want to see more DIY videos more lifestyle videos and I'm not gonna lie I have a lot of awesome DIYs planned to be uploaded and shared so make sure you stick around I promise you won't regret it or I hope you won't this is actually collab with my friend marina here on YouTube she is doing a DIY handles video so you guys should definitely go and check that out I will put a link to her channel down below go check her out she makes amazing DIY videos they're so unique and so different and so fun really kids know be quiet um there's like screaming kids outside my house it's so that further ado let's just jump right into the video starting off with the ingredients you're going to be needing some coffee as well as some tapioca pearls I got mine off of amazon.com you will also be needing some vanilla syrup but I'm going to show you guys how to make a DIY from it and then you're also going to need some caramel sauce or syrup as well as any milk of your choice and then ice and granulated sugar which I didn't show you guys then you're going to need a cup I'm just using this Starbucks cup because you know it's a Starbucks recipe and then any like jumbo straw that will allow the tapioca pearls to pass through so starting with the DIY vanilla syrup recipe you're going to need 1 cup of water and 1 cup of sugar and you just want to boil them on the stove once they reach that boiling um time you want to reduce the heat and let them simmer for about 2 minutes while stirring them and then remove it from the heat and then add in 1 tablespoon of the vanilla extract and then just mix everything together before adding it into a separate container or cup or whatever and once you have done this you want to let it cool for about a couple minutes before placing it into the refrigerator for about 20 minutes leave them in for a shorter or longer amount of time does it really matter so now on to the pearls you want to boil them in a pot of water and just add in however much you think you're going to need stir them until they reach the surface of the pot and then you just want to reduce the heat and add in a lid onto the top and let them cook through for about two to four minutes or until you see that they've like turned into these swollen balls uh-huh so then you want to remove the pearls from the pot and into a bowl of ice-cold water and this is just going to help them cool off so let them cool off for a couple minutes before once again removing them from that bowl into a separate drive hole your next step is going to be just sweet into tapioca pearls and you can use the vanilla strip that we just made to do that or you can use honey it's up to you I would recommend using the vanilla syrup or any type of sugar syrup the next step is to finally make your drink to the bottom you're going to add in some caramel sauce you can add in however much you want it's completely up to you I like a lot of caramel in my macchiato and then you're going to add in the vanilla syrup I'm about to add in like one tablespoon it's up to you more or less however much you want into it the next step is to add in the tapioca pearls into the bottom again it's up to you however much you would like in your drink next you want to add in ice but I forgot that step I would recommend doing it first but here you can see I'm adding in a cup of milk and then adding in the ice remember do the ice first before the milk and don't fill it all the way to the top the next step is to add in some coffee or expresso I added in a little bit more than that because I want it to be more like coffee tasting than milk tasting and then finally you are going to just drizzle some caramel sauce or syrup at the top which makes the completion of a caramel macchiato and today you are done with your Starbucks boba alright guys that was the video I hope you guys liked it please please please give this video a thumbs up if you did if you happen to recreate this then make sure to send me pictures on my Twitter and Instagram and also make sure to check out Karina's channel and yeah thank you guys so much for watching I love you

because it is such a brutally hot day out we are going to make lemonade and as they say when life gives you lemons make lemonade so that's exactly what we're going to do this is going to be an interesting lemonade recipe part of the reason why we wanted to do this is because the typically the lemonade that you will buy in grocery stores is really just loaded full of sugar and is not that good for you but the type of lemonade that we are going to make is going to be a very high antioxidant delicious refreshing nutritious lemonade so did I say nutritious twice I think I did we have organic lemons we have from Lena the tea lady some green roy boss team so as opposed to black tea you can do whatever type of tea you want for your lemonade we're gonna do Roy Boss and to give it some really interesting flavor but also some interesting nutritional value as well you can go basil or basil leaves if you want but we're going to go mint so I've got 6 really nice decent-sized mint leaves and with respect to a sweetener we've got our good ol organic Canadian maple syrup first things first I'm going to get 6 cups of water to a boil to steep all of our ingredients the water is almost boiling ooh I'm not going to get it let it get super hot and I'm just pouring this here into a nice big glass picture this is what I'm going to steep the tea in so that right there is just shy of about two liters and this recipe calls for one whole lemon if you want it to be a little bit more potent you can go with two or more if you prefer what I'm basically going to do is just cut this lemon which I have washed into lemon wedges or slices I do want to make sure that I am removing the seeds okay so all these nice little lemon wedges that I've just cut up are going to get steeped so in those go so with our lemon iced tea like I mentioned we are going to do some green Roy boss if you have tea bags obviously the easy thing to do is to toss the teabags right in we aren't using loose leaf tea so in this case I do have to use a tea ball so what I'm going to do is take a nice level teaspoon of the tea and the entire thing is going to go right in there I'm going to do the exact same thing a few more times okay time for the mint leaves and I am just going to sort of tear them up into smaller pieces as much or as little as you want these are six pretty decent-sized mint leaves from our herb garden Odone deck and then finally our sweetener I always guesstimate which I know drives people crazy that there is going to be at least a couple tablespoons if not more that right there is essentially it what I'm going to do now is let this steep and it is going to go in the fridge tonight and then we've got some nice refreshing lemon Roy Boss iced tea to have tomorrow so my feedback question for you is what is your favorite flavor of iced tea thank you for watching fit for two TV the Internet's only show dedicated to health", "3Fj289T6BVg": "hello I'm mr. tie-dye and today we're gonna mix some dye up I'm gonna show you a couple methods from mixing just a little bit of dye in one bottle to mixing a lot of dye so whatever your case may be you don't need a whole lot of things for mix and dye you're gonna need of course your dye you're gonna need a bottle another important thing as I said with my soda ash video is one of these dust masks and you want one that has these filters on here the little paper ones you put over your mouth they're not just not going to cut it so you want a good one for mix and dye and then I have my measuring spoon and then I have a chart of oh I mix my dye so most dice and let me zoom in on this most of the dyes that I mix for an 8 ounce bottle I'm going to use 2 teaspoons 16 ounce 4 teaspoons 32 ounce 8 so it just multiplies out as the bottles get bigger 4 black dies I use twice as much dye so since this here is a 16 ounce bottle I'm going to use 4 teaspoons to dye this there's my lemon yellow and for a tablespoon it holds three teaspoons of its level so I usually do a heaping tablespoon oh there we go heaping tablespoon and that gives me my 4 teaspoons it's just a quick easy measure here so we'll widen this back out again and I'm gonna put my mask on so that protects me from all the fine particles and then we'll put my dye in and then we're going to for the small bottle we're just gonna shake it so here we go you're not gonna hear me very well once I put this mask on okay so now that I have the dye in there then for mixing just a little bit you're just gonna shake that bottle and I'll hold it up to the light and see if I've got any any particles left in there that need to be broken up but this here is if you're mixing just a few colors and you don't have any fancy equipment I'm showing you you don't need it this is how I did it for several years is mixing them just in the 16-ounce bottles and shaking them once you get the the dye mixed all the way up you can't see anymore the particles floating in the bottom then you just fill this the rest of the way up with water and then you're good to start doing some tie-dyed mix up the rest of your colors and you're good to go so then another method I'm gonna show you let me get set up here and I'll be right back okay so for the second method of mixing dye up where you're going to mix a lot of dye or you're gonna do it easier mmm I have these hand mixers I have one for so - and one for dye you don't want to use the same one because you might cross contaminate and that would be bad so I have various bottles filled up with water what I'm gonna do is add dye to it since I'm going with the 32 ounce bottle I'm gonna use a teaspoons dye and since I'm using similar colors here I don't have to or I don't rinse my teeth my measuring spoon in between time just because there's not really that much contamination that's just me if you guys want to rinse it the only time I rinse is if I'm going from a different color like right now I have a little bit of yellow in it but since I'm going to be mixing some bright green I'm just going to leave that in there I'm to pour my yellow first I'll rinse my tablespoon and then I'm going to put dye in the rest and then I'm going to blend it I'm telling you all this ahead of time because then I put my mask on you can't hear me talk I am wearing one of these masks here so I'll just go ahead and start mixing and you guys can watch what I do here but like I say for the the dye since 32 I'm going with two heaping tablespoons into each one of these okay that's all my die put in now I'm gonna use the hand mixer and like I said it only takes about thirty seconds or so to finish the blending these dyes up so that's why I really like using these mixers that's back on [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay that's it for the blending and now I'm gonna pour and what I have here is the funnel I've got one funnel that I use for soda ash and I have one that I use for diet once again I don't mix them over and I also don't reuse these for any type of food product this here is strictly my die pouring funnel and the other funnel is strictly my soda ash funnel so that's an important thing to note there and then I have a little screened filter here and that just kind of cut just any of the chunks it might not have completely dissolved and I just go along and I fill all of these up and this just makes quick work of it if I can mix up five guys at one time then it's really time-saving activity especially with this blender and then once I get these all filled up I'll fill in the rest of the way with my water and we'll be good to go on tie-dye so like I say you can start out simple with just small bottles and shaking or you can step up and the hand mixers are about 30 bucks on Amazon and like I say they usually last me two or three years before I use another one or need to buy another one the other thing you want to do when you're using them or getting done using them and do a little bit of cleaning on them especially the soda ash one otherwise that'll make the blade bind up if you haven't washed it good so I always rinse my soda ash one by one even gets rinsed just because I'm then mixing dye I rinse it off so there is all of my die easy people thank you for watching please like and share my videos and subscribe to my channel I'll be back with more videos thank you", "l84wYP0rcNE": "welcome to blood tv today we explain the main types of tea where they originate and popular varieties of each so let's start tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of camellia sinensis an evergreen shrub native to china and east asia tea drinking may have begun in the region of yunnan region where it was used for medicinal purposes it is also believed that in sichuan people began to boil tea leaves for consumption into a concentrated liquid without the addition of other leaves or herbs thereby using tea as a bitter yet stimulating drink rather than as a medicinal concoction chinese legends attribute the invention of tea to the mythical shenang in central and northern china in 2737 bc although evidence suggests that tea drinking may have been introduced from the southwest of china szechuan yunan area the earliest written records of tea come from china the word appears in the xi jing and other ancient texts to signify a kind of bitter vegetable and it is possible that it referred to many different plants such as south thistle chicory or smartweed as well as tea in the chronicles of wyang it was recorded that the bar people in sichuan presented two to the joking the chin later conquered the state of bar and its neighbour's shoe and according to the 17th century scholar goo yanwoo who wrote in riji lu it was after the chin had taken shu that they learned how to drink tea another possible early reference to tea is found in a letter written by the chin dynasty general lu  who requested that some real tea to be sent to him the earliest known physical evidence of tea was discovered in 2016 in the mausoleum of emperor jing of han in shian indicating that tea from the genus camellia was drunk by han dynasty emperors as early as the second century bc the han dynasty work the contract for a youth written by wang bao in 59 bc contains the first known reference to boiling tea among the tasks listed to be undertaken by the youth the contract states that he shall boil tea and fill the utensils and he shall buy tea at woo yang the first record of tea cultivation is also dated to this period during which tea was cultivated on meng mountain near chengdu another early credible record of tea drinking dates to the 3rd century a.d in a medical text by hua2o who stated to drink bitter too constantly makes one think better however before the mid-8th century tang dynasty tea drinking was primarily a southern chinese practice [Music] tea was disdained by the northern dynasties aristocrats who describe it as a slave's drink inferior to yogurt it became widely popular during the tang dynasty when it was spread to korea japan and vietnam the classic of tea a treatise on tea and its preparations was written by liu in 762 through the centuries a variety of techniques for processing tea and a number of different forms of tea were developed during the tang dynasty tea was steamed then pounded and shaped into cake form while in the song dynasty loose leaf tea was developed and became popular during the yuan and ming dynasties unoxidized tea leaves were first pan-fried then rolled and dried a process that stops the oxidation process that turns the leaves dark thereby allowing tea to remain green in the 15th century oolong tea in which the leaves were allowed to partially oxidize before pan frying was developed western tastes however favored the fully oxidized black tea and the leaves were allowed to oxidize further yellow tea was an accidental discovery in the production of green tea during the ming dynasty when apparently careless practices allowed the leaves to turn yellow which yielded a different flavor [Music] the tea plant originated in the region encompassing today's south west china tibet north myanmar and north east india where it was used as a medicinal drink by various ethnic groups in this video blurred tv is presenting different types of tea watch the video till the end to get complete information about different types of tea white tea white tea may refer to one of several styles of tea which generally feature young or minimally processed leaves of the camellia sinensis plant currently there is no generally accepted definition of white tea and very little international agreement some sources use the term to refer to tea that is merely dried with no additional processing some to tea made from the buds and immature tea leaves picked shortly before the buds have fully opened and allowed to wither and dry in natural sun while others include tea buds and very young leaves which have been steamed or fired before drying most definitions agree however that white tea is not rolled or oxidized citation needed resulting in a flavor characterized as lighter than most green or traditional black teas in spite of its name sweet brewed white tea is pale yellow its name derives from the fine silvery white hairs on the unopened buds of the tea plant which give the plant a whitish appearance the unopened buds are used for some types of white tea it is harvested primarily in china mostly in the fukian province but more recently produced in eastern nepal taiwan thailand green tea green tea is a type of tea that is made from camellia sinensis leaves and buds that have not undergone the same withering and oxidation process used to make oolong teas and black teas but its production and manufacture has spread to other countries in east asia several varieties of green tea exist which differ substantially based on the variety of sea sinensis used growing conditions horticultural methods production processing and time of harvest although there has been considerable research on the possible health effects of consuming green tea regularly there is little evidence that drinking green tea has any effects on health generally lower quality green teas are steeped hotter and longer while higher quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter but usually multiple times two to three typically higher quality teas like yokuro use more tea leaves and are steeped multiple times for short durations steeping too hot or too long results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins leading to a bitter astringent brew regardless of initial quality the bruised taste is also affected by the steeping technique two important techniques are to warm the steeping container beforehand to prevent the tea from immediately cooling down [Music] and to leave the tea leaves in the pot and gradually add more hot water during consumption [Music] herbal tea less commonly called to zanes are beverages made from the infusion or decoction of herbs spices or other plant material in hot water the term herbal tea is often used in contrast to true teas which are prepared from the cured leaves of the tea plant camellia sinensis unlike coffee and true teas which are also available decaffeinated most tizanes do not naturally contain caffeine herbal teas can also have different effects from person to person and this is further compounded by the problem of potential misidentification the deadly fox glove for example can be mistaken for the much more benign comfrey the u.s does not require herbal teas to have any evidence concerning their efficacy but does treat them technically as food products and require that they be safe for consumption fruit or fruit flavored tea is usually acidic and thus may contribute to erosion of tooth enamel [Music] [Music] [Music] roy biss t roibus meaning red bush is a broom-like member of the plant family for basey eye that grows in south africa's finn boss the leaves are used to make a herbal tea that is called by the names roybas especially in southern africa bush tea red tea or red bush tea the tea has been popular in southern africa for generations and since the 2000s has gained popularity internationally the tea has a taste and color somewhat similar to hibiscus tea with more or less of an earthy flavor like yerba mate roybus was formally classified as ceralia but is now thought to be part of a spalathis following dahlgren the specific name of linearize was given by berman for the plant's linear growing structure and needle-like leaves roybis is usually grown in the cedarburg a small mountainous area in the region of the western cape province of south africa generally the leaves undergo an oxidation this process produces the distinctive reddish-brown color of rooibos and enhances the flavor unoxidized green rooibos is also produced but the more demanding production process for green roybus makes it more expensive than traditional roybas it carries a malty and slightly grassy flavor somewhat different from its red counterpart mate tea mate tea is it is traditionally prepared by boiling yerba mate in water then strained and served in cups it is a bitter tasting beverage similar to mate but milder with the same stimulating and nutritional properties it is also sold in tea bags so it can be prepared like tea the jesuits in the current territories of the south of brazil and paraguay and the argentine provinces of missionese and coriantis in the first decades of the 17th century improved the cultivation technique of the yerba mate and exported it to compete with the tea that england sold put a chopped yerba mate on sale to make tea that became popular in europe known as the tea of the jesuits that tea of the jesuits from the 17th century today has become the mate cocodo a very popular infusion that because of the low price of yerba mate compared to the price of tea or coffee has become since the early 20th century the common beverage in schools hospitals and prisons the preparation of mate coquido in tea bags is almost the same as regular yerba mate with the difference that in grinding the dust and sticks are removed sorting and processing only the leaves mate coquido is also produced in soluble form blooming tea blooming tea flowering tea or blooming tea consists of a bundle of dried tea leaves wrapped around one or more dried flowers these are made by binding tea leaves and flowers together into a bulb then setting them to dry when steeped the bundle expands and unfurls in a process that emulates a blooming flower and the flowers inside emerge as the centerpiece typically they are sourced from the yunnan province of china flowers commonly used in flowering teas include globe amaranth chrysanthemum jasmine lily hibiscus and osmanthus flowering tea in its current form was developed in china in the 1980s and first became popular in western countries in the early 2000s some sources state that the general concept of bundled tea leaves is several centuries old blossoming flower in water flowering tea is generally served in containers made of glass or similar transparent materials so that the flowering effect can be seen the bundles can usually be reused two or three times without the tea becoming bitter is a tea made from camellia sinensis far sinensis that is grown and processed in the darjeeling or kalampong districts in west bengal india since 2004 the term darjeeling tea has been a registered geographical indication referring to products produced on certain estates within darjeeling and kalumpong the tea leaves are processed as black tea though some estates have expanded their product offerings to include leaves suitable for making green white and oolong teas the tea leaves are harvested by plucking the plants top two leaves and the bud from march to november a time span that is divided into four flushes the first flush consists of the first few leaves grown after the plant's winter dormancy and produce a light floral tea with a slight astringency this flush is also suitable for producing a white tea second flush leaves are harvested after the plant has been attacked by a leaf hopper and the camellia tortrix so that the leaves create a tea with a distinctive muscatel aroma the warm and wet weather of monsoon flush rapidly produces leaves but they are less flavorful and often used for blending the autumn flush produces teas similar but more muted to the second flush tea plants were first planted in the darjeeling region in the mid-1800s at the time the british were seeking an alternative supply of tea apart china and attempted growing the plant in several candidate areas in india the british established numerous tea plantations with the majority of workers being gawkers and lectures from nepal and sikkim after independence the estates were all subsequently sold to businesses in india and regulated under the laws of india the soviet union replaced the british as the primary consumers of tea from darjeeling as darjeeling tea gained a reputation for its distinctiveness and quality it was marketed more to western europe with many estates acquiring organic biodynamic and fair trade certifications and the tea board of india pursuing authentication and international promotion of darjeeling teas [Music] if you like our video so please press the like button and comment below don't

linda hi [Music] today we will be having a delightful tea we hope from david's tease this one is called la la lemon or california dreaming um i could tell you in french but my french socks so i'm not going to this is 16 ounces of water for one to two perfect spoons boiled at 200 for three to five minutes 16 ounces of water for one to two i don't know where my perfect spoon has gone and if it's one to two and we only want one cup we're gonna do half of that so we're gonna put one regular teaspoon for half all right this is organic let's see smells like lemon can't really smell the black tea in it the ingredients in this are black tea from the yunnan province orange peel with natural lemon and orange oil so we're going to put one spoonful in there and you can see the difference between the orange peel and the lemon in here some of the tea is ground very finely others of it you know some decent leaves [Music] so i'm just hoping this doesn't taste like lemon pledge smells we've had a lot of you know lemon type teas that have done that that have not been so good let's pour all right we've gone to eight oz and i think it's three minutes three to five hey siri set a timer for four minutes four minutes counting down all right if this is your first time you've stopped by the channel thanks i really appreciate it my name is linda arnold i'm a mostly self-taught potter who has just a teeny tiny hot tea addiction i'm on a quest as a potter to either find make or buy the perfect teapot for the occasion and then fill it with the perfect tea for the occasion i am generally joined by one of my children i have three sons however you know everybody's busy with their own little lives and you're stuck with me today so sorry about that you'll get over it all right so our timer has gone off let's take a look um our leaves have plumped up our peel in here has also hydrated quite well i am scared it's going to be like lemon pledge though [Music] it smells very lemony i enjoy lemon in my tea when it's iced so i'm not worried about that all right okay so our color oh we have the yum yum color oh my goodness yum yum yum yum yum i am okay so this is going to sound really crazy um and it's got to be just me uh that kind of it's i don't know that's a it smells kind of cigarettey um not like an ashtray okay well like an ashtray but not smokey it's um okay so imagine you you have cigarettes that you haven't lit them or anything and you've just kind of ground them out in an ashtray so i guess it's not cigaretty it's tobacco it smells tobacco-y that's i don't know i don't know if that's even right and it has a little bit of a smoke smell to it i don't know that's weird but it it it doesn't have a lap saying in it um so it must just be me someone may be burning something outside and the dogs keep coming in and out of one of the doors so that may be it i don't know so discount what i've said about the smell since i can't i can't pinpoint it all right okay so it doesn't taste like lemon pledge so that's a plus it tastes like a glass of iced tea that's hot that has a lemon in it that makes no sense uh it tastes like a cup of hot tea with lemon in it um it's i mean that's it's nothing extraordinary i mean if you would have taken a regular irregular cup of tea you know your standard cup of tea and put lemon in it this would be it it's i mean it's not extraordinary by any stretch of the imaginations it's just it's just kind of ordinary to me honestly but i don't know if i'm going to spend that kind of money on this i'd rather it be well i don't always have lemon in the house so i mean i know yeah that just made it sweet tea now okay so what i'm going to say is that this tea i would rather have cold i would rather have a glass of tea with ice on it it's not a bad tea i'm enjoying it but this way i'd rather have it be iced with the lemon then have it be hot because it's it's i mean it's not weird or anything it's just there are so many other hot teas out there that i would rather have this would just be better for me iced i mean it goes in a good bin um it will go inside because i can make iced tea out of this i could oh it would be lovely as a cold brew that actually sounds really yummy to do this as a cold brew tea actually i may do that tonight i really may do that i think that would work out very well because then you don't have to put your lemon in it and it's not overly lemony it's just lemony enough without being too tart actually i think that would be i think that's the way to go with this one with the la la lemon do it as as a cold brew like an overnight cold brew in your fridge and i think it'd be perfect hot it's okay but i think it'd be better cold so um alrighty well thanks for coming by and having a couple with me today i really do appreciate it i hope you have an amazing rest of your day and i look forward to seeing you tomorrow [Music] bye hey there do you enjoy our content today if there's any teas

on myself hit the back obviously if you think it's love oh if you think it's love I'll drink to that hey guys welcome back to my youtube channel my name is Abbey what's good what is up how are you so I asked you guys on the community page here what you wanted me to do and the largest request was Starbucks drinks and like I get it that's what we're here for we all just you know we want to save a buck or two I understand I get it so beyond that I asked you guys what kind of drinks you wanted me to make and I don't have to say the biggest request had to have been a caramel macchiato so I'm gonna show you guys how to make that one today also I'm gonna show you guys how to make a couple more I'm gonna show you guys how to make the caramel macchiato chai tea latte that was also a big one that everyone was asking for I'm gonna show you how to make cold brew these are basically just the easiest drinks from Starbucks that you can make at home and it's like so simple that you're like why am i paying six dollars for this but you didn't hear it from me they give me a paycheck so actually technically they don't right now so I can honestly expose them much to think about all right so without further ado I'm gonna show you guys how to make some Starbucks drinks I haven't worked at Starbucks and like a week now and I haven't had caffeine in a week dude this is the first cup of coffee that I've made in a week I'm like my eyes are watering let's I'm like getting emotional before I started filming a video god bless me so first we're gonna start with the caramel macchiato I'm gonna do it iced because it is a cold day in hell when people start ordering hot caramel macchiatos but like you do you boo boo whatever you like so what you're gonna need is vanilla syrup milk ice espresso and caramel and you're probably like vanilla syrup like what yeah there's no caramel syrup except for the drizzle in a caramel macchiato I don't know that blows everyone's mind but I'm using vanilla almond milk so I'm not gonna put Nilla syrup in there because I feel like that would just be redundant yeah I've got my handy-dandy reusable cup here oh wow it's changing colors it still blows my mind every time it changes colors I've had this cup for like months next you get your ice cubes put them boys in there not all the way to the top leave about mmm this much room or light ice if you prefer the amount of ice and milk is honestly a preference thing if you like it more icy add more ice you know I don't feel like I have to explain that next I'm going to add the espresso so here's where it gets a little funky a lot of people don't have an espresso machine at home I don't I will someday but as at this point in my life my bank account is not set up for that so we're using instant espresso which is like honestly kind of like or you can just use like extra strong coffee basically boom lastly we're just gonna do a little crosshatch of caramel we got seven going this way seven going this way two circles boom caramel macchiato it is that easy like I wish I could make this up but it's so simple kind of blows my mind that people pay like 557 and also if you make it at home it's much more customizable you can choose your milk I you can choose how sweet you want it how much vanilla you want in there so yeah that's the caramel macchiato it is as simple as that it's ridiculous next we're gonna do the chai tea latte people always request for me to make the Chinese latte and they don't understand that it's literally just chai and milk all it is go to your local grocery store pick out some chai at Starbucks they add water and milk but there's this like extra concentrated so that's why we add water but if you get one at the grocery store just add milk you get your mug that you like put your try in the club get your milk steam the milk that is very essential unless you're going for an iced chai and which she would just put the chai the milk and ice and then you have a nice tidy latte and boom you've got yourself I tried tea latte it almost feels like we're cheating people because it's so easy look at this Cup it literally as our places on it how hilarious I love her next we're going to talk about cold brew cold brew is the holy grail of iced coffee I don't drink regular iced coffee from Starbucks I only drink cold brew nitro cold brew if I can but always cold brew so here's a French press if you don't have a French press I highly suggest you invest in one because I highly suggest you invest in a French press so you can ingest anyways um I highly suggest you get a French press it just makes the best coffee I feel like in my personal opinion if you're gonna drink Starbucks coffee make your own hot coffee because if you want me to be honest and I'm speaking for every Starbucks barista out there Pike roast is ass it is not good if you think it's good you're lying to yourself get help back to cold brew if you have one of these you're gonna put any coffee that you want or have in here about like 3/4 of a cup and then you're gonna add cold water to the top put the lid on don't press it down but put the lid on so it's gonna look like I wish I didn't make coffee in this or I would make cold girl but yeah it's gonna look like this and you sit that in your fridge for a day a whole day at Starbucks the cold brew takes 20 hours to brew so yeah this is gonna be chilling in your fridge for 20 24 hours and then after the 24 hours is up you just press this baby down it squishes the grounds in the bottom and then boom this is cold brew drink it make a vanilla sweet cream cold brew make a pumpkin creme cold brew you can make anything drink the cold brew black that's what I prefer it's so good cold brew is like the of Starbucks that's they know what they're doing with that the Nitro if you haven't had the nitro get in your car go to their nearest Starbucks and drink it be careful if you're like sensitive to caffeine because it couldn't get you wired so wired that they can't even sell a venti of it is so much caffeine let's talk about iced tea green tea black tea white tea ridiculously easy to make that at home I have basically the entire Starbucks store in my pantry here is ice passing tea you don't have to have the Starbucks Teavana brand or whatever but what you do to make a big batch of ice is you get the tea bag from the grocery store um you can get big batch ones but if you have a specific tea that's little then you just put lots of little bags in there get a picture boil water put the teabags in the pitcher let that steep for five minutes take the bags out fill it with ice and water boom you've got your whole into your pitcher of green tea black tea white tea whatever flavored tea you want I know that iced tea is probably the cheapest thing at Starbucks though so like you're not really breaking the bank if you get an iced tea but still lattes we can talk about lattes if you want to make one of those you steam your milk a latte is just espresso and milk plus your flavoring this is red hot I meant to get this this is caramel syrup got it from Walmart put your syrup in however much you think is necessary you put your espresso in at that point steamed milk on top or not steamed milk and ice if you want an iced latte I figured I'd show you like the easiest things to make at Starbucks because they're just too easy to not make at home you know none of these are like frappuccinos I know if you want a Frappuccino video I have like four of them already they're all a disaster but I have them they're on this channel but yeah none of these require any equipment other than a stove probably no blenders needed or food processors in my case I feel like a real hypocrite making a Starbucks video and not even drinking Starbucks coffee myself I feel like Starbucks hot coffee just like isn't that good and that's the tea it's fine it tastes fine like it'll get me through I'll drink it I do drink it but like that's when I'm that's what I'm like desperate like when you see me pour myself a cup of pike you come to me and you you asked me Abbi are you okay what's going on in your home life and that's when you know something's wrong that I will willingly pour myself a pike think like two weeks ago I was going through I was going through it let me tell you I was going through it I pour myself a Pike and my friend said honey is everything okay and I was like no I don't know it just be like that sometimes everyone already thinks I'm a horse girl and me wearing this sweatshirt is it's really not helping my case um but yeah I think that's all I have for you guys today I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did give it a thumbs up and subscribe if you would like to I hope you guys recreate these at home Annie if you're out there the caramel macchiato is for you honey it's you it's you it's all for you everything I do I tell you all the time heaven is a place on earth with you I hope these recipes save you guys a couple bucks I only want the best for you save your money for hs2 that's all I got for you guys today I'll see you the next one [Music] do you think that if I talk enough will make you wanna be fine all right I'm done", "XQIXCgdDoAM": "what's up guys this is Derek house with the protein chef and if you love coffee as much as me you're gonna love this Co proof coffee recipe it's quick blast you the whole week and take your coffee taste buds to another level so let's jump right into it first four reasons why you should cold-brew one no more water down coffee - it tastes absolutely delicious 3 since hot water isn't being used the oils that are full of acid aren't going to be fully released into the coffee which makes cold brew 60 to 65% less acidic and 4 it's extremely easy to make in bulk with that said before we start you're gonna need a few items these items can collectively be found for around 50 dollars and should last you forever item number 1 a liquid container your container can just be something you have lying around or if you're like me you'll want something specifically for this recipe this 1 gallon jar that you see here I found for $7 online whatever size container you want to use is completely up to you I find that one gallon is the perfect size to last me a couple weeks if you don't have a container this big don't worry you'll be able to scale this recipe however you want to depending on how much you want to brew at a time item number two a burr grinder this manual burr grinder here was $28 online and no it takes me a bit longer than an electric grinder it's a boatload cheaper much more portable and you burn some calories using it the reason we're using a burr grinder over a blade grinder is very simple a burr grinder is a nice consistent grind whereas a blade grinder is not a blade grinder for the most part as no adjustability it's gonna grind some of your grounds into a powder in others and larger pieces basically a blade grinder is like throwing in a bunch of random protein powder into a shake and a burr grinder is using your favorite brand a burr grinder is going to extract the most flavor item number three a filter this filter here is a reusable all-purpose strainer bag that I picked up for nine dollars online this bag allows me to put my ground coffee into it and then into my jar thus making things much quicker and cleanup a breeze you could also use a cheesecloth t-shirt and so on just think outside the box and last number for coffee you could use either whole beans or ground coffee seeing that I'm suggesting you purchase a burr grinder above I'm obviously partial to using whole beans using ground coffee is going to be much quicker and more convenient but you're going to be compromising the taste of time you might be asking why I prefer a whole bean over ground in a simple answer is that whole bean is going to be much fresher as soon as coffee is ground it starts to go stale so grinding the beans yourself will give you a nice fresh beautiful flavor you can purchase any of these items by clicking right there or their links in the description below now let's start this process take out your digital kitchen scale and if you're making one gallon at a time then weigh out eight ounces or 227 grams of whole beans you can make more or less by pausing your screen right now and using one of the other ratios you see in the pop-up if you don't have a digital kitchen scale the one I'm using only costs around $25 ship and it's one of the best investments you can make for your kitchens once you've weighed out your whole beans use your Berg rinder to grind them up the whole grinding process shouldn't take longer than five to ten minutes next add your fresh ground coffee into your strainer bag put your bag into your jar and pour one gallon or 128 ounces of water into your jar making sure that end of your bag sticks out a little bit so that your grounds don't fall out into your water let your coffee brew for fourteen to sixteen hours after fourteen to sixteen hours remove your ground coffee by filtering it or if you use the bag like me just pull your bag out while making sure to remove as much liquid as you can from it just go back back distribute your cold brew into some bottles for easy access to take with you on the go or just leave it in your jar and serve it whenever you want it and there is your cold brew a couple tips one you can have flavored cold brew multiple ways first by using flavored rose but keep in mind lighter rose typically have more acidity I personally prefer darker rose to by putting in extracts like vanilla raspberry coconut chocolate etc into your brew 3 by adding in vanilla bean mint leaves nuts etc into your ground coffee and for of course you can always add in sweeteners or syrups after you brew it to each individual coffee that's my personal favorite right there tip number two don't brew it for too long it'll start to go bitter in my opinion brewing it for 14 to 16 hours is optimal 3 you don't have to brew it in the fridge you can brew it on the countertop brewing it in the fridge will just give you a nice cold cup of coffee in the morning for the brew will stay fresh for round 2 to 3 weeks so don't be scared to make a ton of it at a time and 5 there's a ton of variables here but my estimate for that caffeine content is around 100 to 125 milligrams of caffeine per 8 ounces alright guys thank you for watching if you like coffee as much as I do smack that thumbs up on everything in moderation and of course stay healthy", "6SiG7CprIa8": "[Music] welcome to our bubble broadcast sundays uh i mean it's a rank um edition and uh today is no different uh what we have for you uh today is a iced tea rancom mikey um what do you look for in a good iced tea good taste i'm tired so i can't think straight so if i say anything please ignore it all right jake what do you look for in a good iced tea um sweetness but not too sweet because it can get too sweet it can get too sweet and generally the darkness of it especially on like powdered iced tea you get that dark iced tea like if it looks like if yeah if it looks like black coffee don't drink it yeah um but yeah i'm looking for a refreshment um i was just riding the bike so looking for a refreshing taste looking for again not too sweet but i don't want it to taste like tea either yep like i want a sugary drink i don't want you want it to be iced tea not real tea yeah you want it sweet and tea yeah if anything so um for the brands that we have uh we have uh snapple and we tried to go with just plain iced tea uh none of the flavored stuff so we have snapple it comes in a plastic bottle now uh we have nest tea it's lemon iced tea yeah so is the snapple we have gold peak tea sorry i'm kind of far away from the camera now uh this is natural lemon and honey flavored we got brisk again kind of you know what it looks like we have fair fairly i've never actually seen this um i usually see like the apple juice orange juice in this one but they have iced tea as well looks like a dollar store drink good drink we'll see if we agree with them on that drink good feel good be good good drink arizona iced tea very good so funny uh arizona iced tea reminds me of my childhood um back when we lived in bc uh when i was an only child we would go to the driving range sometimes and after the driving range we'd go and pick up a drink and i would get a big can of the arizona iced tea this was before they had like the arnold palmer half and half iced tea lemonade which is delicious as well but we have the arizona iced tea and then finally we have the blue cup which represents homemade ice cream that one reminds me of my childhood all right so we have uh eight different types of iced tea in front of us uh they're labeled one through eight so why don't we start at number one i know i i just have a defected cup that's number one like melted almost yeah this one i have a big boycott cheers i know what this one is whoa well i think i know what this actually noise two tastes yeah you'll see probably there's a lot of i i think i know which one this is too i all right like there's a little bit of apple in it count of three we'll say what no what yeah count three will say which one we think it is one two three what did you say wait hold on what is i thought that fairly was the only definitely no yeah i think it has a it definitely has a lemony taste right very lemony a little too tea for me all right number two i don't know exactly what this is who made it jake it's weak you're not too good we call it iced tea it's good not right i usually make mine really strong so i didn't want these two to whine about us i like strawberries too all right number three this one's a little i know that is that's tea what do you think that is that's not arizona is it good drink i was thinking it was good drink or gold peak all right yeah that's definitely not my favorite i think i know that one all right next one number four oh that's good that is good good sugar amount refreshing i think well i feel like there's a way it does something to your tongue and like if if that is good then i don't know are you guys ranking them or are you just putting them back in order oh uh well just because i'm as i'm going i'm trying to remember what the flavor was and where i like them i drank number one for some reason so jake's going back and re-sampling so we're midway through uh what do you have is your number one mikey jake four same as me what's your last one right now number two it's number three so at least we haven't spread out across the board after that all right go on to number five not bad is that your brisk iced tea i don't like i don't like brisk iced tea i like nesting more which is nasty okay so good we used to get the nesty um these things for yourself you still get them you can still get them yeah you have it but mom used to give them for me for lunch all the time i can't talk but mom used to give them to me for lunch all the time and then i drink too much and i got sick of them so i don't like it anymore uh all right finishing off number number six we'll see if i like it okay that's disgusting i'm never drinking that again that's like water no that is real that's bad water that's does that have honey flavor or is that good tea good drink no it can't be that that's disgusting fairly must have a ton of sugar so it's not gold it's not green is fake it's sugary but they say slightly sweet which i don't know how you could say this was sweet at all this has with black tea and lemon i don't know but number six is my last place now yes yes all right go into number seven i need something to replace that flavor from my mouth i don't know if it's the same flavor or if it's different it's a little sweeter yeah but it tastes the same yeah it does well i'm saying it's better than six not by much but it is better it's less i'm thinking gold peaking good good drink i don't think gold peak is like that whoa look what's the lemon and honey flavored iced tea i think that's like the it may be well we'll see all right last one let's finish her off okay we had to just try what number two was was too homemade yeah yeah better than that all right okay mikey what was your first place just wait no i actually number four number four number two was what like number two came up no no your second place number five okay and your third place number eight okay so four and eight were in my top three jake i just got it wow number eight was my third place and then i switched mike so i put five as number one and four okay five is actually my number four the only one that made it into my top three that didn't make yours was number two hey thank you you're welcome all right dad doesn't like strong heidi has the results so heidi we just started what was number six cup number six was gold pink gold peak so it was the gross one i don't think maybe i i guess i haven't had gold pizza all right and then uh number seven number seven number seven was good drink yep okay okay if you like ice cream if you like iced tea like real iced tea those are your two drinks yes there's a gap now we get good now we get to better iced tea number three number three was fairly okay i'm still okay with that didn't i say that i said it was gonna be fairly number one snapple which you said which i called thank you thank you i can hear your applause from here burning my throat it's down the list like i don't actually like it i've never liked snapple but uh number five brisk yeah you guys like brisk i'm not a brisk fan i don't know number two was homemade yeah number eight just closed nest tea yeah

"eE5IyAJ8Dao": "[Music] [Music] hi my name is April Denon and you're in the wilds of West Cork and today we're gonna look at doing her boo chip or you're probably more familiar with kombucha and it's a fermented tea I make kombucha from herbs only so I will use lovely herbs like this is ginseng this is chamomile we've got hibiscus here as well all kinds of different herbs but not black tea now this go bees are interchangeable you can actually take this goby and use black tea and make a pot of kombucha but for me because I don't drink black tea and I didn't want the caffeine I wanted the herps plus I'm a herbalist so I have this affinity to herbes I wanted to try and see if I could do it with herbes only and after having been told I couldn't do it guess what I knew I was gonna try I could try my best anyway so it worked out really really well so we have caffeine free kombucha or her bucho so to make your kombucha or your her boot chip you need just a few key simple things any glass bottle or jar or a kiln or jar anything like that I love these because we don't have any clips or ties or anything on the top so just an ordinary big cluster I got these actually from restaurants so these are all pickle jars these are fabulous so you can get your hands on something like this hang on to them then you're gonna need your Scobie so you do need mother to get things fermented and you don't need a lot this is plenty here for leaders and leaders you just need a little small piece of Scobie you'll notice here I've got jugs of water here and even if I was just to say a little bit about water when you're fermenting water quality is really important so if you can get chlorine free get filtered water go and get bottles of water whatever you can find because these things are gonna be sitting in water for about two to three weeks or at least you know a good amount of time so if you can get something that's chemical free even better and you won't get off flavors and off tastes which is really important so we're looking around the table here we've got a little bit of sugar that's a whole other discussion but if I was to go into it a little bit you'll notice that this is just white granulated sugar just ordinary sugar and that's my preference it's my preference for fermenting because it's super easy it's not going to overfeed your Scobie so that's really important if you overfeed your scope you actually can have exploding bottles these you're giving it too much nutrition so this is your best bet it's consumed really quickly and it doesn't leave any after tastes again so this is really important you're going to be filling a tea bag though this is a sort we call a sock here this is a really big tea bag but an ordinary tea bag just a little tea bag open your kitchen press and see what you have and this is all important never leave your your ferment without something to cover so I just actually make these on a sewing machine this is just a little piece of kitchen cloth anything will do a paper towel do what you want it to be able to breathe so just just a piece of muslin or linen and put over top with an elastic band the elastic band keeps any bugs or any flies out your flies have a real affinity for this stuff so these are handy so you've got a full range of little things spoons your herbs or your tea water mother sugar straightforward so this here is a Scobie that I developed now Scobie you're gonna know it by several different names so this is a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast it's also called the mother basically it is your bacteria and yeast culture and it's living its a mat of cellulose in the at the end of it all I developed my own because there wasn't anything available I didn't want something that was made on black tea because I don't drink black tea and I didn't want caffeine for the kids it took about a year over a year but I basically just took tea and sweetened it with sugar and put a cloth over top and I let it sit and go off now again when you do that fungus could grow anything can grow so you have to kind of look and see are the conditions right so I would suggest if you want to try this do it in the spring of the year when it's not hot it's not cold and make sure it's well covered and well secured and then check it every month and see is there a thin skin this cellulose looking thing growing over top that being said you do not have to start your own and wait for a year these are available on everywhere from amazon you can pop by my market stall if you're in ireland we could even dry it out and and people post them all over dried and then they kind of rehydrate them and you can convert them so you can get a Scobie that's made from black tea ordinary black tea and you can then start making her bucho with herbes only and eventually your Scobie will kind of convert over and be less acidic I found that that they're often acidic I'm interested in this one because I like to take rose and ferment and then two or three days later at hibiscus or add ginseng or add an elderberry or something fresh that's growing or something that's that's wild that I can forage and then adding different flavors until I get the desired result this this series of wonderful notes and flavors so now we're at the stage where we can actually start putting this together so we can do it a couple of different ways this is cold herbal tea that was made a few hours ago and then I'm gonna add a little bit of hot water it does not have to be full you make as much as you want to drink and then I'll take a little tea bag and put some herbs maybe we'll go with the lighter herb so this is ginseng and chamomile I'm gonna mix them together this makes absolutely delicious flavors but you can use any herbs in your imagination it doesn't even have to be herbes it can be berries it can be anything you want to tie your bag up or use a tea bag or and again it doesn't have to be a bag it can be a scrap of cloth with a string okay but you want to close it and I'll show you in a minute what's gonna happen we're gonna put our herbs in there and that will sink it will get saturated with the water then we're gonna put a little bit of a Scobie so just a piece of Scobie in here now this gobi has lots of different stages like if you can see there some pieces are thick some pieces are really really thin and I think like I dug these out of a barrel and some of these like look at these really really kind of scraps of Scobie this is the what we call the babies I call it mother maiden Crone so you have your maiden which is your scraps your babies and the thicker Scobie it gets really really super thick those are the older bits I tend to use take scissors and put them in the compost eventually because they'll make really strong kombucha super fast if that's what you want work away but for me I want a longer slower ferment so I tend to use the younger scobie's and you don't need a lot and I'm always trimming the scoby as well so if you've got a good you want to keep a nice healthy Scooby with lots of healthy lactobacillus bacteria keep trimming it so take scissors to it keep this the younger bits and discard the older bits when it starts to turn brown definitely discard it because it's getting elderly then and you're not going to get a good quality drink so now we've got a bit of Scooby the tea that's in there so one other thing now this is a different flavour I'm just gonna put a little bit but this is already fermented kombucha or her bucho and again just as another little kick to start it what I like to say the people is remember you're the one who's in charge you're the master fermenter here so you want to be telling this liquid which organisms are going to flourish and which ones will be discouraged we're just putting tablespoons of white sugar in here and we're just stirring that there like that without beating up your mother too much there's just a gentle stir and we're gonna put a little bit more water in there and then I'm going to take a cloth and secure it over top now one of the other things I would suggest you do is then take a little piece of paper or a little sticker put exactly what's in there and the date you started because you will forget I always do so it's just it's just handy to have something just to remind you of what's in there and then some of the questions I get asked a lot is my Scobie is at the bottom what happens now should it be there the scoby should 90% of the time it will rise to the top after 24 or 48 hours but not always and you still will get a lovely ferment so it doesn't really matter but it usually will rise to the top and then grow in around your tea bag you can leave your tea bag in there for the entire ferment this time of year we're in the middle of summer this might be ready in five or six days then we can do a second ferment we're going to talk about that in a minute or if you want you can pour it off and drink it so this is it you can put it on your kitchen counter you can put it in the press it doesn't need to be warm hot or cold if it's cooler it'll simply take a bit longer if it's warmer it will go faster it will keep going until the sugar is gone you can then consume this when you're happy with it so after four or five days taste if you like the taste pour it off and drink it if not leave it for another day or two that the taste the flavors will develop another thing you can do then is do a second ferment and we'll talk about that next so now I'm just going to show you really quickly what I would do for a second ferment again it's one of the top questions I get that after you've been making your kombucha for a little while you're her bucho people want to get more adventurous and why not like this is what it's all about so have some fun with it so if this let's say this has already been fermenting for four or five days and you've got everything in there and everything is it's been sort of well steeped so for your second phase this is what I do some people just kind of top it up from there in that jar but I don't like to do that I like to change jars and the reason why is that you will get sediment built up on the bottom of your first jar even after a day or two there will be kind of dead and dying yeast it's not a problem but again it can create off flavors and so I like to discard that so I will never even I didn't stir this I would just gently decant into another jar and then we've got our tea so we've got our fermented herbal tea right here there's very little scovia in here you can actually take your Scobie out but most of the scoby was left behind you can add more sugar you can add more hurts if you want but what we're gonna do now because it's summer is add some frozen berries and you can put these here in a little bag if you want or you can just drop them right in but I'm using frozen berries as opposed to fresh especially when it comes to raspberries because you probably remember if you see raspberries on the bush or blackberries and they they will get moldy and they get there's fungus so I like to use frozen just a few to ensure that we're not introducing additional bacteria or fungus into our ferment so you want to just encourage the right types of organisms to grow and not have everything willy-nilly growing in there so frozen berries of any kind work really well so what will happen after a few hours with these raspberries in here is they will actually turn completely white and the color and the flavor will be steeped into your drink so after six to twelve hours I would suggest decant it again and pop it in the fridge and then it's ready to drink and you have this delicious flavors it may or may not be fizzy it depends on fizziness comes from the wild yeast I believe and probably know obviously a lot of other factors so it may or may not be fizzy often if you want fizz what you can do is put a little bit of ginger book in there but sometimes it'll get fizzy on its own even without the ginger bug so use your imagination if you're making kombucha there's no end to what you can add or you know different herbs and combinations different types of frozen fruit or berries there's so many things you can just have so much fun with it so this is ready in a few hours decant it off I would suggest put it into a jar it's good for a month or longer I have people I know people who keep it for months and let it get good and sour once it's capped and in the fridge in your jar it will get very very slowly less and less sweet and more and more fizzy so if you wanted to pour it off and leave it for a couple of weeks or even a couple of months it's absolutely lovely it'll be like a champagne once it's finished keep it in the fridge once it's finished yeah I would keep it it plus it tastes better in the fridge it tastes better it preserves it longer you'll have a stable environment for your bacteria to remain stable and it will still continue because it's fermenting and it's not pasteurized or filtered so it will continue this long slow ferment and I think the flavors developed and then of course the purpose why are we doing all of this it is a fantastic probiotic speaking as a nutritionist we I believe we need them to assimilate and for the uptake of nutrients in and through the gut so it helps you digest your food so this is the fun part where you get to take your healthy fermented drink and take it to a whole new level as far as I'm concerned and get a little bit of gin though it could be any kind of gin I'm sorry I don't have the Irish gin today but actually some of the flavor gins you want something that's not flavored because you're gonna add your gin to lots of flavor so this is my hibiscus and Rose and what else is in here a little bit of elderberry and a smidge of clove and gin pears so beautifully so does whiskey people who love it with whiskey but I'm a ton preference so my preference is gin so I just put a little bit all right just just a couple of tablespoons or you can put a lot up to you and give it a little stir what I usually do was I would mix this a couple of hours ahead of time I put a little cover like just some cling film over top put it in the fridge to make it good like ice cold or add some ice and then pour it off into your glass and you have a super delicious summer drink like this is absolutely amazing really refreshing and a little bit of an alcoholic drink for the adults in the evening and and certainly to enjoy some of these lovely Irish gins plancha enjoy [Music] you you", "mnYOjWw2I0s": "how to get a flat stomach and lose weight in five days this miracle fat-burning tea not only helps you to lose weight but also helps

kind of spice up chamomile um so the ingredients in this tea are organic green rooibos organic apple organic vervain leaf organic licorice root organic lemongrass organic lemon peel organic valerian root organic lemon oil and organic marigold blossoms so everything is organic and everything is a really nice ingredient that pairs well together i especially like how there are no like natural flavors or anything like that it's all organic and pure and i really like how they have miracle blossoms and that because that always tastes good this is obviously caffeine free so it's great for um after dinner and around bedtime and it has a really distinct chamomile flavor so i'm drinking some right now and it's been about um five minutes the steak time says to i'm not four to five minutes at 200 degrees fahrenheit so i'm gonna go ahead and take it out and i'll show you guys what it looks like so it's this really beautiful kind of honey colored cup and you can see it is a really nice color let's give it a taste it's just one of those teas that you love to have by the fire before you go to sleep and it's just very calming and it's not one of those teas where the chamomile is too strong i can definitely taste the lemongrass the lemongrass is really standing out to me and it's pairing very nicely with the lemon and the chamomile all right that's gonna be it today i had so much fun showing you guys this tea i'm sorry there wasn't a video last week because i was on vacation but i am back now and there will be a new video next week so i'll see you guys next sunday bye", "ivfMZW468_U": "we have the China here in four different states what it looks like when you get it off the tree broke it into smaller chunks from the freshly harvested chopper right to be dried dried China in nugget size and then dried chaga in powder I had a fun day today looking for chalk on the property and this is what I came back with and I also have some older chaga here that we harvested earlier I'm going to show you now how to process this chaga in order to make it into something usable when you first get chug off the tree it's actually quite full of water it's very moist and you need to dry it first before you can use it when you first get chaga it's actually a little bit kind of pliable which is good it's easier to work with if you've had chuck up for a while and it's off the tree for a while it becomes quite hard so there's two main ways that people use chaga one in chunks like this and another where it's caught up into much smaller more of a powder and then you use it when you have the powder use it more like a tea you put it in tea bags or in tea containers or in your coffee filters and you soak boil water and then soak it in the water for about ten minutes and it makes a nice dark brown liquid or you can use these chunks you can just soak it for longer in a larger pot some people do it in a crock pot and then and you do it for a very long time and then you'll also get an iced tea and a larger volume so first when you before you process that you need to remove any pieces of bark that it might be on the on the chaga from the tree because you don't really want that [Music] for this new chaga I'm just going to cut it up into smaller pieces you can also use a sharp knife now this stuff will be a lot easier to dry and then you'll put it in the coffee grinder and you can make powder now if you have left the chaga for too long and it's really solid it's not really that easy anymore to get slivers off of it a lot of people go to town and hack out with an axe they're going to be a lot of shrapnel so put it in a container like a like a cooler isn't like that so you can contain all the shrapnel another way is just to shave off like this takes a lot longer but if you don't have a lot to process but the easiest way as I said is with big axe with shrapnel cut it into smaller pieces and then once you got it into some bone up pieces of it in your coffee grinder then you can put in the coffee grinder to make it into a powder so there you have it the next step to processing your chaga in order to make tea the stuff that's new you've got to dry it first the stuff that's old it's already dry then you can put this right away into your coffee grinder and then into your into your tea and then you can have some wonderful chocolate tea we have the China here in four different states what it looks like when you get it off that broke it into smaller chunks from the freshly harvested chopper right to be dried dried Chara in nugget size and then dried chaga in powder for the powder you take about a tablespoon and put that in hot water just below boiling temperatures and use it like a tea for the large chunks or nuggets you put you put those in water and simmer for one to eight hours depending on how dark you liked the chaga the powder you can use once the nuggets you can use two to three times for the pot method use about five to six Nuggets which would be about 15 grams in one liter of water and let simmer for 1 to 6 hours depending on how strong you want it these can be reused two to three times [Music] to brew a single cup of tea you can take a tablespoon of the powder and place it in a team fuser like this one and then let it soak in near boiling water until you've reached the desired color concentration [Music] now let's compare the different brews first we have the brew made with the powder it was left to steep for about 10 minutes and this is the color consistency and then we have the brew with the Nuggets which was on the wood stove for about four hours and as you can see here it has a richer brew it also has a stronger flavor some people like to add sweetener to the tea to make it more palatable I find it a little bit sweet already but some people add maple syrup but might be better would be adverse syrup keep to the same tree so there you have it 1 tablespoon of powder versus 5 or 6 Nuggets short brew less rich less flavorful a longer brew more rich more flavorful [Music] it's not quite dark enough for Dave yet so I'm going to put it back on the stove you might want to experiment with what flavors you like and enjoy your chopper broom", "Qviymia6ob4": "hi guys I'm Gabrielle Michelle Romero and in this video I'm going to show you how to make iced tea with lemon in it so and this is

enjoy your drink", "zXrKkpvchgg": "[Music] hey how's it going everybody it's avert at t review and two welcome to my channel today we're going to be doing a little duel review of the white peach from adagio teas and hearty assigns the adagio teens one you're getting the peach and you're getting the apricot you're getting some floralness so it's very opening with the adagio tease smell of that one right there with the harnesses you're getting that peach you get some vanilla in here too and i mean it these both smell great well now let's jump into the taste of them with the adagio teas when that floral aspect of it in the smell is there to taste lightly the peach is definitely there the apricot is definitely there they both taste pretty together here in this blend and then you've got the tea in there as well light light and stringency not much like going on i brewed both of them three minutes 175 degrees just make them as similar as possible and with the adagio teas one right here get some slight like honest notes coming from that tea as well with the white tea of course white tea you can pick up several different flavor notes with white tea just by itself of course you put it in different blends something might stick out a little bit more so some of that floral aspect i'm tasting here could be from the actual tea with the taste of the harney and sons right here you're getting a more concentrated peach taste and the peach in this one tastes like it's a fresh peach but it's also kind of like a baked in peach it's really in the tea whereas with the adagio blend it's kind of getting some separation going on you taste the tea you're tasting the peach and the apricot you got the floral aspect the fluorescence blends in kind of with each one of those though with the harney and suns it's almost as if the peach was grown with the tea leaves and this is a mutant white tea from china and the tea from the industrial sea device is from china as well from the fujian province the adagio tease i'm getting a more open kind of flavor profile from it it's just like you're outside and you're with the tea like this the horniest size is the inside tea with the flavors from the peach and the tea which has to slightly kind of grassy notes that's coming out with you a little slightly strange to see i want it in just a direct white peach tea and that's it it's white peach i want to just get that and i want to get out like this i'm going to start yellow white peach all right harney and sons that's what i'm going to go for right there if i wanted something like i want a white peach but i'm open to you know tasting some other things with it you know the adagio cheese you know and then for since you know honestly like i would next time i make these i might i'm probably just gonna blend both of them together the sweetness of both of them very nice sweetness goes along with both of them not a lot of sweetness not a little squeeze i would say more towards like hey there's some sweetness in this for sure but not like a oh this is too sweet for me or anything like that and that is it for the review hope you all have an awesome day enjoy those cup of teas you got take care", "4Bxz-uUlqD8": "[Music] hello everyone my name is the ends i need more water ice cube teaspoon of sugar [Music] tea vanilla and meal and cookies for the tools i need a glass and a spoon

back to my channel and hello if you're new what make sure that you subscribe if you're not subscribed already you're probably wondering why am i holding a cup of tea that's because I'm going to show you guys how to make this cup of ginger tea it tastes so freakin good and it makes your hair grow really fast so if you guys are interested then keep on us so basically you're going to need a ginger root and then you're going to slice that up into little pieces and depending on how strong you want your ginger teas that's how much you're going to cut now I like mine super strong so that's I'm using this much next you're going to need a cup of water or however much tea you're making you're going to use that much water so I'm just making a cup so that's what I'm going to be using today so let's get started so starting off I'm just going to go ahead and pour my water in there be careful when you're pouring and then I'm just going to turn my stove on to the highest heat next I'm just going to go ahead and drop my ginger pieces in there and we're going to let this come to a boil so once your water is boiling you want to let that boil for about two to three minutes or even five minutes if you want this tea to be really strong and then you're going to take this off the heat and we're ready to pour our tea into our glasses next you want to take a strainer and strain your tea into your glass they don't get the ginger pieces in your tea unless you want to keep them in that's your preference and there you have it our ginger tea is all ready for us to drink Oh before in the video I wanted to talk real quickly about the benefits of ginger tea for hair growth and why it's so good so basically ginger tea promotes the growth of your hair by working from the inside it promotes circulation of the blood it also boosts your immune system which is really good because if your immune system is weak your hair starts can fall at your hair starts to get dry and brittle and it starts to look dull and dead it has a lot of potassium and potassium is really good right there and ginger kia also gives you a lot of energy give you a boost of energy mainly because it's removing the toxins from your body that are like weighing you down making you tired and lazy and when you get that boost of energy you kind of want to just get up and do something and that's really good for your hair because you're boosting the blood circulation even more on top of what the ginger tea is doing and that's really good to promote and trigger your follicles to produce more hair not only that but ginger tea is so good for so many other things if you guys go on google in your research in turkey is really good for weight loss it's really good for acne it's really good for metabolism dress reliever it calms and soothes you but it also gives you a boost of energy it's also really good for asthma and if you're feeling sick or you have a cold or cough or sinuses this tea is really good it has so many benefits but today I wanted to talk to you today about hair growth I went online and I did a little bit of research and I write a lot of stories about women talking about drinking ginger tea for hair growth because it was a like a secret passed down from their grandmas and their grandma drink it all the time their grandma's always make ginger tea out of great gingers like the way I did today this is one of my favorite favorite teas ever not only does it smell and taste so good but I also see the difference that it does in my pairing my body may be nice silver for watching I hope

[Music] so [Music] [Music] you", "5T8Vr9wpWnE": "[Music] greetings always hi and we welcome back to another Emmy recipe today I will be sharing with you my boba recipe if you guys don't know what boba is boba is a I think originally a time on a string that has black tapioca pearls I could have jellied pearls at the bottom or boba and it's often mixed with all different kinds of flavors milk tea fruity flavors so this was requested when I did a thirsty video about a canned boba drink and put the link down below that unfortunately was not what it said it was supposed to be the disappointment in that drink was the talus for me to actually make my own so let's go to kitchen I'll show you what I did so on the stove bring three cups of water to a boil and I'm using a Burmese t that my mom taught me I love it but you can use whatever you have on hand even use tea bags or whatever your favorite black tea is and then to the boiling water add about four conservative spoons of black tea then turn down the heat to a bare simmer and let it go for about two minutes then use a strainer to strain out the tea and allow the tea to cool at this point you can store it in the fridge and keep it in your fridge rater for a couple days if you want to have some of this tea concentrate on hand I'll quickly show you how you can make a milk tea using that hot tea concentrate so in a mug just add some sweetened condensed milk however much you like and then just top it off with a little bit of milk I like my milk tea really milky and then just top it off with your tea concentrate you can always delete it with hot water if it's a little bit too strong stir it up and there you go so while your tea concentrate is cooling you can go ahead and make your boba this is the boba that I found my local Asian market it's the first time I tried it and actually was pretty happy with it this is the instant type of boba it cooks in five minutes I know there's another kind that takes longer feel free to use whatever you have on hand so two three to four cups of rapidly boiling water add one cup of your boba and let it come to a boil and cook for about five minutes Wow the boba is cooking go ahead and make your simple syrup a simple syrup is just like it says it's really simple is just a one-to-one ratio of sugar to water so I'm just using turbinado sugar 1/4 cup and 1/4 cup of boiling water and just stir that to dissolve I really like the flavor of turbinado sugar but feel free to substitute brown sugar or white sugar ok it's been 5 minutes and give your Bo Buster and make sure you taste one of them to see if they're fully cooked you want them to be nice and chewy not mushy and you don't want them to be firm in the middle drain the tapioca pearls and then flush with lots of cold water to cool them off pour the rinse pearls into the syrup and let them soak for at least 15 minutes you can also store them in the fridge they will get a little bit firm so if you make a drink just place some pearls into the microwave for about 30 seconds before making your drink and they'll shoots off and right up okay so now we're ready to assemble so place however much boba and syrup you want in the bottom of your glass I'm using about 4 tablespoons and then top it off with some condensed milk I think condensed milk is really great it gives a certain amount of richness along with some added sweetness and to make it nice and milky I go ahead and add a little bit of just regular old milk then a few ice cubes and then top everything off with your tea concentrate and give everything a really good stir and then give it a taste if you find it too strong or too live at a little bit more milk and you can add a little bit of water as well to thin out the concentrate if it's a little bit too bitter add a little more ice and a big fat straw and you're all set here's the finished boba drink dah dah dah you can buy these straws I should mention at the Asian market or I just went down to a place in here behind my house and asked them if I could buy a couple straws and the lady just gave me some so yeah you certainly don't need the big fat straws but it really makes it fun to drink and to launch later come by hmm real mean really really good one thing I really like about making them at home is you can adjust the sweetness and the concentration of the tea all you want I mean you can ask them at the store to make it not so sweet or sweet but when you do it at home you you have full control tastes like a really great strong black tea with lots of milk and it's sweetened and you get the little kind of textural chewy component of the boba which is really really delightful and fun there bit like gummies and don't let the colour bother you they don't actually have very much flavor that's why you soak them in the syrup so take up some of the sweetness they alone don't taste like much they're just chewy kind of go many fun things so let me know in the comments if you have made this at home and if so what your recipes are what your suggestions are or what flavors you like of boba I hope you guys enjoy that hope you guys learned something and I'll see you in my next video take care bye I love these oh my goodness look how stinking adorable it's a three dimensional drumstick adorable I think this is one of the cutest snacks I've ever seen it looks a bit like a bowling

Everyone knows lemons are beneficial to us because of the high Vitamin C level. We add this root to tea and we use it when cooking and curing colds. However, there are more incredible properties of lemons. If you place a piece of lemon next to your bed it will bring benefits to your health. Believe it or not, just one lemon can make you happier and help you fight anxiety. Number six - you'll finally relax. The citrus aroma can calm your nervous system, reduce anxiety and relieve tension after a hard day. In the evening, light an aroma lamp in your bedroom and add a few drops of lemon essential oil. The lemon aroma will help you clear your mind and improve your immunity. If you don't have lemon essential oil use a piece of this fruit. Place it next to your bed and your insomnia will disappear very quickly. You'll sleep all night like a baby. Number five - your concentration and attention will improve. Lemon has another fantastic property. Inhaling its aroma every day, you become more concentrated and your mental activity and memory improve. The smell of lemon makes you work more efficiently and faster. Now, it might sound surprising, but people make fewer mistakes at work if there's the smell of lemon. This conclusion was made by Japanese scientists The studies have shown that programmers make 20% less mistakes if they inhale lavender during work, 33% less with the smell of Jasmine and 54% less with the smell of lemon. Number four - your mood will lift up. The smell of lemon can invigorate you, help you concentrate and stimulate your mental abilities. Also, lemon essential oil is a proven remedy for depression. If you've tried all the remedies but they never helped, pay attention to this bright fruit. Citrus aroma like lemon or orange remind us of summer days and makes us feel happier and more relaxed. Grab a lemon and smell it. Your mood will lift up immediately. Number three - lemon cleans the air from germs. Lemon has not only a pleasant aroma, but also bacteriocidal properties. This citrus fruit is an excellent air purifier. It cleans the air in the room very well and makes it fresh. By the way, to get rid of unpleasant odors from your carpets, spray them with a citrus solution before cleaning. Number two - lemon brings your blood pressure back to normal. Many people suffer from hypertension and lemon can also help here. It's been scientifically proven that the lemon smell lowers blood pressure. To improve your health, just place a piece of lemon on your bedside. Also a cup of warm tea with a piece of lemon will bring your blood pressure back to normal. Scientists have found that daily consumption of one lemon lowers blood pressure by 10 percent. Lemon is the most useful for the initial stage of hypertension. Number 1 - insects won't bother you. Ants, flies, mosquitoes and other insects are unlikely to stay in your house smelling of lemon. You don't have to spend money on chemical repellents. To get rid of mosquitoes, stick cloves into a lemon cut in half. To keep ants out of your home, pour a little lemon juice on window sills and doorways. Have we missed any uses for lemon on our list?

today so the other day I went through Starbucks and I got there toasted coconut cold brew which was sort of the talk of the town at the time and I thought wow coffee and coconut that's a really great flavor combination it's got to be good so I got myself one and I thought hmmm I think I could do better than this so I went home and tried my own recipe and here we are a made a delicious coconut cold brew that I really want to share with you guys let's get started so of course we have to start with a cold brew coffee and this is actually my new favorite way of making coffee now is cold brewing so what you want to start with some coffee beans for this I recommend dark rose and non acidic coffee so the hipster fruity note coffee that doesn't work in this recipe okay there we go so I'm doing quick blitz because I don't want to accidentally get you know powder iced coffee this is very full okay so just coarse grind particularly because I'm going to be doing it in a French press and I don't want a ton of fine grounds coming through the mesh right okay I'm going to pour this into my French press French press drug here I made a mess now if you don't have a French press what you can also do is use a muslin bag like if you see my Thai tea Thai coffee recipe I use one of those bags I'll definitely put a link to the product I'm talking about right over here in the description below actually you can go and take a look at what that product is I'm talking about it's super convenient it's like a big bag to put the coffee and let it soak okay okay just cold water and you want this to be drinking tasty water keep that astir looks like I got some great grounds that are too big but that's okay I blame that on Adams coffee grinder so now that's just going to sit at room temperature overnight so 12 hours if you're going to do longer than that like 24 hours I stick it in the fridge so that you don't start getting bacteria growing in it and don't press it until you're ready to use like present halfway just to close it but you want the coffee to be able to just loosely swim in there okay and I have to tell you this this is a lot of coffee so if you just by yourself and you want to make just personal cold brew coffee what do meet is I'm in a French press this is actually a dove you're like I have just the perfect thing for you so the part of the coffee that gifts the toasted coconut flavor is in the toasted coconut syrup so we are going to make just that so I'm going to start out by toasting my coconut so just shredded dried coconut and you want to get this dark toast it not a nice golden brown you want to develop a deep dark Coastie flavor and you want to keep it moving because otherwise you get uneven toasting I'm going to push it I really want that toasty toasty flavor if you remember my me income episode yeah you on that dark toasted coconut okay we're almost there you ready with the water I'm actually going to turn the heat off just so it doesn't go too crazy very nice whew it still went crazy my goodness so what I am doing now is infusing the water but I'm going to use for the syrup with the coconut flavors I'm going to let this simmer for a little while alright wow I can smell that in the air so I'm going to turn this off now and I'm going to strain out all this coconut I want to make sure I get every last bit okay so now I'm going to press every last juice out of this thing yeah there we go and you can see how that water has taken on the color and the flavor of the coconut now the reason why I am straining it into a measuring cup is because I want to know how much volume I have left because I'm going to make sure that I add just about one part sugar to one part water and you know everybody is gonna end up with different amounts of liquid so that's why this is convenient and you also notice there's a layer of oil on top and that's the coconut oil it came out that's flavor right there it's good leave it I am adding palm sugar just because hey we're on the coconut beam right why not use coconut sugar you can use definitely white sugar or light brown sugar if you'd like now because I'm using palm sugar it's going to have a bit of a hard time dissolving so I'm just going to stick this in the microwave and help it get going a little bit ooh perfect so there's just a few big lumps but then usually at this stage you can just stir and press it with the spatula or a spoon and the lumps will all go away and that is it we are now ready to assemble so here is my cold brew that I made yesterday in my beautiful bench press here and I should tell you too that the reason why we cold brew as opposed to hot brew is because when you cold through something the low temperature actually draws out fewer compounds specifically acidic flavor compounds so that means in your coffee will be less acidic and when you taste it it'll feel like it's sweeter and smoother I also find it a little less bitter too and I cold through it but will this work with a hot girl that you've chilled sure why not okay and you can also reheat your cold brew and have it as hot coffee in the morning which is what I do now so then in the morning I don't spend any time making coffee which is my kind of idea okay so now here is my syrup that I made earlier I'm going to add now of course just like any beverage you can add as much or as little of the syrup as you want if you like your beverage is sweet add more sugar to the syrup but don't make it too sweet because then you won't be able to add a lot of syrup and then you get less coconut flavor because just remember that your coconut flavor is tied to the syrup so if you add a lot you get more coconut if you add little you get less okay alright and now coconut milk this is where I think my recipe really differs I am using actual coconut milk that I cook with I think what Starbucks uses is actually coconut beverage you know the coconut milk because they they now have and they used it as a milk substitute so that coconut has had coconut oil coconut fat taken out of it and coconut flavor is in that fat so you end up with like this milky thin beverage that doesn't taste anything like coconut so this is the key here you want to use good real coconut if you want to know my favorite brand of coconut milk I'll put the link in the description below you can check that out okay and now we've got some ice and all you have to do is pull oh yes oh I'm so thirsty with a green straw it's so refreshing taste tropical oh it's just the right amount of creamy just the right amount of sweet and that coconut flavor really comes through oh it's such a great combination and I knew this would work you know why because in Thailand we make a dessert that is a coffee and coconut jelly and together those flavors work really well so when I heard about this concept I knew it was going to work and it's so tasty really easy you can make a cold brew in advance the syrup will keep in your fridge forever for a long time you can make that an event and then coconut milk a view watch my show you probably saw coconut milk in your country so I hope you give this a try the recipe as

works for so long like I said and I absolutely can not wait to have an amazing time on the road all of you sisters alright you guys that that is all I have for the special announcement now let's jump in to today's brand new video as many of you sisters now I have a severe addiction to Starbucks I start off my day every single morning with a venti finca tea drink a tea with my ice and also a slice a pumpkin bread I feel like for a very very long time people thought it was just like part of my brand to snapchat it all the time but no literally every single day I'm obsessed with it I'm addicted and I've been posting about it for a very very long time too to try to get a brand deal and alas here we are today still without wine fun facts for you guys it actually used to be on the Starbucks secret menu as just a strawberry honestly refresher but you how to add coconut milk to it but after I started posting about it and so many of you sisters started ordering it they literally added it to the permanent menu like we actually did that which i think is so cool this morning I rolled out of bed and was craving a pink drink as always but I really was feeling lazy and did not want to leave the house and I thought to myself I bet I can make this myself right here at home so for today's video I thought I'll be so much fun to come downstairs to the Kitty kitchen and see if I could recreate my Starbucks order that I get every single day from scratch let's get started all right you guys I have a bunch of ingredients in front of me are ready to get started on our pumpkin bread today I'm gonna do that first I can pop it in the oven and then work on at the pinky drinka tea which speaking of for this video I am wearing my custom pinky drinking hoodie that was made for me by to my fan pages Zoey and Brooke I love you guys the absolute most but I do have something a little bit more sister special to put on over top and that is my a pride hi welcome to Starbucks what can I get started for you a lot of my ingredients I do have an actual spice of a pumpkin bread up from Starbucks so you can use it as a reference add Lopez as you can see our loop has a beautiful thick slice cut out of it we do love a thick sister and is a beautiful warm tone smoky pumpkin color with a darkened soft crust there's also some pistachio flake some peas it's pumpkin really it's not for Sachi I was the expert on all things not related so we're trying to recreate this exact loaf today so our first step we are go ahead and preheated our oven to 350 degrees and she's in the back heating up for a real one and now we have our large mixing bowl for my mini kitchen and that we are going to mix our dry ingredients into so first we need 1 and 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour really shove your measuring cup in there how do I get it full so there's one ich cup of flour and now we have our half a cup 1 teaspoon of baking soda that smells strong oh wow ok 1 teaspoon of ground nutmeg cinnamon without cinnamon challenge let's go ladies pasta I thought it was so easy I just swallowed it it looks so good Yatta is one teaspoon of cinnamon 1 teaspoon of ground what the clove that sounds very strong it will just look a little bit less than a teaspoon of us I don't like this we have to use baking powder too I'm already bored how about teaspoon of salt the covers on there's a lid on it first of all I'm not stupid oh we need to do this in separate bowls I took a lot of work I'm gonna transfer this powder mixture over to this bowl because I need to beat my other things together in this one now I have to beat the eggs white sugar brown sugar and vanilla extract in a large bowl of an electric mixer on high speed until combined about 30 seconds we're gonna crack four eggs why well I am a professional who'd ever get a cell in there 1 cup of pure white sugar 1 1/4 cup of light brown sugar how are you kidding 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extracts that's like another - now we put it together we're gonna mix it at high speed for 30 seconds being pumpkin and oil Oh Oh God open this No now we're gonna lower this down and lock it and sorry I'll put a slow-speed we're gonna start beating this in and now we're going to add 3/4 cup of our oil 1 for our powder mixture until it's blended and smooth this is too hard whoo now it's getting nice and thick it's let me like it's about done oh my god it actually looks so good I'm a personal Baker if you didn't know okay now we're going to take our batter of our pumpkin loaf cake when important nice and good oh it looks so good I'm gonna use it this good spoon it's really scoop the excess out of here now we're gonna grab our pumpkin seeds because we need to sprinkle them on top so it creates that nice crunchy crust on the bread this ziplock bag and we're going to put our pumpkin seeds in there and now we're just gonna take this rolling pin and really crunch it off what somebody your pumpkin powder we're sprinkle this right on top I know I'm even thinking steak right none of you are now 70 minutes all right you guys now that our pumpkin bread is all ready to go and nice and coated we're going to pop this in the oven at 350 degrees for 70 minutes I thought this was gonna be a quick video to film I was wrong are we surprised no we're basically gonna let this cook until the top is a dark brown we can stick a toothpick Anna and nothing comes out and then we're gonna have to let it cool for many more minutes so I'll see you looks like a porn Tower Oh time for the pink drink all right sisters it is pink kitty drink any time and we have all of our ingredients right here the pumpkin bright is about to be done so it's the perfect time to start making our drink so we can sister sip while we get ready for our breakfast that has taken us two hours so far using a large measuring cup filled with 16 ounces of cold water well that's all like that's nothing so now that I started this recipe is to identify at pocket of the Starbucks insert refreshers now don't get me wrong I love Starbucks but I'm slightly annoyed that I have to use this because it definitely makes it feel less homemade but at the same time we were going for that authentic pink candy drink edite so you gotta do what you gotta do I picked it would be a very very hibiscus refresher it's gonna pour this in to our nice little cup here right now in order to prepare I went ahead and I boiled 1 cup water on top of my stove so we can make some tea oh it's hot oh now we're gonna get one pocket of the itas Oh a passionate tea now if you have been a long time with Starbucks the sister before we had the pink drink all of us typical white girls used to get our passion tea lemonade and this is what they used to make this stuff it's honestly really good for us were just going to put that in there no we have to wait there's way too much waiting in these recipes might as well just go to Starbucks and get it I put a bunch of Starbucks at least 10 times and back by now and the time is taking us to fill this video no yeah it cost forty seven dollars for the ingredients of this yeah you are kidding no oh my god forty seven dollars no and this is not worth it in any way shape and/or form for the time nor the money this just turned into a Starbucks prandial I mean it already was even go get two three drinks the pump everybody what the heck now we've let our tea steep in the pot and get nice and juicy for about five minutes now so I'm just going to take this and I'm going to squeeze the remaining juices out this has been a way too long of a process but I will say it smells amazing and this kitchen right now my god so now we're going to take our passion tea and mix it together with our very very hibiscus refresher looking beautiful is this it like even now now we're just gonna take our reusable Starbucks a tumbler with our reusable straw and fill it with some nice chunks of ice but like a little bit of ice Oh tippy forming a cold drink from Starbucks you said a 100% always order light ice ordering light ice is just say far better drink - iced ratio Assoc for the price sisters not a budget now we're gonna take our mixture and pour the cup until it is halfway full and obviously every brace that makes pink drinks differently but I personally prefer when there's a little bit more pink and then there is drink a 4060 ratio of the pink drink and the coconut milk but obviously personal preference we're just gonna top the rest off with some unsweetened coconut milk we're just gonna fill the rest up beautiful oh our pumpkin breads done a perfect timing okay wait wait I don't know oh shoot Oh oh wow look at how beautiful that is that is good and fresh unless you are cute a toast let's do our toothpick test clean it's done okay now we have to put this in at the fridge for 30 minutes to cool down we don't have 30 minutes so we're going to put this in the freezer and hope that it gets chilly quickly because we have to go this has taken three hours already for literally no reason I could have gotten it in two minutes as our Luck's right now put it on your plastic shelves in the freezer the pan this is taking three hours you get a godless desirable trick to manage this is not worth that since I have now been informed that putting this in my freezer would burn a hole through the plastic I am actually going to leave this on my stove top and holes down into the next 10 minutes because I'm over this video and I have things to do let's finish this drink this looks awful like what this toxin not good the race here was a little wrong let's milk in it oh that is not right Oh kick to chest again okay like there okay that's good we're gonna try this with regular coconut milk instead of unsweetened coconut I don't know who what made that I figured decision it was not me I'll tell you that right now but maybe this will taste a little bit oh it's closed better let's see this now oh that's so gross just color I've ever seen this is not right it's purple that's really dark purple last step I'm going to grab these freeze-dried strawberries it's like strawberry chips can I eat this this would be the good nor fries our last tap stick this straw in there oops okay what I guess this completes our venti pink candy drinking purply purply this video is cancelled how do I get this out of here oh my god girls don't rob me good now we're gonna cut a nice thick slice that is professional look at that oh my god you guys oh it's still sister's steaming for a real one alright sisters oh my god three hours later we are finally done with our breakfast option for today I had truly thought this is going to be an easy video to film and of course I was wrong I didn't however have a very good time doing this and the pumpkin bread it looks great the pink drink not so much I think the only way to see how we actually did is with the taste test so I'm ready to dive right in and first one Oh God but just my fort and like a nice little slice of my pumpkin right here Oh we're gonna look same-sex oh my god I'm a professional Baker look at this same beautiful golden a brown color nice dark brown crust on the outside with a good pumpkin seed crunchy texture this is pretty good fresh you would never even know if I put this in front of you let's see how to actually compare as taste wise oh my god that's laughs oh my god oh my god you were good that was such a delicious and hearty piece of bread but all of this chewing has left my throat so dry I think I should maybe wash it all down with a sip of my DIY Do It Yourself that's what GI right means done thinkety thinkety that turned out purple oh it doesn't taste like strawberries at all it tastes like fashion tea lemonade but like with milk instead of lemonade which is not good I will tell you right now I think it's because we use the very very hibiscus refresher instead of the like strawberry one but there was no strawberry hace refresher to actually use if they do this on purpose so we cannot actually do this at home that's so disappointing all that work and we get this are you guys I guess this concludes me trying to make my daily Starbucks order at home from scratch let me know what you guys think this pumpkin bread recipe lochia slaps like ten out of ten would recommend you guys should definitely try this at home it's like a really really good and fresh breakfast item this pink candy drinkin tea however is not a pink tea drinker tea as a disgrace pinkie drinkin tea sweetie I am so sorry I was already suspicious going into this but all the recipes recommended the passion tea and the very very hibiscus refresher is because I'm an avid at Starbucks fanatic and neither one of those two drinks are even close to the taste of the pink drink and I was definitely right because this tastes absolutely awful although this is very very far that secretes these things at home today it took me at 3 hours I would much rather run to Starbucks and take five minutes and spend only five dollars and have a far better and faster morning time alright sisters if you guys enjoyed today's video please don't forget to give it a big thumbs

this special series on how to make bubble tea shop fruit teas from syrup in the comfort of your own home there are over a dozen popular restaurant quality grade bubble tea shop syrups on the market

other popular fruity recipe videos so let's get started first we want to get our tea brewing we need a strong face brew i recommend a medium strength loose leaf jasmine green tea if you don't have loose leaf then two or more tea bags will work fine you can experiment over time to figure out your preferred tea strength you put one tablespoon of the loose leaf tea into 175 milliliters of 70 degrees celsius water you let it sit for 7 minutes covered okay we'll just put this off to the side while this is brewing pour 21 milliliters of the orange syrup in a 500 milliliter shaker add 14 milliliters of fructose if you don't have fructose i would recommend experimenting with different types of sugars sweeteners or honey once the tea is done brewing carefully strain it into your shaker and then stir stir until combined add ice to the top of the shaker [Music] put on the middle lid and the top lid and shake well for about one minute if you don't have a shaker i would recommend doing this next step in a very large cup and stirring for about two minutes before you strain we know it's ready when there's a really nice condensation around the outside of the shaker and the majority of the ice has melted add your topping of choice to your glass today i'm using my favorite boba i've got cute little mini tapioca pearls and a really nice brown sugar solution stirring the fruit tea into

common man cocktails i'm your host airdrome ER today we're going to create the Savannah iced tea this recipe didn't come from anybody I think I found the internet yep I did because I was looking for something that had creme de cassis so to get one and a half ounces he had a ton of those words p so did I turns out i only had like two and there was one I haven't done yet because i didn't have something else that goes with it some of the crazy thing house are going to get elderflower you're a liar a little bit saint germain's that's my next purchase creme de cassis one and at it was going to be orange it's good porfa or skirt you said that was your next purchase i believe done with the video here them up we got an ounce and a half ounce of have tequila i'm not going to use gold it says gold nothing good comes out of gold we're going to do 2 tablespoons do I have something on my boat am I talking about what do you mean what am I talking about pink gold reposado it is gold color but if it was like tequila gold gold owner or o is typically a caramel color to make the two not real tequila hmm Jose I don't like to say same in the building um we're going to do just did today I just one half of the name oh ah so I got tablespoons these are tablespoons yep so the 2 tbsp two tables women's that's a crapload that's like that's like an ounce how does it say that and then we're going to fill with sprite this is our SodaStream right they don't they should have put in announces why tablespoons who needs a table with the spoon anyway we're going to build it in the cocktail glass and the Collins glass boom and we're going to fill them in a specific order because the recipe says so creme de cassis we're going to do our one and a half ounces one done Oh current will do lemon juice yeah I know don't like that word homeward current all i think is like the ocean and the current you know I the tide that comes with bring it in okay how do you have a liquor that tastes like the current it it doesn't taste like the current it's just currents it's not current its current oh it's all but hey yes and they are supposed to be poured in a specific order I'm guessing because you're going to get a specific effects out of it did you do your lemon juice yeah totally did you just do the killer he said it was a certain order I am I put them in the right order it was this lemon juice tequila and that and this is says the other way it's just the recipe but it says in the instructions said poor in order to get that effect interesting very interesting interesting almost disturbing actually you can see like it's almost like a why is it sitting like that it's got what is that that must be lemon juice it could get squished between them it's pretty interesting and then the bubbles are kind of popping up and pulling up some of those little lemon flesh pieces lemon well tequila's sprite for sure throw that in there lot of tequila it's in layers I'm just trying to get to that last layer that's tough so you're going to get tequila in sprite definitely get the tequila tasting really tasty but that's just to kill her see if I get the rest a little sour and you get your cassis it's like a it's like a layered shot whoo that's still growing the sourness you get it because the way the compact when you take that sip you're getting a pretty good dose of the lemon juice is it really a trick drink so think about it in phases you're going to be drinking this in phases you're going to start with your sprite springiness little tequila then a little more tequila you're like whoa it was potent then you bring on the sour I'm at the end you're going to get that black currant the cassis flavor so they can almost like a dark grape berry ish type thing pretty neat that's the Savannah iced tea and the presentation is right on i mean that's that's just cool so there you go i'm your host Erick show more check us out on every day drinkers dot TV it's over there we're teaching you how to

bourbon most important ingredient lemon wedge honey teaspoon and top it off with nothing I've gone ahead and preheated the glass just so it's good and hot and on the liberty of getting some hot water

we're gonna talk about how I remove skin tags now I don't know if you've ever had one or experience a skin tag somewhere on your body and if you don't know what a skin tag in it's like an extra piece of skin now protruding from your skin somewhere on your body for me they usually appear along my neck and chest area right around here in sometimes I get them like in this area now I'm gonna tell you how I've been removing them lately and it's been relatively easy because I feel like it's easy for me because I'm catching them while they're smaller now these start happening typically on people once they're in their late 20s early 30s it's when you start seeing these things develop on your skin and like I said for me I hit them early now this one method this first method that I'm going to tell you about now this one worked for me in the course of just about 48 hours and all you do is soak a cotton ball with your apple cider vinegar this is the vinegar that I use for almost everything and I literally just soak the cotton ball with the vinegar now I do have a picture of the skin tag that I'm speaking I'm going to insert that here so you see it but you just soak it make sure that it's good and soaked and then you're going to apply this to the area cuz the one that I just removed was right here and I just put a bandaid on it and go to sleep so yes I was sleep with this attached to me right here with a piece of tape or either a band-aid but you want to thoroughly soak your cotton ball you want it to be like supersaturated because what this does is allows that skin tag to get totally totally totally soaked with the vinegar and the vinegar kind of soaks into it and kills it off and wear it just like if you rub it it just literally just comes right off the skin it just comes right off and for me it only took two days and this was like a nice-sized skin tag now I could have used my second method on it but I really want to give the vinegar method a try and it worked now it did leave that little area just a little well I don't know if you can see it on camera but it's still a little red and it was a little darker in this area but my neck area is just typically darker that's just how it's always been for me but it is darker but this little area is still darker and that's from the vinegar sitting on the skin so it kind of did something weird but I can see my skin color coming back so it's nothing terribly terribly horrible when it comes to the vinegar sitting on the skin your your skin color will come back but if you're scared just put some like cocoa butter or some light skin balance and cream on it and you should be fine but for me it totally totally worked the skin tag is gone but next right to it was another one right beside it trying to grow in and this right there I'm gonna zoom in on it and I want to show you how I typically remove these smaller ones and I just used scissors guys so I know you could be squeamish and you think that this could could hurt it doesn't hurt it's like these little things really don't have any feeling if any of them at all so I never feel him when I clip them especially when there's when they're that little so I'm gonna zoom in and these scissors are totally totally clean I actually um clean these off with my 91% alcohol and I clean my handles with a Clorox wipe as well because anybody got times for you getting any kind of infection especially with me at home performing at home in home little surgeries on myself so I just go in with the scissors and as you see this is it right here and I just clip it off of me and I literally just cut them off now some people say you shouldn't do that that could cause different little skin problems but it definitely does not and there it is I literally just cut this little [ __ ] off and it's gone no more pain no skin tag and that's literally what I do you just cut them off if you catch these suckers before they get really big then there's no problem with cutting them off just cut them save yourself money from going to the dermatologist getting them lasered and Berto now even when I go over I can still feel a little spot where I clipped it but it's nothing it's totally gone and then I don't have to worry about this sucker growing into something huge and unsightly on my neck and I know you cannot see it but it's right there like literally so yeah so don't be afraid to clip them just clip them or use the apple cider vinegar if you have the 48 to 72 hours to wait on this to work with this jaffna it does work saturate the cotton ball with the vinegar sleep with it overnight just allow it to do its thing just rub it in every day and that sucker will come right off but yeah that is how I remove skin tags let me know if you like this video give this video a big thumbs up if you think it's just totally suck and you think I'm stupid for cutting them off leave that down below but I'm still gonna cut them skin tags all my guys I'll see you at my next one", "w2FPUxHrUyU": "hey guys this is Fabiana from high snob ID and this is our guide to dyeing your sneakers before you start customizing your sneakers you're gonna need the following an apron or old clothes you don't mind getting dirty rubber gloves something to mix with liquid dish soap a waterproof container access to water dye and pay special attention to the type as it varies depending on the materials you're dyeing dye fixative and of course a pair of sneakers prepare your sneakers by taking the laces and insoles out make sure anything you need is within reach because once you get started you're gonna want everything to go as smooth as possible before you set up your container with the dye make sure your kicks are wet to maximize dye absorption you can do this by running them under a tap or submerging them in cold water next heat water to just below boiling and pour it into one of your containers the water needs to stay hot throughout the process if the water from your faucet isn't so hot you might want to add some boiling water from a kettle now you're ready to prepare the diet add a teaspoon of liquid dish soap to the water so the dye spreads and mixes more evenly then pour in about half the dye and mix well add more if you want a deeper color for reference I'm using half of a seven ounce bottle of dye once they're wet place your shoes sole up in the container with the dye you can submerge the sneakers anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour depending on how rich you want the color to be I usually put mine in for about 45 minutes prepare the second container with a dive fixative add hot water and mix in the solution usually four tablespoons for three gallons of water transfer the shoes to the dye fixative solution stirring occasionally after 20 minutes remove your sneakers and rinse them under cold water until the water is clear once fully rinse wash your cakes in warm water with a mild clothing detergent finally leave the sinkers

Channel today I'm going to show you how to H paper using tea so how to turn this into this here is what you need select your paper and print all right on it before you age it you will also need two black tea bags boiling water ball and a baking sheet so bare with me I'm gonna show you the steps so first couple your piece of paper into a ball like this and then you smooth it flat again and place it on top of a baking sheet like so second step place two black tea bags in in a small bowl like this so make sure the teabags are not too hot before using them I'm gonna pour slowly the tea directly onto the paper like so and apply the tea with one of the tea bags like so as I already said make sure the tea bag is not too hot before using and brush it over paper so allow to sit and soak for at least five to 10 minutes and pre-heat your oven to the lowest sitting approximately 200 degrees before we put it in the oven just remove the extra liquid like so and we're gonna bake it for three to five minutes so this is the final result after baking it for three to four minutes you have to take it out when the paper start to curve so you see it really cute it looks antique vintage you can use it for an invitation for a letter and wrap it like so as you can see it's very original it's very cute and that's it thank you so much for watching don't forget to subscribe under fixit's Amal and I

had this many when I was pulling them together to make this video so let's just talk about like there are watering requirements first let's think about like what kind of plants they are and they're plants that don't need a lot of water thankfully because the reason I think I have so many of them is because I water when I water and that I've ended up with plants that just do better when I'm not like constantly on top of them because I can't be and I think a lot of us can't be constantly paying attention to our plants we like to look at them but it's not often we have the time to devote 100% to taking care of plants so anyway so Jersey knows like this is a think this is a moon light and beautiful beautiful structural plant its a cane right because these stems are called canes but what I like to do is I generally will water it when it's completely dry and the foliage will start talking to you and telling you that it's time to water them and I like to water them if you can and you could try if you know seeing that the Leafs like the tips of the leaves are turning brown like this guy see his leaves are brown or Hurley's or brown or its leaves are brown because it's been in this pot for a long time and i haven't like leached the soil which means getting rid of like salt buildup and mineral build-up because that's what happens when you use water that has high salts and minerals so you should maybe test your tap water and if you discover you have these minerals in your water you should think about using like distilled water or filtered water because this will happen unfortunately but you're gonna find with most of your juris Anna's over time they are going to have brown tips and that's kind of just a part of a jersey in his life like I like to look at them like a Monet painting from a distance because they look better and that's how I treat my Dracena so anyway so when you want to water them what are them all the way through and this actually is gonna tell you a lot about the soil you're addressing is in if your soil is too porous that means that the water is just pouring right through when you're actually watering your plant it's probably not gonna retain enough moisture in the soil to keep your plants happy so if you're finding that you're watering your dracaena a lot like like every couple of days you should think about maybe changing your soil out or adding some more peat moss or more coco coir because it's gonna help absorb and keep the water near the roots where they need to be that's where the plant absorbs the moisture and nutrients so what are your plants when they are bone dry and and or your foliage starts to droop and drop like I said this one is pretty okay I think I just watered a bunch of these so I don't know if having an example of a really dry one this is pretty dry this is a Kiwi Christina marginata and the these are called tips because you don't see the cane the eart is basically propagated tips put into soil so it looks like a big Bush so that's what this guy is and then like I said this this is considered a cane a Dracaena cane this is a marginata I think the magenta and so you can really see the structure so they fulfill two different styling needs like if you need a big massive foliage like this beautiful strips and strap so foliage someplace this is great if you're looking for vertical elements the margin otters are very good because they will grow tall like this guy behind me that's tall and it's a beautiful element just on its own I moved it up here to show you guys actually my husband moved it up here for me this Janet Craig that yeah these guys are just so fabulous because they just do so well no foliage in their green um but anyway this has brown tips and this could either be from under watering which sometimes I do or from high salts and minerals so just watch out for that and if you don't like it you can cut them off but use definitely use scissors that are what do you call it when you disinfect you disinfect them you don't want to spread any potential diseases or bacteria bacteria is bad because bacteria is really hard to get rid of so definitely disinfect your tools so let's talk about leaching your soil so if you note if you notice that your plants are starting to get like yellow spots and brown tips like way too often and too prolific take your plant take it under the sink or in the sink and under the faucet and just run slowly run water through the soil and what that'll do it'll help flush out any of the salt build-up and the mineral build-up and once you've done that let the plant rest a day or two and then fertilize it again these guys don't love to be fertilized so so much so I would just put like a worm casting or some sort of organic fertilizer on the top and top dress it and and then maybe do that twice a year twice a year do it in the spring and you can do it again nimi in the summer but you maybe only have to do it once just kind of over fertilization as a bad thing for Justina so if you're gonna do it do it less than more the other thing you can do is use a a complete liquid fertilizer every two weeks during the growing season and then slow down in the fall and then stop in the winter because these guys don't put out a lot of growth during the during the colder months so just gonna watch it because this is a new leaf but this was in a really warm spot with a lot of humidity so it's fooled it doesn't know it's winter so your growing season is going to depend pretty much on where you live if you live in the tropics or you know anything higher than like zone 8 and so zone 9 your plants are probably gonna continue to grow they're not really going to grow to go dormant so if they're growing you'll definitely want to feed your plants so just keep an eye on them and your plants will give use cues and signals as to whether or not they want food but just take it easy with their fertilization the temperature for you're seeing is they like it between like sixty and eighty degrees so pretty much whatever you keep your house at they're gonna be pretty fine in those temperatures and they can tolerate lower temps I wouldn't go lower than fifty I really wouldn't for any of these tropical plants because they're going to suffer and you don't want to do that so and you can go hotter if you want to but you're gonna be watering your plants like all the time so just keep it between like sixty and eighty even 1675 it's good for these guys they don't love cold drafts like super super cold but they can handle colder weather does that make any sense I hope these guys you know these are you know are a little little sensitive to dry air then you know they definitely tolerate it more than other plants because I've had these guys pretty much in every corner of my house and they don't seem to really care if the air is like thirty percent humidity or less but if you're concerned about it you know like I said I mean in many videos you should think about investing in a humidifier and you know you can miss the leaves in the morning I don't like misting leaves because I really feel like it introduces bacteria and fungus if you do it too often and you do it at night but you can do it it's okay there's two different schools of on that but I like this I like misting cuz I like the way it feels but I try to back off on certain plants but your Cena's can handle it just make sure that they're they're able to dry out throughout the day so they don't sit at night with wet wetness on their leaves and get bacteria it's completely normal for Justyna this is a marginata I think this is another magenta it looks just like that so I think it is these are actually just these are three or four or five plants in here I had these on my front porch and they were like this big and now they're this big so they're definitely growing this winter and they grow a lot this summer on the porch but it's very normal excuse me it's very normal for interestingness to lose lower leaves because they are pushing out new growth on the top and don't be concerned if you're pulling these off throughout your plant care sessions because that's gonna happen especially on the lower parts like this there's quite a lot I think I'll let this dry out too much - seems to be a reoccurring theme but yeah so basically don't worry as long as this looks lovely and full and healthy don't worry about this because over time you know you're gonna see the Canes their canes are gonna become visible and that's gonna become a structural element of your plant so don't worry about the loss leaves if you're Lee you start falling off from the top that's a concern because I would look very closely at what's going on with your plant because sometimes they're susceptible to mealy bugs and tooth rips and thrips are very hard to see but the mealy bugs are kind of easy to see because they're white so you just gotta get in there and look and if you see anything fuzzy and white you need to treat it and you need to kind of run it under cold water you need to spray neem oil you need to use horticultural oil or insecticidal soap things like that just get rid of those buggers because they're gonna they're gonna decimate your plant and that's uh that's a sign of kind of leaf loss on top that you probably have an insect or some sort of root problem because you've been over watering so just look around another thing I suggest that you guys do is clean the leaves here's an example because I didn't clean these leaves on this another Janet Craig they need to produce energy so all you really have to do is take some room-temperature water and just clean them with a rag and I would definitely not use leaf shine on any of your plants because it just pours a clog look a clog clog yeah it clogs the stomata which are the pores of the leaves and it just becomes you know it's just harder and harder for the plant to breathe and in transpire and all those things that it needs to do to be healthy so clean the leaves as often as you can and when you remember because your plants going to like you for that it will it'll thank you by growing faster so the light requirements for a Dracaena or bright indirect light and the brighter indirect light you can give them the better they're going to be they're going to absolutely grow faster they're gonna be healthier bushier they're gonna lose less leaves but you might need to be watering them more often if you're putting them in a brighter light area and especially if it's warm but they do want bright light you can put certain Jerseyans in lower light like the fragrance but you know if you don't have to don't but if you want a plant in a room that has no windows and you you're you know able to leave a light on it'll probably do okay but just in general most of these plants want kind of indirect light bright and direct light as a general rule so how do you propagate these guys right there's a couple ways you can do it and probably the best way is to just kind of cut depends right and I've done this before and I've probably gonna show you some b-roll I hacked a Dracaena I had to propagate it and so you can just cut it you know kind of wherever you want the new growth to start because you can if you say for some reason you thought this was getting too big let's imagine this is a giant tree and you just it was too tall for your house you can cut it anywhere along the stem and that will it'll facilitate growth where you cut it and then you can propagate the tips you can put it in soil and keep the soil moist for you know a couple of weeks and just watch it and let those roots grow give it a lot of light give it a lot of warmth that really really helps when propagating intersteno and the other thing I didn't think this was possible but I just tried it as an experiment I put some leaves of this lemon-lime dracaena in water and to my surprise to my surprise it started growing roots which I can't believe I don't know if it is if this is gonna grow into an actual dracaena plant but I'm gonna try it and look I have one - nothing nothing okay so out of maybe 12 leaves that I try to propagate to actually rooted so these are gonna go in soil and I'm gonna see if I can grow some Christina I don't think so I don't think it's gonna happen but you never know I think nature is really amazing so I don't know if that's about it with Dracena I just really wanted to kind of save you how easy they are to grow how beautiful they are how important they are for me in my design because of the ease that I can take care of them they don't require a lot of attention they don't need to be constantly watered and they do need higher light levels than some of your lower light plants and if you have some problems with them just think about the watering if you have too many minerals in your water and also if the soil is draining properly so that's kind of it I would just think about like if you are getting into plants and you are not that sure that you have like a green thumb yet which I know you do you just have to find your inner great green thumb and let it come out but think about getting dressed in is because they're absolutely stunning plants and they serve a lot of purposes for me especially in design anyway that is it for my Dracena care video I hope you learned a little bit more about Justina than you knew or if you knew nothing I hope you something now that's that's it you guys have a great weekend what is today it's Friday Wow have an amazing weekend and I'll see you guys next week okay take care bye bye I have no idea what day it is ever like ever", "V7086myu8sM": "okay quick hands quick hands quick hands\nquick hands quick

welcome back to my channel so right now if you are just raw and all up in my face I couldn't just putting it all out there but it's cool cuz I never scared cuz today we're going to be talking about the most question this has to be like the most plagued question I guess that's just out there in the beauty community and you guys have asked me for tips Ellen and that is large pores just anything regarding large pores how to hide them why who what where and when okay basically so if you don't know what pores our pores are basically like a minut opening in the skin that let's think of it as a gateway it lets things in okay when pores are inflamed that is what makes them appear more larger they're full they're junky think of it like a trash can trash cans got junk in it trash can needs to be empty try and cants in trash can what it's not full is it pores are dirt and impurities keep your hands off your face your hands are dirty they pick up germs you shake hands people you touch doors money you could not be putting like it couldn't be worse for your skin than putting your dirty hands you know all that dirt impurities back on your face the Clarisonic device if my holy grail for poor it's like when I feel like my pores it's just not man she acted up she acted up I go for my Clarisonic and seriously it clears it right up I really like to concentrate that in that area if you guys don't know what a Clarisonic is this is a deep cleanser I have zero experience with the other versions of the Clarisonic that are out there on the market right now I can only talk about what I've used personally and I live swear and died by the Clarisonic it just gets your skin squeaky clean without without stripping it and that's what I really really love for all of you guys that are looking for something more quick cost-effective and you can get in your kitchen cabinet are lemons the enzymes and lemons are known to tighten the skin and tighten the pores and I used to do lemon masks a couple years ago where I would just rub the limit on my skin and leave it on for about 20 minutes since time so let's sleep with a mask on and then wash it off and it just you know just sucks it's like a mini mini mini mini facelift just you have to make sure because lemon is so citrusy make sure you keep it away from the eyes and if you have sensitive skin you guys when you guys watch my skincare videos you're like that's not a terrible okay not everybody has sensitive skin I don't have sensitive skin so these are techniques that work for me if you have sensitive skin please please please if you're even interested in dabbling with this if you're willing to take that risk at your own risk you have to have to test the skin first another tip a little bit more on the safer side if your skin is sensitive is using an ice cube if you run an ice cube on the skin for about 1530 seconds just like with a cold water rinse on the hair tightens the pores and closes those pores in the hair cuticle otherwise known as cuticle in the hair it's the same effect on the skin it tightens the skin it froms the skin it just instantly sucks it in how you apply your products means mountains with pores okay when you have large pores we're not swiping okay you have to use a primer you have to have to have to use the primer think of your pores as a valley okay pretending like as a valley that needs to be filled okay we're going to fill it like spackle so you have to use a primer there's no questions asked think of the primer as that barrier that's gonna make sure your foundation is flat on flat surface okay so it's not settling in now my primers of choice I prefer primers that are more moosie buttery that's silicone texture one of my favorites in particular specifically for pores is actually the pore fessional from benefit this gets the job done a little bit goes a long way when you feel it and texture it just feels like it just feels like a mousse you know what I mean it's not like a liquid I'm gonna show you this side of my face because the pores on this side of my face are teensy bit bigger and I have the primer in my hand very small amount okay now watch me put in work I am stippling that into my skin we're filling those holes this is everything this is the quickest if you don't have a limit if you don't have ice if you down the Clarisonic this is your quick fix and you don't have to use the professional if you have another primer that really really works to fill pores use it you don't have to use exactly what I use I'm showing you the technique of how I'm doing this all I'm doing is patting that in it may not completely diminish the pores but I guarantee you once you pop that foundation on you will not see pores you will not see pores look at how much of a huge difference that was okay guys so those are my tips on how you can minimize enlarged pores let's just do a quick recap first tip is always always always keep your hands clean and off the face no more dirt in the morning parities to treat the pores by using a deep cleansing device such as the Clarisonic or any other electronic device that you love using for deep cleansing you can use an ice cube or the limit method to help tighten those already enlarged pores and three when you are in the applying makeup stage and you still have those pores you're still trying to deal with them you're figuring out trying to hide them always always always use a primer always dab that primer in to the porous to fill them and smooth them out and just make sure that you don't smear or smudge or do anything of that nature one tip that I wanted to include that I forgot to mention earlier highlighters depending on where the pores are on the parts of the face usually for me I typically get them here so the highlighter that I use and that is any type of like powders shimmer product you really want to be careful with those because those can sometimes highlight of course that's their job is to highlight those areas of the face so if you are dealing with enlarged pores you might want to stick consider staying away from them or applying them in a part of the face where you don't deal with as many pores or stick to matte highlighters so those are pretty much the tips that I have on how to minimize and cover enlarged pores if you guys have any questions please let me know in the comments down below thank you guys so much for watching today's video and give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it of course I will see you at the next video bye", "NclJQpQs14M": "today I'm going to show how to dye some regular 80 GSM printer paper to give it this nice tea dyed vintage look which looks fantastic in a book in a drug I have some tea leaves and you could use tea bags as well I've just used what I had in the puppet and I've used three spoonfuls next add some boiling water and let that infuse for a good 5 or 10 minutes I've left my tea set for about seven minutes so it's had a chance to go nice and dark and now I'm just going to strain out the tea leaves your strainer and inside of that I'm just going to put a little piece of muslin that I have doubled over and that will catch all the really fine little bits if you haven't seen Muslim before it's kind of a a really fine woven fabric and it's used in cooking a lot so if you go to your material store and ask some muslin this is what you'll be able to get now these tea leaves are not wasted I have used them about three or four times and I'm still getting I still can get some really good results okay so pull that into a dish that can fit the size paper that you're using it doesn't have to be very deep then take a piece of patterned paper and slide it in and press it down give it a few few taps because it is easy to get air bubbles under this and where there is an air bubble it's not going to die the paper so you're going to end up with some little little white blotches in there how long you leave it depends on how dark you'd like it I'll leave it for a couple of minutes to get to get this really dark really dark look but I have left it you know probably about a minute maybe two two minutes for the light probably up to about three minutes of the dark now my paper has gone nicely brown I'm just going to take it out and give it a bit of a drip drive and then put it on some kitchen towel and I'm just going to blot off the excess now you could just let this naturally dry like this or you could dry it partially with a heat gun I also give my pages sort of a bit of a wrinkle so that they're not so flat and I have about twenty four pieces here and twenty four pieces of printer paper when it's when it's really flat it's not very big but this actually ends up being quite a good inside for a book without having to have a million pages inside of it so if you just go ahead and wrinkle this now it'll give quite a the the wrinkles won't look as good they'll get sort of moisture in them and they can tear very easily so I normally give it just a little bit of a dry with my heat gun first just to take some of the moisture out and then I give it a scratch so just a light scratch and then lay that on a flat surface to dry I often find that once I find a whole heap I normally stack them all up and then pop them under my big heavy wooden chopping board and that will flatten them out a little bit and and make them a little bit a little bit more uniform so for when you are putting them in a book", "BEph2Obm4lI": "money interest accrues forgotten Madame green tea capital NH Cunha green Tiki koalas Navi cuckoo

alchemy natural products and in this video I'm going to show you how to make a natural remedy for saggy stomach skin so a lot of us have saggy stomach skin whether it be from having a couple babies or maybe from losing weight too quickly so we want something that's going to help tighten and firm that area and now I'm going to show you just a real simple way to make a really neat mask that's going to help to tighten and firm saggy stomach skins so what you're going to start off with is some witch hazel extract you're also going to need some coffee then some vegetable oil and this one I'm using avocado oil but you can really use anything that you want any kind of moisturizing oil then you're also going to need some green or black tea I prefer black tea it usually works a little bit better for helping to tighten and firm and then also some clay in this case I'm using red Moroccan clay which is a really great detoxifying and strengthening and tightening type clay you can use any other clay though you choose if you wanted to use bentonite that's a nice one or any other Kaling clay so what you'll start off with is a cup of your clay so you're going to start by pouring in your clay this is about a cup here after that you're going to add a quarter cup of your black or green tea and this has been measured out just pour it all in then you're going to do 1 teaspoon of your vegetable oil this is a great way to moisturize the skin because you want to moisturize the area that's also going to help it tighten and firm and then one teaspoon of your coffee now the tea and the coffee that we're adding we're adding that specifically because the tea and coffee has tannins and caffeine in there and the tannins in caffeine are what's going to help tighten and tone and firm that saggy stomach skin they work by shrinking the cell structure and with witch hazel extract that's also a natural astringent and I'm going to be putting in 1 teaspoon of my witch hazel extract in there too so once you're done adding your greediest you're just going to mix it all together and you're going to keep mixing until the clay is all hydrated together and it's going to firm into kind of like a pasty peanut buttery type of ball if it's a little thick if you need a little bit more you could always add a little bit more of your coffee or your tea go ahead a that left you can always add a little bit of water too depending on your clay it will change the way that it swells and firms up some clays swell up quite a bit with just a little bit of liquid and some won't need too much at all I'm just going to add a little bit more just so I can get the kind of consistency so depending on the clay you're using you're going to want to keep mixing it until it's this nice type of peanut buttery type of consistency here so you can see there it's almost like mixing clay so once you're done mixing all your ingredients together and you end up with this peanut butter type of consistency you can apply it to your stomach area once or twice a day in a thin layer let it dry for about 15-20 minutes and then rinse the more often you apply it and a longer you apply it for the more it's going to have its chance to tighten and firm your saggy stomach skin and that's how you make a natural remedy for saggy stomach skin you"}
