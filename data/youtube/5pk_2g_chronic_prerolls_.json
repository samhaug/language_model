{"mdqV728E-ug": "[Music] what's up pop peeps in sugar I'll pop mine for 20 and we are back for another product review video before we get started popping so let's do our little thing that we call SML we need you to subscribe and while you're there I need you to hit that notification bell and also just like me because I'm pop mom and you guys already love me anyway so make sure you're going in that love but Ananya to guys today I know have been one like a total hiatus but maybe about a week or two now just because of the holiday break so I appreciate you guys hanging in there making sure you go to my videos as soon as they drop on leave Wednesdays I appreciate it I came back with something bigger this week guys I have Peck woods not to be confused with back woods this is tactless this is packwood's dot la is out of Los Angeles and I am so excited so be the proud owner of three of them I have all three pack words from LA they're now at planted 13 so you can get packwood's in nevada now at planted 13 so shout out to shot planted 13 that always hook me up with the latest that comes out I got all of these and Nevada from them they have an exclusive one called alien og so I'm excited I have all three so what I want to do today is just do a simple product review with you guys I will include all the links to Packwood's la comm so you guys can go in a site find out with new strands that they're coming up with but I'm just excited about the company so what they have done is infused rolling papers that look like blood papers and they're not they're a handmade hemp wrap paper that they put a vein into it to make it look like it was like an actual plant wrapper this guy's is special because they did three different infuse menteur this they have a concentrate in it they have a premium flower and then on outside they dust it with Keith so I don't even know how strong this is gonna be I don't I don't know how many puffs I'm gonna be able to get all I know is I'm gonna be a little out so I don't want you to judge me but we're gonna get into this I have three brands here this one is the alien OG hopefully you can see that this one is exclusive to Planet 13 once again shout out to them they are sold out maybe out of this one you guys have to call them and see this one is called GABA and this is a hybrid so is the alien og so both of these are hyper some remember hybrids want to keep you nice in the middle that way you can feel the head body high but not too high now this one the purple one is called purple punch and this one is an indica so today I'm not going to smoke Invicta I'm also not gonna smoke this particular hybrid Agathe I'm gonna go for the alien og because I am an alien and I want to get a shot off the plane 213 because this one was exclusive you might not see this one on the market I'm not sure so I wanted to kind of give my review to them as well what I thought of the one they made just for planting 13 customers so we're gonna get into this I'm gonna remove these two to the side so first of all I'm going to just talk about the packaging because you my peeps know when I do a product review I go there I go all the way there first of all I love that this can't break I do know they're going for $60 at the shop so they have $60 here in Nevada we can look up and see what they're going for Vegas but this is $60 so for $60 to Graham would concentrate premium flower and they keep one outside that does an amazing deal and I love that you can't break anything so you don't have to silver fragile because I mean your product is fragile but I love the date took the time to kind of like really design it where it's eye-catching as well and even if you see it inside of this place like it's playing 13 they have done the displays so beautifully so shout out to the pack was marketing team in LA y'all did that it also kind of reminds me in a weird way of a Kylie lipstick if y'all agree with me pop peeps just tell me that in the comment it really does it has that whole trippin thing on the side so this is really a good packaging I I'm impressed with packaging didn't even think that so you just roll it off it's a roll and I hope my camera can get to this so let me come up I want you guys to really see that when you first pull it out and you can really smell it the scent on this is I just love the smell okay so if you can see them holding my hand up you can see the key fits nicely dusted on it outside this part of it is a glass tip so it's gonna allow you to like kind of burn it evenly so you get a nice draw every time you pull that's what the glass tip is supposed to doing this is a nice sized glass citize I would say that's a couple of inches I don't know if you can see that real close up but that's like a two inch glass that's really nice to me it feels like if you had a mini cigar in a way so I kind of I love the feel of it it's nothing to it but to do it we're gonna get into it anything I like that's a blunt or the palm rolls or anything like that I like to light mines with the hemp I know this is a little piece of this is hemp rope I like to light it with that that way it gives me some type of control instead of letting my lighter control everything so that's how I'm gonna do it so choose the you pot peeps shot the Packwood's LA and let's get this alien og from shot planted 13 let's I like to inhale just to make sure I'm pulling everything I must say lighting getting I thought the pool would be happy they go be a lot heavier and it's not it's really smooth and I guess it has something to do with the glass tip now I can tell if you can tell I lit it wrong in here but it should have a nice even lip and because that keep us on the outside it shouldn't burn through fast that's what it shouldn't do if you find yourself in you lit it the wrong way just let it take its time and let they kind of like let it breathe and it'll evenly start to burn around so what I like is that you don't have to put the whole piece in your mouth it burns real light you can just put your mouth right on a tip just like my shirt be on the lookout for shop pop mom for 20 years oh I got that weed weird I like this a little dude not sure what premium flower I do know that the concentrate is nice and to keep this not even coming off on my hand I love that so let's talk a little more in depth about this back once I got my smoking hat on you know I've seen Rick Ross smoked this I've seen you waka flocka the baby little baby what's that other baby skittles baby I don't know one of them other babies they've all had this and now I'm hot moms at it I gotta do this I need a friend shout out to any of my papi friends that want to come share cuz I don't know if I'm gonna finish this this is this is a lot I might have this for the next couple days it's two grounds one person should have to finish this off seriously what did you say when you hi you just don't know what to say I guess you say that [ __ ] was good huh no I hate that y'all see me like this cuz I'm gonna be rolling I don't even know me get anything else doing this is too much this is probably not the best product reveiw to have done I'm super afraid of my life right now but this is nice you know what this would be great for like people that are having bachelor parties or bachelorette parties New Year's Christmas you can get them the people if you live in a legal state oh I can't move to this come to the East Coast Jesus [Music] Oh also Packwood's shout-out to y'all have made a collaboration with cocoanuts which some of the celebrities have teamed up to make these into like chocolate edibles kind of thing so check out backwoods la calm because they got a lot of interesting collaborations like they did a collaboration with planted 13 they're doing it with celebrities so shout out to them definitely gonna go to pack once when I go to LA cuz this is pretty cool in the light so stoned and how many puffs that I take I don't even know if somebody keep it count I wish somebody was here to play this is what they do to me pop beats they just leave me in a room with filming and just tell me to go for my own okay I'm really high seriously you don't think it too high he's just like alright I'm over it I'm like hi okay I think I hit this at least maybe 10 times which is extreme okay this is my review of a Little J first of all I'm high I'm really high and I just don't even know this hormone right now seriously I don't even I don't even know what to say I mean for once I am truly I think it's strong I for what a high grade us I feel like my body is just like somebody else came and took off really nice somebody named Adele a no Gina so somebody can come take over your body if you did a little G because I don't feel I don't know oh I probably wish I had a friend this year went that way I can have somebody to give me feedback and I know Papeete y'all wish to do that but you're not here right right here matter of fact you try it exactly it's like a calming effect but you just feel like hmm maybe I should take it slow like I feel like I can do things but I should probably take it slow I feel like if you were sharing with this this was someone you don't have to worry about them soggy enough to tip its glass so it's really like one stay sturdy you're not sometimes you you roll a blunt and then they get all saggy at the tip of it and you gotta pull it back together they've already solved that issue so this is a great cheerful I would suggest you buy it this holiday season share it with your friends you can put it out as you see I'm probably one hit just another day so this is definitely a two day if you buy yourself this is a two day situation it's no way this is no way it's just no way like I'm cool put old day I feel great about this situation would I buy it hell yeah yeah I like the alien og I do I really do and this key thing is fascinating it really is because it's not like coming off on my hands or anything Frank it don't come on that's just like amazing oh my burn my nose oh [ __ ] I feel cool this out oh I'd say that like I got a young Stoli if I put it alright guys here's my Beulah spec would if I had to give five stars I would definitely get them five pot leaves on these these is they they're the way you hold them they strung in your hand they burn slowly not burning fast I've been at this for about an hour or so 35 minutes it's a good burn if you were smoking a regular blunt you're [ __ ] we've been done so backwards y'all got pop moms 5 leaves I'm gonna try

some uh you made it to the end of the year you deserve this today we are going to be showcasing a hundred and fifty dollar joint this is a joint ladies and gentlemen this insane glass grenade is actually holding an 8 gram joint yeah what napalm's original grenade pre-roll seven grams of their premium gelato cannabis so you get a quarter all ready to start with yep then they add a gram of their live resin diamonds that concentrate component that extra like punch to it and then if that wasn't enough they wrap it in lift tickets yup lift tickets i love is an infused rolling paper we've seen them around since like the pre-legalization medical days so it was super fun to see that that was the paper that this was used for and we need to give a big shout out to mj one of our favorite delivery services here in los angeles we were able to get this luxury pre-roll hand-delivered to us so we didn't even have to go out and visit a shop during the pandemic yeah all right so let's get into the actual pre-roll itself oh i love it how insane is that yeah it just comes right out of the grenade i kept pulling this pin thinking that it came out but like not what you would think it's just the tag oh here we go pull it out and i love that the crutch itself is glass to make sure that it burns evenly honestly it looks and feels like a cigar it really does this is eight grams this is heft especially with this glass tip on the end of it this is impressive ganja marks groucho mars there we go that's what we're going for this is just a normal like standard run of the mill you can see

and foremost please wash your hands before handling any material to avoid contamination place your vibration table stabilization mat on the surface you will be working off place the vibration table on the stabilization map plug the extension cord into the wall outlet plug the vibration table into the extension cord place the cone filling machine on top of the vibration table set the cone riser aside for now load your cone filling machine with empty cones [Music] grab the material that you will be filling your cones with today we are using menthol meadow an herbal smoking blend from herbal spirits use the switch on the extension cable to turn the vibration table on once your vibration table has turned on begin filling the machine with your material the vibration action of the machine will shake your material into the cones use the included cone packing tool to pack the cones while the vibration table is off continue filling the Machine and packing until the cones are full once the cones are full turn the vibration table off using the switch on the extension cord place the cone filling machine with the cone riser underneath it on a flat surface rotate the cone filling machines while lightly applying downward pressure on the riser the machine will eventually slide down on top of the riser while simultaneously lifting the filled cones remove each cone from the machine fold and twist the end to finish [Music] congratulations you have just used a cone filling machine to make a lot of pre rolls in a short period of time [Music]", "zToo8UbssTo": "hey guys it's uh alberta cannabis unboxed here and today i got something a little different um today i actually don't have but i have a a ten pack of pre-rolls um i thought i'd make a video about this just because uh they've been really popular here um always selling out at like every store and even online from the aglc um so we'll see um kind of what's on boxes and see what's going on inside um yeah and i'm trying to do this video in one take so uh we'll see how that goes nice so um they come in a little baggie like this with a box little box inside you might be familiar with those opening these little bags used in a lot of other products um sixteen point four two percent thc package may eighth and uh yeah from ready can called the reddies and it's going to be the outlaw one other sativa strains so yeah let's get this open they have all the hairways needed so the knife does not need to make a showing today after you get that open get this little pack inside and uh yeah definitely almost it pretty much looks like it's way too small to be ten pre-rolls in there and um you might recognize them they didn't always come in a bag they used to come in little boxes like this yeah so um here are the pre-rolls and we'll get these guys open almost like a little mini cigarette box even sealed like them so yeah these payrolls are apparently 100 machine rolled which they must because they're so thin and they use cigarette papers as you can see uh they're quite uh quite long filter makes up for i would say almost like more than 25 percent of the whole joint and then flower would be pretty much everything in the white and maybe a little beyond um but yeah i'm not gonna smoke it right away instead um i'm actually gonna weigh it i was always curious because they say that there's actually this package has three and a half grams i have always wondered if that included like the whole thing or with like the bud and the filter or was it just the butt so let's give this away and see what it comes in at so of course this is not the most accurate scale but hopefully it'll be close enough okay so oh my gosh the joint itself weighs 0.6 um grams so if there were 10 of them it'd be 6 grams total so it must uh it must not include the filter then so um how we'll find out is uh we will actually bust it open i'll empty out the bud into a little container and then we'll see how much it weighs okay so i've decided instead using a container i'm just going to dump all the bud onto the tray since it's not that much to begin with so yeah wait till it's zeroed out and i'll cut it open and dump it there and uh we should have already gotten a good look at what it looks like on the inside i'm gonna get clean cut there we go this is not the most accurate scale and also that's probably not the most accurate way to do it but i'm just so curious to see what actually weighs like in these little pre-rolls of course i told you it does go down beyond the black part just a little bit but we'll get every last bit out just for the weighing to make it nice and fair i think this piece was from there too actually no it wasn't okay anyways you know not the most accurate so take it with a grain of salt is what i'm saying and dang right hand pretty good it's 0.36 like right they're actually exactly 0.35 gram joints wow i'm really surprised actually my scale is shifting around to show people how not accurate it is but anyways you get the point it's uh pretty close not bad pretty good ready can we uh store this somewhere i actually wanted to give this a squeeze just so people can see it's actually i don't know you can determine for yourself what it means but when you squeeze a butt can almost like clump it together so i don't know not bad not too powdery actually the grind is actually a lot more coarse than what i've seen in a lot of pre-rolls like so in some pre-rolls it actually looks like powder almost especially some of those huge one gram pre-rolls but these are the grinds actually quite coarse i'm surprised", "oZVF2vsOWJU": "[Music] what's that wavy [ __ ] trippy we got a special guest with us Jason a shout-out my boy Jason for coming through for today's video but today's video we're gonna

so stay tuned see if it gets night gang [Music] keep down please smoke everywhere we go [Music] let's go baby fam we got the joint lit as you can see it is ripping you guys you guys see the cherry on that thing I think it's back what you guys think about it yes I really like the tip that it has on it it's like I never seen a tip like that before but I'm really liking it because it keeps all the Scooby Snacks we're coming in your mouth and we also noticed that you don't have to get a hella hard like I thought that you had to be like you know how like when you roll hella fat you've got to hit it hard know that one you can hit it regular like a regular joint and it's hitting really good yeah I'm hitting it way too hard it is pretty heavy you guys there's hella [ __ ] weed in there I mean what the weed included but the tip is pretty heavy left away the tip itself see how much it that's some Gaston I didn't even know there was constant rain there either I just see like the celebrity spike scenes and I was like in aware how much to smoke on what should be cat he was saying that bringing a joint like this is like bringing like a bottle oh yeah like okay it's like usually when you go see like a family friend or just somebody like that's important to you bring him like a like a cake or a bottle you know something for like this nice gift big Oh join make sure if you have it comes to your size I mean if you ever go see your friends you pull up with one of these and yeah and if you live in a set you better keep its rental in your pocket in case you're looking up saw yeah it's kind of running a little bit late yeah that's the only thing that I'm trying to figure out how would you stop that or just [ __ ] probably start lighting the other side once I feel like you need to have like [ __ ] yeah look we did it work to catch it up old fashioned hello saliva you know stop the look going out right hopefully that works let me know what you guys do to stop your plants from running put it on but so far what do you guys what do you think I'm highest luck gets high in here it's boxy to be honest with you I'm gonna give mine to pee I'm not gonna if I go it's its exhibits joint the [ __ ] flavor is could be more flavor II like I've been smoking some SF cultivators wedding pie $61 out the door testing at 31% that [ __ ] is way better way better than this but I mean I don't know maybe maybe I maybe it's the concentrates too though I'm just doing a little bit of flavor yeah I mean honestly I'm gonna keep it really guys I feel like it's not hitting like a hundred percent it could be I think if you roll do be better but yeah you know I don't like the fact that it's running so bad I think that's like my main problem with it and yeah I feel like I'm wasting away I'm so high that I'm just like [ __ ] you know but it's like if I were to rolled it I'd be more pissed because it's like damn you exhibit homies these are hand rolled them I see them making them I'm pretty sure I have no idea what is each test bet just a big flex guys we're smoking a [ __ ] $184 joint what let me know if there's things that you guys feel like it's just for the foot I feel like designer is just for the Flex you know I know bass quality to this testing at 27 percent by the way pretty high 27 percent concentrate don't see any wax running or anything like that either so I'm not really sure where the concentrate is in the joint I mean it is like white ash though all the way yeah it definitely does the job oh yeah let's play baseball you know what I was thinking is that like it's a big guys joint you want it to last you how long Lee I don't know I didn't set a timer but it's feel like I'm going kind of fast yeah yeah you right sure it's eight I mean there's still no cuz it's hella fat but it's like you think you'll be just custom ah don't underestimate you guys and then I just want to remind you guys to go cup some lady where a wave emerged a very explosive second exclusive that we got the sweats on Ted I got them on today real one make sure you guys go cop it going real quick thank you guys for supporting us shout out the whole way and we appreciate you guys for getting us here we got bigger things coming you guys oh my god looks like gonna burn your lips I know follow me let me like the other side back because I really like easy burn me I have bad luck burning myself with it I bet you as the video when it started it was not that smoky and now it's like the only thing I don't like okay so we're getting to the end what are you guys thinking is this what is $285 honestly it's not $1 i'ma tell you why you guys polite you could just get so much weed with that money you could just roll so many blunts that just getting so much higher I don't know that's my s what I so I think creating for me was worth it listen out listen up so it's a pandemic I can't come to accept that much I only hang out with them so much I only have so much time so we got to get hella [ __ ] high in a short amount of time [Music] want to get hella high in a short amount of time that's a good way and there's a lot of money well but it was worth it yeah it was worth anything I think I would buy it if I was like gonna go see ya like a friend that I haven't seen him tell along and like your city just said you're gonna top the whole chain because this thing was a [ __ ] but she doesn't really need a [ __ ] damn I feel like I'm hella re inhaling all the smoke we want some water free I got you Brandon thank you like really even higher we just sitting here no

but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it

pre-rolls guys okay and you know me i'm kind of excited about it um i got the tahoe oh g i have the headband i have girl scout cookies and i have the white runts so from my last video i liked when i did the flower okay um and the delta eight enhanced flower have to add that because people don't think we don't know how it's made we know okay so i like the tahoe og and i like the white ruts so now we got the headband and atlrx where's my headband i didn't get my headband it's all right so we're gonna open this up guys and i'm gonna let y'all guys know what's popping with it and what's not so we're gonna go with this headband oh i didn't get the label open right hold on let me get this special seal it's another warning label that's on here guys and it's warning people not to operate motor vehicles because this is not your average cbd this has delta 8 t8c in it and it's going to be a little bit stronger than usual okay so now there we go guys we got that open so this is the headband there's pre-rollers from atlrx and as you can see it's a nice grain of full grain like that so ain't nothing left to it you know what time it is it's time to get some in the loan let's go all right shout out to my peoples at atlrix we got some more stuff coming up in the future for you guys but right now my bad but right now we're about to get into this pre-roll right here and this is the headband strand all right so let me light this bad boy up telling me see what i like most about the flower that i had the d8 flower that i had from atl rx is that it's not compromising the taste of the flower at all i like that here we go i gotta get it burning i'm not going through what i went through yesterday now i'm not going through that okay so we already know the taste is pretty good and it's kind of sweet i don't know where the sweetness is coming from but it's kind of sweet too guys this is actually really tight too i'm not sure why this is why a lot of people don't really like to buy pre-rolls these things i don't know if they're not handmade pre-rolls i'm honestly about to say i don't want him one thing i could tell you the taste is definitely there okay so that did not turn out well for some reason well i don't know that's not the only company having issues when it comes to pre-rolls um i did a video yesterday in the pre-rolls i couldn't get anything from them so right now we're just gonna go with the tahoe og pre-roll and hopefully we can actually smoke that one so here we go guys this is the tahoe og this was the headband i i just i can't get it past this point i don't know what's going on with a lot of companies that sending me pre-rolls that i can't smoke so that makes it impossible for me to review it but um we're gonna try another one here we go guys now this one here as you can see from the way i lit it there we go now we got the tahoe oh g flowing sheesh thank god i guess i'll just empty that one down and roll it up myself that way i'll be able to tell how good it is but the tahoe og has a really really good taste to it really good taste really good taste [Music] all right so now i can tell you guys exactly how this thing is it has a great taste like i said in the beginning with the uh headband even even though it wasn't smoking properly you could still taste it too distinctive tastes so the headband did taste a lot different than this tahoe og and the last time i liked the tahoe g as well oh man so i'm just telling you guys where you can get some high quality delta eight enhanced flour from all right these are my go-to guys i mean i know the last one was messed up but that's okay we still got three more of these bad boys to go so we have a few strands to try out i'm not gonna try all of them out right now here on this video but i just wanted you guys to know that their delta eight is legit it tastes good and so far i feel good so just wanted to let you guys know and as you can see i don't have any issues with this one at all so here we go i'm starting to fill up excellent warming up and this this actually tastes like some thc type gas right now really it really does so i want to get enough of it in so i can let know so i gotta say the tahoe og made up for the headband it made up for it because i am super enjoying this right now okay and yes i do have a great bus a great bus all right so just to let y'all guys know where is that and what to do with it you know if you run into one that's stuck like this one right here i'm just going to open this up and re-roll it myself all right you know i don't know if that's because the way it was packed if they packed it using machines or if somebody hand rolled it but whatever it is is like way too much right there in the front this one is perfect all right guys am in a full body bliss right now i feel great because i have the entourage effect i have cbd mixed with thc which is the delta eight was still tac and i can still achieve the entourage effect with that as well so i feel great all right smoke doctor signing out but i'll be back with another review soon guys alright peace", "XbUr98Z7MII": "[ __ ] video on hello rso sosa and today i've made it up the

welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be smoking this pre-roll from Lux rolls now Lux rolls is a company that sells cones that you can stuff yourself to make these epic ass parade rolls I really like these some people can't roll as well as others so if you want a nice big fat joint for a special occasion sometimes it's hard to do so this company literally allows you to make a cone like the raw cones but these ones are way more bougie they come in these nice little tubes so they have one that looks like a hundred dollar bill they have even fatter ones then they have the classic cannon which is the one that we're gonna be smoking today personally this is my favorite size out of all the ones they make I really like that it comes with a wood tip I really like just the amount of wheat that fits in it it's about 3 grams maybe 4 I didn't actually scale it out but without further ado I said you spark this up [Music] I put live breath and keep on the outside of it oh yeah that keep his burden I really love the size of these joints bed they are [ __ ] huge so on the video where I cut open a $50 pre-roll I said that I could make one myself for less money and a couple of you guys told me to do it so that's what I'm doing in this video I stuffed Durbin poison flour in this joint there's sour tangi live resin coated on the outside and then I rolled that Keef we keep this bird away faster than the actual bug but I'm not too concerned as of now the Durbin poison flower that I put in here was gifted to me by my buddy he grew it himself and like I'm really picky about weed but I gotta say this dude's Durbin poison was like out of this world I truly appreciate it you know who you are bro thank you very much free weed is always the best weed especially when it's good [Music] I got a radio this very second guys like I said in the pre-roll video I think it concentrates and Keith belong on the inside of the joint but I wanted to actually recreate that $50 role so that's why I put it on the outside it's definitely wasteful like there's way more smoke coming out of this and a normal joint and that smoke that could be going in your lungs let me show you a little close to finish you can see the oil actually melting down I put it decent amount of live resin on the outside of this whoo it's just got me shaking dude this is the first day of smoke today I'm lit oh my god guys this thing is ripping so hard for those of you guys who don't follow me on snapchat you probably don't know I just had surgery on my nose I had a deviated septum so basically I couldn't breathe well through it so for the last week I've just been recovering and man holy [ __ ] like my collar ins went down so much good I didn't smoke normally I don't take tolerance breaks but in the situation I was like bucket let me just not really smoke a like one edible one day but ultimately my collar ins went down with a block time dude the flavor oh this is so good the sour tangi library is mixed with the Durbin poison it's just a super [ __ ] fruity medley of deliciousness when the key that's a nice touch to my Keef is like all PA dispensary medical weed Keef so it's like some delicious fire beautiful Keef this is definitely better than the pre-roll in the $50.00 pre-roll video just because I know the weed was fresher the oil was live resin not co2 oil and the kief was definitely like better keep a lot of the dispensary chief I just know it's just shitty Keef that's why it's so cheap versus like when you actually get Keef from your weed and your grinder like there's no Keef better than homemade Keef [ __ ] yo oh okay you hit guys your turn ritual toks I'm so glad to be boomer the surgery and pretty much recovered with a deviated septum I couldn't really breathe well through my nose it was like breathing through a coffee straw instead of like a McDonald's straw if I was congested at all I just like naturally could not breathe so I got the procedure it's a septoplasty and annoyed ectomy I honestly don't even really know what the procedure is like I just was like cooled up do what you got to do but now that that process is over I'm back to smoking and I not gonna lie guys I missed it like there's no withdrawal really from not smoking for me like the worst thing is like I can't sleep well that's like really the biggest issue with me when I don't smoke I am totally not too profitable and able to sleep like I smoke so much I should date myself basically by the end of the night I remember my entire childhood growing up I would never be able to fall asleep when it was bedtime like I would always land that for an hour - just trying to fall asleep I think that's why I started to like weed when I started smoking it so I was like oh my first time smoking weed I got so [ __ ] stoned you guys like mids and heads was like the two options back then and like people around me all smoked mids but for whatever reason this day that I decided to agree with these guys they had heads and before we didn't get back to the skatepark I am so [ __ ] stoned like I remember getting out of the car and walking back to the skate park and being like holy [ __ ] I've never experienced anything like this like I was just giggling colors were more vibrant and I just like everything was just funny and I was like in love with the feeling but what my mom picked me up and I got back home I remember I literally fell asleep in our living room like half on the Ottoman half on the couch and like my stomach was just like in like the open air between it like it literally was just like based out of sleep for some reason they just thought it had like a long day at the skate park and didn't say anything about it but how the stones [ __ ] once I got past the keep you guys and the oil it has just had a really nice slow even burn you see that notice bro can do French inhales all day now no problem buy one of these for yourself and just stuffing it with weed is so much cheaper than buying pre-rolls from the dispensary and then you know it's actually inside it even if the pre-roll is out the dispensaries were recently priced usually there's just [ __ ] mids in there so it's nice being able to stuff your own fire weed in there and there's only being like thirty bucks instead of fifty dollars to 100 bucks but seriously if you think about it this cone was like two bucks say an eight the weed is like $25 I maybe put like ten dollars worth of live resin on it which is really really stretching it so we're at like 35 bucks and then like keep this free but let's say five bucks forty dollars for something that is literally twice the size and twice the experience of what that $50 pre-roll was not in California not trying to be a hater on pre-rolls I just like I always would smoke them and I'd be like these are kind of shitty and now that I've like broken a couple it open did the science I'm just like yeah welcome I'd rather stuff my own getting rough I love the wood tip though you can just rip the [ __ ] out of it and it has that black and milds okay green and spicy vibe to it and I just like it so much more I forgot to actually have this one though this is probably their coolest kit they got they put you down for a second it comes with two in one two he comes with this giant cannon I think I felt like five grams and the last one I put in this and then it comes with another one tip cone pretty much like the one I'm smoking right now let me know if you want to see another mini of me doing something like this with these also I'm going to Colorado so you guys so expect a couple more Colorado videos coming up let me know if there's any products you want me to check out while I'm out there or if there's any strain specifically you want me to pick up or any companies you want me to try one thing I do definitely want to find is

by hessies love those guys really good and the last guy we're gonna check out is the henry's original premium cannabis smoke blend i have not tried those guys i'm not too sure um what they're all about but they were on there they were on sale and i wanted to try them out because normally i would go with the lola lola brand ones those are my second or my third favorite second favorite ones compared to the stone road they go really they go up up against each other with the heshes but the last uh episode we showed you guys saw what i was smoking on how they look etc so feel free to check out that last video and see what those are all about but in the meantime stay tuned for what we're gonna have to do right now check them out and learn some more about these beautiful pre-rolls oh man all right guys we're gonna start off with my always favorite my number one go-to it's the black jack stone road natural pre-roll cannabis joints right here man these guys are off the hook delicious so i love these guys i usually prefer getting the watermelon skittles it's so tasty but i really wanted to try some sativa blends today and this is the go-to for me so we're gonna go ahead and show you guys exactly what this looks like inside the box and i love the little design you can see some flower trademarks right here oh yeah look at that looking nice and proper stone road shout out let's open you up voila just like that we remove the protective wrapper around the box you're going to go ahead and press these two in push out slide it right out and it comes with a nice little protective sheet so you got yourself right here your dericious pre-rolls so they're nice and proper like i said these are my go-to i absolutely love these are a 10 out of 10 depending on what your preference is for your high levels this is going to be a sativa blend blackjack um i'll find out exactly the the thc levels on this bad boy just for sure control let's see yeah we'll get to that in just a moment we'll put it up on the wall so thank you again stone road i love the box look at the inside very cute very cool discreet simple five on the go 3.5 eighth in the box not bad not bad second item in the box

this guy right here is a little tricky to open let me show you guys you're gonna take off the plastic so you do this little slit on the top whack simple you're gonna push in push down and then pull

so very cool 18 thc half grams so two grams of each one of these so this is two grams of joints an eighth right here a flower two grams of flour and three grams of flour so preference of yours the preference of smoke is yours to choose um the elevation is different for sure because you're gonna have a whole lot more with the stone road or a whole lot more with the henries and the hessies but either way they're a great way to meditate so thank you guys again there you go that's how it's done we're gonna drop that on the ground no worries henry's original smoke stone road and selfies thank

thought I'd do something a little different today and got this packwood's shout out to what's in my pre-roll for their inspiration such a simple concept with something so desperately needed in today's day and age so yeah this is legit Packwood's that I picked up it's prop 64 compliant not exactly sure what that means it does look like it is a normal blunt but I'm sure it's kind of like hemp wrap or something like that it doesn't exactly specify here on the packaging but as you can see it's got its holographic seal there it's got this wax but it's not real wax apparently and it's sealed by actual plastic so yeah let's go ahead and crack this thing open and see what we got looks like the dotted line is right here Packaging always gets the best of me all right cool all right so that came off pretty easily strip this does this just want to come off all right let's get the sticker going really self-conscious of my nails right now I definitely should have cut them but alright let's see oh there we go popping this off I guess this would be pretty problematic if it was actual wax oh that's just a screw top all right makes perfect sense plastic in there and there's what we're seeing from the top first a little preview there let's get this thing out of here no graceful way to really do this let's see there we go cool there it is it even has packwood's right there on the glass tip so yeah I mean looking decently keeped up guess that's the whole point this little guy escaped some like a little well let's just cut it open in reserved judgment here let's see if I can smell anything not really picking up on any Jack necessarily but it's probably just because it's overwhelmed by whatever this rap is made of got my little scissors out so here we go first cut definitely is stout whatever's in there oh damn oh no I was gonna try to patch this back together after this video but we'll see how that goes all right so there we go let's open it up get the focus on that alright well not exactly what you'd expect from their post on their Instagram page so you're getting at that looks like it'd be pretty hard to pull through falling apart pretty easily let's get a smell for this I mean it is looking fairly tricht yeah I'm not really picking up on any Jackson I know it's blackjack but I mean all the blackjack that I've ever smoked has just been predominantly Jack smelling it and I'm not really getting anything off of this let me grind it up a little bit that's what you this is what you're getting look tiny here let me get in here this is what you're getting I'm not shooting on this if you want to spend you know fifty sixty dollars to get this packed into you know keep tup want do it I mean I don't have a problem with that but that is what you're getting get you know it's ground up pretty well it's all smashed in there it's got some stems in it nothing no huge ones nothing like that I mean the note looks alright it's not anything amazing I see some perp in there but I'm sure I mean I'm not getting any smell off of my fingers at all which is kind of weird if anything maybe a little bit of sweetness but nothing jack like so that's what you get right there let's see what it comes out - oh wait you know there's a lot more there I mean not a lot more but there's more in here cut down a little more I'm saving this guy now is that it isn't where I'm at the tip there all right you guys couldn't see this but I'm trying to work it out it is just smashed in here look here so I mean maybe that would have smoked awesome laying here let me focus a little bit there we go so maybe that would it yeah it's like I don't know maybe that would have smoked great I don't think so [Music] I'll try to take a picture away in it cuz it's like honestly it's so caked in here I'd have to scoop it out so but yeah that's it that's what's inside right there you're looking at it pretty much all of it except for what's jammed right in there there's some Keef on the outside I don't know you know where the what is it co2 wax I guess maybe it's with in the nug like kind of blended in or maybe it's on the outside but honestly no Jackson it whatsoever and yeah I don't know that's what you get so if you want if you're cool with that and if you want to spend the kind of money to grab that then go for it but I mean I'd rather just grab something else and roll it myself there it is backwoods blackjack", "jxQA4YQz6tY": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "Q_RKmbYjq2M": "hello everyone good morning good morning good morning this is your homie malty oh we and today we're coming with so i come off with my car my cat is there um that is only me now people today we have the nice and the cbd uh products that and last night we done the from the goods and today we have from the goods as well onion the last night was more um concentrate site uh you know a beautiful and uh grounded purple uh shuttle it's really good um and of course ours and the little um a little vape pen uh what it's delicious as well this is blue dreams that if someone is interesting on that side um check my last video um or go on the straightaway to plays with cbd products people today we're going a little different way we go help our way and as well i wanted to discuss what i think about company how i see in the website and all that you know by the way i'm not sponsored by this company all this product was by them by from my pocket that i'm not related this is pure pure pure pure my review and my opinion with no you know influence from another people uh people say that today we'll be having the disability uh little pineapple express pereirol uh 30 percent of cbd or 14 protein of cbd that people what i do i change our view um i do little close-ups that you can see in the bible how it happens and we open this and later yeah you know i light up and smoke and i tell you my faults what i think it's good or not it's i think have little different approach uh this company for anyway if you change the view up here you go people pineapple experts coming out to but anyway um first i really like um how you know a company really make packages uh it's look amazing i like it it's really in the top top quality uh at least in the packaging and i'm not saying that there is bad boys it's under five star um now with this one it's in the 14 percent of cbd okay that is that is cool and now ingredients why i say this company have literally different approach look at that people organic pro property theory i'm sorry if i butch this world herbal blend what i think it's really don't use hemp it's use this and blendy use this on the use this blendy blendy blendy blendy products you know [Music] what you can use to um to mix with your normal and the wheat what is quite cool i try and it's quite nice um i try this in the holland anyway go back to this little bad boy and what has happened and the art and the cbd isolate what is in the from help and the tapes and minor cannabinoids that can include in the cbg and cbc um that and a lot with previous and products that people yeah quite interesting but let me open this it's safety card we like that let me smell this bubble what's this inside kind of sweet and tiny that really shoot exactly and smell and here we go and that is cool this this is glass it's glass people this is good it's glass tube that that is big shout out um no plastic you know cool nice glass tube uh that people yeah look i was saying they look nice i will if so use and the own papers what we have as well and at some point i'll be delivery of these bad boys uh don't you order it those people yeah this look nice smell quite okay not anyway we got we changed our view and i light up this bad boy but we here you go we go it's time to try this little bad boy uh people uh coffee is check uh lighter check and of course our spiritual check yep that here we go ready to go people i smell very piney and heavy piney what is correct because and the pineapple excess should have little tiny sweet piney healthy flavor however we see how gold is it's quite moist very mellow it smell the pine on you not every day you take kind of sweetness almost nothing almost go tasteless and i think if i'm honest i like these blends for you on the sleeves instead to use tobacco because it's almost tasteless and you have your whole almost whole spectrum and the real deal stuff now i don't say it's bad because it's not however to compare to two flavors what you have from this uh flavors what you have from that uh yeah this little lay down however you know it's nice ben honestly it's good quality and the herbal mix that uh you know it's how it is and i tell you that we go um it's more it exactly taste better than ham flour that i think i like this approach i like this approach to use herbal mix and infuse with with cbd isolates well that is done um i think it's better idea to do it and instead to have perroll hem however i think price of this is about 10 pounds it's 9.99 um it's a little too much i know and they give me and the nice and the glass you know jar and that that it's all cool and that i think it's a little too much uh it's only that my opinion um if i much prefer add you know another tenor and have this bad boy and i have 300 parts and it i i must be picky i'm sorry um overall it's no battery it's very mellow almost you smell it tastes nothing that as the art medicine for you yeah i think in the cook yeah it's not unpleasant what sometimes can have unpleasant than the smell that it's it's okay i mean i think it's still uh it's still um little down compared to these products that people anyway i still be smoking this and now i'll be quickly jumping to show you in the website how look um that you can see um and decide for yourself now people change the quick review and i show your website and we'll be done now people check there you go people website it's let me underscroll it's really uh look nice i like how look look uh cool now you have quality control the premium and the line of cbd infused products and the lab tested that it's so good you know explain you everything nicely a winner so 2020 i'm not surprised um that people yes i think it's this is the herbal mix uh and it's done that i if i'm honest it's better by this uh it's better by honestly by this you you come better and that now you have a vape pants what i really like and enjoy um of course in the shutter uh it's quite good uh as well lovely i never try on the ejuice and i think this be another product what i won't try look people how beautiful design uh i don't know maybe in the summer and the cartilages as well uh why i have yeah and maybe cartridges as well you know uh and here people i think the most with this company really do great and that eats all that [ __ ] it's delicious and a hundred percent uh i want to try tropical citrus and many another that oh so you torture as well that is nice the other and yes we have in the papers as well oh you can have under your and the grinder however be more interesting and up oh here we go ah 30 pound no but look nice people say that you know it's how it is that people it's always i really like this in company uh i really like products how look um i don't know it's this one i think it's no worth it and the money all the rest yeah hundred percent um if you'll be a little cheaper maybe you know some promotion or something maybe seven pounds and that only hey i'm not you know company owner that um this is only my third rest of the products that i say uh uh and the shutter and the vape it's spot on five stars this one i like idea and don't usually help me to use and the herbal mix and the infuse and the stuff i think this is better approach um overall i think it's great company people and i don't say that because it's uk one uh it's a really good company i i like and the how that profile look and and what the guys and sell and that yeah it's and of course we'll be having these little hand papers at some point in the review uh that people thank you very much hopefully you like and enjoy in this video if you guys

to smoke one of these west coast cure pre-rolls provided to us by jacob thank you very much jacob thank you i'm really hyped about those i've heard a lot of good reviews on west coast cures um i've never smoked one before i don't y'all never smoked one before right that's happening i tapped two hits off of one of these but haven't really got like a full experience okay cool and um i'll let you spark this thing up buddy this is chrisley i like how they put it in raw joints i like raw papers so i think that's pretty cool use that all natural taste yeah [Music] a little harsh [Music] damn this is pulling yeah you can't hear the [ __ ] section it stinks damn duncan it smells like some gas for me this is gonna be an easy hot box it does so now that i've gotten into it a little bit it's got a nice little it's got a nice little gassy taste to it under the i swear i think it's that keef it's super it's got a little stink to it for sure dude i mean it looks very hard so that [ __ ] pulls like i mean it pulls like shotgun like i really don't think it tastes that bad compared to other pre-rules we've had not many at least i mean it does have that pre-roll flavor but it's i i expected it to be hard yeah i mean this is [Music] perfect [Music] i hope our youtube channel gives you nostalgic memories and when you used to hang out with your bros and you smoke up or you're chilling with your brains and watching yes we're all bros here this is not bad it's not bad at all i mean [Music] that [ __ ] was yellow yeah he took a [ __ ] that was kind of nasty it's not bad i mean you can you could tell like it's probably a little a little old you know what i mean not the pre-roll of the bud sitting on the shelf a little too long yeah you got to get a pre-roll like the day they made that [ __ ] i mean like at least a week after they made it but like i mean [ __ ] bird there's no telling when they made think about it and you roll a joint right and you just have that [ __ ] sitting there for like a month right it's not going to taste like it did you do that exactly yeah that's what i mean like they need that you need to like if somebody rolled that [ __ ] or made that [ __ ] like that day that's fire i don't want a [ __ ] live resident or keith that's been sitting there for like a month or some [ __ ] bro like yeah facts look at him god damn it that's more expensive than milo and he doesn't even realize that's two of him like they make you buy cats be called or like buy pets really i mean when you go to a pet store and you have to buy it for like 40 dollars like you were just saying bro that's like it's just weird like you're kind of helping them you're helping them out by taking that cat off their hands so it's like i don't know why you're having fun and pay for it yeah that's what i'm saying like that i got it from an actual shelter and like they uh they make you pay adoption fees for the shots and they give it a chip beforehand and all that stuff and they also give you free they give you free like a chip yeah there's a chip in it just in case it got lost and they brought it back to the pound they could check it for a chip and it's got my number on it inside of them yeah it's like under his ear bro he's like [ __ ] he's like a clone bro order 66 right right like this like dude imagine one day just like all the cats that have chips and him like just [ __ ] somebody from the pet store is like executed 466 they just all start killing their [ __ ] owners and cats with [ __ ] machine guns [ __ ] blazer machine guns taking them out there's like yes my lord there's her like it's like the slice and jacob starting to sleep and she's liking rick and morty with the the dog had the [ __ ] robot suit yeah yeah that's a dude that was a good [ __ ] episode dude while he's taking that little hit here you want to talk a little bit about what you thought of that west coast uh yeah i mean i thought it was all right i mean like i said it's definitely not a fresh pre-roll so it's hard to tell like if it was like a brand new one i guarantee you it's really [ __ ] fire you'd definitely tell that was like it's pretty old but it got me high but that's all that matters i guess at the end of the day you know what i mean but yeah i mean the taste and everything it wasn't really there it was it was okay it was all right it was i gave it about like a a six and a half because it got me like high but like taste wise and stuff it was not there in my opinion but that like i said that's an older one so i'm not going to sit there and say like west coast here suck because i've heard really good things about them so i might have got like a dud kind of yeah i mean i bought this a week ago for the video yeah exactly so yeah i mean there and it probably was like made weeks before that so yeah if not yeah so this is what you the price you pay when you're getting a a three roll in my opinion i think the pre-roll it wasn't i'm on the same page but ever wasn't anything special when it came to the flavor um but i definitely would say it accelerated my heart yeah yeah for sure we were already kind of getting before we started so yeah i mean it got me high so i feel like it just um it's cool all in all like it was good it got me high and like that's what i want um i just feel like the taste wasn't there you know like it just it and i mean that is that's what you're you know you're gonna get with pre-roll that's what i said today yeah so all in all it was a pretty good point i mean i or joint it got me high i mean that's that's what matters yeah so pretty much we all said the same thing yeah i i pretty much about have the same the same thing to say i mean it was really it got me high it was a nice uh a nice feel and everything it was smooth but the flavor that i wanted out of pre-roll for that kind of price just wasn't there yeah i expect more of it it's probably like trim or shake that's been sitting in that you know in that joint for like months and i mean it's like i said earlier you know if you if you roll a joint of some gas right top shelf even you sit that [ __ ] in in the cabinet for like what a month even if you put it in a nice little glass jar sealed up it's not going to taste the same it's just not dude and that that's the case i got high i mean i know there's some gas in there because i'm high and there was five heads on that so i mean i noticed some gas dude don't get me wrong um especially if you take a dab after that you know you get really stunned there's some pre-rolls though that like are [ __ ] insane bro but like it's just like you're asking for like a hundred dollars for one joint so that's just just not me but like that's okay you're smoking like four grams in one joint which is cool i get it like it honestly it equals up to 100 but like i just don't want to smoke all that at once i want to save my [ __ ] but that [ __ ] is probably like where it's at that's probably those are probably the pre-rolls you're really going for you're probably not gonna find a solid pre-roll that's only like a gram and it's just strictly but you know i mean like you need to pre-roll with dabs or some live resin in it some [ __ ] like that really get a good taste out of it but you get to say the option buddy okay uh what do i need to say did you just say it dude now y'all got me like thinking all that [ __ ] guys all right i gotta get um wait a second all right so uh yeah thanks for watching the video um so or all right whatever milo is hungry dude dude just do it then if you want to do i don't know

Lowell specializes in producing\npacks of pre-rolled joints. Last year, it rolled and\nsold over 4 million joints. In order to do so, Lowell needs a lot of cannabis. This is David Elias,\nCEO of Lowell Herb Co. David Elias: Right now,\nwe're selling about 1,100 pounds a month, soon to be up to almost\n1,300 pounds a month. We're rolling 25,000 joints\na day out of this facility. Joe: The recent legalization\nof cannabis in California for recreational use has allowed companies like Lowell to grow at a rapid rate. David: As of last year, our revenues have\nincreased just over 300%. Joe: Lowell let me take a\npeek inside its facility to see how they make\nso many joints a year. Thank God, because I roll\nmaybe two or three a year, and they're all terrible. Let's check it out. How you doing? David: Right now, we're best known for our one-eighth pack of pre-rolls, which is seven pre-rolls\nin one-eighth of an ounce. We also have a quarter-ounce pack, which has double the number. We have jarred flower, which we sell one-eighth\njarred flower as well. AJ Fay: So, this is where\nwe store all of our flower. When it comes in, it goes\ninto a quarantine container, which is where we do our\ninitial R&D lab testing. When that comes back clear and it passes our\nquality-control standards, it moves over into these\nother two joined containers, which is all usable material. Joe: Each container\nholds about 2,000 pounds of marijuana. My new LinkedIn profile pic. Joe: Strawberry Banana, Mimosa. AJ: Some Gorilla Glue. Joe: Silky Johnson. AJ: The Rude Boy. Joe: The Rude Boy. You got any favorite strains? AJ: Sour Diesel. I love Durban Poison, and I love that Strawberry\nBanana; it's a great indica. Joe: All right, cool.\nAJ: Really relaxing. Joe: You seem like an indica guy. (laughs) The cannabis is put into this shaker to separate the big buds\nfrom the little buds. The big ones will be\nput in jars like these. Employee: This is 77 eighths in total. Joe: Seventy-seven eighths? Employee: Yeah. Joe: So... that's... gonna be 7 pounds? AJ: No, that's, like,\nless than half a pound. Joe: The first step in making\nso many pre-rolled joints requires this machine: a knock box. One-hundred paper cones,\npre-attached to filters, are loaded into the machine. Lowell starts with a blend of flower, which is added to a loading tray. Each tray holds 1 gram of cannabis. The tray is placed on top of the knock box and the machine vibrates and bounces, pulling the flower down\ninto the paper cones. Once the joints are filled, the trays are brought over to a roller. AJ: So, we have about 40\nrollers working each day on one tray per hour, so 100 joints per hour per roller, and that's where we get our about 25,000 joints rolled per day. Joe: Then the joints are\nbrought over to another station where they are placed\nin packages and sealed. David: When you think about pre-rolls, pre-rolls are very convenient. It's easier for the user; they don't have to buy the flower and roll it and then put it into a joint. Joe: Lowell also sells flower in jars if you like to roll your own joints. David: Here in California, we test for pesticides, microbials and potency. So, when a customer gets our product, they can actually see the\nTHC potency right on the pack and know that it's been tested for all the other items that are mandatory here in California. AJ: So, once everything's\nproduced and packaged, it moves into this container, which is our quarantine container. Joe: Gotcha. AJ: So, the lab comes here on site, they send their reps, and they do a random sampling based on the batch size. Joe: So, they just go in,\nthey grab one of these. AJ: So, this was a box of 25, they took two or three out\nof there for lab testing. Joe: Yeah, \"lab testing.\" AJ: And in a few days\nwe'll get the results back, which means if it passes it's able to be labeled and sold to the retailers. Joe: OK. How often do they\ncome through with tests? AJ: We test every single\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday. Joe: After it passes, the products are labeled, boxed, and shipped out. Got his newest product. They're coming out with 17-pound joints.", "6hI1oRR9gKU": "row row row your blunt full of cbd i'm breaking down roll it up light it up here no more anxiety hey hey what up cut ups um welcome to

or keep it pushing ready salute", "jLJWAM_L4_c": "[Music] I've known always I know oh boy what's up guys simplistic here back with another video as you could see wonderful day outside you know I'm saying we're at Ben's house in his backyard and I I bought these pre-rolls like on Friday last week and I I'm already saying I already opened it I already used five there's seven of them and I saved two for this video one for me and one for Ben and as you can see the brand is called hervana it says 20% THC and the only thing I have a fault with this back packaging is look at it I don't even know if it was like airtight at all you know like this is not like yeah so it doesn't keep the joints fresh that's my only neck and it was a bit dry I'm not gonna say it you know I'm not gonna lie and uh I don't it's just pretty much all I can say about that but you have the lighter thing right here and you can open it well packaged not gonna lie for every ounce they buy they plant a tree or for every ounce that's bought from them they buy a tree or plant a tree that's pretty dope yeah so they definitely aren't giving back to the planet you know says a lot about a company that whether they're willing to you know do that so here's Ben's oh yeah and the packaging is biodegradable or some [ __ ] I don't know so they also gave you some matches tied to a hemp wick yeah so [Music] oh I'm running independent no I mean coming in my feeling [Music] so these are point fives each seven joints and these are for mostly the people that can't roll or in a rush and yeah those are basically lonely like from from a stoners perspective always try to get an eight and just roll your own because you don't know what they actually put in these I'm not gonna just spend money and then empty one and see what it is because I spent money on it but people some people do and sometimes it's just shaking these pre rolls so you just got to be aware and like I said the the airtight packaging was not there so it definitely does not keep the joint as fresh I mean what do you guys say about the joint it's smooth though right yeah oh it strain is this that's another thing I don't really like about is that they just call it hybrid which is a hybrid blend so it's a blend of all this stuff and usually when I hear blend I just think that they just blended all the remaining shake together their hybrid [ __ ] hopefully it's not the case but in the end I can't really tell but you could follow them and see it there I mean who knows you know good and it's definitely not bad you know I've tasted four screw holes right and this is like a little point fiber so it's like for those of you who are tweeting cigarettes but smoke weed like cigarette besides this you know I don't think ban was expecting the smoke all joined by himself today I just came through with it but luckily it's a point five so I feel like anyone can handle 0.5 yeah I'm gonna that's one good quick and like so when you smoke things quick especially when you only want smoking it it's still gonna be slow smoke like the other ones the other five when I first opened out that Blake's house mean and just had one were just smoking it yeah then when money came I gave him one to avert itself and then a half me and Blake shared half and then you came and I was just like you know just save this for what my do a video I played salsa [Music] but also seen a video recently of owl owl smokes which is basically the same kind of packaging just colored differently so I'm guessing that this this is a generic freewill pre-roll package that companies can buy okay I don't know if I mentioned it but the percentage was about 20% THC solders be like it's pretty good and this was running in about to pull 8th buys 25 bucks for the whole pack which is not bad right I mean I've seen worse or worse for price more you know [Music] look at it but yeah as you can see most good none of them ran at all so that is a plus in my book because sometimes you buy pre-rolls sometimes you buy single pre-rolls and then they run and it's just the [ __ ] ten bucks on this single pre-roll and like I said pre rules are for people that really are in a rush or can't roll or they just yeah basically on a rush or can't roll but if you can just always try to get the flower I for one was in a rush and I just wanted to like just pull one out and smoke it whenever I wanted instead of getting my fingers all sticky because I've somehow lost my grinder so I would have to break that out with my hands though you froze lost your grinder yeah I find it but it's like no I'm saying but yeah check out the coming company hervana let me know if you guys guys have tried their pre rolls in let me know if you thought it was pretty good you know so far I'm liking it like I had I really smoked like three before this so it was a pretty good smoke not gonna lie but it's not like the greatest pre-roll in the [ __ ] game you know yeah oh yeah well I also was uploading a video today and it said the gave you mute gave me an option to say is this video allowed or washable for kids or is it not this is like an option they added on YouTube like recently so I just click no this is not for children on all my videos so hopefully this is like a better chance of me not getting deleted they just added that so I'm guessing they're kind of like you know compensate for I don't know you know I don't they don't know but hopefully I checked the all of them I checked no they're not made for children hopefully I don't get deleted again that's dumb that they just delete your account for [ __ ] that in here twice twice how do you feel you feel high a little bit a little bit yeah so uh maybe the strength isn't as what it's advertised cuz 20% on a joint is pretty hot should ya be getting me pretty lifted that goes to say back to the the shake in the blend that's probably what what the case is mm-hmm but I mean I don't know I don't know what to say to take after this new it's a kick creeper yeah you gotta expect that with payrolls as you know you can't really expect to get too high because you can't expect the quality to be too high that's the first time smoking I didn't know nirmaia took a very there yeah so if you're like everyday smokers you know by your payroll is pointy not the way to go either that's true but like I said I was in a rush you know I'm saying that could roll guys yeah I can't roll good but good enough to smoke you know I'm not saying I'm like it's master roller over here but guess the job done but other than that the joints both of our joints are pretty much done hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I will see you guys in the next one peace out [Music]", "CSaz1dXgG0E": "the number one pick and shovel play in the marijuana sector stay tuned you really don't want to miss this one hi guys in today's video i want to go over a company that we went over before but i'm heavily bullish on this company i want you guys really to take notice of this company maybe you're not you're not familiar with the marijuana industry um maybe you are but this company here i feel like it's the best pick and shovel play for this industry and i'm gonna break it down for you and i'm gonna tell you why within this video very important you stay to the end because i feel like this video at this price range where this stock is at right now can really can really benefit you guys in terms of making some profits long term okay everybody focuses on when the marijuana sector everybody focuses in on companies that are producing that are producers right we have companies like tilray we have companies like sndl we have all kinds of different companies well within those companies there's gonna be a lot a lot of competition okay so that means the market share for each company is getting reduced and as time goes by there's gonna be more and more companies more and more competition right so i'm gonna i'm gonna describe this company too i'm gonna go over it real quick we already did a video before if you didn't if you missed that video click here and you'll be able to see that video okay so the name of the company that we're speaking about is silver spike acquisition which is a spec but they're merging with weed maps weed maps okay guys um currently trading at 1964 which for me presents a huge buying opportunity this stock has ran up all the way to about 30 okay high 20s currently we do have 300 shares on this stock now i was invested in when i made that video i think we got in like around 12 bucks we ran it all the way up guys okay i cashed out i i was selling along the way because i had a lot of shares then i went and got opportunities with these facts you got to know that you got to get rid of some of your shares along the way because they do run up all the way and they do come down we've seen them come down however within the last couple of weeks you've seen that this company silver spike acquisition weed maps has really held its ground compared to many other um spacks okay so this company here i think i think has a great potential and i'm gonna break it down for you okay currently invested uh 300 shares at an at an average cost of 2091 i want to get that average below 20 and i want to build up anywhere from 500 to 700 shares and this is gonna be the perfect time to do it guys okay um let me let me get into something real quick for those that don't know weed maps is a online advertising platform for mj okay guys it's an online advertising platform now they're not just an online advertising platform they're the number one online advertisement platform okay in the whole us so just think about that their competition is very minimal the next big competition i think is ease but they have no type of market share like what weed maps does now i want to show you if you're not familiar with weed maps i want to show you there when you when you go on the website you usually get this this image here which is a map of where you're located and it tells you uh every pin that you see here on the screen is basically a pin of a certain company that pays weed maps to advertise on their platform guys to advertise on their platform so every single pin you see here in the la area every single pin is paying an advertisement fee now that advertisement fee can range from 500 all the way up to five to ten thousand dollars depending on how much advertisement this company has now if you multiply that within all these these pins you see here you're gonna you're gonna see that it's a lot of money guys a lot of money so that in turn will continue to grow within the next couple of years as weed becomes legalized in other states okay so in my opinion this company is just getting started but just to give you a little bit of history on the revenue and the revenue growth i'm going to step in this um this chart here which is which is an amazing um chart that shows you and breaks you down everything okay there's um i'm going to read off a little bit of information so you can get a little bit of more information okay cannabis advertisement advertising giant weed maps hopes to boost its revenues over the next three years by a whopping 175 okay and investors are wagering the california based company can deliver on that goal guys i mentioned before in my other video that i have been involved in this sector for quite some time and this company here is the number one company guys don't sleep on this company it's the number one company and you guys will see within the next couple of years that this price that you're seeing right now at 19 will blow up okay i'm just giving you this advice i'm connecting the dots for you i've already been involved here i know this company i know people that work at this company it's a very solid company okay and their ceo is great too let me read this off to you the stock which trades under sspk on the nasdaq climbed another 22 after the company filed a form ss4 with the u.s securities exchange commission that includes the audited financials and more details about the deal and the company operations okay this is important in weed maps investors see a profitable high margin fast growing and tech and software business that happens to be tied to the cannabis sales but one that does not touch the plan why is that important i'll tell you why that's important not touching the plant allows the company to enjoy higher trading volume on the nasdaq be owned by the traditional investment institutions and avoid irs section 280e to pay typical business tax rates you get that guys so what does that mean that means they don't touch the plan therefore big institutions can go ahead and load the boat on these guys and not fear that you know what one day you know if if anything happens in the future with the laws and stuff like that they won't be influenced with that okay that's very important now this is the most eye-catching information for me and i want to pass it on to you okay we're going to go over revenue growth from 2015 which was before cannabis was even legalized as as anybody can use it right recreation or anybody can use it okay back in 2015 their revenue was 43 2016 61 million 2017 90 2018 we got jumped to 101 2019 now we're getting more closer to the recreational 144 guys that's a 43 year overgrowth okay 2020 160 okay and in 2021 they're estimated to go from 160 all the way to 205 but look at these numbers guys 2022 as more states become legalized as more states open up to this and i'll tell you what because of the situation we're in with the coven i'll tell you what more states are gonna be open we just heard new jersey new york they're open for this okay why they want to generate tax they want to generate income okay so they're going to be open to this sector now we see 20 22 300 million estimated and in 2023 we're going to 440 40 million dollars guys this company at this current price you're getting an awesome opportunity to jump in in this sector if you're not involved yet i would suggest and this is not financial advice that this is a wonderful picks and shovels play because why the competition is minimal the sector's competition when we're talking about mj we're talking about competition within a bunch of companies they got a lot of competition okay a lot of growers out there a lot of sellers out there but weed maps comes at you from a different perspective and they're collecting money from all the competition their platform offers advertisement for the producers for the big companies like stizzy okay and people buying it okay so if you look at it you're saying wow you got an opportunity to own this company at this price very reduced right now and it has great uptrend okay that's just my opinion guys with that i wanted to conclude the video i just want to give you an update on this company i think it's an awesome opportunity to buy right now um if you found any of this information informative please like and subscribe also hit the notification bell that way you get all the videos when they just come out okay also if you haven't followed us yet follow us at twitter investing og on twitter okay guys with that guys you have yourself a wonderful day god bless and i'll see you on the next one [Music]", "hh7DaaJmarg": "countdown

really in here and that top-shelf pre-roll let's slice it open here see what we got inside looking like a nice light green color like some good-looking bud so so far so good so the sight test it's looking decent smell test I'm not smelling a whole lot right now a little bit here so sites looking pretty good smell let's double check that decent I mean it might be sitting for a while let me see if I can change the angle here actually giving you a little something better to look at this might not be the best angle so I'm gonna get my phone here and see if we can make it look a little better cell phone looking a lot better we can see that nice green color and see some of that shatter and there little dots I wonder how much exactly was in there looks good smells decent so past those two tests now let's do the most important the taste test tastes pretty good it doesn't taste some of the best flour I've had like that fresh flavor this might have been sitting for a little while doesn't

yeah it's not even a gram 2.25 2.25 yeah I am hungry too we're gonna eat good after this we can go to a homies house and grab on some [ __ ] barbecue Maya we haven't had a video like this in a while we got the homies it's original people that did the hotbox especially with the bait pants I don't have you guys remember remember where yeah the video we were casually talking and this was choking in the back when I gave you one long-ass time ago when you still worked at Jamba Juice yeah and we met up at the park near Chris's house at Hughes right I don't worry about up yeah was there maybe nothing wrong please you don't remember that day in that video where we're casually talking and then i zoom up on the video are off his face while he's like choking Oh RJ I'm saving this [ __ ] Joey what are you doing at 4:20 you're not smoking fat I think if we do this we don't need to smoke for the rest of the day just become the plant so a fortnight comes in with kron4 and so you wouldn't know it's ok to know so while they relax I don't force your [ __ ] this really dope guys can't Destin check them out honestly I don't know the price of this but if I had to guess I would say in the forty fifty dollar range maybe less depending on where you are maybe thirty seven where you can buy here in the Hollywood yeah he was just he was in there the homing Hut the homie Tyler shout out to you Tyler but yeah let's definitely don't this shows all the [ __ ] look the charge one twenty five percent THC it's definitely super stiff neck is twenty nine like cruises twenty-six it's just like my teeth deep it's like inhale it for too long you know Eastern Conference if I would just have pulled out right away it's actually really smooth basically THC in the hit is absorbed already instantly 95% of it the you hold it in any longer you're getting 5% instantly it's I looked it up that's what I said instantly you don't need to hold it in just breathe in breathe out it like you're trying to smoke for a good amount of time you know you can't be holding it in especially if you're smoking about backwards guys that's just real [ __ ] yes exactly and it time multiplies with the effect of you getting high plus you're holding in tobacco - so it's like a high that people seem to really enjoy you could probably pass out from that [ __ ] yeah I've seen it happen I've seen where uh my home between gravity just holding it in and you passed out and he fell on the rocks his Marx cousin outside Brian's house and apparently uh Marcus did that - off dabs jammer fun no though Marcus passed out off dabs before you like fainted yeah so guys just be safe you know with that knowledge it can go a long way especially with your health um you guys know holding in smoke and your [ __ ] body is not good for you you know so holding in as as less as possible as you can and plus we're hotboxing in right now so it's all being recycled at the end of the day it's like even though we chose like our own strains we're still in the smoke of the other strains oh sure I'm not good with hotboxing tell you that right now why I'm not either I just can't breathe and I'm I can't breathe no clue I got I finished a bitter I know [ __ ] this video I'm understanding though so I'll [ __ ] play them oh yeah I'm understanding - [ __ ] those women I'm gonna stop it no cell [ __ ] on me okay did you really know about you guys but I'm almost I'm who's done are you almost done you stopped a long time ago Oh it's a good one though guys [ __ ] you're not honey I'm how high did I I'm done with his own yam them there you go guys no no that's not how we do it here this 420 we do something big Amy all right okay okay all right guys let's see alright guys there you have it yeah that is the plan 20 special I actually made it back and I hit the [ __ ] I hit the fence and then I was just like whose height was I all right there you have it guys peace out Lina 4/20 stress sleep [Music]", "90i9gwPVILY": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the canvas small ei I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews and our special episode series battle pre-roll were three pre rolls down from trailblazer they've been pretty good not great we've found a winner from these three already now we have one last contender in the ring and it's from tweed I assume TWD it's a pre rule we have sixty point four milligrams of THC and 70 milligrams of CBD so it is six point four percent THC and there's a little bit more CBD in there this is our first one Graham joint of the competition and warning do not drive so let's get back to it Krakauer duty seal see if we can get into it there we go and there is our joint it was the best protected but it's the most bent you will notice top is not twisted off and let's lock that up well the other ones took the tips off this one has it on so I will light it with the tip on to assess it the way it would like that's the raw King size it's been packed down quite a bit again it's a 1 gram joint let's check out what the top material is looking like all right so you can see some different colors you can also notice that it's a little bit dried out it's not a bright green or an exciting green in the hand it smells like old cannabis for sure kind of just a bit like a milk chocolate but you can't notice quite a bit of Keith in my hand actually so we shall see how it burns twist that back on I guess I'll get rid of this crazy tail even though they left it on there which is crazy to seem lighter same lighting process except a little bit of wind now so I noticed one thing right away that it's just not burning that well but let's give you the courage buff and let's go so as far as the burn goes you can you can clearly see how it's changed as far as appealing flavors go there are none it just takes like hot smoke its ran instantly like really badly none of the other ones ran like that this one really ran but you can see why because the air pockets in the bend not as definitely not hand finished or hand finished the same way the other ones were I guess I will fix the run a little bit and keep off and on it it's not easy to pull on it tastes like old wood as far as battle pre-roll goes and the actual need to continue smoking this and the grade that I want to give it I think we can just stop right here so this was tweed balanced TWD balanced THC CBD this was from which lot sorry lot 1 9 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 5 4 and of all of them we had a bar set pretty well 7.5 was our highest it tasted pretty good it burnt nice and white and it burnt straight what are we gonna give this I guess it gets 5 just for being cannabis but would I buy it again no I paid this was actually the most expensive joint of the entire battle at six dollars and fifty cents I believe I paid for it or maybe it was six dollars but I think it was 650 and it definitely leaves the absolute most to be desired so would not buy again five points TWD so I'll show you if you want to watch back you can watch the final episode and watch the conclusion and hear all of my final thoughts make sure like comment share and subscribe until next time Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yay", "TI5GfHPJh5I": "[Music] what's up you guys it's king kelly here for another video review today i think it tastes like weed [Music] thanks for watching guys today we're going to be reviewing a cookie's purchase that i did on my last little haul at the cookie store which is the selfies pre-rolls which i'll insert a little closer up clip of the pre-rolls and the packaging here in this video now i have tried a couple times to film this video kind of unsuccessfully what's up you guys it's king kali here for another mini vlog even though i don't know what order of my vlogs are coming in on which is why i'm gonna sound so excited in these vlogs compared to my little review videos where i sound just kind of dead sometimes but anyway we're gonna fix that we're doing it on the go vlog today yeah so i'm just saying this isn't gonna be the main video you guys this will be inserted in the video just like another vlog that i have coming up um but i have a lot of videos coming up so i'm not sure when this one will be up but we're going to be doing the little selfies we're actually going to smoke so i did go ahead and smoke both of the indica pre-rolls already the medellin the medallion was the indica it comes in little two packs half grams so each are 0.25 grams there's selfies payroll so they're just little personal hits that you can do the medallion tested at 20.4 and less than 2 cbd when i smoked these and now let me tell you guys i don't think this is like super premium flour i think this is just for a quick on the go smoke for a nice little quick smoke i'm in a little you know easy to go packaging i don't think this is the most affordable pre-roll if that's what you're looking for for your money because for eight dollars for two um little pre-rolls that are 0.25 grams you could purchase a full gram per roll for like 10 bucks you know and get a little more worth your money but then again it's not going to come in the cute little packaging and it's not going to come in a little .25 gram it'll be a fuller one but that's completely up to you and there's tons of little selfies i'm not little selfies but little mini pre-rolls and joints that are out there now to try today we are going to be doing the one that i showed you guys a close-up of in this video which is the super glue so super glue is a hybrid strain this one tests at 20.4 as well now super glues origins um should be northern lights and skunk so let's go ahead and like this one up and see now if you guys look in my video it is really small like really tiny like i light it and it's gonna be gone in a second it's not even going to be a really long pre-roll video now i will say that it is like a super glue it has a very kind of um funky kind of taste to it to me it's not super sweet it's not super harsh it has a nice little white ash at the top of it here um where it's starting to burn i mean like two or three hits this will basically be done and you put it out so let's go ahead and hit it again so for a little pre-rolls that you could just take on the go with you guys you know if you're just pulling up somewhere and you just want something to just pull out and smoke on real quick this is like a fun little idea do i think this is the perfectly best tasting flower to be honest no i think it's okay it's not the worst flower ever smoked um doesn't taste just like trim or anything it does have a nice taste to it but it's not something that you know i pick up i would personally prefer to roll my blunts or joints if i'm gonna smoke them but yeah it has a nice white ash coming to it we'll also open the lime which is the sativa here on camera today too let me go ahead and grab the little clipper that i'm using for it because i don't know where any of my scissors have gone but the clipper works just fine to open them up we'll go ahead and pull one out looks just the same as the other one um this other little one is pretty much almost gone anyway but for a hybrid i would say this has a nice mellow taste to it it's not like a strong um too strong of like a taste to me to where it's you know unsmokable but i would say this definitely has more of an outdoorsy type taste to it because it is sun-grown pre-rolls most likely because it's eight dollars for two little mini pre-rolls it's cute packaging i like the little reflective packaging that they have um but just for a little on the go pre-roll i think that's the really only point to it the lime which is the sativa taste are tests at twenty point two percent thc less than two percent cbd let's go ahead and light the sativa one up and see how it is and hopefully i mentioned it when i was talking about the super glue but that one is a hybrid the medallion which is the one that i don't have to show you guys to smoke is the indica one which is this one right here because i tried to film the video before and it wasn't working now i will say these are cute these are cool um definitely like to throw in your purse or something or your backpack and not have it smell and just want to open one or two it's definitely nice because they're small also they don't really go out or anything so i think that's the nice thing of it too now when i also looked up the lime in the medellin just for kind of strain info for you guys i think the lime is more of just a lemonade lemon strained derivament um the medellin comes from specifically cookies brand flour they rolled out the medellin as a sun grown strain before i'm not too sure on the medallions madeans medan's origin um but i just wanted to go ahead and do a little fun little review because i haven't done many pre-roll videos i think only just the one which is the lift tickets that i did before for you guys but i'm going to go ahead and end the video here and thank you guys so much for watching if you guys want to write any comments or have any questions make sure to write them below if you guys are interested in another product coming up let me know please like and subscribe if you guys want to watch me in the future thank you for watching guys have a great day bye", "TcfYBHRexLk": "hey guys how you doing here we are again for the third time in a day at loud house hemp here in beautiful huntsville alabama it's late in the evening sun's starting to go down it's getting dusk pretty soon be time for me to to call it a day but guys i want to show you something [Music] this is our delta eight pre-roll that's right it's a raw king size pre-roll holding approximately 1.2 grams of our cbd flour once it's dipped and then the cbg and cbd keith put on it you're looking at just over 2 grams you're getting about 670 milligrams of delta eight along with a little kick of cbg and of course the hemp flower that's there so what's that gonna be that's probably gonna be somewhere around the neighborhood of [Music] six seven eight nine shoot that's probably gonna be over a thousand a thousand milligrams yeah that'd be over a thousand milligrams of cannabinoids all together you know counting the cbd the delta eight the cbg just look at that it's beautiful i don't know if i can really get you see how some of that that little hanger on right there trying to peel off but guys this is a beautiful beautiful product uh got another one right here let's take a look at it and see if see how it looks ah there we go as you can see the delta is dipped up to here it's not all the way we may start taking a brush and actually brushing it on all the way back so we get it get it going completely there because the flower itself the flower itself is not infused uh or sprayed with with a delta eight but uh man there's a good basically a a gram of delta eight on this flowers like say man the hit's gonna be phenomenal and then the rest of it after you get through with the delta eight you go down to the regular seaweed flour which is the last uh well you spoke more than half of it with delta eight on it and cbg keef but the rest of this is gonna melly out because it's gonna bring it it's going to take two people to smoke this thing i believe i know i can spoke about myself talking about a gram of a gram of delta eight along with uh 1.2 grams of uh cbd high you know high cbd flower shoot but anyway guys you get two of them two of them shipped to you let's see what's the price there's some hole let me let me check it real quick make sure i'm telling you right let's see [Music] okay at 17 with free shipping you get two of the pre-rolls now i know you say well i can get 3.5 of your spray of 3.5 grams if you spray flour [ __ ] to me for 15. well guys they some manual labor uh you know in this right here also you're getting [Music] i don't know if he didn't really more bang for your buck but it's different uh you're getting a pre-roll flower that's packed well it's got a great uh the uh the the flour that's used as actual flour it's no shake or anything like that no seeds or very little seeds we try to make sure seeds don't get in there no stems great product so i think for 17 dollars shipped i think to 1.2 gram actually is it being like 2.2 gram pre-rolls so you're getting total 4.4 grams you know compared to 3.5 grams of actual spray flour so i don't know it's kind of a you know apples apples oranges oranges type thing so if you want just a man i mean look at it again okay guys you can sit up against my finger and my fingers aren't small not shooting your bird sorry just giving you you know giving you [Music] and just think you get two of these bad boys for 17 ships anyway these will be all these i don't know if they'll be on tonight i've got to take some pictures and stuff but they'll definitely be on uh by tomorrow so 17 ship guys is i believe it's a great price anyway just letting you know don't forget we also got the new delta 8 vape juice that's already on the site for 1698 i believe shipped and that's shipped anywhere 16.98 shipped anywhere that's a 60 ml bottle of 1200 milligram delta 8 for the whole bottle so that's 20 milligrams of delta eight per milliliter of vape juice and it's a true vape juice so you can use those bigger mods and stuff that you got that you get nicotine guys are using or you know maybe you've got a you got jewel with a you know maybe you've got a jewel that you want to use in a jewel i don't know uh but uh i've got a vape mod here myself and i've been hitting it since yesterday phenomenal but these right here remember these are our delta eight uh coated pre-rolls along with cbd and cbg keef 17 shipped to your door within the united states but again guys i'm getting long-winded i know you've got things to do but anyway i bid you adieu from uh loud house hemp here again in beautiful huntsville alabama and we look forward to reviewing something or giving showing you a new product again soon be safe", "O1RhgH2C1es": "hi oh please just done couple years there in a box at the time and the pensioner diesel said well your people was good obviously a bit for today I fought I picked up this a niche boys skills pre-roll they're gonna see a little creaminess trade skills 1.5 grams nature boys all that stuff I think this major points to get always pretty role I was just going to smoke it before you know what might do something a bit different much good it just to see what's inside it you know in the spirit of like you what some of pre-roll West case we reviews on a Instagram see that minding some pretty roles and stuff seen exactly what's inside in that and I see these native boys peels and put quite a bit hard round at the moment a lot of people smoking on them like you know the business and that sort of for you know what let's cut one op see exactly what's inside it yeah it's only gonna be a short video like there wasn't quite as I can see what's inside to make sure they like stem use and often show that which I really don't think that will be you know nature would do the absolute business so I highly doubt it's gonna be anything sort [ __ ] in here but yeah let's get this a pre roll out and see exactly the same sue there is the pre-roll to start of it's a case then I'll show you as well we do have like a little glass I've wanted to be a little bit of weed in mind just unfortunate looking this being a bad stuff well yeah come to my class which obviously I'm gonna keep and reusing stuff damn certainly looks nice certainly smells nice as well really nice or skittle smoke coming up there so sweet through II sort of smell Klim yeah just a as well be is raining outside so I do apologize about that didn't hear that stuff but yeah anyway nature boys skittles pyrrole as you see you there let's get this opened up see what's inside it oh just got that cut open as you can see look all our weed there let's go certainly on Thursdays fictions it's looking at the business Google drive's anything that shouldn't be that's all the pulp order stove our classrooms everything you'll save a little bit in the middle well yeah natureboy skits you know you got break your dad didn't roll really nice damn yeah well I expected just really nice ground-up flour doesn't realize anything in there that shouldn't be in there absolutely don't think I can see anything anyway find it all stem is that just a sugar leaf you know it actually is sugar leaf they're so round itself [Music] yeah maybe it's honey's best I don't feel like a stem nut feels proper song might be Tony's bit stoner part from that looking pretty [ __ ] silent it's a nice ground flour it's not amazing that I put it out suppose for some great skills yeah certainly some diggin dogs as well which is just maybe it's been hand ground other than I probably Grandal to be fair a grinder this certain is it's a nice and well ground and I saw some really nice flower I don't know what I was expecting but I thought we were gonna see obviously I'm a DS need to boys pre-order many boom really nicely and stuff I just for whatever to one see exactly what's in there you know I've seen in the spirit of lots of a pre-roll and West case we review them and an Instagram afford apron assault so we could have another loss certainly seems like nothing untoward at the ordinary there's nice ground or flower Labadie the specs so yeah Nature Boy skills pyrrole well I have to do is we roll this now actually gets focus making it but yeah I must see the flash run quickly as well just so you can see that what and where I'm seeing just saw some really nice brown flour yeah it's we the flash on not really helping us see anything who have already seen things this you see for some nice grams of flour really really nice I rise today from that flush is doing anything frizz really is it yeah natureboy stick it was pretty rolled 1.5 grams maybe those are tiny that was stemming now I'm still not even sure if that was the spending it was proper soft and that look it might have been a tiny little step in there but apart from that it's all obviously for fire very nice ground-up flower so yeah and I we see comes with you little lacerations well fun you know sort of forget about Rosie a nice little feature on the pre-roll yellow flash boots like that grieve that that will certainly get some use out of so time to roll this [ __ ] back up like I said that's your meter boy skills 1.5 grab pre-roll go in just to check everything's what it should be in there yeah sound is always bigger major boys as well ways bringing as that fire and yeah what we do this so maybe different if you wanna see me got some more pretty girls let me know its best pure whatever Gordon actually a lot what's inside but yeah there we go Nature Boy skill was lucky a real soon with some washing your people I just wanted to hop on really quickly so bringing into this video obviously I just got that skittles pre-roll I have actually smoked it now as well well I've actually a build-up to spliffs out of what was left of it to sort of nice press smoke one absolutely fire banging taste to it some of the nicest skills I've tasted and the skills are reviewed the skills of my channel was definitely a ladder flavor the UK grade one and boy I would have said wow this the skittles wasn't necessarily as quite loud a flavor of some skills of smoke before the actual taste was bang on like initially tasted like some skittles like the sweet sort of thing no absolutely [ __ ] banging so yeah obviously I just wanted to hop on and say you know end of this pre-roll video have you seen what's inside there even sorted all right that was a little stem I personally not even sure that was still estab if it was it was certain very small stem but it was also not mud softened but certainly didn't affect you know or wouldn't have affected I'd imagine the way the pre-roll would have smoked yeah because it was been him you made bright white ash as you'd expect from eh boys so yeah I just wanted to hop on and just sort of bring that to an end bring it to a close sort of thing you know like anyway actually fought to the flower when I smoked it what's absolutely banging and if you want to see me got more pre-rolls you know see what's inside him and stuff let me know because I can do that yeah I also just want to say we're nearly at 2,000 subscribers it's a big everyone that subscribed really does mean a lot and we've got a cherry gelato and a dosey doe UK two different trains UK reviews coming soon and also going to do a little sort of 2k celebration sort of adventure maybe sort of video so you've got that to look forward to as well but yeah just want to hop hard and bring this video to a close let you know that that the skills was actually banging to smoke as well rather than us seeing what's inside it but yeah Bingle paper wasn't subscribed like I say it did pundits to me back here with another review more content for ya real soup", "YyeYeKGCpD8": "[Music] we'll then start by initially going very slowly and turning machine up and as you do this you'll start to hear a little bit of electronic sound initially coming to machine as you can see here we're starting a very low vibration and building up that you can see here the butter medium setting with the machine this tends to be the area in which beetles start loading a lot more material in and working that material this is going to start initially packing down and vibrating that material in there now if you start to have an issue with things floating at the top and not packing down properly there's a nice convenient function of this machine which is at the high function as you start turning it up the vibrational difference and what we're doing here this will initially have your product vibrating on top and sync it down that knowing that it can't over pack your free rolls if you have so much waited product on the top so always staying conscious of how much material you're working with at all times will keep your p rolls from being over packed or under packed and occasion from here if I feel comfortable enough with my three roles in pack I will turn the Machine down and off to this low-end all function for safety purposes you can't turn the Machine off as well afterwards so I'm just gonna be moving this machine up to a very good tampering speed here to where we can actually start introducing the product and three rolls I'm not looking for an aggressive speed by any means just something very light to make a nice movement on there and as you can hear that's kind of the sound we're looking for on this very light as I'm moving my material into this I'm stirring it maintaining a good consistency of product if it separates with the Keith on the bottom there and we started getting a lot of big material on top it can make for a very uneven pack and it will make it a very major struggle for you as far as getting all of your joints evenly packed as you so desire as we're going through this and getting an even pack you can see that not many of these are vibrating and moving which is meaning that they're not sinking into the pre-roll any further than what we have it so this is when we're going to step up the motor a little bit and see if it can sink them in as you can see they're starting to rotate further and further and the center ones are starting to have a much more dense pack we want to make sure every single one of these pre rolls is capable of moving on its own to get the pack we so desire I'm not pushing these in by any means but slowly rushing them over across from each other and as you can see a lot of the seeds and the stems are pushing their way to the top through this vibration to do one last finishing product I am going to give it a high volt and as you can see they sunk at his best it good there from there I feel rather confident in my pack and I'm really curious to see where these pre-roll sets so I'm going to unscrew my locking screws here out of convenience and just keeping your parts and pieces together again I highly recommend just keeping these with the tray if you have a container next to you or anything else like that feel free to put the locking nuts in there however do not worry about the washer so much yet until we get this top tray out the top tray I'm gonna move on over to a reclaim Abul bucket over here in which this product is completely viable and ready to go for another run or any other process that you're wishing to do we can set it down here or a nice easy way to get these out is make sure you grab your washers set it aside and tip it upside down as you can see here all these are kind of full still so you can proceed to give them a tap and go forward some of these may be rather densely packed in there so I highly recommend having a ballpoint pen or even metallic chopsticks is actually a very useful tool we use around here as you can see we're ready to go and the material is packed and ready to go right there for another run or whatever you desire to do with it from here I'm gonna be taking out the base the bottom tray pulling it out making sure I'm not hitting any of the pre rolls we're gonna look at those crunches just to make sure and see how even those are going down on the bottom making sure that all our papers are completely even the same size now different papers are gonna have different specifications as far as their tolerances go and being made manufactured so keeping that in mind when we're working with these can give us a lot of different variables so now that the machine is not going to prevent that from here we press down and as we see here before us all our papers are pushed up and forward and ready to go from here they're gonna need a pack as well as a fold on them depending how you like your product you may need to insert a tiny bit more material in one or take out other material and others but then 10% variable is what we're saying with our machine here and you're next a little free roll", "QK6ILN8mHeU": "hey what's going on everybody jay ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com i've got an official west coast we tour review today featuring ember valley one of california's most popular a bud tender favorite across the state i'm very excited today's strain is the berry jack hybrid thc listed at 23.1 percent we've got cultivation date march 2nd 2020 packaging date may 7 2020 so we're looking at cannabis that is you know roughly five and a half months old packaged on may 7 so roughly packaged uh three months and two weeks ago so definitely something that should be good should be terpy should have a lot of flavor i'm personally excited so let's dive right in i will give you guys a one hit review and then two hits with the score per how i usually do it in my joint effort pre-roll series i open the tube as i smell it there's this slight fruity chemically smell but unfortunately it does look like there is a bunch of flower cannabis outside of the pre-roll and in the tube so let's check this out here yeah there's definitely definitely some good some shake coming out of here it looks like it's probably coming out of the mouthpiece which would make sense because as you guys can see there is a complete open circle in this joint mouthpiece there is not a crutch super interesting that there's not a crutch here hopefully it doesn't impact a smoking experience but i'm definitely sure that cannabis is floating out of this and into this too because there's you know because there's no approach we've got a nice evenly stuffed j that is how it came in the joint i did not unravel it yet so i can see that is as this is bouncing around in the tube because it's not twisted flour is leaking out of the joy tube so a little bit of quality control there but it's hard it's tough with the pre-rolls it really is because so much happens um you know sometimes it's only done by hand sometimes brands only use you know machines to stuff them etc i'm not sure at the details so let's just dive right into the smoke shall we the dry hit has flavor but dry hit us flavor and i didn't get scooby snacks in my mouth when i just did that dry hair so that was nice all right here we go you guys ready so on the first hit right there very smooth um not much flavor the aftertaste right now [Music] it's just really that of burnt smoke burnt paper uh a little bit of burnt earthiness i'm not getting a huge terpene profile that i would think would come with berry jack so second hit usually we get the better taste let's check it out yeah so per usual second hit much more flavorful you guys can see i got the cough that time um let's see i'm getting notes of berry i'm getting limonene i got a little bit of pinene again this is the berry jack so i would expect a little bit of that terpinoline a little bit of that pinene the limonene that you would get in a jack herrera cross or a dutch treat or an amnesia hay something along those lines but this berry here gives it this earthiness and those these berry tones i'm really liking it let me hit it one more time and i'll give you guys the official score out of 100 simply because that first taste did not that first hit did not do this justice the second hit was so tasty a third hit is necessary here we go all righty so i have 10 categories for this uh pre-roll review the west coast we tour official official rating system does 100 points ten categories each uh presentation first you know i look at the ember valley tube and i think you know it is a basic joint but i really enjoy the logo the font and the white and red coloring i think it pops so although it is a standard joint tube um you know plastic not glass i'm gonna give them a decent score uh probably you know somewhere in that eight to nine range um simply because you know i do like their red white and black that they do i think it's attractive appeal same thing ember valley has lots of respect and clout here rightfully so and rightfully earned in california so i do feel like the appeal is there again i'd have to go eight to nine closer to a nine the color you know you talk about the color what is color meaning canvas well when i look at the joint and i look at the color of it you know if this joint were wrapped in the same paper and i could tell that the wheat inside was brown well then the color would be bad so color on this is appropriate for a flower pre-roll there's chunks in here i can see some some good bits of pre-roll is an attractive color you know it could be barf brown or green it's just not attractive so the colors there the smell when i opened the tube i said that there wasn't really a terpe smell but to correct myself there was berry notes there was this you know slight gassy musk maybe not gas but this muskiness and i think that's evident that it is one of the very uh notes or natures of this strain the berry jack so smell i'll give it you know maybe a high six maybe a low seven now when i talk about the taste the first hit not so great and as a consumer that first hit is usually everything that's going to determine whether or not they really want to keep smoking it or how impactful that that experience you know how powerful that memory really is so taste with this i'm gonna give it an you know a nice eight to two you know eight point two five to a five probably closer to eight point two five i like it i wish there was more jack to it um that first hit kind of gave me a little bit of a sour puss taste you know what i mean it just wasn't the best so i'll give it the 8.25 on the taste for this uh it tasted good i don't want you guys to you know be get this get this the wrong way it does taste very good um potency potency potency potency when we're talking potency that's thc 23.1 this is a sativa i'm talking talking talking i got lots of energy i think the potency is right on point um it's hard for me to give it at a 10 out of 10 when the thc scores are low but i do feel that the thc the terpenes are you know creating a nice entourage effect i can feel my heart kind of racing and pumping due to the sativa nature the sativa hybrid nature of this so potency i'll give it the i'll give it the 8.75 maybe even the nine i think it's right up there with where it should be potency-wise for this strain um experience you know i'll give it a nine i'll give it a nine because you know these pre-rolls can range anywhere between 13 and like 18 bucks sometimes you might even pay 20 for the grand but that's that's pretty rare so with that said the experience for me i feel is appropriate for the price appropriate for the smoke the strain i'd say the experience for me is a perfect ah maybe you know i'll give the experience a nine i'll give the experience a nine and the reason why i give it a nine is because again there was some some scooby snacks throughout the j it wasn't twisted perfectly uh the ash is looking good um but that first hit was rough now more information available is a new category this year for us the reason why we added that is because as a consumer i want to be able to look up more information about the strain or more information about the brand you know instagram facebook linkedin etc so lamber valley has a strong internet presence there could always be more information about the strain and pre-rolls you know helping me to guide it you know lighter versus you know the hemp wicks etc so more information available i'm gonna give them a solid eight uh i do feel like more like i say most brands can improve on this more more information should always be available the day that a brand gets a 10 out of 10 is the day that i'm celebrating and filming a video just shouting out that brand hasn't happened and what i recommend i would absolutely recommend this berry jack hybrid from amber valley i feel like it's worth smoking you know 10 out of 10 times i just wish this particular joint was a little bit more less messy you know the pre-roll being kind of undone at the tip kind of impacts it but yes 10 out of 10 i would recommend an overall score for me ah when i taken things all in consideration and just to give it an overall rating i'm gonna stick with a solid nine um i think you know the strain the flower the actual cannabis side of things made it a very positive experience but i definitely feel it's important to highlight some of the other things you know the scooby snacks um you know there could always be more information available online uh there aren't actually any terpenes listed here on the joint tube so i feel like that is kind of a missed opportunity that could be still capitalized on over the you know next few years so overall score 9 out of 10 this is a high quality pre-roll i highly recommend you guys visit any of the dispensaries in norcal or socal that carry amber valley there's literally i believe 150 to 250 dispensaries that carry amber valley maybe more if you guys have any questions about this product any of my ratings or rankings please feel free to drop a comment and send me a dm i would love to talk with you about my thinking about why you know why i chose these numbers and this you know the strain et cetera so appreciate you guys for all the love west coast view tour 2020 make sure you guys go follow ember valley

say this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't wanna show you my personal information hi yo what's up guys Ronnie really back at juice I would know this frame review for you guys in this video it's been a minute since I did a any strain review video or anything like this so um if you guys want to see more of these videos let me know down below in the comments and I'll definitely get him out because you know I like doing these videos but um I wasn't even planning on doing this review or then I was just thinking like I haven't done a review of eating I know why I said [ __ ] it why not these are pretty cool so let me do every one them so I got um two packs of these um dutchy pretty rolls but they actually called them um and it is cigarettes so um I don't know I just thought these are pretty cool because ever since I was like young and I first started smoking weed I always like at least for me was like always a dream like the day that I'd be able to like walk until I can Circle K or you know I don't know if you have support cases where you guys live a gas station you wanna me and I like buy a packet like cigarettes but like weed cigarettes and then I mean so we finally got some cannabis cigarettes so that's pretty lit in my opinion um but yeah I got this mo dispensary go ahead and get them from a [ __ ] gas station or nothin but still [ __ ] lit what hopefully one day they'll be gas stations but this video will be reviewing the Northern Lights one if you guys want to see a review on the purplish green let me know down below in the comments and I'll get back to ya and that's my stupid fire concentrate it's right now so if you guys want to see a wax review let me know down below in the comments and I'll get that out too but yeah let's just hop into this so duchies Northern Lights cannabis cigarettes basically just pre-rolls but they're [ __ ] on fire but yeah let's go over the pathogen real quick so this is the front of it pretty basic pretty simple but it's [ __ ] I don't know it gets the point across and it's the open enemy and so it says duchies right there Northern Lights obviously it's the indica made with 100% but source from premium genetics and then it comes with six potent 0.5 mm cannabis cigarettes and Isis keep it keep out of reach of children yeah 6.5 pre-rolls in the back of it just says Northern Lights as a pure indica and is arguably the most famous strain in the world yeah that's definitely one of the most famous strains so that's the back of it pretty plain and simple and in the side of the box has had the Arizona Department of California this side just has some other warning on it nothing else crazy yeah these road forty-four dollars plus tax but they actually that's a little bit expensive in my opinion for like six point five three rolls that's like three grams three grams for 45 bucks that's a little bit expense that's not expensive but on the pricey side you know what I mean um I've got these when everybody won't get one free so I paid 45 bucks for two of them I'm still like $22 each so can't complain I paid about 20 bucks for this I don't know if I would pay that full price 45 bucks for them that's a little bit pricey maybe if I needed something convene I was going on with the trip was something I'm one of them maybe I would but like just done like the everyday occasion I don't think I really see myself kicking these up too often but they are really sick so I already smoked five of these they only have one left for you guys so you open it up it comes in these little bags or this little bag and it's to keep it fresh I'm pretty sure oh I didn't notice that this is just now but I guess it comes with a sticker I don't know how I missed that but yeah that's pretty cool I'm so a little sticker mm-hmm yes that's kind of cool so you can like kinda it says Northern Lights all the time in because you can like try out all the flavors and like make a little collection wall I don't know do something cool don't mean that I mean but they normally it comes in a purple bag I'm assuming for this indica I guess it's the tables would probably come in like a yellow bag or something I don't know the only meaning so we got one to one and they're normally they'll be like if you if it's a fresh pack so I haven't opened this one yet so I'm gonna open this in the next review so you see what it's like when I open a fresh new sealed box you see I'm saying completely schools so there'll be 6/6 ones in that one but this one only has one left let's multiply already but you take it out a little small but it's hey let's [ __ ] pack completely tight in there so my first time taking these out I was like kind of thinking like them like these are kind of small you and I mean I don't know if they're gonna be like they're gonna do me like that they're gonna really give me the lid off for just like one y'all know saying but they not they actually do you just this oh oh yeah they probably like one of the most potent pre-rolls i've ever had they're also um really packed like they packed perfect when you select even though this is only make point 5 and it's like pretty small it's gonna burn for about oh it's gonna burn for about 10 minutes or so so it's [ __ ] fire yeah so this is the pre-roll give you guys one more look at it and then the crutch even has their little logo in it so that's kind of cool yeah that's the joint nothing else really to it um I forget all the top of my head what this was tested at but I want to say it was about 24% 25% but I lost the sticker sorry yeah let's just get into smoking this now if you guys are smoking along I forgot a lighter I think I got one so yeah a soft bunch of this now though hope you guys are smoking long hope you guys are smoking something dank and if you guys are cheers let's get it so dogs in the background I don't know if you hear that let's get it shoes all right so yeah this is [ __ ] fire you can see already and just burn them pretty perfect not running nothing at all so the taste on this is like so far you can tell us that you can definitely tell us made from straight yo my buds they're not using the trim and no [ __ ] like a lot of pre-roll is doing on I mean definitely some fire and this a pre-roll that thing has a pungent like Northern Light stage like um definitely like that classic indica pungent like skunky taste um definitely fire now like and like I said before like these things like these joints even though they're so small they burn for a minute and they burn perfect like you see that [ __ ] like it's I never really look at the ash till just now the ash is not the best color you want to see one smoking a joint but I have seen a lot worse so that's not I don't know let me know what you guys think about ash down below in the comments but you can see how it's smoking it's not running at all smoking pretty much perfect you know I mean like perfect the taste them like it just has like a pungent funky taste like nothing like too crazy like the taste isn't like too good I mean it tastes fire it tastes like some fire bud like that I thought if I roll up a joint myself it would taste better than this but I don't know if it really all depends I don't know it's just personal preference and it all depends I don't know I haven't really smoked flour too much I smoked many concentrates no but he's good but not like what I remember you know I mean but it's definitely definitely has that classic identity that Classica indica like you mean like you see me stuttering over my words a little bit definitely getting kind of tired relaxing yeah just classic indicate indica high so let me go over the raisins but I'll read this real quick usually in these reviews I do like five riddance log over the package in that age the smoke the high the price point not like give like an overall review so um the packaging I thought this packaging was pretty cool it's just I got a little like a cigarette box but like a [ __ ] for a week I mean so it's pretty [ __ ] dope I thought it was lit I like the concept but like I like the idea behind it so um I give it a four point five out of five I just feel like they could have added like a little bit more information about the strange like that on the box because it doesn't really say too much about the strain or any information at all you know - but it says Northern Lights and that's it but besides for that I thought the pack pretty dope so let me know what you guys thought of it down below in the comments and if you disagree with me or you're with me on any of these just let me know down below in the comments but the taste on this um they gave like a four out of five I think that's pretty accurate because like I said it's not the for a pre-roll it's [ __ ] fire a secret age for super tasty um like on for a pre-roll it's like top notch but I feel like if I just bought some top-notch flower like a Potter 8th for 45 and rolled my own joint it probably tastes better than this and if you're fatter than this you know what I mean but it's fire for sure the smoke they looked the way it smokes you guys seen like this thing rips like you know some of those pre-rolls dispensaries are giving you they don't even brown right don't hit right yeah but this burns like perfect all the way down to the grudge this smokes like it his [ __ ] yeah you guys been seeing so this the way it smokes I give it a 5 out of 5 because it's like it's ripping you out I mean you should smack him the high the high is up there but I got kind of stuck between a four and a 4.5 out of 5 so I gave it like a four point two out of five because it's [ __ ] fired but like I said I definitely had some more to fire like for 45 bucks I feel like I could get like a way far like a way better eighth the only mean I roll my own [ __ ] so I feel like they're paying more for like the package and just like that the looks initiated this static of it you know I mean but it's definitely fired the next thing was um yes I'll give it like a four point two out of five for the high the price point I gave like a four out of five it's a little bit pricey for something like I hit like three grams applied for 45 bucks it's a little bit pricey but like if you're going off like if you need something convenient like it going on a trip or something like that that's [ __ ] a good option for you because I mean they're [ __ ] they're really good they they're coat when they burn [ __ ] perfect this you guys see I mean everything about them is good but they're just a little bit pricey so come if you don't mind paying a little bit sure I guess I go for it but me I couldn't see myself on them unless I was like going on a trip and I or I needed something convenient everybody sneaky use some [ __ ] I mean because I feel like I think I got that I already said I can definitely get away far for $45 and roll my own [ __ ] but if you don't know how to roll I guess over these or something but the price point I need like a four out of five so that makes the overall rating about like a four out of five but um these are definitely fired so if you ever see them in your area duchies that she's pretty rose that can we pick him up and try them out um if they're having the buy one get one free deal definitely pick him up and try him out place uh 20 bucks for three grams can't go wrong as fired like this video and want to see more reviews I'm gonna down below in the comments and if you want to see a review on these on [ __ ] dream big rolls there's something I'm going to comments to I'll get that out and add some like fireworks I could do every review on so let me know down below in the comments if you like doing some more review videos again but so much for that thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] you're gonna count with you Mitch Enron you're a so", "Ge0ORhYJmoc": "what's up guys welcome back to Kush Coast and today we're gonna talk about using your 120 sight cones machine and how the order forum a lot of people get confused on what cones to order and basically they come in different styles you can get cones Raw's these are the raw versions they're brown they're opposed to be organically made or whatever these are the basic white cones this is a company that you can buy it's called J wear and they make cones as well they're pretty cheap but when you buy from J we're compared to buying from the cones company the cones companies gonna ask you what sides you want them in small that it added a large when you're buying half grams you're gonna want the point six otherwise known as the smalls and these ones will do the half grams and then if you're ordering for the one grams you're gonna want the one point three I don't know if you can see that there gives you a size one point three that's for your actual gram if you use the gram ones it's really hard to get a gram in them so they call them one point threes or they're a hundred and nine millimeters the hundred and nine millimeter is the way you need to know if you're ordering from other companies like this J wear because they don't come in sizes point six point that it it comes in reefer King size and party size but the hundred and nine millimeter is the actual size that gets you that one gram but if not the ninety eight millimeter will do half grams pretty good but you get a lot of extra paper just so you know so basically some of the things you guys are gonna need beside your cones in the machine you're gonna need a grinder to grind the product I prefer these coffee grinders like this these suckers right here get the cannabis to the exact consistency you want for it to be able to burn smoothly you can over grind with these real easy and just make piles of Keith but if you just tag it a couple of times which we'll show you in a minute it keeps the product real consist and it helps surface stims which you can pull out later of course cones when you buy the machine it comes with one of these scrubbers and before you reload this every time you need to make sure you clean it otherwise you get Jam ups so this is a real important tool to make sure you don't lose you're gonna want a pair of tweezers in case some of them get stuck down in there and you can tweezer them out if you have problems this is a good emergency tool to go to you're gonna want a couple of different size rods or pins or whatever to be able to poke down inside of the cones and help pack them in case they got air spots in them these work really good we just got a piece of bamboo nap in we've been using them for a long time if you guys want and you guys don't have that much product you guys could cut off little pieces of card like I did here and this card will actually fit on this combs machine let's see it goes like right here well maybe over here there it is so it goes like that and then we got another one with an angle and we put it like that and you can block off holes this way and only fill in so many without losing product through the rest of the holes a couple crappy old business cards work really good for that but they also work good for stirring and making sure that you can fill all the cones so these work really good we got an old film container here and the reason why we have this film container is because you're gonna need a skel if you're doing it for shops to get them the exact weight so this helps hold the cone up and not spill all the stuff out of it as you're weighing them so you could go through and weigh them real fast like that but these are a couple of the essentials that you guys are gonna need besides some product for us we've got some gorilla glue these are some buds that work quite pretty enough to go into the sacks for people there's a bunch of smalls in here but so we're gonna make these into joints so go to waste we also got some green queen and we have a bag of pitbull and even though it's really good smoke it just it got real lar fee it didn't get real dense like we wanted it to so this all get rolled into joints it didn't make it into the bag so a couple of things you guys want to know to start you want to really clean the table really good otherwise it'll go from a one-man job to a two-man job on the bottom of this cones machine right here it have suction pads these suction pads are crucial for you to get through this once you stick this sucker down and the spot you want it at and make sure it sucked down real good to where it's not gonna come off leave it there don't keep picking it up if you keep picking it up you're gonna cover the table and keep and when you cover the table and keep it won't stick no more and if it doesn't stick you'll never be able to pick this spring up on the inside and be able to turn it like this it'll keep picking up with it and then you can't two-hand it and pick it up this spring is real strong in here so you want to make sure that it's tucked down real good so you can actually turn it okay so now I'm gonna go ahead and get out some cones and then I'll show you guys how we load it all right so to load your cones machine I'm going with these point sixes the this order calls for a lot of handout pre-rolls so most of the handout pre-rolls you get in the shop are gonna be 0.6 s or half grams those are the ones they usually hand out the gram size joints we'll do in a minute but basically you grab this stack of cones like this and then you can real easily just walk along and drop them down inside of these holes like this and it makes it really fast to go through it and dump them you're gonna pull out the little paper stints that they give you and you're just gonna go through and load this whole machine down like this until you get done so I'm gonna go through and load this and then I'll show you guys how we do deal with the grind all right real quick just you guys know we filled this in the down position if you can see here it's touching that's the down position and then when you go to lift it up that's the up position it sinks them all down to where they're down inside of there lower than the grade of the actual top so that way when you put the Cannabis on there or your material it'll go down inside there so now I'm gonna show you guys what it we do to grind it and the consistency you're looking for a couple of things that forgot to mention you're gonna want a couple of Tupperware containers we're gonna want one for grinding your product into then you're gonna want one to put the finished cones in and this one we'll use later but for now we're gonna roll with this one so basically we're gonna get our coffee grinder out and start grinding product let me get that set up so I could show you what it looks like so for me I like to go through it and try to remove as much stem as possible and get rid of all your chunks of stem those will end up plaguing you later when you go to try to tighten joint down and twist the tops those little pieces of stem will start poking through it so I'm gonna just keep breaking this up like this getting it inside of this grinder trying to pull all the big chunks that I can find anything hard real pokey you want it gone but make sure you got gloves on so you're not you know making everybody's smoke all dirty dead skinned and you don't get your hands super sticky or black this products real sticky and it'll ruin your hands real fast it'll make it tore you can't touch the papers without ruining them so you want to make sure that you get your hands covered with some kind of gloves for this process it's just better all the way around and sanitary for the product as well you don't need to fill this very full of course you don't want to be sitting here all day long doing tiny bits at a time but I mean you want to make sure that it's got a good chunk in it just not super packed to where gonna make it hard and you have to fight the lid on it so once I get it about like that I'm gonna throw my cap on and this only takes like a couple of seconds you'll listen and I'll let you hear it there's one and then I'll do one with a shake then I'm gonna open it up and you can already see that it's pretty ground down pretty fine so a consistency like this is really nice but you have to still be sure that there ain't no bigger chunks like this these little chunks like this will get stuck in there and mess you up real bad so you're just gonna go through it and break them up make sure and I move the product from one side of this box to the other just to make sure there ain't no big chunks that did get broke up like that one or any big stem that you see you're gonna want to make sure it's broke up as well any big stems but that's basically the grind right there then I take this and I slide it down and then I go on to the next one you can see all the kief in it there's a lot of Keef in that if you go too long all you will make is piles of Keef there won't you won't have any mass to it so when you go to smoke the joy what happens is this one and either gets so compacted that it doesn't want a bird or two it'll start running oil all the way down your face when you smoke on it it gets so tight that the oil just starts pouring out the end of the cone and you don't want that so I'm gonna go through this bag right here and knock out as much as I can and I'll show you guys what it looks like when I get it all browned up okay here you can see our consistency it's fine grain powder like tobacco we removed all the stems like we talked about you need about 65 to 70 grams to do 120 1/2 grammars you always want to go about 5-6 grams over so they're not light but plus you're gonna lose some even with your scale on the point system which we'll show you later so I got my consistency ground up set that off to the side say this is the area I'm working in I already threw my pile of stems away you're gonna want to take a moist paper towel and wipe this down real good and make sure it's clean you're also going to want to touch the bottom of your suction cups and make sure they're clean and moist and there's nothing stuck to them then you're gonna set it down and you're gonna make sure it's planted on the table solid so that way when you go to pick it up later and turn it it doesn't come up off of the table but now that we know it's on there and it's already in the up position not the down position where the white papers showing but up position am i picking it up and locking it into place it keeps the papers from getting destroyed now taking the old card I like to use these business cards and I like to sprinkle it on here and try to go pretty evenly and you're not gonna fill them all right the second you're just gonna spread some out across the tops and make sure some little pieces fall down in there so that way when we do the first beating you can make sure that you get it all the way down to the cones filter at the bottom the little crutch so I'm just gonna get some down inside of these like this and once I'm confident that I spilt a little bit in each one and that each one's got a little tiny bit in it I'm gonna go ahead and go through like this and if you do it light-handed don't go Bam Bam Bam just like it actually gives you a better pack than if you're slamming on it real hard then I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna add some more and this time I'm gonna get a little fuller and a little fuller until they're all filled up you're just gonna keep repeating this process and if you do it if you take the time to do it right the first time you won't have to bunch you have to fix nobody likes having to go through and fix a whole bunch of these combs it sucks so to keep the process fast it just do it right the first time and you won't have no problem so I had it a little bit and add some more product and I'm gonna do this until I know that all the paper are covered that each one of them have some to the top of that white paper in there I don't know if you can see that with the camera but you got to make sure that it gets all the way up to there it looks like I need to grind some more let me have a second and I'll be right back guys so I got more ground we're gonna get them all filled up a little fast make sure we get all of our holes filled and you can look down in them and see which ones didn't get it which ones did and of course I didn't weigh this product which I probably should have then I would have known I had enough but I don't got time I got orders to fill so I'm just flying through it as fast as I can we still have thwack sirs to do which I'll make a video on that that's where we take whacks and then keep rolling which I'm sure everybody's already knows how to do but we get so many questions why not make a video about it right and of course we don't get paid for by combs or anybody else for any of these videos we post you guys know nowadays YouTube confiscates all the money and it doesn't allow anybody to do any type of merchant handling or any type of third party marketing or anything like that for anything with cannabis on it they uh ixnay your videos monetization so we don't get paid for this we just do this out of you know share and share alike and this culture was based on that so all these secret keepers nowadays you can keep your secrets and Joe money alright that's looking pretty good we got just about all of them full some of them are a little short but they'll make up for it later as we're pulling weight out of them cuz they're always gonna be over so you're gonna be taking quite a bit out as you go [Music] alright now when you go to the turn it it's stuck to the table really good and they're gonna all stand up for you just like that right there now you're gonna go and pick through them and you're gonna throw them on a scale to see what they weigh and that's why we have this little cup here and we set that on the scale before we turn our scale on to tear it I also like to keep another cup on the graphic pass this one over here because as I pull them these way approximately for the half gram joints about 0.2 so at point two you need to make sure that this says point 7 or 0.8 and in California and Oregon to be able to say that you're selling it to a shop and it's medicine you need to make them weigh exactly so that way they're not getting a messed up dosage scale so point 7 is what they really want them to be at so you're just gonna take over here and make yourself a little pile because as you can see when we shook this thing it kicked out all kinds of product around it so as soon as we're done we're gonna clean it all to the front of us get it back into our bag or our Tupperware and clean the table again and start over again but this one still says point eight so I got to get it down now it jumped two points there it is right there that's close enough okay so you're gonna take your poker you got two different pokers you're gonna take your poker and just to get you a nice flat top to be able to grab it with three fingers and you're gonna do a shake like this and that shake is gonna tighten it up you can hold it up to the light and look through it and you can see that the product made it all the way down to the bottom and there's no big air gap here and if there is an air gap you just keep shaking it until it comes out when you crease it with your three fingers it's gonna make a little try thing like that kind of like a triangle right once you got it like that you're gonna give it a gentle twist like this and then you're gonna shake it again to help tighten that twist into place and when you're done it should look just like that right there to keep your scale from being on for long periods of time though the trick is to go through pull them out one at a time weigh them make sure that they get their weight right and set them right here in this jar fill up a jar like this first and then go through and tighten them all up after you're done it'll make it a lot faster for you in the long run and you could have multiple jars and go through the whole thing real fast but unless you have somebody else here helping you and you're doing this by yourself this is the best way to do it right here all right guys I'm gonna go on to finish it in this out I'll show you guys how many we get and what they look like when we're all done all right made it through all 120 it took me about 28 minutes 29 minutes or so and just from going from here skelling I'm dumping the excess inside of the cup dropping them in here boom boom boom until I had my cup full shut my scale off take them twist all the tops throw them inside of my Tupperware that's what a hundred and twenty look like it would normally go straight from here twist them put them in a two sticker label um and then put them in off to the side but this company doesn't need them to so there is going in Tupperware and they're gonna be delivered like that and the tough work so they stay dry and they don't dry out any further before you guys even get to this process though you guys should practically roll one see how it smokes and make sure that it burns properly before you get to this stage where you're making hundreds of them if you get some cannabis that people grow or if you didn't grow it yourself and you're purchasing it they didn't flush it properly the joints won't burn right and you don't want to make hundreds of them and hand them out and get a lot of complaints about the way they burn I mean the number one reason for them not burning right is because of the way people dry and cure it but if they don't flush properly that's another reason why to moist a weed won't grind white right or it won't burn right so you want to make sure that it's at the right dried consistency to be able to grind up nicely not so dry that it's you know turn straight to dust but about four to six percent is the average moisture level that you're going to be looking for my next stage will be after this is to clean this to repeat the process and I'll show you guys how I do that alright so real quick for you guys to clean this the simple way is to make sure everything's down in the holes first using a card to scrape all any big chunks that's leftover then you take your brush and you go through and you brush off the top make sure everything goes down on the inside like this here make sure it's good and clean then you're gonna make sure that it's in the upright position not in the bottom closed position that way this can go all the way through and clean really good I like to choose a section this is in section so find a section start at a section and roll with it and just fly through it like this right here and this is pushing everything down to the bottom and this will make sure that when you put the next set of cones and they don't stick to the walls that could be a real big problem if you get them all caked in there you can't get them out you end up breaking a bunch of papers this is the best way to do it just like this right here all right so we got it all cleaned out I don't know if you could pan the camera down here and see inside here all that that's in there so we got our tough water dish over here I'm gonna just dump my extras in there I'm gonna take this bad boy lean it over on its side like this so I could see down it I don't know if you guys can see in there and then I'll take my brush and I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna scrub this bottom plate off with the brush and get it really good and clean and try to get all that stuff out of there and onto the table it's weird holding it like this for your guys's angle but uh you got to make sure you get the thing super clean you don't want this thing getting gummed up it'll gum up real fast on you if you have to you have to clean it with alcohol or something that's fine clean it with alcohol but then make sure you let it dry out for a long time before you use it again because the key itself will stick to everything like glue if it sits there the longer it sits there it'll stick so hard it'll be real hard to get off so the trick is is to go through this as fast as you can and try to get you know all of the product back off of the off of this 120 sight combs machine so it's not stuck to it like glue then you could give it a couple of days it's clean set it off to the side out of the way try not to get the two or the three little suction cups dirty you got your tongue over here and you look at this right here see how it automatically keeps up and starts to clump up that's because it's got a lot of oils in it get your card out scrape it all right back into your tough wire and you're gonna repeat the process again and again and again so you're done with your tada but you want to make sure that you clean this table off really good I got me a paper towel right here and I'm gonna get it wet and I'll use that to read moisten the table again and make sure that it's tucked down real good because any of these little particles right here they're gonna mess up your guys's suction with the suction cup so grab a paper towel and then go through and just give it a good wipe picking up all those little green particles flip this bad boy over make sure my suction cups are clean stick it to the table make sure it's stuck now you can turn it BAM back in business time to reload and go again and basically that's all there is to how you do this 120 sight cones machine it's real simple it's made out of real hard plastic and if you can afford it I know they're expensive but if you guys can afford it this is the way to go for mass producing joints the cones works good they got crutches in them so you don't get cannabis or tobacco or whatever you're using in your mouth and these are the subway we prefer to do it if we're gonna be doing them by the you know buttload but thanks for watching be sure to LIKE and subscribe and we'll catch you guys on the flip side stay lifted and stay safe peace", "bBaF5_NmQzs": "we're going to keep this role in here episode two of this 12 episode saga is that overstating calling it a saga is that even the appropriate word how are they all right you're watching the song I did you the saga continues pre-rolls major seller for just about everyone that sells them I want to show you guys innovative ways to package your pre rolls again 2019 being that critical year that you have to stand out you have to get your share of those millions of consumers who are coming into the market for the first time you got to separate yourself from just the traditional pop top and you should subscribe to the channel too because we're going to be showing you eco packaging innovation in 2019 and other stuff to Ingrid without further ado let's let's show the audience some pre-roll options if you are a dupe tube user and you want to get away from that but you're not quite ready a way that you could do that is to get a punch and put your tubes into a pouch and then you just have a little bit of an upscale way to market your product a little on the fence with that idea but I could even see that being that had like a really like premium or like luster looking pouch with like nice felt a nice like velvet exactly that could be really with like as gold hot stamp or something for more premium trim like we talked about before that fits for it you know you're telling a story it's say for example similar to the first batch of naturalistic feel to granola vibe it's now in the woods vibe but you have a bunch of pop tops you want to make additions to it so whether it's a craft label or a craft sleeve or putting it inside of that pouch its additions that we can make to alter the vibe that you're giving and then you know the next stage is we can really give a custom feel to exactly what you're looking for to build it from scratch but we can do those alterations in those modifications if you guys have already made purchases to get it more on point with what the store that you guys are trying to tell okay another way to move up from the duke tube is with these four tubes which you can get in any size and we can do all kinds of finishes on them this one has spot UV on it the clear varnish that adds some shine and it has a hot stamp on it this one is using a spot pearl varnish which is has a slight sparkle to it you make these any size and something you're going to hear also that we hear all the time it's just about how you keep these fresh so we do with people putting the doob tubes inside of tubes like that or you can put it in a little baggie as well - if you think freshness is going to be concerned if you're not moving through the product really quickly really popular for people that are trying to get away from the plastic look still have that really cool you know cylinder a cylindrical look but completely made out of board recycled board so really with a nice alternative to the classic plastic duty alright next up it's a folding box that has a soft touch of varnish on it so when you hold it in your hand it automatically feels a little bit more elevated or a lot more elevated than any kind of standard do to be folding boxes are far more affordable in terms of cost and like rigid more premium boxes so you might think oh I can't afford a box for my pre rolls because you know the price point isn't high enough but folding boxes like that that's like a 25 to 50 cent box depending on the volume that you're ordering versus the rigid ones are gonna be more dollar than two dollars depending on of course the specs of what it is it's simpler and more complex but don't rule out boxes for even low ticket items because there's ways to do them really affordably Manny I want to get you on the show before the Animus but what do you think about what have you found people like using on the pre-rolls has it been more like your customers have been more folding boxes rigid boxes tins what are you kind of seeing in the market so for like a single that's where I think people are more cautious on the pricing but for packs that's a higher retail price point Melissa welcome to the show that's the vault box you guys said a lot of you have seen that child-resistant certified you need a key or the flat object or pencil the true versatility of the vault box that's a beautiful rigid box no like buttons hanging off easy for consumers consumers love it and perfect for a pack perfect for a pack it's another fan favorite we've shown on previous episodes of the cannabis packaging show whose creation was this one is this a ingrid or had the creation you you come on to the show and hold the product is a family place its own this was another customer who had due to dupe tubes that they were trying to elevate the look of so they went for a larger version in this box there's an insert inside that is holding their tubes it's holding three so that you can do it in two Kasim sativa hybrid you could do a morning afternoon and night you could do a blank blank and blank three different strains whatever it is so these are ways to sell the product often the packaging is going to dictate how you're actually selling in your business strategy so those are always fun conversations that have when people are saying aren't so like not just making the packaging but what's the strategy behind how we're going to sell it gold plated tin gold plated if you want to go with like you know $100 pack of pre-roll isn't really make an impact you got the gold plated tin it's just more when we talked about we cater to all markets and Gucci's of the world the marque mass markets of the world if you're going for that vibe you're telling that story you want to elevate your packaging to the highest level if you're not and you don't then we find affordable ways to still tell your story and if you need a child-resistant sliding tin go to contempo packaging comm and drop your email in the box and we will send you when it's ready we'll send you an email when it's ready got quite a few see our innovations in the pipeline Jody's excited about them I could sell with with a quark trap which is a nice way to package on your pre-roll and then you can put it in something else these things are wildly popular my thing with these is like okay for how do you fit all the compliance information on them so like is it going to be a label that Flags or do you put it in a box I think sometimes I see brands they have a really nice primary package they're not considering compliance and labeling and then the end result because it's not done you know thoughtfully is the actual consumer gets something that doesn't really look too professional kind of looks tattered this is one example of something that you could do with those vials just put it into a nice box like this which would showcase them as well because this is clear acetate that look of the product being suspended is really cool doing it with clear inserts and showcasing the product so it's not really competing with the packaging but really the focus of what you're trying to show off Nick what do you like in terms of pre-roll packaging what are some of your you know that you're selling to into the market or even as a consumer what's like good pre-roll packaging yeah so I really like the cardboard spiral tubes I think it's you know a changeup from the the typical pop tops and we've had a lot of people very interested in them recently and and we can dress up the wrap with different print print techniques and make it you know really be able to tell your story we're constantly bringing you know boatloads of shipments in here so again tacking on to some of the shipments that we're bringing in so you don't have to be afraid only over a couple of thousand pieces of flying it in and if you have the time we can tack it on to one of our many boat shipments so that we can add you to the large retailers that we're doing and make it much more affordable than if you were just on your own we could do a whole show in 2019 about projections and how do you buy efficiently and how do you not just buy when you have an immediate need because you incur unnecessary costs but that is not the purpose of these shows so angry please continue all right last two things to show our non contempo items but definitely worth showing because they are very nice this is a lipstick tube that is a push to release feature fresh seal to the clicking and has embossing on the top stay tuned and this last is a box this is from Milan so we shopped the market in like big fashion cities to stay on top of trends and this was just a gorgeous box that obviously the dimensions would be different for pre-rolls but I'm just thinking like that would be that's like a game-changer that I think sure that under the Shelf and you've got like like a pre-roll or like a simple box versus that thing in terms of making an impact and getting people to notice you that's the kind of like thought process I think we should be having I think it's important to also consider what your consumers gonna do with the product so in the case of a bigger box that's gonna go on a coffee table that's gonna be a showpiece for a party they're having it's Christmas time you're having a Christmas gathering everyone gets their own pre-roll another thing that's popular in the market right now if it's a three pack five pack seven pack of pre-rolls where is that going when your consumer consumer leaves the store they're going to a concert they're going to a show it needs to fit in a purse it needs to fit in your pocket so those are the types of things you need to think about in terms of the actual end user so to speak and what they'll actually be doing with and how does that add to the overall experience that that packaging provides so keep that in mind as well just drop in great points right here knowledge boy I love it all right guys any other pre-roll stuff from the showroom that is worth showing our wonderful audience Ron's coming up for the display show drunken building displays longer than I've been alive so we have full boxes once more about the lux and they're really clean packaging that's soft touch finish with a nice hot stamp on it all right good stuff

some whatever car look luminous smells good it has a nice smell to it this is a Jack Frost I've never heard of Jack Frost it's everything mmm it's not loud but I guess that's because it's already in the pre-roll but it does have a nice smell to it not really kind it's earthy it has a slight little bit of pain but mainly earthy it smells good I like it a lot but some reason I'd be seeing people do this when they get their pre-rolls or anyone's they go yeah let's get to it I smoked all day and I'm high I'm risk to smoke so salute to health wealth and self self-love is the best love if you haven't heard the words I love you today then get to the closest meeting and say so I love you self you know why because you can't expect anyone else to love you or love anyone else if you don't love

we go there we go okay why is this thing not pulling right I'm pulled in with this now pulling it's tasting good about an ounce net in this time it's not pulling good I'm a freak it a little bit as we

even good that Ash is nice and white that's in the CBD is the mother cannabinoid to me it it's silly CBG is silky it's like it's like the creamer to the coffee it just it's a very small smoke cpg it's coming in now CBG gives me a very calm feel a very chill relaxed feel after not smoking all day this is what's up I also just meet personally I like CVG more in the afternoon I don't know why I see me Jesus for real for real relaxes me this Jack Frost is pretty tasty it tastes good um the flavor profile is not really strong only because I'm having to pull so hard on this pre row never go they are nails in now that's that smooth creamy taste that I like that's what I'm used to with CNG and it's this Jack brows I don't know why but it has a familiar taste it's reminding me of another strain I can't quite think of it but it's good I like it I was hidden now now is hitting the arm it still has that earthy taste this is gonna sound weird right but it it it kinda has a little bit of I don't know if it's the CBD or just the strain Jack Frost but it has like a little bit of that papaya taste to it if you like retires then you know exactly what I'm talking about very smooth though I mean CBG is very smooth it's tasting it's very smooth very tasty okay okay jack brows okay then okay then I see you I see you I see you Dozo Dozo CBD I see you even though I think this is more for the afternoon it's so smooth that I want it with a glass of coffee I want it with some coffee because city is just a smooth Strang I can't wait to try the Silver Haze in the electro and this is the CBD CBD to CBD that seems like that's gonna be good as well but the pre-roll the jackpot is the little eagle the only thing I would say though does the flower taste good when please make sure you put the notice to law enforcement in there please make sure you put the seal ways in there always every single time every single time - you may not want to roll the pre-roll so tight because I took about it

what's up welcome to my channel welcome back to my channel today I'm going to be doing a review on this CBD pre-roll joint vegan on my name's Robin change get you changed big buddy range no we're not the same I found my local smoke shop so some people ask me can I get it CBD without ordering it online like how can I just go pick it up smoke it today you know spark in them you can pretty much pick and pick it up anywhere I've seen it at gas stations I've seen I've seen it at smoke shops like dispensaries you name it CBD is pretty much everywhere they even have CBD stores in different places when I first seen it I thought it was just one pre-roll like I couldn't see what it says but guess what it is - because secret nature is what the packaging looks like I think it is so freakin cute it's called frosted cush and it is to see your city rose to free Rose that our CBD and it says in the comment you suck you how they think how they say later on there and at the bottom it says organic cannabis flower so we got to see what secret nature's all about I've never tried them before or anything they actually are from Rogue Valley Oregon hmm so if I ever go to Oregon if I like I might have to go and check this out but this is what it looks like and then it just has a little tube this is so cute like you can keep your ashes in here if you want you can keep your yeah joints whatever you smoke but it is to pre-rolls in I swear this stuff smells so freakin good this is what they look like what the tips look like I know you guys did it I hope you guys can see I'm glad you like the beauty gurus but yeah this is what the tips look like you can see like get some cbdu at the tip I don't see any like sticks or anything actually there is a little stick right here it may not be a stick but yeah they're rolling pretty tight and roll pretty good but I know you guys are waiting like I'm out to spark one up I think this little tube is so cute like it keeps it so it fresh that's another thing that's a big plus okay [Music] and I've seen this packaging widget I'm not gonna I ordered some sheet but from other companies I haven't water from this company because I want to try it out first but is she good does she hate like I love Jon Odie's like I like instantly star like slow no I didn't smoke weed earlier but almost all over though like I should be more up a little look like a little glass who does she hate rude [Music] okay secret nature path look sweetie would eat this is a 80 milligrams this is 80 milligrams y'all can see there but it says hopefully hopefully y'all can see that but it says pesticide and something else like Andy to see but everything they passed off on us good remember I said make sure it is lab tested and there's its lattice be laughed at it even got the test ID I got it done and Bill Costa labs I don't know what the where that is but they basically tested it and they even have a test ID on the bottom of the package so this is how you know you can some legit smoke okay y'all don't want to be smoking their trash yes you can get trash as cb2 flouring the way this whole he it's so hard I taste I can't really get a good taste off of it and that could be because I burned my [ __ ] taste but it's off this morning when I was drinking coffee so hope they can be proud [Music] enhancing burning over there I'm really going in sales but I decided to burn alone today but I was so anxious or yeah like my shirt I've got this shirt for like $1.99 yah and I was like [ __ ] I'm getting this you pay a shirt a video shirt I need a shirt and it's not like a little crop top and a guy like a little permanent blue not in the front I was going out but the way I'm set up right now like awful Aang get up you know at this point I'm gonna have to take them out and see thing our incident because I did do a video but if I find it you guys already know it will be in the description box below but yeah folks we did so I'm gonna have to check him out though for real because my my small shop they were like 17 dollars I noticed it's the one that I go to you I don't know baby taxes on time so I got a I'll be finding all the deals on the actual websites so yeah but I was just trying to look for different things that I could help other people with that don't trust virus [ __ ] on my or just don't want to wait because I thought when I first arrived CBD I didn't know want to wait for some [ __ ] to be shipped to me I wanted to find the pre room and I went looking everywhere I'll just type in CBD near me and then everything just popped up that's really high that's really how you got to do it anyway like in order to find what you really want and check out new people in trying to shake you just gotta try shape but make sure it is the lab tested okay even if there's not and you just want to try it give it a try because I still do the [ __ ] but I try to make sure that I do see lab tested somewhere on their website just because you just don't want to be smoking trying it's like who's what want to be smoking my catnip or some [ __ ] potpourri so Scooby [ __ ] but it was a book you don't know what the [ __ ] people be putting in pre-rolls a shade so just always make sure you know what the [ __ ] you get I don't care if they [ __ ] cheap [ __ ] that [Music] and to get research but this good though like this it's kind of instantly calling just kind of instantly telling me because I was like a little anxious before I started this video but like now I'm cool how are you guys liking these smokin easy guys like these or what because I do I like familymoon I like filming them yeah yeah so someone had basically asked me like what my race is and to be honest I've been told so much [ __ ] that I really don't know so I

we gonna be smoking so talk about Dorne because I've seen some other people do it but I was told that I'm all like I was told that I'm mainly black and I have like 10% Hispanic in me which is weird because my mom is dark-skinned and as you can see I'm not dark-skinned I [Music] don't matter please [Music] when you find look at the box leg I think it is this CPP or THC but it says CBD everywhere on the box a handmade oh let me read this yup it says our joints are made with premium hand trimmed buds ok beat we never use shape trim or anything that is not top shelf material 100% flour with no artificial beads no artificial ingredients or additives this is Road in organic hemp papers yep got a smoke clean this brings the highest flavor and terpenes and turbine and allows for a smooth experience ok Rogue Valley organ I see you [Music] this product when I gave you her for adults 80 and over smoking candy hot legal hip product oh [Music] it does have a little bit of THC it has a 0.3 I'm sure I got at the bottom say I don't think I'm lying see it's a very viable 0.3 first thing that the THC at the very bottom and then this is exactly what I just read to you guys let's get it under

like a cigarette pack normally you just pull okay oh yeah there's there it is there it is pull that away and then we have ten readies up in this batch boom look at that there's your retican ready now the marijuana inside you can clearly see there's marijuana inside that's good that's good that's what i'm hoping for let's do math real quick here the package comes with 10 pre-rolls the package weighs 3.5 grams of dope so in each pre-roll you got .35 of marijuana i paid 24.99 for this package that makes every pre-roll about 250. so 250 for .35 grams of dough now let's see what's in the pre-roll just for fun that's what this is about we're recreational we're just doing things for fun i'm gonna rip this batch open let's get you open let's see what we're smoking on is it sticks is it stems is it seeds we don't know let's see it's not dry and crusty i will give it that you know you're not uh may 2nd package date the weed that's falling out is not dry and crusty there is a bit of humidity left in there that's what you want yeah yeah we'll do a little dance for that okay so there's .38 of dope in this pre-roll that's on point perfect ah do another dance you're getting dances today now let's see what's actually in here so it's not too bad look at this this is a stem here okay that's something you don't want to really pre-roll right here that's leaf okay so there's a bunch of leaf getting in there this is definitely bottoms okay this is bottoms this is the bins after it's handled weed you're going to grab all this bits and you're going to put it in your parel that's what's happening here but there is flour in there too it's not all sticks and stems it's not all leaf matter you can see the leaf matter there's chances you know when i roll my joints i report all the stem all these little bits that affects my smoking goodness these are i'm pretty slick i mean i am slick but i'm also pretty happy this is a little slick pack um i'm looking forward to getting all snapped up here it's [ __ ] 420 right on the dot too hmm not bad not bad not a whole lot of flavor there's really not a lot that stands out on that taste i know i'm smoking weed but there's nothing to complain about either right i'll just start there so good good good good in the past i've had two other radicands actually have them right here i have the waffle and the god bud done both these they were both 29.99 which is a great price and they were both quality dopes they passed the test they're rebuyable they're suggestible check them out check out redican this is gonna be perfect for me throughout my day a quick little snap snap i'll take my i'll take bowl hoots throughout the day just to get my medicine so i can keep going that's what this is very convenient actually and for 250 per joint all i need is one and then i continue on my day this one's almost going out though i need more than that so you got a second one going right away before this one goes out and you just gotta keep her going it's smokeable but it's not flavorful that's what i like to say there i smoked my second one i'm getting down there i'm getting pretty snapped up i am feeling good i'm starting to forget words here you go friends take one of those put it in your mouth later later as easy as that smoke three at once if you want whoo [Music] you can like two up and give one to a friend if you want that's how easy that is to they're quick lights that is nice it's not like uh they light like a cigarette you smoke you know one two three four five there's five more somewhere one two i lost three okay so no i have four i have four in my hand and i got five six seven eight nine i lost one when i threw one to a friend but the neat thing about these this is really cool let's say you're like boom

they get going good now you know you light them all or you can light one all right so it is smokable weed there's no way i do that if there's no way i could do that if this wasn't smoke but we this is decent weed okay there's there's not a lot of taste there it really just falls in the sativa category that's what's going on there so there's no point for really enjoying your bud the weed needs to be better but the convenience and the actual product is fantastic straight up fantastic these are quick you want to go out on the boat you want to even [ __ ] take a rip on the sea-doo you want to go up in a hot air balloon grab these like wherever you go you can just have these with you have these in your car have these in your glove compartment i just smashed through 10 retican readies the overall

for [ __ ] weed you know you get all the exotic things that you've never heard for and never like really get around your neighborhood things of that nature you get to get that you get to get edibles food good music like accessories things of that nature like I got this rolling train oh it's all dirty I had this rolling train from one of the events that I did go to so yeah so I have to here I got this from the entry as you can see it's a little loose they were kind of being whatever and then I got this with the purchase of the bud that I've got from a table so I've already smoked the bud that it's already enrolled in this one and this is a mystery weed so hopefully all those will lighten refocus let's party let's party let's party my god I'm so yellow okay there we go a spark joy oh this is cute they even did a little a perfect em can we get that and focus I can't I can't get it in focus there's a perfect um there's a little piece of weed at the bottom but I like who did this voltar [Music] okay this is smoking good this is tasting good so far is good but um last night I'm at a good time going to the event kind of sad that I should go by myself actually a couple my friends my friends like mean I don't want to go me I'm me I'm like [ __ ] I'm going so I went I got me a couple Apes as I told you or we got me two free pre rolls and I got edibles so I'm going to edible first these are there you like these are the thickest edibles I've seen like and I got three for 25 I ate half of one last night yeah quick story so when I went to go buy the edibles last night at the table the couple that was there was nice enough to let me try their THC infused food so they had rice and like a car you chicken I'm not going to pass up free food so I thank you very much so that [ __ ] was my hit spot I'm gonna just say that it is by tasting wise it didn't taste that great but it sure enough got me smacked I give him that so moving on to the fuzz they don't die I got three different bugs as you can see I got two from the same table present both wicked green and then one from a different table boom so I got sugar cookie purple pie and apple fritters I'm gonna insert a video clip of it Oh sugar cookie was definitely a fan favorite of the ladies last night so that's why the vendor recommended it to me and that's what's in the second panel oh yeah it's really sweet smelling like it smells legit like sugar like candy and then we have purple piper if I definitely cooked my I personally pissed I like her I don't know why it's just so pretty so you got the purple part yeah then we got the apple fritter the apple fritter smells the best the best so sugar cookie was definitely a fan favorite profile looks the best and Apple Twitter smells all of them so also the positive thing that happened to me last night at this event was when I went to get the sugar cookie and purple I was only gonna get one I was only gonna get the purple pie but then the guy told me about shooting you something since you mentioned before I deal at your table was like two for something why they bother he's like I can't do two 460 I'm like okay cool so I got an eighth for $10 less just to get another one with a free I feel like a good deal because rather than spend 80 for two days I got anymore and a free pre-roll whoa sounds have you with that kind of made up for the fact that I went by myself but I did the most novice mood ever I didn't have any problem when I waited I don't know what happened like I swear to fall I had papers in my bag or whatever but I had nothing I didn't have papers I had fun so I didn't have a rep I didn't have nothing so as soon as your girl got there you already know I went scavenger mole I would like so where is the photo they pointed me to a table phantom blow me some paan so I kept it push it I found somebody I was rolling up I'm like I gotta look for somebody smoking not finishing like just starting to smoke or like rolling up at this moment so I was just looking around scavenger room and I found somebody I was like [Music] - oh so I got some papers I like I bet got my phone so got my papers I started to check my pocket no lighter mind you I went to this event right after work so I was so eager to smoke you didn't even know how to smoke I was I was like I've got this I'm on it I'm about to smoke about to have some good weed in my system I ain't never had before oh boo boo nah nothing so I'm so glad I'm part of the stoner community as we're stoners are very nice I asked the couple even though I've kind of felt bad that I was kind of like raining on their blue loving parades this is it we're definitely going back on and I had to ask them for you know a lighter they sure know tells me and homegirl huh huh and then we'll make up [Music] yes I did all in all I could have a good time and I wasn't upset about going by myself after the fact that I walked in the door I was mad walking there I was like oh yeah I'd make a stun pull my

and love say hi you guys [Music]", "kRTXU8MYw7w": "what's up welcome to true buds TV it's your buddy Jack how to make your own pre-roll conjoint it's simple and cost-effective we're using the rips today I think there's like six feet of paper in here so you can make a lot I know a lot of the pre-rolls I see online and it stores well to be real with you they look really overpriced and I would have paid that money I'm gonna show you how to be yourself easy and you don't need to use rips you can use any paper but the same method applies let's dive in make a pre-roll and stuff that thing up just grab a piece of paper cut it in half or a third or you can do the full thing I'll show you what that looks like in a minute go ahead and roll it into a nice cone shape no right or wrong way here you can watch how I do it I'd like to give a little extra and make that tip nice and firm what you want to roll it as tight as possible wrap it right around there and then you're gonna go ahead and grab your tape and you're gonna tape that and the paper cone is set to go next parts are optional you don't need to cut the top off but I'm just gonna go ahead and do it give it a chop and the next thing we're gonna do is go ahead and grab our papers we're going to pull out of rips about the same size as it cone cut that just go ahead take that paper give it a lick roll up a nice come here now let's go ahead and set that down put the paper coat on there and roll it from the bottom on up you want it to be nice and tight so that when you pull it out it stays and it's a nice perfect to come keep rolling don't stop just roll it right past the paper until there and it is three two one and there perfect go ahead and stick your finger in and pull out the inner paper mold this will leave you with a nice perfect pre roll well almost perfect couple more steps we're gonna use our raw filter tips today and we're gonna go ahead and fold those up and just toss it right in the end there you could do it without this highly recommend it though especially because you're gonna be packing it down makes it easier and yeah I wouldn't do it any other way and you can make it filtered about anything just find any piece of paper that has a little resilience we're gonna go ahead and stick that right in the back of the cone tap tap tap tap tap and we're going to go ahead and cut the top of the paper off so it's even and easy to fill but there it is that's the pre roll you would spend money on and now that you have the mold you can just keep making them really simple now there's a couple different ways I like to do this first you could just drop it in just like that and stuff it down this works its effective the second way is just dump it on there and push it in this is maybe a little more effective but my personal favorite the most effective is describe a piece of paper and fold it and chop it sell it's manageable to hold and go ahead and dump it in there and just use it as a chute to slide it right in there makes things a lot faster the paper is laying around it's not waste we're making you see everything here you're making the process speed up a little bit keep going ahead filling it packing it down you want to keep doing this you don't want to fill it and then pack the whole thing down or also be too loose you want to do it in steps it's a process fill it packet Philip packet and repeat let's go ahead and twist that top off here dress it up that cone is looking fat nice and there you see it it's not hard to do you got yourself a perfect color right there and that's how you make a pre-roll and that's still a fat size you know if you're passing out around to but here's how you make a bigger one let's take a full piece of paper making the same style cone but you're gonna pull two pieces and combine them this time just right on top each other now it's like one extra extra large go ahead same process roll that out from the bottom give it a lick twist it project there it is and that's a huge one thank you for chilling today I hope you found this video helpful and if you liked it give it a like drop a comment and let me know if there's anything else

slow down I don't know if you guys remember back some time ago I had done a review on dr. zodiacs moon rock vape cartridge that [ __ ] was pretty fire so I figured why not do one of the pre-roll that they have now with this free roll was so cool about it we'll find out if it's actually cool but it has it says it has a supreme cannabis flower I hate when they say they like who is supreme top notch tell me the [ __ ] string that damn it but anyway they got flour here does also keep inside of it it also says cannabis extract which is like it has a sauce in here and it says terpenes so we'll see what the deal is on this [ __ ] let's open it mmm okay so I'm gonna see that you got to keep on the outside the tubes no good I will say that okay so the powder is on the outside the Keith and I'm not a fan to keep on the outside of my [ __ ] and I ain't saying it's wrong I understand I'm not a fan of that [ __ ] and the reason for it is but I will say they didn't over adjust it because some of them just be so [ __ ] frosty when you go to a [ __ ] off you keep just balling up - god damn it so it seems like they didn't over dust it so with it being on the outside it might not be a problem from that so I give it to him on that now I will say on the flip side of me saying I don't like to have it on the outside sometime we'll know if I could say they put them on the inside I got a pre-roll before and I open that [ __ ] up and I didn't find a drop I keep in that [ __ ] and ain't no way nobody can convince me that the [ __ ] was just in the bud and I didn't see it because I'm still gonna put it in my grinder and I shook it so my keep catcher and I didn't get any Keef out of it really so that is one thing when they put it on the inside I don't know if they tell the truth that's really in there so if I put it on the outside that does kind of at least let me know that that [ __ ] is there and like I say it doesn't seem like they over did this it looks like there's probably about point to the point three of a gram on that and of Keith so I think they did a pretty good job on that so I gotta give it sold now this is a little too big from a slaver later yeah man the Snider lighters Douglas an electric lighter if you haven't seen that I got a reveal that two dishes dope but this head is a little too fat to fit inside of it there's my [ __ ] sick as [ __ ] watch nice right so anyway I'll just use a regular lighter see I wish it is that's nice make them up like a sit back like man he leaned back mmm this is nice I like it has really good flavor to it damn I like that [ __ ] he got a pretty taste to it yeah man yeah I'm not I - I might a fan when people put like extracts and [ __ ] in joints I haven't felt like it's wasting extract because the temperature ain't hot enough to really give you the effects from it you know so if that's this almost like sin you might as well just smoke a bowl of dab instead of anything so I don't really like mixing concentrate with flowers and stuff like that because I just realize they don't really make a difference I mean I just feel like I'm wasting extract like let me know y'all so I can go with opinion on that [ __ ] like if y'all think is beneficial or anything because I might be overlooking something on that but to me it's kind of a waste when you do that but they did it on this and I'm not gonna front it but if I can taste I can I honestly can taste the extract the sauce that's in there because you know it's sauce when you hit it on the right type of vaporizer or even just the right type of though I'm not fake but the rig sorry is what I'm trying to say if you get it the right way on the rig at the right Tim you can really really really taste like the terpenes in it so I can really taste the terpenes in this but I can also get that that extract flavor to it I don't know how to describe it you know you get like a after flavor of a dad when you dad that's what I'm kind of getting from that so I kind of got to give it to yeah I like this and it's rolled into Rock own man we're all coming up they got everybody putting these [ __ ] and they stood up yo I just ordered a new bait it's a US adult it's so just like weed and wax and [ __ ] it's the pulsar rock so we don't see how that [ __ ] is so show Peter next week so as soon as I get it of course you know I'm gonna [ __ ] do that [ __ ] for y'all right but Jimmy much else about that start cooking my food for the week get my meal prep in I also got some good news for y'all but I gotta get this series together to show y'all but I got some really fun stuff coming I'm kind of kicking it talking to a child right now what the [ __ ] else can I say about I got a I'm joined but I got some pretty cool stuff for y'all coming like you guys really really really encouraged me when I did the video of showing what bud tenders see like [ __ ] but tender see you guys gave me some very encouraging words so it kind of encouraged me to do some other [ __ ] so I got a lot of stuff that I would be doing for you and I'm working on things right now so just sit tight I know my videos have been a little slow posting cuz I've been working on some other type of things but that's why I figured let me make sure I do this so I could at least holla at y'all but there's all kind of [ __ ] on the way like coming so stay tuned [ __ ] so that is the end of this video I would say that I do like that pre-roll definitely I definitely like it three worlds a lock but every once in a while I like to get one and so on it's kind of cool to know which ones delish and I don't think I've ever done one on a review with you guys on one so I figured why not do that [ __ ] so anyway that's the end of this [ __ ] I'm out of this [ __ ] all right so it's Kennedy make sure you go follow me over on Instagram make sure you can actually got me hooked up okay let me rewind a shrew shrew okay so make sure you follow me on Instagram that's my Kenneth underscore mink I'm out this [ __ ] y'all make sure y'all keep the love going keep the peace going y'all love each other be peaceful to each other I am high as [ __ ] right now head up house this [ __ ] peace I want to hit the seat we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smokin", "pbXiUqVyrE4": "welcome back to the talking hedge I'm Josh Kincaid Capital Markets analyst and host of your cannabis business podcast today we're gonna do a video that we haven't updated in quite a while which is for pre-roll automations so why their cones or cylindrical joints or even blunts we've seen quite a few different options over the last few years which is a huge improvement from about five years ago when I did my first video looking for investment to build an automated solution not the shake tables that you're saying seeing from future Ola but like real automated solutions so when I made this video in 2015 it was with that intention on getting capital so I went to the marijuana show which is like Shark Tank for cannabis and pitched that but everyone wanted a prototype so I went to Snoop Dogg's investment company called Casa Verde capital they also wanted a prototype and I told them straight up if I had a prototype I'd be printing money quite literally so I didn't get the capital for that this video here has about 40,000 views so it's definitely still something that people are interested in and now there's an actual solution so you guys are probably all have heard of future rulers not box it's a little shake table you put your cannabis in there after you've ground it up it shakes it all in and then makes a pre roll problem with this and a lot of other machines is that it doesn't get to the base and pack that as well as it should and so when you don't have a very tight base it leaves for like clogging effects so the very last half inch of that pre-roll is not be you can't really use it you can rip it off and throw it into a bong or whatever but a lot of the problems with this is it doesn't pack very well you also have to weigh each one and twist the top so it's really not an automated solution other competitors have come out and tried to make a pre-roll machine that does faster than future rollers but it doesn't solve the problems it doesn't accurately weigh them it doesn't pack the base and it doesn't twist the tops automatically so while it might produce more than future a lot of these shake tables haven't solved the fundamental problem we're gonna take a look at nine or ten different machines nine automated machines now we are took a look at future Rolla that's not an automated solution some of these machines arranged anywhere from 85,000 a 300,000 there is no real cheap solution if you want an automated solution it's not cheap there is a table top for the session ology machine that we just showed the STM that's a you know basically the same thing as future Rolla so they do have you know bigger faster tabletop versions but those aren't automated solutions there is no small automated solution these things are huge the equivalent of a couple ATM machines and they are not cheap so this first one we're gonna take a look at as Evans McTavish pre-rolls so they were a tobacco company they tried to make cannabis and then reverted back to him because cannabis was too sticky I met these guys at the MJ biz Con in Las Vegas in 2018 they have a huge grinder $60,000 bud buster as they call it they have a lot of equipment that I don't think the cannabis industry is necessarily ready for like conveyor belts and so a lot of these tobacco companies want to sell you multi-million dollar equipment that the cannabis industry isn't ready for they don't need conveyor belts yet so this is a teeny little pre-roll machine that they have don't forget to like share and subscribe we've got a playlist for automation right here you can see on the floor of MJ bisk on the bud Buster I mentioned the $60,000 grinder and then we'll skip forward to the pre-roll machine that you can see right here with the bobbin system that's the wheel of paper so it's a kind of really fine or excuse me a really narrow profile where there's a hopper that you put the cannabis into with the grinder in there this machine is about $300,000 for the pre-roll machine $60,000 for the grinder they want to sell you all of it a lot of these companies want to ensure quality and that's ridiculous because they can't but they still want to sell you the machines to ensure that the finished product is what they anticipate and they don't even know cannabis so it's a little frustrating trying to deal with these guys sometimes so this is a cylindrical machine it's not a cone so that's the one interesting thing about this I think it's perfect for hemp they need to move a little bit farther along before they can have a full a cannabis option I've got a diagram here for floorspace requirements all of that and I work with Sam so if you got any questions let me know I'll get you in contact with the right people so the statistics on that machine about 225,000 for the cylindrical joint rolling machine 500 per minute you don't have to worry about different cycle times so like for example with the futuro low or the STM rocketbox you have to put the the cannabis in there and then put all the cones in there and that takes a lot of time you might only get four cycles an hour where is with this machine it's just non-stop continuous so you get about thirty thousand an hour compared to about 1,800 on the rocketbox or a thousand on the knock box you're stuck to a single size that's a 1 gram joint they don't have the options for four different sizes yet and it doesn't have a check way so we'll get into that where it has a built-in way mechanism but it does have that open top so you don't have to worry about twisting it for these but moving on to machine ax can I ran into these guys at lift up in Vancouver BC this machine is about 400,000 it is a cone shaped it will do 33 a minutes non-stop continuous accuracy is 0.01 grams so that's within a health canada and US regulations it does not have a built-in way mechanism but you can have multiple sizes and although it doesn't twist the tops it does fold them so that's kind of a nice little option if you've seen that with pre rules where they fold it a lot better in my opinion than that twist so I ran into the manufacturer of this machine a few years ago previous to seeing it on the floor up in Vancouver BC they've made some adjustments to that and so that's good it does weigh it so I believe that there is a way mechanism and it's not based on volume so the the new added features that I haven't updated yet does include a check weigh system and it does twist the tops I don't know how well it packs the base though so looking at some of them it looked like they were okay but as time moves on that's going to be something that's essential is to really get that base nice and packed tight because as you smoke something that's maybe too dry and that's another thing that we'll talk on is the grind and the the humidity if it's too dry it's gonna clog and so there's some issues with that and we'll touch on that at the end I like how you can just stack the pre-rolls in there and they just take them one by one the cannabis is put into to a box and verdict the gravity just takes over and kind of just fills it up automatically so one person can run a couple of these different machines alright moving on to canna automation $350,000 machine it is a cone it'll do 30 per minute so about 2,400 and our accuracy is 0.02 percent the Czech Way system I'm not sure about it does do multiple sizes and it will twist the tops automatically not only will it twist the tops it'll fold them if you wanted to so this is one one of the only machines I've seen that offers that twisting and folding it does weigh them as well I don't have a video on this I ran into these guys on the floor of the lift Expo in Vancouver BC earlier this year a lot of these machines are starting to look very similar I think they've take a look at one another and just try to automatically kind of come up with the same solution so this prosit pack at $350,000 is also a comb making machine running at 20 a minute 1800 output per hour with an accuracy of 0.01 grams it does have a check weigh system it does allow for multiple sizes and it will twist the tops so this machine is still about 4 by 4 by about 6 feet tall but one thing about this is eventually this the control system will be allowed to integrate with your state regulators so in Washington we have the the liquor and cannabis board and so having something like this directly tied into your regulatory agency would be helpful because then they know that there's no diversion into the black-market you'll know exactly how many of these are being rolled not only that if the if a company is buying these and leasing them out with royalties that company know exactly how many are manufactured as well I've got a full dialogue here our diagram where it'll roll it as well as package it and so packaging companies or packaging machines are very very expensive more expensive than the rolling machines themselves so the packaging machines start at 300,000 and go up from there and there's no single type of packaging machine so if you have doob tubes or tins or bags you know mylar or whatever there's a different machine for all of those so you have to be really really sure what kind of packaging you want otherwise you're gonna be dropping another 1/4 to 1/2 million dollars on a machine so getting something like this that has the machine and packaging together as long as you know what you want is a nice option and more and more companies are offering packaging in addition to their rolling machines so the next one is from packs iam they've been really quiet about this I actually found out about it through the grapevine they're being really kind of coy just sending out emails to existing account holders and they're not really talking a whole lot about it but based on what I can see that they're gonna have a $300,000 pre roll machine in the shape of a cone that'll do 60 pre-rolls a minute and I'm not sure about what the output is going to be or if it has a check way or what sizes I don't have any information I just know that pax e'm is a big manufacturer they're gonna come out with it with one of these eventually so apex is another one that I ran into @mj biz con and I think lift as well 95,000 our machine so incredibly affordable does pre-rolls at 20 a minute and so it's based on volume though the accuracy it doesn't have a check weigh system and I'm not sure if it twists the tops or folds them either moving right along to the ezj Auto roller for 85,000 it's also a cone it'll do eight a minute eight pre-rolls a minute don't have much on the output or the accuracy so we ran into these guys in Oregon at a hemp Expo and so this guy was selling his little ezj roller to the hemp industry so talk him about the grinder right there at the top as a built-in grinder and check waist system the base was fairly soft and so you can kind of see the indentation there and it's it's not a really packed joint at all so this one would be good I think for the hemp industry but I wouldn't consider this machine ready to use for cannabis and commercial skill yet all right I heard Green Burroughs is gonna be making a machine I don't have a lot of information but they did have a banner up a timid MJ bisque on fourth quarter 2019 and so the price of this is going to be too deep to be determined it's gonna be a cone shapes but I don't know what the cycle time is how much they're able to do per minute or what the accuracy is don't have any information so here's a video that I found online it looks like they may have taken it down since I'm not sure if this is a prototype maybe they've changed it so you can kind of see that they're doing their own weighing system for each in particular pre-roll and so this machine is a little bit unique with regards to how it weighs it but it's one of those situations where the base is going to be the the biggest issue I think trying to pack cones in general at the base is difficult so we've looked at some Lind Racal joints we've looked at pre roses take a look at blunts because blunts especially in the place like California are hugely popular although you can't have tobacco you can't have hemp wrapped or mint or natural unbleached white paper so this blunt rolling machine is about three hundred thousand dollars it is cylindrical it'll do forty five per minute or twenty seven hundred an hour the accuracy is 0.05 grams it does not have a check weigh system it will do multiple whether you want a little cigarillo or a fat old you know big ol blunt does not twist the tops it's open just like a cigar so this blunt machine is converted from an old cigar rolling machine so it doesn't have a check weigh system it does fill it based on volume so you can have hemp wraps for this bobbin system so it has a wheel of paper and it takes that paper and rolls it with it so you can do any kind of size you want it is the the size is based on volume you can add a check weigh system so you can have act at weighing and that would just be on the top there with the vertical fill so these are highly popular in Nevada and California infused cannery lows or cigars are a huge popular item one of the top questions I get is do you really need a machine to do this and the answer is yes automation is necessary so when you look at the last time anybody in the United States paid a company to roll cigars it was probably in the late 1800s and yet we have people that have company is 18 people making pre-rolls in Washington State so it's incredibly unique at this point in time to not on me I think pre-rolls are here to stay and you can see that based on their popularity looking at 2017 statistics on the number of joints sold 3.5 million in Alaska 10 million in Oregon 11 million for Washington looking at Colorado they sold 21 million pre-rolls in 2017 34 million in Nevada and 42 million in California some of the cannon guard prices that we see are about $420 with the wholesale price of 150 but the cost of goods sold is only $20 so it kind of makes sense with this machine in terms of market capture and growth of products in each state Colorado saw growth of 29 percent 21 million dollars in sales at a 5% market capture all the way down to California 30% growth 42 million in sales and 6% market capture Washington had the highest market capture at 12 percent totaling 68 million with 36 percent growth infused pre-rolls however are taking off quite a bit and so Washington has a hundred three percent growth not only 5.8 million in sales now granted this is 2017 for fourth quarter and that market capture was 18 percent Washington we don't have any growth statistics for Cali but the sales were almost 12 million at 28 percent market captured for infused pre-rolls fourth quarter 2017 regardless of how you get your data whether it's headset BDS analytics or otherwise you can see pre-roll sales are one of the number one products sold in terms of popularity you know concentrates or taking off but flower is dominant and in terms of a particular SKU pre-roll sell more than just anything if we go way way back to 2016 pre-rolls experienced a huge growth at a hundred fifty eight million dollars generated between Colorado Washington and Oregon during the month of December 2016 alone approximately 1.1 million joints were purchased tolling eight point five million in Washington and the following month joints consumption dropped to a mere eight hundred eighty eight thousand joints generating almost six point five million in revenue I love this map of Washington State it shows each county how many joints were smoked during December of 2016 King County where Seattle is that had 3.2 million joints smoked whereas Whatcom County where I went to college up by the Canadian border 380 thousand joints were smoked so you can see just how popular and prevalent pre-rolls are there's a lot of opportunities with mobile process saying you can see that you could charge a minimal fee to producers or processors for as little as 50 cents per unit rolled or buy the machines and Lisa I'm having a franchise or royalty at five cents each per per unit rolled here's some more fun facts for Washington State we had 10 million pre rolls in 2016 81 million in revenue that weighed about 1.7 million grams and was 40 million inches long some competitive advantages to think about there's an opportunity for top shelf organic strains specific product offerings that appeal to a more discerning and sophisticated customers at economies of scale you can also provide customization so think about branding and bull wearing gold leaf for weddings bachelor parties or corporate events so you can have other advantages with canna gars so blunts are large joints wrapped in tobacco paper it's not legal but you can have like we mentioned hemp or maybe if you work with the tribe you can have tribal blunts that could be very very unique the automated commercial joint Lim Machine eliminates the hand-rolled production constraints producing joints and categories for all licensed entities including producers processors and retailers you can provide clients an opportunity to display compelling professionally designed and accessible customized brands with the capacity to create brands with differentiated products at reasonable prices rolling is incredibly laborious and time-consuming requiring skills and patience with customers seeking strain-specific options that are also underserved quality and consistency is a problem in candy gars have limited production because they're extremely expensive to produce joints aren't easy to roll in categories are even more difficult especially have arthritis or physical limitations Washington State has the highest companion pre-roll meaning that at least one out of every 5 purchases has a pre-roll so 20% of all purchases in Washington State had at least one joint terpenes are also trending they're being touted as they're being touted more widely than ever and the public starting to catch on and what they are and why they matter that the cannabis experience so consumers are aware of and interested in CBD as well therefore infusing joints with terpene flavors and CBD will be essential with the ability to automate you can expect to see brands beginning to establish themselves as household names especially as they go national into interstate with agreements having an animated solution is an opportunity to reallocate that human capital instead of manufacturing to turn that labor into more of a marketing and distribution and sales team instead of just manufacturing these automated commercial machines should eliminate the hand-rolled production constraints to produce joints and pre-rolls for all licensed entities including producers and processors and retailers as a consultant I normally get paid for my advice but I'll give you some free advice right now don't use a grinder that's made for ice cubes a blender is made to crush ice not cannabis so you want to get something that's a little bit more fine something that's made for cannabis that's issue number one I've seen going to hundreds if not thousands of farms over the last five or six years I've seen people use the wrong kinds of tools starting with that grinder so get an appropriate grinder fritsch is a really good one it's a thirty thousand dollar grinder but you can adjust it and it's commercial and it's it's a really good grinder after that it needs to have the proper drying time so before people fill it up and I've seen them used an improper grinder and then go straight to filling without drying it in between so it takes at least 24 hours to properly cure or dry the cannabis so I would dry it first and then pack it into the the pre-roll or whatever you're making joints blunts and then cure it afterwards otherwise it's going to get really dry and crispy and clogged or it's gonna be too wet if you grind it and then fill it it needs to be a little bit drier than that so you can you can dry it first then fill it and then cure it we had a lot of fun in 2015 about three pounds and ground up a whole lot of we'd rolled about 1,500 joints and gave them out as business cards one thing that I noticed is that people weren't used to smoking one gram joints so they felt like it was clogged so I had the opportunity to either educate my customer or switch marketing if you try to educate people and then sell them on something very very difficult but instead of telling people it's not clogged it's you know it's a cigar I just changed the name of it instead of calling it a joint I called it a cigar a mini cigar and then people when they would smoke it it wasn't clogging it wasn't a hard pull and that's the difference we know pre-roll in a cigar is that draw a factor the big tobacco has figured that out milliliters permitted on the draw has been perfected by big tobacco pre rolls are a novelty it's not gonna stick around long term because it's not the optimum shape or experience and so it's with something like this maybe it's a little bit too much but you have to re-educate people so it's just something to think about whereas if you have a product that people aren't used to it it's not necessarily wrong it just means you have to work that out with marketing and advertising educating to a certain degree but again I don't think that pre rolls are gonna be around long term because it's not the optimum draw the shape and everything else is a novelty somebody just wanted to throw in more at the at the top but it's not the perfect shape otherwise you would see Big Tobacco with that so I think it's just going to be a novelty it's not gonna be around long terms especially with automated solutions coming out now all right with that we're gonna roll this one up I'm Josh Kincaid this is the talking hedge don't forget to Like share and subscribe or don't and amount [Music]", "8mLGdYGA6Ik": "[Music] you are now watching smoke doctor [Music] what's good youtube it's your boy cbd smoke doctor back with another review even though this is going to be a quick one i just gotta show you guys something real quick all right my dude justin from the calm leaf hit me up says smoke doc i want you to try one of these i said sure why not bro and he sent me over a delta eight pre-roll okay and this delta eight pre-roll is coming from farmer barn those are the people that uh manufacture these um uh the name of this one is plowed pre-rolled joints and the manufacturer again is farmer barn okay but you can get these on the calm leaf site guys all right and y'all already know i'm gonna hook y'all up all right all the info be below pinned first comment let's open this up this has a good taste to it too okay so i just got one question is this the new norm serious is this the new norm i don't know my people i don't know but what i'm gonna tell you is that i am gonna try this and let you guys know if it's any good if i like it i'm gonna tell you guys to go get you some and if i don't i'ma tell them to try again all right how about that so let's light this bad boy up get some in the lungs so we know what it's about this is my first d8 pre-roll okay so here we go guys we're gonna light this up [Music] i can tell you one thing from the first poll it doesn't taste any different than your average pre-roll so there's no harshness there's no taste there's no trace of the delta eight so you would actually think that you're smoking a regular pre-roll [Music] i like it i'm just waiting for my first effects to come in so i can let you guys know what this is about see y'all guys can see that there's extra smoke burning off because most of the time i'm not sure how they spray the delta eight onto it but if you ask me i believe it's somewhat like a moon rock but with the delta eight keef instead genius right guys genius i don't think it's possible oh yeah whoa that was a good one like i was saying i don't think it's possible to grow delta eight flower you have to create it but what i'm doing now is trying to find out the companies that's doing the best job at that and i gotta honestly say this pre-roll is delicious it's smoking good and yes i got that fix got the effects already so i guess the more i smoke the more you know what i'm gonna get y'all guys go check this out all right i'm signing out right now but i will be back with another review soon guys i just wanted to show you some of the new products coming from the calm leaf guys all right so i'm signing out and i'll be back soon guys peace you", "92ffxfboc3E": "um so this pre roll is called littles or comes from the company littles it is a pre roll and I purchased it at Better Health Group in Vallejo California and it was it is a gram and it was 537 with a discount so let's take a look cameras not wanting to focus there we go so I'm sorry this is a half gram per your role for 5:37 and plus some taxes and 20 so this one has a THC of 24.9 and the CBD czar zero on this one there is the standard government warning it is an indica and again it doesn't show what type of cannabis plus I also looked up this company online and there was very little on that so there we go we will check this out and see what they've got and again if you know anything about the company please do write it in below or down below in the comments because I love to have some more information about companies and so they have a nice little tip on it and we'll try to get that to focus here we go and so that is a short little half gram check it out and see how it tastes thanks for watching", "di5IVd9pECg": "all right i was about it i was about to smoke i was about to smoke one of these and i was like hey might as well make a video on it right so i'll make a video on it and we're gonna have box hot box the bean [Music] let's see if you guys haven't seen any of my other videos i have two other videos of jeter i have a one gram in the xl this is going to be the baby jesus um these are [ __ ] gas man literally um one hand of these will get you [ __ ] feeling different already like if you and your friends are not heavy smokers you could literally split one of these between three people um i split i mean we split one between three people and honestly i got pretty lit off of it i mean like it wasn't to the point where i wanted to but it got me way more high than i thought it would these things are amazing man this is a five pack of baby jeters this is a fire og is gonna be a hybrid for some reason this package doesn't have any of the thc information you can see everything's all blank maybe it was like the setup case or something the display case or something but the manufacturer date and packaging date was september 23rd so a little bit old about over a month old it's a five pack premium indoor flower with distillate oil and keef weighing at 2.5 grams these periods are going to be weighing around a half gram each burning time is five minutes let me go ahead and open them you gotta push down that comes sealed already open to seal you can see there's four of them in there it comes with five already smoked one all right i know this is all right y'all know this is a weird angle and [ __ ] but i'm in my car so i don't really have a good place to set it up i'm gonna go ahead and take one of these out spark it up um i already know how these are hitting man these are [ __ ] crazy small ass [ __ ] joint bro but [ __ ] hits like smack so let's go ahead and spark this [ __ ] up got the clipper spark it uh are [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] love these joints if you guys haven't tried any of the jesus strains before i recommend the fire og i recommend the gelato 33 and i recommend the durban poison the banana cushion was cool it sounds good but i don't know to me just it wasn't like i was like one of my least favorite strains that i've had i probably had all of them already but the only one i think that i haven't had has to be maybe the ramadan grapefruit that's probably like one of the only ones i haven't had you can see i've been hitting it for a cool amount it's barely starting to to burn down they also have um a different line of these where they're not infused it's just like a fire ash puro and they have different strains on them so i need to make a review on them because they have some pretty good strains i don't remember off the top but i remember seeing some cool ones it was a lot of strains i haven't had before yeah these pills are really good though man i mean one is like all right two of them will get you highest like though especially in the morning have you just smoke with these especially in the morning man you'll be smoking these they will hit hard um this is already midday i already made a video if you guys haven't seen made a video about the dab cap so i'm already pretty lit but it's a good joint you know just to like get you level-headed um you know if you're not lit so so far i've been recording for four minutes and 20 seconds so um that five minute mark is pretty true i guess the first minute of this clip was me talking about it though so and i'm talking about like that first part where you guys see me come to the car that was like a different clip so i'm talking about this clip right now it's recording when i put the camera up is that four minutes and 45 seconds we hit the five minute mark now five minutes three seconds also what's really cool about these is that they do not turn off if you cannot hit it for like a cool minute and it'll still be on by the next time you want to take a hit officially been smoking over five minutes so it's true burning time is about five minutes if this weighs a half gram it must be a 0.4 flower point five of a key point five oh some wax i'm guessing that's how it works um unless you count the point five gram as a pure flour but i don't know uh that's gonna be it for the there's gonna be a for the video though y'all hopefully y'all enjoyed the video hopefully i'll tie y'all son hopefully i'll learn soon hope y'all got lit with me and um catch on the next one man peace okay bye", "xSV-r897aag": "whoa all right here we go here we go here we go another west coast speed tour pre-roll review you guys i'm here at the plant check this out woodland hills cannabis drive-through and a dispensary super cool we just picked up the stone road the stone road pre-roll grown organically with love this is a .7 gram pre-roll let's see what strain do we have what strain do we have oh we got blue dream uh 146.01 milligrams of thc 0.8 milligrams of cbd manufactured in oil plant santa rosa california so this is out of santa rosa cool beautiful packaging simple plastic cute little craft uh we've got this it says blue dream here sativa hybrid creative euphoric it's got a batch number super dope let's dive right in shall we one hit talk about it two hits score out of ten you guys ready curse on the camera my man justin here rocking like gary payton jersey you know i'm saying shout out to seattle okay packaging good i smell cannabis dropped it i smell cannabis in this oh we've got a cork top this one i don't know if i don't think it fell on anything sharp but this one had this cork top and i pulled it off and it was already broken i don't see any little pieces down here but it did come like this got the stone road pre-roll looks looks pretty nice i mean it's only a 0.7 so it's not going to be super packed and filled you know i'm going to massage it out i don't feel any stems poking out on either side the smell it's got flower smell taste i'm tasting this citrus light lemoniness all right one hit here we go [Music] first hit not so great mainly getting the paper getting a darker burn here right off the bat i'm going to set it on fire a little bit more see if it doesn't help get to some more terps and turn a little white here yeah the color is changing slightly let's go ahead and dive right into the second hit second hit much more smooth i'm getting a much more notable flavor i personally am getting a little bit of citrus uh a tiny bit of this i don't want to say haze but it's almost like haze like like not dutch treaty but light not so much this super sour pine just kind of lighter than that um the burn here it didn't get significantly lighter i'll show it to you guys again up close so you guys can kind of see what we're looking at there for 0.7 it's pretty smooth i'm going to do a third hit here just to give them a fair chance of getting a good score out of 10. feeling nice got the homies here unfortunately it's still just burning harsh i mean i don't have the desire to smoke through this whole joint because of how harsh this is blue dream is generally always a super light creamy uh sometimes it's super citrusy sometimes it's got a little bit of that pine but i'm just not getting that i'm not sure i got to give him a low seven here i'm thinking seven flat maybe a 6.75 i'm sorry stone road i've always had good joints from you guys but this blue dream here particularly not a great one 6.75 maybe up to a seven at the highest definitely recommend coming to the plant and checking it out they were sold out of a lot of their other higher end pre-rolls this is kind of what was left so i'll be back here to check out other strains that they've got we've got another blunt here that we're going to do in another video make sure you guys check that out otherwise check it out y'all stone road we've got a harsh smoke dark ash doesn't taste that great six point seven five to a seven kind of being generous i'll let you guys know if i you know what i really think in the description there will be a uh there'll be a full article all coming soon on respectmyregion.com uh for the official hundred point rating system but for now i'm definitely gonna fall on that 6.75 it's just not getting better as i smoke it appreciate you guys for the love talk some [ __ ] below follow unfollow dudes you gotta do stone road is definitely worth checking out just maybe not this batch of a blue dream pre-rolls i'll see you guys down the road peace", "ObFtB_eFUcc": "[Music] hey

because there's a lot of terpenes in it yeah I had to run a test done it's Monday and two days before my operation I getting getting a little nervous so if I'm actin a little a little different I'm not gonna lie every time I get put to sleep I mean there's a chance you don't wake up so like I get a little I get a little iffy about okay so um okay with that said the ins is kicking up a little bit so that's why I wanted to sit down and try to try to smoke this whole thing it's at 0.75 grams and on the scale at 0.03 houses okay I mean it's pretty cool last time I had this this the second time I had this on the channel the first time I had these on a channel I said that everyone you buy it donates to a dog in need which that is pretty [ __ ] cold so yeah this was like $15 I believe yeah not bad at all like I said Afghani man so let's just go ahead and crack in this and you can get her started all right this is a hard percent indica to by the way just bad boy all right I kind of I kind of thought it'd be bigger but it's really really really tight I'm not even gonna try to like take it apart or anything like that I'm just gonna get get to smoke into a society a little bit I'm having [Music] Cheers let me doing the comments what you guys are smoking on if you're smoking on anything yeah and let me know if you guys are having a good week so far you said it's Monday two days before my operation I did my ronan test today to cobia test they do it real quick on both nostrils man and tell you it's like you're sinking feel it like to go behind your eye sockets and it makes your eyes water up immediately is it it does it's not like it hurt it's more more just like a weird kind of burning sensation I guess behind your eyes and you can feel it in your nose like like maybe 10 to 15 minutes afterwards too you can still kind of feel a little bit but yeah let's talk about this my first initial hit it kind of burnt a little bit to be honest with you guys I'm not really much used to smoking much fire anymore man I've been smoking a little a lot of [ __ ] oils a lot of rosin you know a lot of rosin a lot of concentrates the taste is definitely a woody maybe a little fruity I don't taste no coughing but now maybe low for now but I don't taste no coffee flavor definitely little fruity it's a nice subtle taste smooth taste too like I said it has a little a little burn on my throat there and I think that's just from [ __ ] smoking fire you guys in Pennsylvania I can't buy these pre-rolls I guess and I feel sorry for you is it [ __ ] sucks but uh you know hearing good old Maryland and you're allowed to and you can smoke your flower and it's pretty [ __ ] dope I'm not gonna lie I could have bagged a [ __ ] paper flower consoling I'm getting a better taste on it now depth that one was definitely fruity like I said it's it's a hundred percent indica so definitely want to be at nighttime when you're smoking this one and it's definitely good for [ __ ] uh like like pain and and effects effects for like the body and muscle aches and stuff like if you just had a hard day at work and you just want to come home and relax and sit here and just like be couch locked a half-black Afghanistan like Afghanistan one of the strange you want for you it definitely eases the mind it definitely relaxes the body relaxes the muscles like I said it's like a soothing narcotic and it definitely is I mean I've only took him for four or five hits of it so far and I'm definitely feeling it right and I'm telling you what the taste it's getting even better I guarantee when I wake up in the morning I'm still going to smell my room is still gonna smell like just [ __ ] joint head normally does been a try some of these joints any kind of joint really good see how nice and white to ashes - yeah yeah this [ __ ] burn him beautiful yeah nice wish I could do like slow-mo if we are yeah that what only $1 works hopefully see we get that fix here but I already got a couple recordings ready for y'all so like I said I'm not just gonna leave gone hanging man like I said the first time around it won't be no videos I'm not gonna go hang a man I got a couple videos a very pretty record for the [ __ ] time when I'm laid to [ __ ] out yeah so be definitely be on the lookout for them [ __ ] man I will give you all those deep video right this disc cartridge right here I open it up yesterday and at first they gave me kind of like a little hot flash whenever I did the review but I turn my ACS I think it was a big part of that puss breaking a bacon with the liquid live resin cartridge it definitely threw me in like a hot flash but afterwards once I cool down man the bus is really really [ __ ] nice and I'll tell you from a G leaf liquid live resin cartridge FS e cartridge whatever I think I forget it [ __ ] means um yeah it was pretty good so be on the lookout for that review blueberry scone just like the porn snap blueberry skunk fire bro blueberries Conchas fire I mean literally look I killed it I killed it it was that it was that good I mean I just the oil burnt really fast and I'm not gonna lie like I mean like on a normal Cresco card the oil would last me three four days the way I was smoking it this one here that was done within a day yeah like clearly at 24 32 hours time it was done it normally doesn't happen like that like I said alive Cresco car some [ __ ] last me for at least a couple days after me I have to only doubt for about the G leaf-like reliable riser cartridge so far so far cuz I only had one and take what this [ __ ] definitely um looks even like it has some like oil in it yeah my fur is nice man and to be honest with you the throat burn isn't even isn't bad at all anymore like I guess it maybe that first initial like maybe it was just from the [ __ ] you know what I mean I don't know maybe it was you know I'm just book search anymore August 17th to be here since I haven't had a cigarette so like you know inhale [ __ ] the gas anymore so like I said I ain't been smoking much fire to be using lighters and [ __ ] so I'm try to smoke this did that cough too much right nobody wants to sit through a video

thought is always in the back your mind of not waking up right that can happen anytime again put down any type of surgery I don't get but what kind of surgery it is even it was the most simplest kind of surgery there is you could [ __ ] not wake up for it something could go wrong I try not to think about it too much this my friend my friends is definitely helping it out I'm sure I look [ __ ]

from but I have had it before and it was [ __ ] amazing and it looked beautiful as they called purple maybe it was maybe it wasn't Marilyn Allen I understand but maybe that's whenever they first

"what is up guys that blank talker back here again welcome to another video man in today's video we got a product review of some pacific stoned pre-rolled joints a hundred percent premium cannabis so a little back story on this i went to my local disco over the weekend and they were having a sale on bees they were 40 dollars before tax and the second second one they were offering is for penny so i got two of these and I've been smoking on them and I've been liking the lead so let's get on with the review so how you open them it is childproof so you just squeeze the sides push the front end right here you have to do it there we go and then well BAM it comes with 14 joints but I've been smoking out of this one and one and another thing that's pretty cool with this as well is that they tuck it up with a little pack of matches my dude like that's what's up so you know if you can't if you don't have the lighter or if you don't smoke this much you don't have to get a lighter you can just use these matches out of this box so I am a little bit stoned [Music] this is my second time trying to record this my phone ran out of space so I'm getting double liddie today's let me know what you're smoking on down in the comment section below I'm gonna light up the match and we'll get on with it man just gotta have my ashtray next to me so go and light it up so it's just give me a second so hell yeah I like using the mattress man I think it's pretty cool different because I always use lighters books and Clippers but you know it's something different I thought it was kind of cool something really different but I really thought and the Pacific Stone they really did a pretty good job with the packaging and the joynton and adding the matches I thought that was pretty cool and I really do you think it is worth 40 bucks I think each joint joint is like about half a gram each so that's like you get 14 so that's like about 7 grams and for 40 bucks oh well after taxes like 46 48 bucks the tax here is pretty ridiculous in California but [Music] but yeah so you're paying just about 50 bucks for seven grams so that ain't too bad in the this ain't no [ __ ] pre-roll either dude it has a pretty good taste and I get pretty stoned off it and I usually smoke it with somebody dude like I smoked it with my mom and just like splitting it and smoking up with somebody dude I got pretty [ __ ] stunned and like smoking a whole one dude that like I get completely but you know if you see this out in Southern California man I recommend checking this out man even if you're like a tourist or something like this this product would be perfect for you [Music] because you don't have to die the [ __ ] papers it roll them grind it up like eg just buy it already done really good flowers [Music] so yeah man I was pretty I was pretty stuck when I saw this because I think one spark it's federally legalized in the next couple of years I think after that twenty to twenty five years after that in grocery stores you'll be able to buy a pack of joints and I think that would be pretty [ __ ] sick and you know it's kind of can't come early I know they're just only selling it at the Disco's but still that's pretty cool [Music] damn we're almost done with this and then I'm going to get out but I'm going to have their website down in the description below and yeah I really liked it like this these green rolls man and there's a lot of [ __ ] shitty ass pre-roll companies out here in Cali man they always tried to [ __ ] rip it off and it's [ __ ] just complete food in bottom shelf like disgusting ah [ __ ] but this has some really good flour in it and it's worth the forty bucks man [Music] oh yeah man if you have it already shoot me a ball on instagram at that glint okay I've been pretty consistent on there trying to post more so follow me on there and ID live streams like two to three times a week and join in on the fun D so hopefully you guys are getting letting like a titty and and how I have a new video out on Friday I don't know what I'm going to do but we'll see god damn dude this joint is kind of getting harsh towards the end got it in that just actually a little bit who I am it's making my icon into you're up dude and it is any pretty smoking in my room but yeah so hopefully you guys enjoyed today's product review if you see this product man check it out [Music] - it gets louder you won't be disappointed but I feel all relax man this one thing though that I wish they would have is like what strain that is because you don't really have the strain name or alright I think it's an OG because it says premium OG so maybe it is indica gotta look into it a little bit more the bucket under gonna do a really good job on explaining it to me [Music] but yeah man I join it's done oh yeah man thanks for tuning in on today's video make sure to subscribe stay Lydia like the tittie you on friday's video follow me on instagram joining on the live streams huh Cheers stay lady [Music]", "j2wMLL5hCIY": "[Music] hey yo fam what's happening so i'm gonna set up another review on youtube and uh basically go review a pre-roll a new one that i've not been able to smoke or came across yet uh the pre-rolls usually catch my eye if they've got something other than flower in it you know what i mean so i like for them to have either like a i don't know some moon rock hash oil keith um sorry about that anyways yes sir let's get ready with the show anyways um i got my ig life uh show coming up in about 45 minutes so i figured why not get high before that that way i'm uplifted and ready to go ah that pellegrino orange drink tastes really good all right fam so basically gonna review the peak premium [Music] 2020 future roll 420 edition i mean it's got a lot on the print kind of loud it did get my attention because of uh the way the stickers printed on there with all the colors so it's basically what it looks like it is made of it might be glass not sure it's definitely glass so uh right along here i'll tell you what it reads so basically it's a san francis san fernando valley og infused with hash oil and rolled in golden keith all right so it does read thc 34 [Music] cbd point eight four i totally missed that i thought it said eighty four percent i'm like why the [ __ ] is the thc so high i had the wrong [ __ ] joint but anyways it says 0.84 all right if you can see that all right so thc is 34 cbd 0.84 and uh also reads it's a 1.3 net weight so uh the last review i did was on the golani and the golanis i i usually like they're they're rolled in uh keith but they don't have that uh hash oil in it all right so basically i'm a fan of the golini all right nothing wrong with them i like it good brand it's easy to just kind of grab and go like i said pick up three or four of them if you don't have time to roll anything put in your bag good go it's safe and they're pretty potent so the other uh thing we want to talk about is price right so the golani [Music] i want to say it's about 15 this one the 2020 feature roll reads premium roll this is 25 so definitely cost more 10 more so uh let's go ahead and see what this thing's like so i'm gonna unscrew it [Music] smell it definitely smells like edibles so if you know what edibles smell like when they smell strong definitely has that smell so it smells really good and this thing is [Music] wow kind of uh it's really fat smells so good [Music] so anyways this thing's packed all right let's fire this thing up play some good music tell a story or two and let's get lifted fam so my last post i did was on the trifecta now i'm not saying i made the trifecta because i know i didn't because there's been plenty of people before me who are mixing moon rock hash concentrates inside their blunts or joints so but anyways uh we'll be rolling one of those up tonight a little later very smooth no flavor [Music] just it's burning real nice though it's got a when you light these joints you got to be great be uh careful because sometimes they just start to run and burn really bad but [Music] [Music] thing man this is a big big joint big joints figurines [Music] so so so far it's burning real smooth [Music] the flavor i'll say the flavor is definitely neutral but it's fire i mean it's just gas gas gas [Music] but this one's heavy [Music] heavy still feeling it i'm gonna be nice and litty for the ig show you know what i mean it's coming up in about 40 minutes oh man making the saliva come out of me ma'am anyways this thing is definitely dense i'm a fan of it i'm [ __ ] high [Music] oh [ __ ] you're strong fam [Music] i like it [Music] a lot of the times these pre-rolls might say you know special or enhanced keith hash whatever this is so far the best actually premium rule i tried [Music] man probably smoking missing for like three minutes already just got the tip so in comparison to the golanis when i picked the golanis up which are this brand these are all about the flavor these you can taste the flavor so if it says apple on it it's gonna taste like apple if it reads uh you know banana or whatever it meant it's gonna taste uncertain i think communication helps just man this is gas well for sure um so the go linings are definitely lighter than this i'm actually happy i did this review because this is my new favorite [ __ ] pre-roll this brand here this thing is slapping premium roll 20 20. you know this thing definitely got the hash oil and then i rolled in that teeth [Music] man i've been smoking this for like five minutes this still got a lot you know what i mean [Music] anytime i blow it out of my nose it hits way harder but it does hurt the nasals if you're not used to it you know what i mean man this guy's got me fired up i'll definitely buy it again this could be my new go-to [Music] no way i'm gonna be able to finish this one fam i know uh no cannot finish this one [Music] i didn't even get halfway through bam i'm good on it [Music] oh man [Music] i got this brand premium world 2020 [Music] if you see it pick this thing up i'm a pixar picking it up you know what i mean that's two gas way too gas i don't even know that's what i smoked [Music] damn she got me a cow anyways fam if you liked the video hit the subscribe button and the like button i'm telling you this [ __ ] right here this is it right here this is it again it's that premium future future roll 20. got that hash oil [Music] damn that [ __ ] is strong i'm about to put it away anyways fam i gotta get ready for the iv live show

clean cannabis coming back to you here on channel 4 2008 today we're going to be determining is West Coast cure cured joints aka pre-rolls really worth 15 bucks a pop I think it's affordable for a pre-roll 15 books in it really bad I feel like that's how much pre-rolled should be costing across every brand alright I just depends like what store you go to sometimes you can find a 3-pack for 25 bucks this string that we're going to be smoking on is wedding cake they say there's one whole gram in here the packaging I like I like the way it's like simple black it comes in like maybe like I don't know how you guys smoke or Medicaid but if you do blunt this is like what a pack looks like for one so that's why I like it opening it up it has a really pungent smell to it like a very very strong weed smell loving the tasting west coast here I love west coast care brands you can never go wrong with west coast here whether it's a pin a pre-roll dabbing and I just really like this I cannot wait to spark this up this smells like wedding cake cookie actually so we're gonna spark this up my roommate bought me a new laptop for the channel I'm so excited so we're actually going to set up the laptop it sparked this at the same time see how highly actually okay so if you're not getting high right now whip up that blunt you've got that joint you've got that read and let's get it okay I'm gonna actually cut this pre-roll open just like the tip and then we can break it down the last 30 seconds of the video and see what's inside the taste is impeccable like this like I said the smell of the stream was fruity and pastry at the same time and that's what I'm getting from the taste to zone actually was gifted this laptop because I was complaining about editing and that's another reason why I haven't been even posting first simply cannot edit well the slow computer that I have so I'm gonna take this over and flip it over this is the Microsoft Surface go I wanted this laptop I didn't think I was gonna get it like I could literally like kiss my roommate for doing this for me like I have some great friends down he also got me this awesome board so that this is so complex like I cannot figure out open this we are in business we are in business and I'm so excited you guys are like this I couldn't leave a comment down below are you a joint person are you a boring person honestly I think I'm moving towards that's my preference what is yours again leave a comment down below I'm so into that type of stuff just knowing about you okay channel 420 so you know I wasn't gonna let you go anywhere without getting to the bottom of this print roll no I said I was gonna break it down and show you guys what was on the inside so there you have it honestly it was just a regular bud nothing special but shout out to West Coast cure for not giving us no nasty mid-shelf bud this is actually some premium bud good see those nice crystal lose nice colors and then here's your wrap just to tip a whole joint wrap yeah shout out you guys subscribe [Music]", "sT4Hs1f_3G0": "tarantulas we got them back from gonji gold it's been one of our patients favorites for a long time but ranch Allah is a infused joint it's a good top-shelf cannabis with hash and oil so it's extra kick in the joint they come in green and blue the difference between the green and blue the green our greenhouse grown and the blue are indoor brown and blue ones go for $30 at the door with taxes and the greens go for $20 at the door with all taxes we're not traveling up now besides a covered in with the keep the oil and the key smells we'll get this one is purple Queen Latifah there's also kirova number four it's a real nice hybrids got Keefe distillate Sun grown bud other than that just real glue testing out 19 percent so definitely pick one hose up this one for candy jak2 sativa 22 percent as well this is the indoor the one we're smoking right now is a greenhouse grown a greenhouse grown purple Queen the purple queen is testing out over 27 percent it is a definitely got some cake fire oh yeah get my nose tingling my toque and enjoy hey that's a good joint if you passing me your sheet is I was like tripping there's person and smoking it's very smooth you could definitely on the purple Queen you could taste the purple flavor I don't that's the first time I've had purple queen but I'm not too familiar with the strain I haven't had a lot of fun I had it before this but definitely has reminiscence of a purple strain if you if you like those like you know kind of a granddaddy or maybe a great day I think my favorite thing about it so far is how quickly it's hitting me yeah it's into it and definitely feel it so the Keef on this joint if you can really see it it's a really light which is really rare to find sometimes it's really green but this is real light Keith which is really really good quality the oil on there too is is seem to be clears that's that's real nice it's not dark or brown door or anything like that which you don't want smoking really nice as well it's burning even all the way through and it hits really great to the tarantulas are all tested by can a safe that's the company that test these products making sure that you're getting good high quality medication with no issues they do this directions here says directions light taupe and Anjali so we're on the last part we're enjoying right now and it's good very enjoyable that's a good joint we just got these back recently we had to add them for a while and now after sex like the best joint in the house right now I mean I'd like smoking our pre-rolls we have a lot of good ones but and this is the greenhouse 1/2 this isn't even the end or one he's good to I'm stoned you know there's three of us and we're not even finished if they get the whole joint itself is over a gram and its entirety with the flour the oil and the key so it looks like this is a purple Afghani Hindu Kush me ain't my favorite thing about it so far as how well it's hitting usually every time I've got that joint this guy oil and keep on it and all that it's usually it runs it's pain and they asked to to have it burn right and this is burning really nice and even all the way through so very pleased about that mm-hmm and for our patients that like the Knockouts and what was the other ones we used to get galaxies the galaxies joints maybe we'll get those back one day I don't know right now I believe they're still waiting for compliancy issues but those were a favorite this easily is as good as any one of those that were ever made and this is bombed very comparable I would say have to try the end or want to see if it's how much better it is that was an outdoor Olivia this is the greenhouse okay that's where the greenest word green is greenhouse the blue is an indoor and they come in a variety of strange they keep tit all the way down to the crush to its keep all the way I'm not much left here yeah but there's an you can see from starting to getting this thing burned all the way down right at the very beginning it seemed like wasn't a run but it didn't I mean you can see it's really even from the beginning to the end this thing taste is good and this is towards the tail end if I'm not smoking paper probably still don't taste good still weed let's check it out this paper that was it as good a nice feeling any night oh yeah definitely but a body high and a head high but I feel good and then like I don't want to go run a mile or anything but I mean I feel like I could do something though yeah I'm very mellow I was energy chill yeah but I definitely want to do something a very good feeling up very uplifting I could good they'll enjoy doing something right now I don't know that's nothing another one right now but definitely smoking another one later for sure yep that would be a heavy one for some of the new buyers by their self I think like I don't think I can smell all those to myself that'd be that'd be too much picture itself if we had no plans for this today then when would be solid yeah but first people many people that was pretty good it was a good head change oh dude check them out tarantulas", "FYfewG91Bos": "i'm gonna be making a video on the one gram jeter p rule the strain is gonna be blue skittles let's get straight to it mate um we out here in my pad man i think it's my first time maybe not my first time whoa [ __ ] maybe not my first time but like one of my only videos out here in the backyard um in the day um i'm always making my videos at night because uh [ __ ] just because um i don't film it for my parents you feel me or not just like my parents with my fam i don't like filming it from i don't like filming in front of them it just feels weird [ __ ] there's too much light over here so yeah man like i said we're going to be smoking on the blue skittles by jeter i've had these periods before if you guys have not seen my 2 gram jeter video make sure to go check it out posted it maybe three months ago if you're watching this video where i wanted to upload it but this is the one grammar this is gonna be my first time facing uh the one gram jeter i've never smoked one to the face every time i smoked the jeter i split it with somebody the two gram i split it with my homie lorenzo and then i remember my homie bliss me out with one of these the one gram they actually had me lit two and today sunday friday uh we bought a two grand pre-roll and we split it between three of us still got high as [ __ ] so i'm curious to see how high i'm going to get with this one gram facing it to the dome so blue skittles if i remember correctly is going to be a cross of blue diamond and skittles this is going to be an indica strain this particular one is going to be testing at 30.65 thc zero percent cbd this was manufactured september 22nd 2020 today is i think august i'm in august [ __ ] um october 16th the burn time for this is i think five minutes about 10 minutes yeah you can see right there burning time 10 minutes um yeah man these [ __ ] pre-rolls highly [ __ ] recommend them let me know how much you guys get them i'm not sure if i said it but i got this for 15 out the door i think it was like 10 12 bucks before tax i get the one gram for 16 to 2 grand for 25 and the five pack for 32 or like 31. you just got to peel the plastic right here on the sides and have the um cut out if you want to peel that off pull plastic comes off push down and by the way this is not going to be glass this is um this is all plastic everything on here is plastic it's going to come sealed up just want to lift it up oh that smells weird all right y'all this is what the pre-roll is looking like like i'm guessing they brush it down with some oil and then rolled it in keith i think this is maybe like a point point eight of some flour point one of some wax point one or some keith maybe i don't know but let's go ahead and spark this up see how it's tasting see how it's smoking all right y'all came to the front yard because there was too much noise in the back the [ __ ] uh pump was going on just kidding i didn't want to be screaming and [ __ ] oscar what's up dog i don't know if this is a good angle or not but i'll go ahead and spark this up and uh get my first thoughts on this blue skittles never tried this strand before taste how it smells one thing i really [ __ ] like about these pre-rolls too is they never ever at least i've never smoked one that burns uneven always burning even as [ __ ] dude that's like better than my [ __ ] joints also you're gonna be crying sniffly and coughing like every [ __ ] hit i don't know if you guys can tell on camera but in person bro this [ __ ] chucks [ __ ] clouds dude throws hell of [ __ ] smoke she looks like you're [ __ ] vaping one sip of milk tastes all right all right i'm about to finish this piro i had recorded the video but it came out backwards like it was upside down so i'm just do this again um i'm hot as [ __ ] dude this is a one grand pro my first time facing this [ __ ] i'm pretty [ __ ] lit um i'll give this [ __ ] like a nine out of ten the only reason i'm gonna give it like a nine out of ten because i don't really focus this flavor i recommend a lot of the gelato 33 and i recommend the strawberry shortcake those two are gas um the thurber poison is also really [ __ ] good but yeah man i don't know i thought this flavor was going to be cool but it was cool it's not bad for me this is not what i thought it was going to be um but yeah bro i'm going to give this [ __ ] like a 9 out of 10 bro it's just perfect high swell i paid 25 bucks for this if i had to but you know yeah uh definitely recommend it if you guys haven't tried it for sure try this [ __ ] uh you guys are thinking about it man get this and if you guys have had it let me know what you guys think about them and uh that's a beautiful video y'all hope y'all enjoyed the video hope that time soon hope y'all listen and catch on there for me peace okay bye", "mKrqfPOIWSU": "yeah you guys go out there up your pre-roll game if you get it in a cardboard box and it's uh they're dry grab yourself a pack case throw above it in there let it sit for 24 hours your experience will be completely different than smoking a dry pre-roll nobody wants to do that anymore so let's let's change that welcome everybody this is anthony with boveda joined today by cody ziering with pac case how the hell are you buddy i'm good i'm good i'm coming off vacation so i'm still uh still a little bit of vacation mode um which is always a fun little area to be in no doubt uh best part about vacation is on the way their worst part of vacation is coming back to the office and seeing 18 000 emails waiting for you it happens all the time i know yeah so it's just been pitchforking out of that but um things are good yeah there's a lot going on here a lot of things to talk about today absolutely industry's booming boveda is booming pack cases booming let's get to it where do you want to start i mean you want to start with i guess how we kind of ran into each other years ago yeah absolutely this has been a long time coming no doubt um where was that i think mj biz vegas 2017 maybe yeah okay um yeah you guys what launched in 2016. just about yeah we uh we we came up with the idea very very early on like january 2nd 2016 we were still working for a vertically integrated cannabis company right near aspen colorado great experience gave us great insight into the industry and really what the cannabis market kind of demands uh and everything has come from there it was like it was one of my first very first trade shows i think when i walked over and saw you guys um it was a funny story we we bumped into you uh quite literally um saw your shirt and were like oh we know bobito we love that and we just started talking with you brett and i actually got invited brett's my business partner everybody in case uh nobody nobody knew that uh brettgelfan shout out to you buddy um brett and i actually went to that convention for free the cannabis company had purchased tickets for us and we had left before the show happened so we got to go on their dime and you know that's kind of when our world turned around and how did you how did you guys get into the space again um what was your background before pack case funny funny story uh i was working tech i was uh working for apple at the time i was an engineer um doing some annoying stuff on the phones with in between customers and engineering kind of realized that uh corporate life wasn't for me i needed a change and i was helping brett work on some website for some cannabis company uh two weeks later he said hey we need a director of marketing are you interested i jumped on the opportunities like all right we'll pack your stuff and get to colorado next month uh time to start so went out there a little bit of nepotism uh brett's uh brett's dad my dad and the guy that hired us have all been friends for 30 35 years i guess he wanted some smart cheap labor at the time and that's uh kind of how we got our invitation but a few months later unfortunately he got sick and it put brett and i in a position where we were running the show uh in our young 20s which is absurd to put 20 year olds in charge of a 15 million cannabis company but hey you know you got to do what you got to do in business it sure is yeah we have a similar story too um you know i want to hear it how did you get started please yeah no i was i was in tech as well like straight out of college um under the fluorescent lights in a cube sea of cubes and i was like oh yes i'm getting out of school i'm gonna you know work and sell stuff and pay off my loans and you know it's a big fortune 500 company and uh after about a year and a half you know i was going through started out as like uh you know basically a quote guy you know early on learning the sales process and then moved through quickly but i know i wanted to to sell and to really own accounts and quarterback stuff and i talked to my boss and he's like well that's probably eight to ten years away for you and so i'm like oh i can be patient but uh not that patient [Laughter] and uh yeah luckily family friends um one of my family friends lived down the street from my cousin again nepotism here lucky right place right time but um kate holstein who's in charge of our international business she's been uh she actually got me to sidetrack even more she got me my first job um working like as a banquet server at weddings and so i've just i've known her since i was a kid basically and she's like hey i worked this company boveda and um now we make these humidity control packs we're in the cannabis space we're in the tobacco market and we're in the music industry and i heard those three things i said cool i mean yeah i'm in so i interviewed with them long story short um you know as employee number 12 and i think we're over 65 now and that was just four and a half years ago so um really fun fun place to work similar stories here we're basically um very similar in what we do our products and our services are very complementary to the things we're trying to address here to the cannabis industry 100 peanut butter and jelly uh especially for for pre-rolls we make something that's uh great for protecting them and you guys make sure that they stay fresh and tasty for as long as absolutely possible longer than most thought would be possible exactly so anthony i mean we've been talking we've known each other for a long time but really i don't know the the story behind boveda how how did that come about what is it like tell everybody what bovita is yeah so um it's a really simple product and that's that's what uh that's what we like most about it but it's very effective and it works pretty well um it started 25 years ago a couple of guys in the tobacco business they were cigar smokers saw a problem with uh humidification one-way humidification for regulators for cigar humidors um they said there's got to be a better way to do this so they worked um with a couple of engineers from general mills here in minnesota on coming up with a product that's able to basically self-control it's not you you don't have to add anything to it um and it's a two-way controller so in a deficit environment it'll add humidity and then when there's not enough it'll or when there's too much it'll it'll absorb some too so it's it's really getting rid of those peaks and hills and valleys of humidity um and so that that technology started for the like i said for the the cigars and tobacco business and then over time and we i'm sure this has been talked about on many of our other podcasts but um you know we started seeing these tobacco stores uh selling a lot of products in northern california um to the traditional market and um there's like wow there's there's a demand for this on the cannabis space too and that was probably 10 12 years ago now um and so we came up with our our 62 formula and um you know from there the the technology has really stayed the same but we've been finding out more about how this technology can um you know not just protect weight and help you know manage the moisture content or water activity but to also preserve terpenes and trichome integrity so it's been fun to to watch how it's how it's grown and what we've learned um that's that's really fun there's a huge feast of thought culture here feast of learning love of learning um that's that's something that's at our very core um and we have a lab down in um the basement of our hq here where a lot of these tests are being ran we have a lot of partners um different labs across the states and even internationally that help run tests and it's it's really cool uh so yeah that's you know it's a bit of a ramble there but that's uh no it it it sounds super cool i mean we did we've we've been doing r d on our products for four years you know always trying to come up with new stuff but we just have to make a really interesting design and make sure it's structurally integral you guys you have to do some chemical engineering which i can only imagine just ups the level of difficulty by you know to the umpteenth degree so good for you guys it's great that you guys can do everything downstairs and run humidity tests and i know that's a great segue into what we'll we'll talk about next because you can't really run a humidity test without measuring what you're trying to contain the humidity within uh which kind of leads me on to what we do over a pack case and we make these really amazing joint cases this is one of our awesome hemp clients father obsidian but check this out we call this product a jpeg it's our flagship so you'll notice inside this is what's amazing to bovida and everyone who uses it there's a gasket seal that lines the actual case to hold five payrolls um so when you close it you can actually hear the click that's how you know it's sealed and then our favorite part not so boveda is central but we have a extra little place that you can store roaches so you can't finish a joint you don't want to stink up the rest of uh the fresh ones inside the pack that was a really cool idea um so as we were developing this the whole reason we put a gasket in there was to make sure that pre-rolls stayed fresh unfortunately in this industry the pre-roll has been an underutilized product skew for so long such an easy product to produce it's something that from a beginner to an intermediate to a super heady everyone loves smoking joints everyone loves smoking bloods and when we first got in the industry back in 2016 everyone was just taking trim that shitty extra leftover whatever stuffing in a pre-roll and saying okay good enough today now it's totally different story people use only flower premium everything sometimes they're even caviar which means that they may have a core with some hash or are wrapped with some keef and some extra little bits on the outside and can exceed retail values of over 50 bucks in fact last time i was in vegas at the show we went to a dispensary planet 13 and they were selling a can of cigar for a thousand dollars uh so the pre-roll game has totally evolved now think about this anthony what would what would you do if you went out you bought a blood that was a thousand dollars and it was dry i would immediately want to return it right and can you probably not probably not so products like that have to be in something that's airtight and gasket sealed and if you're doing it the right way you have a bill vita pack in there as well yeah no doubt um you you brought up some really interesting stuff cody um do you mind expanding a little bit on how you've seen um you know we're we're more on the you know we certainly work with a lot of companies that manufacture pre-rolls um but also you know people that are just packaging grams or eighths or quarters or ounces or pounds um but it seems you know i mean you guys have a focus on pre-rolls do you want to elaborate on how that's changed throughout like the last four or five years um you know going into this more premium stuff versus just the consumable hey you know the dispensary is running a deal and you get a free pre-roll and it's kind of just like everyone expects oh it's it's probably gonna be dry it's probably not gonna taste very good but i mean how is it where is it changed and where is it changing where is it going yeah absolutely like i had said before when we first got into it no one really cared they just took a pre-roll they were sometimes even making them in the dispensary with leftover whatever after bagging out you know an eighth for a customer there's maybe another gram or two in the jar so the manager said screw it let's grind it up throw it in some pre-rolls and now we can sell it today the pre-roll is a main sku in the industry i think it accounts for maybe 10 15 20 somewhere in there depending on the month of total cannabis sales in the entire country so clearly they're here to stay and it's a product that people love so very quickly back in 2016 and 17 when we were starting pack case we realized that the pre-roll was super underutilized it wasn't really given the appreciation that it should have i mean it's a top level sku it's a real money maker and it doesn't take a lot of money to actually start producing them so we created our product because there wasn't any premium offerings like i said everyone was just throwing [ __ ] in a tube and or a bag and that was it there really wasn't like a uh a big demand for people asking for quality pre-rolls and we didn't understand that because as pre-roll enthusiasts someone who we smoke joints all the time especially when we went skiing or out for hikes or whatever joints are the way to go um no one really had anything that was nice or worth talking about bringing home so instead we just buy flour and roll our own but it left a huge amount of market opportunity for all these cannabis companies who weren't doing something to make a premium sku that addresses a huge market need so there was an incredible amount of demand and no supply whatsoever and that's where pac case came in to fill the gap and give opportunities to companies like this to be able to sell a premium pre-roll so was pac case kind of born on the mountain per se it's funny uh we quickly came up with the idea late at night uh the second night that brett and i had ever met um just because we were talking about going skiing and taking joints before we ever had a prototype uh i had actually uh three or four joints like in my chest pocket um took a little kicker while i was skiing and totally yard sale ate [ __ ] skis went flying worst part though uh i was kind of hurt and the joints were all broken so not only was i like in pain i couldn't smoke so it was it was rough so brett and i very quickly jumped on finding someone to help us out with the design and we quite literally used our prototype our very first one which i have right here super basic shitty design but uh this i used for an entire winter to hold pre-rolls and make sure that they wouldn't break so connor was uh was born out of uh two things a we needed a person we had a personal need we needed to be able to carry joints on the mountain or going for hikes or wherever uh and at the same time we knew that the cannabis market needed it too so it was a little bit of a selfish uh build it was kind of doing it for us and then realized there was a business behind it too that's that's exactly it though i mean that's how great products and ideas are born what's what's uh what's a problem i'm facing in my world today like some broken pre-rolls and then you know there's gonna be thousands of other people that have the same problem so cool stuff i've always loved your guys products um and you guys um you have your your five pack obviously what's what's more of your consumer facing um your duo right do you have you don't have a single though because who's gonna smoke a single joint i mean you're always gonna have one for a buddy so you would think that we uh we do have a we may or may not i cannot confirm or deny that we have a single in the works um but it won't be ready for a while if in fact we're working on something uh really though like one is never enough right like two is always better than one three is better than two and [ __ ] if you can have five will have five um so it's it's what's most amazing and what i find most interesting about our product and why it it works so well on both sides of the aisle um it's a packaging product it was always developed to be a packaging product and whole allow cannabis companies to sell pre-rolls but over the course of a year or two as we were our social media was growing and people were starting to find out about what we were doing people started asking for these just like hey i don't live in a cannabis state how do i get one um so we put them up on amazon and let it ride and uh two years later we've sold you know more than 50 000 units and are absolutely crushing a thousand reviews which blows my mind and we have over four and a half stars which on a product intended for packaging that gets sold as an accessory yeah blows my mind every time 100 and um one thing that i've always loved about your guys product is that um you know you can you can customize it um you know the the business can go put their branding on it and customize it however they want um that's a huge thing especially up in canada and some other markets that um you know they can't necessarily advertise or brand do you have any experience there um helping companies really market their brand with your guys packaging technology i'm glad that you asked that anthony pack case technically is a packaging company right that's the product that we sell but really when you get down to things we consider ourselves a marketing company we give our clients an ability to brand and promote products in ways that they wouldn't be able to before our packaging may be slightly more expensive than everyone else on the market but that's obviously because it's a premium feel what other packaging can go out and say hey i sell for 20 on amazon but instead you can come to my dispensary take five of my best highest quality joints with delicious flour have my brand on it and then now go and walk around with it so we give these companies not just an opportunity to create beautiful packaging that's going to create an amazing customer experience but we also allow their customers to then become a walking advertisement for their company think about it you buy a jpack from somebody that means you have five joints so you take one joint out to smoke with a friend well you're obviously gonna close the pack put it back in your pocket again you still have four left so you're gonna hold on to the packaging for a long time which means anytime you smoke with somebody and you take that out your brand as a company gets exposed to their friend who's now likely to become a customer their self themselves yeah well and let's let's back up to a second so let's talk about um the premium aspect so and what that value can can mean not only to a business but to the consumer so your guys you go i mean let's and we can even back up to that leap down study that we helped you guys do so that by let's explain this to the the people so yeah boba can take uh packaging and put it into a um a dry chamber put above the pack in there and then we can basically estimate the shelf life or stability how long the boba packs can last how long the product is going to stay fresh um versus no active humidity control versus having a boat pack in there and then we can compare that um against the control and give you hey this is going gonna you know add an extra week two weeks a month some cases um let's should we chat about uh how that went and what that kind of means for brands and consumers as far as you know brands are gonna be able to go into more inventory and that's something that we've seen on on the boveda side is um you know a big concern or a big problem facing a lot of these operators was hey we're just trying to get product on the shelf because the supply and demand chart is totally kitty wampus and you know we've had cultivators operators say we're we're trying to like they're torn especially these commercial ones because they want to have a longer cure on their their flower and they wanna couldn't really control that quality um but then they have um people in the supply chain saying hey this dispensary's been out of said strain this amount of flour for x amount of days and like we just we need to get on the shelf it's just flying off the shelf that we have seen as i have seen personally that's kind of slowing down and people are able to go into more inventory and carry more um but our products together can help assure that that shelf life is there and so product isn't sitting for two three months and then it's sold dry that's one of the benefits of being able to use pack case and boveda together um these operators who you know think about it if you have a production team of 10 well you don't necessarily want to have two people doing pre-rolls and two people doing edibles and spread out your labor force a lot of the times it's more efficient and our clients have told us this that you know i want to put my entire production team have them do an entire run start to finish bang it out and then move on to the next project now when you do that with flour with pre-roll with something that's not necessarily super shelf stable like a concentrate or an edible you have to have velocity so not only do you have to package it up quickly you have to get it out the door you have to get it to the dispensary they have to shelve it and then they have to get it out to the consumer now that process can take a lot longer than it would take a cannabis to dehumidify and then dry out lose terpenes lose flavor lose potency and mess with um with effects right like if uh some thc converts into cbd that flower that you smoke once it's converted is gonna make you feel totally different than if it didn't exactly so with boveda and pack case because they're such a tremendous seal these producers have the ability to make an entire run of pre-rolls leave them in their factory if they have to and as long as it's properly sealed and the boveda pack is fresh these pre-rolls are going to last a lot longer which means that their production problems that come along with having to do massive runs and then making it like sit on it as opposed to doing smaller runs and moving them quicker and making a regular process makes life a lot easier for them they can sit down bang out all of their pre-rolls that they need for a month and two days and then not have to worry about the quality at all because of the protection that pacquiao boveda provides yeah and a term that comes to mind that i hear a lot is consistency um and that's that's what a lot these brands want to deliver because they know in a lot of these markets especially on the east coast where i've been working predominantly it's medicine so uh you know it's if you can the cannabis plant in the flower is not a it's not a pill and it's very volatile and so like you said um you start getting that trichome degradation and you're gonna lose medicinal benefits um and it's like you know going to get your prescription and your short your short two pills and there's an extra one magical pill tossed in there you know it's like you you want to make sure that the product is consistent and delivered same same smell same taste same flavor same effect every time and uh yeah i think i think our our two products definitely can help um in that in that regard absolutely cannabis obviously is a product that affects headspace and if you find something that works for you and you find something that you like you want to make sure that if you buy it again it's going to have the same exact effect uh there's only one way to do that in terms of flour and pre-rolls and that's control the humidity making sure that the product stays the same on day one as it is on day 30 and potentially even out to day 60s so it's important i know that a lot of people that consume cannabis for medical reasons um which there are many that's how this whole industry really started right um they need that they need consistency of dose they need consistency of effect and you can only do that by controlling terpene and humidity content right yup yup there's no doubt about that and then um you know let's another thing that i've been seeing um and sorry this is so salesy just because that's the world that i live in every day is just sales but um you know competition between brands um i i like to think of the cannabis industry as a more friendly um competition uh than any than any other industry that i've been in or or seen where it's you know really we're we're all in this together with one common goal and that's to bring uh relief to a lot of people and liberty to a lot of people um to do what they want with their lives consume what they want and um just not step on anyone else's toes but competition on shelf space um is the pack case boveda combo is that something that people can use to set their their brands apart from others is that can you take these these two common value adds and educate the consumer to say hey i'm gonna my pre-rolls are gonna probably be better in here by the time i get them depending on when they were packaged and you know i'm gonna have an extra two three weeks to go through these um with the boveda pack and then you know i have the pack case forever um these are these are things that consumers care about and are gonna want is that messaging from the consumer is that getting driven to these brands that are making these decisions on packaging yet it's a good question some of the brands who really have a premium focus and a premium attention absolutely they understand that their customers keep coming back to them because their products are so good some of the there's a lot of a lot unfortunate but there's a lot of cannabis companies out there that really don't cater to a premium market um and don't really care about the quality of their products um you know like i said a lot of them are still back in the model of 2016. let's take any leftover [ __ ] that we have let's toss it in a pre-roll put it in the doob tube and just send it whatever happens happens i don't know about you but whenever i consume something that affects headspace uh alcohol cannabis whatever else it may be i always want to make sure that i'm getting something that's quality and consistent um price isn't so much uh a concern of mine right i would much rather pay an extra 20 or 30 bucks to know that uh the quality that i'm getting is there versus having to deal with some [ __ ] for a much cheaper cost i believe that if you're gonna intake something it should only be the the best quality you know it's affecting you like you as yourself not a car not a house you and your health so for me as a consumer i always want to make sure i'm getting high quality and i think that there's a lot of companies that value my sentiment and cater towards a client like me when you have a customer that doesn't you end up with shitty product and that creates a negative loop sure you're going to get the sale once or twice because it's a cheap product but i doubt that person's coming back to you there's no consistency there's no flavor it's all dry harsh smoke it's no good no one likes that yeah and that's i think that's changing too i think as more people get introduced to cannabis i mean we talk about all these people taking baby steps i mean i was down in in florida i had a dispensary doing a visit and i i witnessed what i always knew was going on down there but never had witness for myself which was a woman that looked just like my grandma going into a dispensary for the first time and she has all of her paperwork and she looks at the the person at the front desk and she's kind of you know pretty coy and her her husband's behind her um you know they're just kind of looking around and she goes i'm here to um purchase some marijuana it's so cool to see that but there's so many people that need to be become educated on you know multiple different aspects of cannabis um but it's there's so many new people coming into it and uh that's that's a that's a big piece of the education piece and you know knowing what you're consuming how it's gonna make you feel um you know what you like essentially there are a lot of people figuring out what they like and um you know here in minnesota it's tough for me uh because we don't have um you know like we don't have adult use here so i can't just go in and say hey you know i'm wanting this today and that's uh that's something that a lot of new states are having which is is great um and uh sorry i kind of lost my train of thought here it's all good those are those were always my fate when when i was back at the cannabis company those are always my favorite people you know there were times and days where you know as just a higher level employee at the company uh the dispensary was short-handed so i'd have to go in there and maybe put a quick shift in and just talk to cool people about wheat all day it was honestly not a bad way to uh spend a couple hours outside of my normal role my favorite customers were always the older folks who really had never id any idea they'd walk in they'd always be like hey can i like can i buy some weed yeah and it's like you don't have to whisper it's legal welcome to the cannabis store let me show you what what are you what are you interested in what would you like to try are you interested in smoking something would you like to vape something would you like to try an edible it's always great introducing those people to the entire world something that as an enthusiast we've been living for decades right but i don't want to date myself but [ __ ] it's been a long time um yeah it's it's it's remarkable the clearly the direction of the country the world is totally changing our neighbors up to the north were a lot smarter than we were legalized a lot quicker and look what happened now they have five or six companies in cannabis worth over a billion dollars you ever think that there'd be a unicorn in cannabis now there's five it's insane yep ellen what do you think is i mean comparing the canada to the u.s right now um especially these last couple weeks um just these these larger operators and what what is that what does this mean for cannabis in 2021 um as far as these these bigger companies you know that and you know four or five years ago in the grassroots cannabis movement semi grassroots cannabis movement um you know a lot of it was the the buzz around trade shows in the industry was all these you know these big companies are gonna come in and they're gonna start getting swooped up and the commercialization does cannabis in your opinion cody does it kind of model what happened uh recently this last decade with beer craft beer and you know your big domestic beer is there gonna be a commercial side of cannabis and then also room for the craft cultivator um that's really focused on small quality good stuff um that's gonna be competing against you know price and volume from some of these giants that's a great question the beer model is one that is perfect to use as an analogy um i think myself a lot of these major cannabis companies are swooping up a lot of the smaller ones there's a lot of conglomeration that's going on in the industry obviously when you kind of grow as a company or you want to expand you either need additional growth space which requires additional licensing so a lot of the small guys or the guys that were in quickly did some decent growing started as a startup and made it to mid-sized company those are ideal acquisition targets for the big boys so i think what's going to happen at least the next three four years is that all the big boys are going to start to swoop up a lot of the smaller guys that's where you emerge the budweiser the coors light all the the general high volume lower quality lower price type products from that will come the grassroots movement again so i think everything is going to kind of go underground for a little while and all these craft companies in maybe three four years will start to emerge when people really care about quality and it's not so much about bottom dollar anymore yeah we have a huge canadian client that we love working with when we first started with them they had a huge huge initiative and focus on innovation it was 2018 they had an opportunity to really try and control the market with an innovative awesome product uh cost was no object they said [ __ ] it we want the coolest best highest quality product that we can provide and it worked out great for them they quickly jumped into one of the leaders positions in the industry in canada and everything was was great it towards the end of 2019 and then with uh early covid uh early 2020 uh their share price fell dramatically they were you know their balance sheets showed that they were just outlaying cash left and right for the innovation without necessarily realizing that when you spend so much on innovation it takes a long time for it to come back right roi on innovation is a year year and a half process minimum for us for example you know we started designing jpeg trio in 2018 it didn't get launched until you know mid 2019 it took 12 16 months 18 months to get the product out there so with this cannabis company even though they were so amazingly focused on innovation for the first part once legalization happened now they realize that it's all about bottom dollar and how do we reduce cost of goods so now instead of trying to produce flowers that may be tastier but take an extra two weeks now they're producing lower quality genetics that harvest faster that they can just turn around and sell and cheaper packaging and i think that's now the start of where you see the the budweiser and the the coors lights versus like uh you know a small batch brewing company really focused on delivering a delicious tasty product i mean one has consistency one has flavor yup but you know which would you prefer to drink budweiser or the the local craft beer pretty easy decision in my opinion yeah well for me too it's a time and place thing sometimes uh you know being from minnesota and uh going up to the cabin a busch light just kind of brings you back you know i love those you mean can't hate on that i'm a big coors guy i went to school in colorado spent a few years in co i love course especially like any tailgate absolutely but then you know you're trying to drink 16 18 beers potentially and really have yourself an afternoon that's not so much the case when you're drinking something that's a little bit tastier and perhaps next to a steak and maybe you're gonna have one or two very different days though the pairing is everything bingo and the season two i'm a big seasoned guy when it comes to those things absolutely you brought up uh i don't know how much time we have here ramsay um but you brought up uh kovid um how do you think that's been um impacting i guess pros and cons um your guys customers people you've been working with um you know if i can touch briefly i can just say what i've noticed is um i think a lot of these quality things sops standard practices best practices a lot of these procedural things are starting to really get drilled into um on paper and people are starting to like really figure their their [ __ ] out um and that's i think making a little bit extra room for products and services that focus on true value-add and um you know roi that you know we can bovada specifically too can can really tell you hey your flower your inventory your entire inventory weighs this today um and here's the percent moisture content um if you added two percent moisture content to that entire inventory here's the literal change in fair market value of your inventory i think those things now it's not it's not everything's not moving so fast where it's hey package it get it you know it doesn't matter if it cures on the shelf whatever we just we got to get it in stores because we don't have any and people are buying it anyway um i think covid kind of or the lockdown specifically um kind of help people really look at their what they're doing their day-to-day operations and where they can make changes have you guys noticed that too absolutely it gave you know business operators a chance to sit back and not be surrounded by the buzz of a hopping office and they actually had a few moments to think about like hey what can we do better what can we do to improve like our everything our process is top to bottom from growing the production of packaging to sales yeah um what's interesting is that you know this is what makes me happy is that a lot of the country deemed cannabis in a central industry um okay would you ever have been able to imagine that 10 years ago probably not i mean even back in 2014 but government said hey people need cannabis especially in california and all the cannabis companies stayed open so i think having those cannabis restrictions that got imposed on everybody required all these business operators to really sit back and understand how can we do things more efficiently because [ __ ] i used to run my growing operation with 40 people well now i can only have 15 in the building so how are we still going to manage the same output but with less than half of the labor staff forces you to sit back and really think about what you're doing and if you guys are cutting short you know corners trying to take a shortcut when that's not necessarily the best thing to do or neces or even necessary you know small little changes in process like adding a movita pack into your curing box can potentially generate an extra 300 000 a year for a mid-sized cannabis company it's substantial and that tiny little you know how much could that really end up costing you a couple thousand dollars over the course of a year when you can end up you know that can let you back a couple hundred thousand so a lot of these guys with cannabis you just you've been running and like you you ever try and get on a treadmill when it's set at 10 you there's no warm-up time you just have to get down and start sprinting yeah college a couple times yeah i'm not sure if those ended well but that's that's what working in a cannabis company is like the moment that your product goes out the door for the first time it's off to the races you have now an endless uh endless demand for your product and you have to continuously handle that that with good supply um and they don't haven't had a lot of time to think about it as soon as they got on that treadmill it's just off to the races full sprint covent gave them a chance to sit back take a second step off the treadmill and try and figure out what they should actually be doing yeah i completely agree um definitely notice that as well on our end um all right cody uh what's next for paccase great question we have a couple cool new packaging products coming out but that's not really what what tickles me i get very excited about the consumer market i love bringing products to people that will actually use it so we have a really awesome new case that should be launching the next five six months uh think jpac an iphone had a baby that's about all i can touch on it yeah well that's uh that's intriguing um because i think i think i know where that's going um don't wanna don't want to speculate too much but um and where can you pick these up so i know you said amazon um i know you guys have uh point of purchase displays too so i'm assuming that it's this is getting into more mass retail absolutely yeah we uh we sell in a couple different places you can go out and check uh jpac products out on amazon number one uh our shopping website packcase.com i'm sorry packcase.shop you can get there from packcase.com as well um and now they're we're starting to be available in retailers so there's a whole bunch of distributors starting to pick these up so you should start seeing them in retail stores over the next few months and if you're a retailer and interested in picking up our products we have a wonderful wholesale section on paccase.shop so make sure to stop there put in a little vendor request and we'll make sure to get to you so you guys can start selling pack cases yourself cool cool yeah same thing for boveda um we're

to change their views on it I'm sure you faced a lot of negativity on on what type of lifestyle you're trying to provide with pigs and I tuned it out and don't hear any much negative noise on what I'm trying to do it doesn't really help because because I you know I don't think that's the case I can't even give ear to it [Music]", "4vEEM_USrjw": "welcome to cush's unboxing where we unbox the stuff so that you don't have to if it ends up being garbage all right so these we got from seven stars in richmond they were around six dollars each with tax let's see what's in the white bag all right so we've got west coast trees we've got a hybrid we've got a sativa and we've got an indica let's check out they look like they are from out of sacramento the distribution is there's the west coast trees let's get some information off the package this is a gelato 120 milligrams of thc at a 12 and cbd less than one percent a manufacturing package date price minus tax standard government warning here's your information on the distributor all right let's see what this company has to offer for pre-rolls all right and let's get this out of the way so you can see it's got it's pretty firmly packed and there's the tip and that tip all right let's break into this got a little ash tray right there all right so that's your green inside let's take a dry drag see how it tastes can't really get a dry drag out of it it's not too bad it doesn't have much flavor this is the gelato smoke it you can see the smoke is pretty taste yeah not the best let's see if we can get a shot of the er okay it's burning good getting drags off of it it's burning a little to the side all right i like to do the little pat test again because sometimes i don't smoke a gram all at once you can see it's kind of bendy when you do that it just means it's got like a weak spot in it there it's not fully packed it's not that it's not fully packed it's that it's got a gap in it all right so you can see it's a few more anyway it did break i always like to see if there's big chunks that come out as well if i try to put it out and relight it yeah it's just okay the taste is not that great gelato is gelato and you kind of know if you're smoking flour gelato or whatever they keep putting in these things i don't know i'm kind of disappointed in all of these pre-rolls except one but i can't tell you because it's like a hairdresser so won't be able to get in all right let's check out the west coast trees indica i'm gonna just break this one open for you to show you all right so you can kind of see we're getting a lot of stuff in the background let's get to focus there we go you can see i mean it's pretty well packed again that other one just had that little bump in it or that little gap in it [Music] so if you don't do this to your joints you're missing out can just be removed like that you can see it's like you can kind of see like the yellow flakes in it so you're definitely getting not full full flower in the pre-rolls you can see the little if you've ever grown or you can see the little yellow yellow ones all right so let's take a little dry drag of this i'm sorry i told it i am not getting any dry drags off of these but should still messed up okay so this one is the hybrid no i'm sorry this one's the indica the first one with the hybrid again the drag off of them perfect they're not packed too tight where you can't get a drag off of them it's pretty good let's put that out that one was out better you can see you get a get a little uneven burning on these [Applause] oh anyway okay okay so not my again not bad again for six dollars the bay areas prices are pretty high dollars a joint so oh and this one did not have a seal on it so that plastic seal was missing unless i took it off already which i don't think i did let's take a look at this one again packed packed pretty good let's take that end off i have to write on the on the tips of these of which ones they were um let's take a look at the packaging on this one this is the indica oh sativa sour watermelon 12 less than one percent i think it's all the same packaging let's see west coast we did and the indica i did the hybrid i believe already yeah there you go purple goo and i'm just not tasting so this one is the sour melon i'm hoping i taste a little bit of sour in this one there's the green okay so this one out of all of them probably taste the best and that is the sour melon sativa all right oh gosh there is that yes you're also not getting those little yellow leaves in that one so the yellow leaves was in the i think the indica i'll rewatch the video all right so let's smoke this one they could be burning uneven because i took a little bit out of the m but let me try to even it up see what happens [Laughter] my too many hits all in a row anyway back back to the show so that one tastes the best this one tastes the best um it's the sour sour melon so seven stars was the place that i bought them and west coast trees west coast trees with a z your sativa is good i would try to work on the other ones anyway that's my unboxing and review have a good one see you next time", "Od0PfieBlzg": "what's

rolled for you but look at this like smoking tip it's like so what sexy as you can see that there you go it has the caviar logo it's made out of glass super easy to pull from the paper is basically the raw rolling paper and my personal favorite um and yeah so we decided to go with the hybrid and it's funny actually the way that that happened it's because they had one that was the team that had three so they had a hybrid they had a sativa and an indica so she basically looked at us and was like well I know you like sativa and then you like indica so then we looked at each other like oh [ __ ] which one are we gonna get right so she's like how about you meet in the middle and compromise so we got a hybrid so we're gonna go some off this bad boy we're gonna do the stat test on it so you'll

see it I'd be sitting my bed still go a bit [ __ ] so I was chilling on my bed I went to the kitchen I went to go get some [ __ ] like somebody drink or something eat I was checking on something so anyways I had got up off my bed to go to the kitchen so I went to the kitchen came back had my lady in the couch on my bed and I went to take my slipper off so I have put like raised up my right foot and then I tried to kick my slipper off and as I kicked down bra it was all bad as I kicked down my foot caught my email cord bra oh and as you can imagine the worst happen the [ __ ] email came tumbling down the [ __ ] drop down came off the [ __ ] red was on the ground water spilled the after bath of that [ __ ] Oh bad that bucket after bath of that [ __ ] oh the custom girl rig into pieces guys it's in pieces it's in [ __ ] pieces and you know what didn't [ __ ] break this wasn't the downstem that wasn't biscuit that was the drop down that was on it this was the drop down that was on it and it didn't [ __ ] break so this [ __ ] [ __ ] was damn near set up like this in like this right oh [ __ ] me oh it cut me [Music] look that [ __ ] really cut me anyways so this [ __ ] was dammed out here like this like this and [ __ ] he came crashing down off the table boom boom bap this [ __ ] broke this didn't break I wish it did this was only ten dollars this rig came in a daily high club box that was like $35 so in any rate I [ __ ] broke a rig again check this out this this right here is my first ever piece of glass I bought it was if you could see [ __ ] if you can see that [ __ ] just diamond glass this was the first rig I bought I bought this [ __ ] off 420 in San Francisco on Haight Street just because by huh be cool ja needed add a brick to take a dab out of so I was like [ __ ] I mean let me cops up so we can take some dabs she was taking dabs on 420 with my homie cool John that was reason why I bought this piece but then it ended up breaking I didn't break this piece but it ended up breaking and it's just what happens when you have glass man [ __ ] breaks so yeah I'm a little salty that this shit's broken because it was like my best setup that I have for an email and my mom gave me just peace so it was like you know didn't cost me nothing but [ __ ] it lost me everything do you feel me because this it was tight so that's his god broke-ass it sucks this is still going it's burning just fine it's burning like pretty slow for being just one person token on it it's hella nice is burning evenly now that I finally got it going it's [ __ ] blue brah that's just my favorite I wish this was blue but my older brother got it for me his favorite color is red so that's the only reason why we're cuz my brother got it for me for Christmas so shoutouts to my brother you guys think about this area should get along whoo so yeah guys that's what I've been up to just working on the [ __ ] grind making sure my finger don't bleed out just been working you feel me putting these videos out let me know if you guys like this style here or if you like it over there where I sit on a couch I'm on the other side of the couch and this is like where I sleep so [ __ ] if you leave a comment down below if you like it this style view like looking like this to the side having to cuz I get a better lighting from here when I'm over here on this side I use a [ __ ] lamp light and this burnt out so yeah if you like that should I have to go get another lamp light to be able or a different type of light I'll invest into a better light if you guys like it on a couch better on that couch side of you or if you like it on my bed couch with the window open leave a comment down below what you guys like to see better yeah it's going pretty nice so yeah man all right Pete to the custom grow 420 really that was like to clean this piece to use on my email this because it had the least air restriction it was like a juggler you dumb you just like you can you can just take a toke on that as hard as you wanted to in you filming you was getting your whole dab unlike this piece right here because of all the [ __ ] little [ __ ] and [ __ ] in here all these little [ __ ] you kind of have to hit it harder to get more airflow this one you just and it would just come at you didn't even have to that had no restriction at all [Music] sidecar [ __ ] super slid the fuses I [ __ ] was bomb but r.i.p we got anymore come on you mentally smoke too much flour on this channel but we'll try and come out with some more content with flour I do like some open oil it's my shake that's pretty nice the ash is pretty white guys my review on this since I've been smoking it this [ __ ] got me [ __ ] loaded so it's a pass you feel me it's easy on the throat it's easy on the lungs you get fat clouds out of it and this one in particular is actually rolled way better cuz I actually if you will go watch my [ __ ] what video maybe it's not even in a video yet [ __ ] well I [ __ ] had two of these right so I had this one and I had this one which was the red one and the red would damn near was trash you feel me I didn't really like the red one now I'm not hating on it because it was [ __ ] red but like when you [ __ ] took a toke on it like for some reason it would just like it would hit like you could get a cloud off it and I smoked it to the face and I don't feel like I got loaded off it it tasted cool was black cherry but I don't really like that one but this blue one is [ __ ] bomb cuz like my eyes are already low as [ __ ] is this I'm just higher can't even it's hard to explain it it's way better and I was damn you're gonna smoke another one with you guys for the [ __ ] of it yes this one the sour tangi because i got two of these too and I still have both of them that I need to throw up and it's from the same company so they got these where's that [Music] damn cuz I was gonna put a fella forgot because I was gonna put this [ __ ] out and light one of these [ __ ] right here because one of these is tangi sour tangi sour tangi and this one is [ __ ] juice this is a good old uh and this is a indica and this one is a hybrid you feel me I forgot I was only gonna smoke half of this and then smoke one of these down but [ __ ] damn this [ __ ] just went out so this one just went out I'm actually gonna [ __ ] spark one of these [ __ ] it I'm Lexie I'm gonna just our tangi I think so lucky sour tangi this one here okay so this one just to recap really quick high voltage it was a pre-roll raw cone had top-shelf blood in it I don't even think I said this Kylie's finest og mix for life president it doesn't even say [ __ ] on here covered with OG key and it has live resin inside and I'm assuming it has you know top gel blood in it because that [ __ ] was pretty fired this one here is a premium cannabis rolled with the foot Premium Canada strolled in nature and natural leaf nature I'm cuttin hi this right here nature's combs premium cannabis rolled in natural leaf nature's calm calm distributed by Kings coast tan GOG hybrid tested 1.2 grams tested by SC labs 31.3 40 Hz so yeah there's that I'll show you guys this get it glare off it comes with this [ __ ] on the top I'm assuming that's just so just so just so just so yeah so the none of that [ __ ] did falls out I'm actually gonna keep that on there yeah yeah yeah I got that [ __ ] back on their breath okay so I'm gonna leave it on here just because I don't want this [ __ ] falling out so this was genius and idea number one [ __ ] smartest [ __ ] so this [ __ ] don't fall out it has a [ __ ] filter in there that's pretty [ __ ] dick it's got this cool little band on it to hold everything in it's a palm leaf is what they told me if I'm not mistaken you take a [ __ ] swag ha yeah so this is a palm leaf I'm not mistaken so let's [ __ ] party be spark it mother sparker yay Cheers [Music] [Music] the flavor on this is kind of hard to describe I don't know you've got a [ __ ] try this you I'll know it makes you feel like you're smoking something luxurious and I get to one of the finer things in life I don't know it feels like Titan it is smoking awfully fast then taste on it though to taste that you really came to I've not tasted this flavor with the joint or a blunt on the ball or pipe [Music] super hard to explain the flavor dish it's hella good too I just feel like I should be doing something hella cool friends rather fast but it is what it is this is awesome $15 log with all the other woods this filter is pretty cool [Music] see if I get a good one what I used to

candy flavored cannabis bread by third-generation family and turf hogs the chunky colas explode in the expectrum of light green here okay well I can't show that now because it's in a pre-roll but yeah

necessarily it may not work for you but these are the things that are saying that this strains it'll skittles Zittel you know what it is can do for you and it burns slow I don't have to keep lighting

you can get the product for yourself remember thumbs up subscribe or like this stuff and I'll catch you in the next one I'm out", "YW6EEZNiwFw": "hello everybody okay today I have a super quick tutorial walkthrough if you will we have a lot of people really interested in CBD joints but have actually expressed that they don't know how to use CBD joints so I'll kind of walk through this you know product this is made with industrial hemp flour it is a full one gram joint it's rolled with raw papers it does have kind of you know like a paper filter in there so when you're in handling the part doesn't go into your mouth and so with that this is the part that goes on your mouth it will say we're all on it and it's more like the slender side at the bottom of the joint and then on this end is actually what you're going to light with fire with flame I'm gonna use matches we also sell hemp wick in our store here we start CBD you're welcome to use lighters pretty much anything that will make fire is how you're going to light the pre-roll but I'm just gonna basically show you how to light the pre-roll on how to put the pre-roll out Oh quick other thing to note because is a full gram I don't recommend smoking the whole thing out once this is a really great product to share amongst your friends this is also a really good product for yourself but just to know that you don't need to take puffs to complete the whole joint you kind of smoke until you feel it so usually for me when I'm smoking enjoy by myself I'll take you know anywhere from three to five hits kind of let it rest see how my body is responding to that and then if you want you know there's no harm in smoking more just know that to get the effect of smoking CBD you don't have to smoke this whole one gram joint that's actually a lot of CBD in my opinion and I'm Allison to go on this piece and this is a side that I'm going to light and we're just gonna do a quick little minor joint if I can light it so the point is to light the paper kind of light that hole first you know circumference of the joint you do take a few puffs really big inhalation is just to kind of like get that cherry on the end of it lighted and then from there you can just kind of inhale and take as many drags as you want like I size you through to four drags but the other thing that I wanted to show you guys is how to properly put a joint out so I recommend using a metal ashtray there's also ceramic ashtrays if you happen to be outside concrete is fine you definitely don't put it out on anything wooden because this is a flame but you're gonna basically take the end and so this is how I'm gonna preserve the joint so I can smoke it later if I choose to I'm just gonna gently kind of tap it out you basically want to suffocate the flame sometimes depending on how much you smoke you can kind of push that lit piece out and again I just kind of dampen it out you know just to make sure that flame isn't still lit but you can put it out and basically when I wanted to refocus I would just light from the end again but that'd be south and basically you're trying to suck the heat from the end all the way through using your lungs that's what's lighting it and pulling and burning that hemp butt of that hemp flower set you can have the effect of smoking CBD so hope you guys like that video if you have other questions for us you're too afraid to ask feel free to you know DM us on Instagram also come visit us in our store at restart CBD we're always happy to talk to you guys in person and yeah we actually sell these pre-rolled joints both in our store here at restart and online at restart CBD calm we carry about six to seven different strains both in loose bud and pre-rolls but yeah girls are a great way to have

County's first conditional use permit cannabis farm 25 years of cultivation experience they do sustainable organic growing so you know all of their cloud is top-notch I have two types of joints from challenge choice here first one is a hybrid it's a flower to eat combination it comes in this beautiful glass tooth and the childproof cap on it you can see here this one comes in at 14 percent THC very nice the second one I have is a sativa it's a flower keep combination 1.25 grams this one comes in at seventeen point six percent THC exciting is crack one of these things open see what it smells like to try to - remember this is a childproof cap so you have to push down on the cap and twist and for a little bit let's take a closer look at this wow you can really see the ketha flower in this joint this wood smells like oh yeah well you know what I'm gonna do next guys you remember kids if you'd like to get Chung's choice or other fine legal cannabis products you can get it through rehab

right y'all today i'm making a video on the alien labs graham demente i think that's how you say it and i'll be showing y'all how to get it 14 dollars out the door tony the tiger [Music] so just to start off i got this pre-roll from pcf um patient care first in series california so if you guys haven't seen my video make sure to go watch it it's me reviewing the cheapest dispensary in california and i believe this is the cheapest dispensary in california uh you could buy you know three of these payrolls 14 times three that's like what i don't know what's around there 30 40 50 bucks around there or you could buy an a for you know 72 bucks that's how much they sell it for my uh dispensary so uh i've been buying these lately and they're pretty [ __ ] good this is my third one i had ariel 41 cerbasio and now this creme de mente so um like i said this or i didn't say this cross is um cush mints and um cookies and cream so this puree is going to be testing at twenty three point five three percent thc and zero point zero five percent cpd this was packaged on six fifteen twenty today's seven twenty one twenty um it's a little bit old i guess you could say but not really i mean you're not gonna get some [ __ ] like three four days from the [ __ ] um packaging day or whatever so um let me open this for you guys it's going to have plastic but i took it off already let me show you guys the um the receipt real quick so you can see right there i got two alien laptops from my friend he paid around 30 bucks for him that's before tax and then you can see that single pre-roll was nine dollars and it came out to 14 dollars up the door and that's just some other stuff i bought but uh when you first get it there's gonna be plastic right here on the tip so you're just gonna wanna take that off i'm gonna pop it open so far this doesn't smell as potent as the other ones that i've had um especially that strabasio that was a very very uh smelly one they do it does smell different from them um and it does taste different from them but it doesn't taste um i'm not sorry it doesn't smell as potent and the taste from the dry hit um it's also not as potent but you could definitely taste um the different times i'm not gonna say any names with brands but sometimes brands like uh they just some of their heroes all taste the same they all smell the same i don't know what it is but so far from the three alien knight pupils i've had the all taste different then go outside so to spark it up i can show you guys some of the ash burning and i can give you guys my uh final thoughts on this and also let me know how much you guys get your alien lab one grand prix rolls for i played like i said fourteen dollars off the door nine dollars before tax yeah man comment down below make sure to keep being active and stuff to get me up there and get high with me make sure to get your make sure to get your joints ready make sure you get your you know if you have a rig make sure you get your rig ready make sure to take hits check out the video get high with me all right let's go outside i look sweaty because i just washed my car real quick decided to wash it before i before i smoked like you guys want to go see my whip then you guys know what this is almost with the camera look at this beauty huh e36 1996 my dad got that one and then she got this is mine you got one just like mine but black except this is a 530 mine's a 525 but look at my bumper though look at my bumper though sick huh yeah i got a new bumper let's get back to the [ __ ] hero show y'all that's right all right in lab crew if you all have watched my pre-roll videos before y'all know what this means and if you don't go back and watch my videos and you'll know what that noise means let me know if you guys want me to make a video where i break this joint down and see what's inside but for now taste how it smells first impression the ashes not bad compared to the other pre-rolls i've tasted though the others being area 41 and chewbacco i'll put this [ __ ] last the bartender wasn't wrong i guess he was telling me like uh he's saying it was it he was saying he was saying he said it was alright he said it wasn't his favorite because i uh i got area 41 and i got this one for my homie and then like last minute i just kept looking at the packaging and i was like oh hello curious so i got one for myself and that's when he had told me that but what i will say though about this one is it's a little little bit harsher [Music] we're not harsher but a little bit more hearts i'm gonna go ahead and finish this joint off [Music] okay so i made a video when i was outside i already finished smoking a joint obviously but uh i don't know i didn't like how the video came out to be honest i don't like how the video came out because my shirt was folded so i'ma just like some of what i said outside the flavor it was like not that good to be honest i thought it was gonna get better i was hoping it was gonna get better it didn't get better to me the flavor is like a six or six and a half excuse me i see what the guy was saying now he's like i don't really recommend it to be honest that was a [ __ ] man something new uh i don't recommend buying it if it's your first time getting in labs for sure um this is my third time buying asian labs [ __ ] you know try something new but uh i don't know i just really wouldn't recommend it at least like i said for the first time um for the high i think i gave it like a seven but honestly as i came inside [ __ ] and sat down the high kicked in for sure so i'm like kind of changing my mind about it i want to give it like a a i'm pretty lit i'm not gonna lie oh 72 dollars for an eighth i'm expecting to get pretty late overall though i'd give it like a solid seven just because the flavors i don't know to me it's not well i'm not gonna buy it again so that's why i'm giving it like a seven um it did get me high though so you're looking for that you know that's a plus um one i do recommend is to survive so i think you guys should try that first or the area 41. i know the area 41 is a mix of um sunset sherbert and geological 41. that shows gas but um that's gonna be it for the video guys let me know what other pre-rolls i should buy being about reviewing connected there's this two grand prix rule for and it's like 22 bucks in my dispensary so i think that's what i'm going to review that's the one i'm going to buy this friday let me know if you guys want to see a dispensary video i'm going to bang out hello videos now man shout out to

drool too and like i try to record a video and i'm over here like [ __ ] julie on my foot so i'm in los angeles like i mentioned and i actually met up with this company um i'm not sponsored by the way but i met up with this company and they actually hooked me up with some free products and i'm so thankful and i already picked up the package and the package looks so [ __ ] pretty so pretty um and i'm so excited to show you guys like i'm so excited to show you guys as i was saying i'm not sponsored so i'm going to be giving my honest opinion but i'm very thankful that they hooked me up with this with these products like that's so amazing but this wouldn't have been done by myself i wouldn't be able to do this on my own like you guys have also helped me get like these free products so y'all deserve to see me smoke these and it's like i'm smoking for you guys okay we smoking virtually hopefully one day we do get to like have like a big ass smoke sesh together and like a lit ass day like that would be so fun you know nice view type of [ __ ] but this is how the packaging looks hi 90s super nice super yellow definitely summer vibes has the palm trees right here they're wax infused cannabis pre-rolls each of them hold 1.2 grams and you all know like most of the time i be smoking like joins priors once in a while backwards but it's like everywhere not rare i would say but it's not i don't smoke it as often you know because pre-rolls um are definitely much healthier since they're nicotine free and let's just take a moment thumbnail these are so cute i can't i cannot oh my gosh so we have right here the um flavors that it has we have strawberry it's sweet and juicy strawberries straight from the fields we have watermelon the refreshing watermelon you crave after the beach peach so juicy and delightful you'll want seconds definitely tropical punch oh i love the the color for this one i love the color for all of them but this is like my favorite color a blend of sweet tropical flute flavors gelato oh my gosh you guys are you guys seeing what i'm seeing the packagings are so cute super [ __ ] cute sugar cookie ice cream better than grandma's pink lemonade like a cold glass of lemonade on a summer day definitely for the summer days pineapple sweet pineapple sprinkled with sugar and double cup a candy lemon lime soda your favorite rapper's drink okay hi nighties i see you guys you guys the packaging oh my gosh i can't even decide which one i want to try out first because they all look so cool and you can tell like the packaging is good quality i like glass containers like this because i can usually like stuff this pre-roll if i didn't finish it in the um back or like if i have another one and i'm like i'm gonna save it in here so it doesn't reek my room like these are just pretty cool containers and like i like that they're colorful that's super cool and it's vibrant and it makes me like happy and it's so summer vibes definitely summer vibes i really like it like i don't know i'm just so excited i can't even choose which one like i think i'm gonna have to like grab them all and do like any minimizing well because they're all too good so guys i actually didn't record a lot and i was actually talking a lot about the product itself and i'm already i already had sparked it up too and i was not recording uh youtuber fails look it it's definitely burning pretty nice we have that white ash i just [ __ ] up the burning that's why it's like but it's burning very like nice and even not even but smooth because i didn't burn it even but yeah as i was saying i was talking about the product i really love um i'm smoking tropical punch and this one has 29.7 thc i just chose this one because it matches my nails to be honest nothing specific in particular but it's hitting pretty good their weed is indoor weed they don't use no um no trim nor shake which is like number one like a big thing most of the pre-rolls range from 30 to 40 so far as i'm hitting it it's super smooth i can taste it that tropical in there these are so like on the gold and cute as [ __ ] like hey you're going to freaking grocery shopping or something you want to smoke right before let me take out aha 90s super cute super fashionable just spark it up ready to go so far i actually like the weed it's hitting pretty good and for it being small like it's hitting pretty good and as i was saying when i was unboxing packaging um they are wax infused heroes and h holds 1.2 grams so these little shits hold 1.2 not bad at all oh i did try fuzzies and it has 0.5 and i just feel like last time in like five minutes or so and this one already has lasted me like okay decent time and although it doesn't have the wax out on the outside it has it in the inside it tastes like pretty enjoyable versus the fuzzy i just felt like i don't know it just tasted like straight up wax like i don't know how to explain in like straight up wax and it also i don't know if it also could have been like the weed too that fuzzies carried because i know that the packaging date was pretty um it had been like since the end of march that they had packaged that [ __ ] so i was like [ __ ] but i already had paid for another great thing about these free rolls each of them comes from a natural blend of terpenes but i really like these spring rolls like i feel like with two i'd be like pretty cool two or three [ __ ] smoke on eight right now [ __ ] it it's all down maybe smoking like how many do you want me to smoke in the session because they do have seven now left i have seven all left so let me know what you guys want to see with the rest of these pre-rolls because yeah i don't want to be reviewing each flavor that's going to be too many or maybe i can i can do a series on this high 90s let me know down what you guys think i should do seven pre-rolls in a sitting um a series of like some flavors or like i don't know don't let me know some creative ideas i sometimes don't i'm not really creative i'm not creative to be honest but i do enjoy making videos for you guys and for the people that do enjoy thank you so much like i said i wouldn't be able to be doing this without you guys and we all go make it here i [ __ ] burned myself with a lighter but definitely i [ __ ] with it i also loved like it is a pre-roll i'm usually you guys always know i'm usually smoking joints free rows once in a while i'll be smoking some backwoods or whatever but it's an occasion it's not all the time because they are nicotine free so they are healthier which is it benefits you you know but i hope you guys enjoyed this video and say hi to the [ __ ] sky and until next time bye", "GRTbRN3X-Ag": "[Music] hey guys welcome to hotbox it's a little stray my boy will

so let's go alright nice size check it out mmm I'm seems like the size of my finger yeah this we could get idea let me see if I'm ready then to balance so [ __ ] I don't want a balance let's try that

makalah of CBD Goldline sativa pre-rolled it's nice real smooth not harsh it's real smooth is nice I just want to know what's in it we don't have no much more call it there's no QR code so I'm just so

what trying for y'all trying I think their site is down because it's taking that long to load and then when it does load it's an error this is math smooth it tastes good there's no harsh taste no I could see I like this idea I wish you know I have more fun it's still not even loaded and it's an error and ever trying to I'm trying to show y'all again focus be see what I recommend it yeah you know

ain't you get out of here this channel is for medical marijuana patients and i'm a medical marijuana card holder in the state of florida now that all that bullshit's out the way real quick just smoking on a pre-roll from saterra of b98 which is bubble kush 98 which supposedly came out right before the whole y2k thing just said that i think 197 but i will tell you it has a nice sweet smell to it i can smell it i got a five pack of pre-rolls i can smell it through the the packaging and if you can and i'm going to tell you like this if the pre-roll smells you know some good flour because most pre-rolls smell like grass and ass but this smell good nice sweet smell to it taste wise more earthy kind of kind of gassy a little bit kind of earthy almost like almost like dirt but i get a bad weight can be a little bit of a rough smoke as you guys can tell but overall it does the job and it's a good feeling it's an indica but it's nice man i paid what was it i think 30 something i think 30 for the pack of five so not too bad it is what it is i just thought i'd get out here real quick just let y'all know what i'm smoking on let me know below in the comments what you're smoking on where you got it from even if you're out of state i mean we're all just one big [ __ ] smoking community anyway so but stuff is nice man i like it um i will say i'm in the process of getting a job right now so there might be a little break in between the the strain reviews um as the budget's not there right now but i will say that in the meantime i might post some workout videos or i'm just vlogs or stuff like that in the meantime because just because this is a better water channel doesn't mean that's what we got to do all the time but b98 give it two thumbs up it's a mid to high kind of high but definitely definitely worth checking out if you're in the indica you know um so yeah like i said there might be a little break in the stream reviews um which is kind of good because i feel like i need a little bit of a tolerance break anyways because i'm flying through eighths like it's i'm clearing an eighth in about like two days so i definitely think it's time to chill out for a little bit you know i wouldn't mind if the [ __ ] wasn't so expensive but like you know anywhere between unless you're getting minis which are even hard to get down here because always sold out the minis are 27 and then it goes like 43 dollars and up and like that's just crazy you know i'm better off just probably buying an ounce of something and sitting on that but either way i love y'all we're at 24 subs that's crazy thing is how i literally just made the channel i don't even think a week ago so that's what's up i appreciate all of y'all um subscribing to the channel i will say if you do happen to

this off i love you all i'm just saying you're on your way stay safe stay motivated stay lifted highlight your boy", "J5MxqkQ0gNM": "I know YouTube has been getting like a little strict on this so before this video starts I need to say this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't wanna leave my personal information hey what's up guys Ronnie ray back at you so this video I have another own we train review or weed brand review I don't know whatever you want to call this I'm saying you guys might have seen it I did it um one review on this brand already touches on cannabis cigarettes I did on Northern Lights so I'm in that video I mentioned that I had a another pack of a purple dream and this one is like the unopen so I haven't even opened this packet so you guys will get to see me unbox it or whatever open it you and I mean so that cheese pre-rolls cannabis cigarettes so yeah so guys gonna see my Northern Lights review um they're pretty [ __ ] fired I'm not gonna lie you can definitely tell us like the pre Rossum a would like some real like real actual but not like no trimmer no [ __ ] actually me but something like it's actually made with like some fire but nothing claims it is so I'm not something like that's like one good thing about it I don't know let me just go over the packaging real quick for you guys and then I'll get this thing open we'll get one out and we'll get one lit so like I said Dutch cheese that's the name the brand purple dream that's the and I was hooking on purple dreams that's the fact that I have right now obviously it's indicate domina hybrid yeah not much today package I'm gonna bottom keep out of reach of children and it's a right they're able to say I'm made from 100% but source from premium genetic six potent 0.5 cannabis cigarettes so I also think that's kinda interesting how they call them cannabis cigarettes not pre-rolls if you guys into my last video like I mentioned like it's always been like my like since I started smoking weed at least there was a cause my personal like but dream or whatever you want to call it like walk into a gas station about like that a pack of cigarettes but like wheat cigarettes you know that means is like now they finally have like some counterfeit cigarettes out there I think that's fun to like though it's just like I don't know it's just kind of cool yeah I mean these are 44 bucks in each as you see right there that if I won't get one for you deal going on when I got these I paid like twenty-two roughly each yeah so um yeah on the back of the package I'm gonna take the sticker off purple dream is a very flavorful hybrid made by cross and granddaddy purple with blue trim so it's granddaddy purple like I mean those are arguably tool it like most like well-known strains are famous trains and I mean everybody knows granddaddy pervs everybody heard of blue a dream like I don't know that's just seem like two of the most like common experience if you like I mean there's some of those other ones out there of course like ak-47 Northern Lights is one of the most like famous ones are set in the package but like you know I mean there's just like there's like iconic ones out there so granddaddy purple and blue dream they're definitely two of it the most and obvious in my opinion like iconic strains so that's basically all it says on the back purple dream and then just is that little sentence that I read so yeah and then that's pretty much all to the package let's just get this thing open it's even like that has one of those like Oh cellophane like cigarette packages I mean I'd really is like a cigarette pack so um the thing that I like about these is the cigarette or the joints are not just like I mean I don't know if that you could really tell but they put them in like a little bag to keep them fresh so yeah they put them like so yeah they come in like a little bag inside the box to keep them fresh so that's [ __ ] pretty dope that they thought about doing that in and also each little on pad comes with like a little sticker so if like you want to try all the you can like try it out all the flavors and like make a little collection sticker one always some [ __ ] you know I mean so that's pretty cool too but I don't know nothing too too crazy so and here you see we got the purple bag because it's indica obviously like that previous bike like I said already but um so we got the six joints in there 0.5 each and let's just get this open so so let's pull one of them out here it is let me put this away and I really love how it comes with a bag of heat and fresh yeah I mean like these like it I don't know these are proof these are really fire but I couldn't see myself pain like $45 for a pack of these on the regular but like the buy one get one free deal with a definite goodbye or if like you just need something convenient I'm saying but $45 is a little bit pricey for 3 grams but it made me paint like the package and just like everything else you're not I mean so when you first pull them out they look a little bit small like compared to my thumb it's like this ice Mike um you know what I'm saying so it looked kind of small at first but um actually like really like they like packed perfectly and they burn like they don't run at all they burn perfect I mean please speaking the other pet that I smoked the Northern Lights one they burned perfect and for being like only 0.5 I've been being like kinda pretty small it's gonna burn for about 10 minutes so it packs a punch and a little joint you know I'm you know I mean so let's just get this [ __ ] lit from purple dream yeah purple dream duchies pre-rolls and guys are smoking I'm long I hope you guys are smoking something dank guys are cheers let's [ __ ] get lit right off the bat the flavor on that's [ __ ] amazing [Music] [Music] so if you guys haven't seen my past reviews um the way I like great these um went on do these like little train reviews and [ __ ] the way I am give them a reading I go over the packaging which ever be did I'll do a little taste test and I'll do like a smoke test yeah well smokes and all that you know what I mean I'll give it a high test price point and test not like put them all together do it like a little overall review I'm saying so packaging I think he's [ __ ] badass I like to pack in a lot I like that how they first of them as cannabis cigarettes but I feel like some people might not like that a lot but teach their own and I mean I just think it's really cool it's a really cool concept but yeah I don't know the packaging I'll give that like a four point five five maybe like a 4.7 out of five yeah no four point five is pretty close I just wish I had more information about the strain I get told you a little bit more about rig's access training to smoke maneuver besides for that [ __ ] you or like ever told you like the percentage the blood was tested at or you don't mean just give you a little bit more information that would make it like a five out of five in my opinion but still the packet is dope so they taste on this um that's like micro out at the bat like I said I tasted it um I had the classic just punishing like a spunky indica phase yeah so I just looked it up on V flee featuring a strong grapes no and musty tastes so like I said it has that like this thing like spunky musty like taste to it you know I mean classic into cook so uh I guess like that's kind of like a personal preference on the rating but like I prefer Indigo's of Steve is but for me I'll get that like a it's not I mean I feel like it's not the most tasteful so I feel like if I went out there and up out of $45 eighth and I rolled my own joint I feel like I can get some better bud in this but if you can troll these are [ __ ] fire like it I mean it tastes good you can tell us some fire but but I feel like there's definitely a better thought out there you know I'm saying it's not the top shelf top shelf but but it's definitely top shelf that makes sense you know what I mean but definitely fire so the taste 4 out of 5 I think that's pretty accurate the way it smokes so yeah you guys been seeing it at [ __ ] rips and um it's been smacking this whole video like I said this [ __ ] burns perfect all the way down it doesn't [ __ ] run doesn't yeah I mean nothing's wrong with it snacks I don't think I've seen complaint I don't even the guys look at simple going like one complain about the way they smoke like when I Ford like that first package I had I pulled him out and like I was looking at him was like [ __ ] this is like a small joint I don't know if one's gonna really get me to look like that but on they they they they do you justice I'm not gonna lie like they're being small it's like a little person we're joined by Fisher and it was somebody I don't know about that I mean depending on your tolerance no I mean but the way it smokes I'm looking at a five out of five it burns perfect like I said it's max yeah so the high and we get the high of four out of five I think that's pretty accurate it's hard but like I said it's not the most fire out there it's I think it's the most potent preview I've ever had I think that's pretty fun actually I could say that for a fact the most potent we're over ahead but I can get better put out there on my own but for a pre-roll fire is [ __ ] so yeah like I said if you can't roll like if you can't roll yourself these are like a good little option for you or if you need something convenient like it going on a trip or something and maybe I'll buy a pack or something like that you know I mean I just need something convenient or something but not like a everyday thing for sure um guess the price point that's the next thing I said 45 bucks is a little bit pricey for these I'll give that like this maybe like a 3.8 out of five maybe a four out of five back I said they're really dope and like you're kinda like paying them like that should couple bucks for like the packaging and everything what I mean but like I said I can definitely get some better but out there and roll my own joints for cheaper and we're like we're on the same price so um it's not the most boat like it's not the most potent budget get out there but like I said you find the paint if you like that the fact that you're already getting the pre-roll joint you don't have to do that should be so if you're paying for the package in your pain for like you know I mean all that extra [ __ ] you only mean so I guess to each throwing like you could give that your own person or reading whatever you really want at 40 foot because $45 for $45 for 3 grams that's not really like expensive but that's like on the pricey side you kind of mean 1/8 for 45 this is a little bit more reasonable but that's still a little bit pricey you got I mean but I don't know a the price point I'll give it like a nice tip you pointed out of five maybe the overall score I'm getting is like a four out of five this one helps I stopped hitting it yeah so I think that makes the overall score about like a four out of five like I said they're they're [ __ ] fire definitely fire is [ __ ] that feeling like super tasty definitely smoked perfect definitely like dated for like I mean depending on your tolerance for me it's like a good little positional joint like if I had to share it with somebody probably to smoke like to be I mean for like special occasions or when you need something like convenient and like sneaky discreet you kind of man like definitely a good choice well when they have like the buy one get one free deal that's a good time you pick them up of paying 45 bucks a pack I don't know if I could really like justify that on a daily basis so it's more of like a special special occasion type thing you own I mean so yeah guys like these review videos longer than like keep doing these and want to see more of them um just give me some ideas down below in the comments like if we only see weight behind this thing these little ideas down below in the comments like what you want to see me review like want to see some more weed reviews more concentrated reviews more cart reviews anything you guys want to see me review this is

look like a vintage pack of cigarettes look how nice that looks look how nice that looks so nice i love this logo i love the fine lines the fine detail of font is on point this is a pack of four hashish infused pre-rolls you can see at the top here it says unwind with nature and you're gonna really unwind because this is strong stuff now why is that well if we check on the side here a sativa dominant strain night owl and the thing you really want to pay attention to here is this is 20 hashish and 80 percent out of focus this is 20 concentrated cannabis is what i'm trying to tell you this stuff is hella strong that's why they call it hella dank in the first place anywho uh this stuff is great uh and this is what these these are little half gram joints now you might be ah half gram joint this [ __ ] is hella strong i'm telling you i smoked about a quarter of this and i had to take a break yes tiny shiny little crystals that you see on the surface of the plant and they contain so many cannabinoids and terpenes that strong pungent smell that you associate with marijuana that's coming from the trichomes they take that and they create a concentrate from it the the design is hella cool the product is hella [ __ ] strong and i hella recommended", "9PZxkPIstXU": "all right so let's talk about these little smokes so these low smoke CBDs are around $35 it comes with seven pre-rolls so that's around $5 per pre-roll I've been using them for a couple months now these are all the old containers I have what I like about these CD joints is a you had to keep that body hive that you get from smoking THC products but you also keep a mental clarity so you can really think and you're not as foggy I guess is the best way I could put it my favorite thing about this product is the packaging the packaging is just so premium it can be reusable that's why I kept all my cases because you can fit your pre rolls or joints in there that you made yourself and just use s container it has a magnetic flap so it won't open random little matchbox addition to it is a very handy just in case you forget a lighter but overall other than the price it's a very good product and I would definitely recommend anyone that would like to try any CBD drones and also get a cool package", "LwWAyCuEmDk": "welcome back this is Pacific Reserve another pre-roll the name is called Tropicana

it was from family wellness I got the New York diesel and then I have these indica blend pre-rolls indica blend pre rose oh oh the indica Bream blend pre-rolls are coming in at 14.4% CBD they are wind grandma peace first of all every package from fab relief if you saw me open the last thing comes with the notice to law enforcement which I am a huge fan of I want that if you don't have this in your back it automatically takes you down a notch to me and of course the COAS they come in every package know the indica blend I reached out I got a little information about them the indica plan is Afghan hash is F the Afghan strain bubba kush strain and purple rain I've done a review on all of these strains individually if you would like to know what I think about them if you don't want to go back and watch I'll just tell you I love the Afghan it is a heavy heavy indica it is very tasty it's strong and it makes you sleepy Bubba cush was my favourite strain of 2019 believe me and I'm a sativa guy but it's an indica but it's more like an indica hybrid I think because it didn't really have any stuff I could smoke bubble and still take care of things that I needed to do for that day and then the purple rain I love purple rain it is a beautiful in a very very tasty flower and on a day like today I need pre rose I'm gonna tell you why I just got work soon as I got off work I came to the house I took a shower fresh out the shower I was hoping that I didn't have to roll up I remembered that I had to do this review and I was like oh I got pretty rose print rolls three rolls my CVD heroes h\u00e9roes yeah I got three rolls pre-rolls my CBD heroes h\u00e9roes because sometimes you want your [ __ ] all ready to go I didn't feel like rolling up I didn't feel like loading up my I didn't want to do the bone I wanted three rows I wanted something that was gonna be ready for me to just smoke so just take out the package and smoke and that's my pretty rose on my CBD heroes so I got the indica Planet Bobby also told me that they come in different ways you can get them and you can get one three or five really as many as you want but that's how you can order them you can make an order of one or order a three or a five I got the three pack and that's told you without further ado oh my god use it again adieu is my favorite bird right now without further ado let's get these pretty rose open I'm interested I'm interested in seeing if I'm able to smell them I can and they smell good hmm I do I'm trying to see if if I certain strange to end it's out right now to me just to be honest I just smelled Bubba come to mama Bubba Bubba we got elf game we get Bubba we got ya / brawny you put it in Braille and smell Lully it smells good how seriousness it does smell good and this is

self love is the best love all right salute mow pants and let's give it in the complain pre-roll I've been waiting on this for a long time like at least nine hours [ __ ] that got a nice burn to it it really does that's a nice branch for mmm-hmm let me get some more fire I want to be burning evenly all the way around there we go there we go now we smoking like a brick [ __ ] mmm these three strands go great together when I'm tasting the most is the Afghan but at the same time I can still taste the I can taste I can taste the the the stinkiness of the bubble but I can really taste that sweetness of that Purple Reign Purple Reign has a nice little it has a sweet exhale well sweet inhale actually I don't know who thought to put these free strains together but they did a goddamn good job Virginia's excuse my friends scuse me for cursing but she this is good see this is what I'm saying about the pre-rolls is that you're already ready to go you're already ready to go I knew I was gonna like this because I like all three of these strains individually I like them individually so this is how I look let me get country with you I like peas right I like corn right and I write mashed potatoes right but when I got them all on the plate at the same time I keep my peas and corn and I kept my potatoes together on one spoonful and eat it oh my god that is delicious like in those bowls from KFC when you got the peas the corn the corn and the mashed potatoes right there's just missing the peas amazing and that's what I'm getting from this you get all three strains at the same time that you already like individually hmm it's blooming good I'm a freaking just a little bit we call this freaking it when you're doing like that know what that does it just loses it up just a little bit cuz I'm I want like a little fat I want a faster burn so I can pull a little more oh yeah we hitting now now we know we got something now we got now we have something that we probably proper now we papa papa I don't know what it is but next thing I could taste that bubble gum oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah I'm getting that strong I'm getting that relaxed feel and that's full strong I'm getting that relaxed feel and just the calmness to calm effects and I can tell what I like about what I like about indicas is that and you'll know it's an indica because I want to sit my ass down I'm already thinking about what am I gonna watch on TV like what show them I'm finna sit my butt down and just watch and just shield out and just watch I don't wanna do nothing I don't want to think about anything I just want to chill out all right so look the indica Primrose the indica plant pre-rolls they are an absolute must-have I'm gonna give them I got a great at harsh because I like it too much so I'm gonna give the indica blend pre rose I'm gonna give them about Derrick solid eight and a half easy eight and a half nine only because I like my pre-roll just a little bit looser it was it's packed tight and full which I really love but I did have to freak it a little bit so that made me take a little half a point because there would be a nine there would be a nine but I got to break it down to eight and a half just because I had to freak it a little bit but as far as the taste the taste alone is a nine the way it tastes is a nine it tasted great this is a great blend and now it is pulling and see when it cools like that when that flows like that you really get to tasted that the tasters are nine easy that Afghan and that bubble in that Purple Rain go great together it is a great blend definitely it must have hmm sharing is caring now sharing is caring Ichigo are you know you don't want to do nothing I don't peer pressure hey I appreciate y'all for tuning in we'll be live on Friday night join me the indica bleating pre-rolls from privative wellness there definitely a great pickup there a great pickup if you love pre rows 1 2 3 4 5 liter that's what you can't find

lay I'll oh yeah each and every one I", "WbqQVtJB95U": "hey it's ginger green gold and I'm here with Carmela was lucky for 20s tree was kind of feather and we are going to talk a little bit about your guys's product you guys both have pre-rolls and you guys know we love to Quality Control here so I know you're kind of technically competing brands but we're building right you're like we're building with each other all in this together do you want to start off with what we're serving with you sure so what we have here today is lucky for 20s newest 2-pack we have a regional 7 pack of pre-rolls which had carried 5 grams 7 3 rolls this is our latest two pack Capri rolls so we have a sativa here which comes with not one but two three rolls equaling 1.5 grams so you can share with a friend or you can share for yourself or later I'm a little bit about our company we are founded in Sebastopol women founded women led company employee-owned we are changing the way business is done we are supporting all of our local farmers in the area shout out to all the local farmers major farms so we believe that part of how we're gonna grow and shape this industry and mold it and live up the playing field with everybody and also linked arms folks bikes coke and link arms and solidarity because this is what we're here to do is give the healing of the nation to everybody in the nation and I love that green gold can actually facilitate that truly I mean we look it's a great we're in good hands with sprinkles you know that and you know what the pre-rolls here the one thing that I really like about them is not hating on the cone-shape totally dig on the cone shape however these are something if you're medicating out it's not really you know out and about but you don't really want your neighbors to know exactly where that one's coming from it looks like a ciggy unless you're actually paying attention the width is correct and short all that fun stuff yep and it's a filterless tip so you're gonna get full pool we have a Bitcoin to name where I'm from Oakland so we have the youth there called in black tips which is great they have a little personalized name oh the black tip selective papers well full flower and ready to light it up tell ya so let's get the lighter for by a free roll that identified by the black so right here we have our skunk punch it's definitely one of my favorite strains still like both it's one of our prior service trains our brand is potency / perfected so we're a full spectrum cannabis life we have premium indoor flower pre-rolls concentrates cards you name it mmm all right so the Battle of the three rolls or just quality is elevating in elevating and elevating so I think the funnest part about this quality control it was going to be that we're smoking Sour Diesel sativa from lucky 420 somebody's all gasp go punch in because her note from gum feather okay conglomerating thing here oh I don't mind the comb yeah right there in control a little chillin style probably I don't know out there I think I call this infection control you can close up here right very good it's also interesting to we find having the right grind yeah definitely cuz ours we have machine that fills them too so finding the right and every flower strand is different the texture of it the structure of it's different he can we don't like to pulverize it and you know grind it so much that it burns too quickly or that it dries out and it's not as fresh so even just keeping that sort of like type of grind I mean the grind is get your grind off you know if you're good don't get your grind on too much so we're gonna go ahead and just relight our four points and lights asset even lucky for twenty seven easel everybody's favorite at least most people's favorite yeah at one point in their life yeah not everybody's favorite we actually have some people who are very strict anti Sour Diesel people they however do enjoy more of the fruity citrusy strains that's the exhaust dis turns that people to tend to lead towards when it's like the ken-dog or like Sour Diesel they're like yeah yeah they get more on the preview side which to each their own I actually really enjoy a good Sour Diesel sure it's good it's done right right I kind of wanna feel like I'm smoking my Sour Diesel in the garage almost if it has that's written nice gas easily and it's supposed to have and the remind me again fruity punch was this again this is our stuff punch mm-hmm this is actually one of the first strains that I ever smoked Frank Scott brother I'm so definitely like has like a little nostalgia you know but yeah we were actually just featured in High Times are straight off to cush I believe yes Oh too kind of optical hmm what is that one well that's a hybrid to be honest but don't quote me on that yeah I'm a highly sane hybrid and we know most plants are hybrids and some dominant than others that's a Snickers hard to say right everybody's chemistry is different which reacts differently I'm definitely feeling the effects of both of these strains the purple such is an extremely relaxing strain and right no this is actually really fun both you guys have really quality pre-rolls I love the fact that you just keep doing the infection control no offense taken by the way it should not be it's actually the opposite right right offending you what I care about you exactly myself and everybody else you do yes exactly you also note too is like Chilam style no no backwards did I and then close it create a seal got it yeah hey happen and you get the lipstick but hey but everybody help you stay alive keep smoking some devil must join us that is a [ __ ] - oh yeah lucky for 20 lucky for me that I got to sit in with skunk feather and

cbd uh pre-roll i think the strain is called itself uh balanced thc cbd it's a one gram joint once again by twidd uh it's a i got it from a canadian government dispensary um see the package date and all that there sorry my camera's a little off to the side and eight percent cbd i have i don't usually buy much cbd weeds um and when i did they're never really labeled so i don't know how this one's gonna be for save but uh let's go ahead and open it together and we'll uh see what it looks like it looks like they used a raw paper it's a fat joint it's not very big i've seen point fives uh bigger than this but uh let's do the finger test together i've been doing that uh to show so i'm gonna tip my finger and let's look about there and it's just about to my knuckle so some of the 0.5 i was getting were a little bit bigger but this joint is definitely a lot fatter i don't know if it's a gram i think it might be like a 0.8 but uh i'll let you know how it is when i smoke it i'll throw it in the video like i normally do and i'll see if it has a smell now i didn't really smell anything when i opened it but to me i i can smell um to me it smells like a little a little bit like uh a greenhouse like you know like the smell of like glass almost the plants growing that's what it kind of reminds me of but i'll let you know how it is when i uh smoke it thanks for watching this is the tweed uh balance thc cbd joint i find with some of these pre-rolls they're very hard to smoke they're not rolled very well it was like it was packed too much maybe this is a ground joint it was just packed way too much because it's not really burning very well [Music] it's like a sour um a sour piney taste almost i really tasted greenhouse i think this is greenhouse grown i really taste it i'm gonna smoke through it a bit and i'm gonna go through um what i think of it i just wanted to show you me lighting it up it's not burning very well at all oh they use the machine or something all right i'll let you know how it is all right i'm almost done smoking a joint we're over halfway a fantastic performance you went out there so it's a cbd joint it's it i was talking my friend about it a little bit and it's meant to relax your muscles now i got a lot of back pains neck pains [ __ ] you name it i got it pains everywhere did you expect to be coming and i feel uh i don't feel stoned right now like i really don't i could go to work right now and use power tools i feel fine but i don't feel any pain um usually my neck hurts like it kind of went away i don't even think you made it past the first the flyweight minute is is is stacking up right now is there anybody out there is there something you want so far like a painkiller it's very good but i'm not getting stoned and i can take big bowls it doesn't have much of a taste very dry taste on flavor on flavor i'm gonna give it like a tube it's got flavor but it's one of the worst flavors i've tasted in weed before from a dispensary i don't like the taste at all i don't know if it's not mixing well with the coffee i'm drinking or something like that but um i drank lemonade this morning i had a clean mouth before i started smoking i drank coffee the last half an hour an hour maybe that threw the taste off but uh to me this is getting the lowest rating for flavor i've never tasted a joint i tasted so um it's almost bitter and dry [Music] what do you think of it is my whole thought is when you when you taste the greenhouse flavor maybe they clean the glass and maybe that smell of the glass being clean because every everything has a smell even glass kind of especially when you clean it if you get what i mean like a whole bunch of it in one space with a greenhouse you know it's lots of glass you're gonna get a glass uh smell and i think that added to the flavor and maybe they dried it in a greenhouse too because it's it really has a greenhouse flavor but [Music] i feel relaxed so i don't feel any pain [Music] yeah i think it's i think it's machine role too well i i've smoked this joint two years ago and it had the same thing yeah i had the same issue i saw this showing two years ago the same thing it was just roll too tight for more than a decade he's taking his lumps the buzz i'm going to give it like a 3.5 it's a very like clean buzz i won't lie like i'm not stoned or anything but i'm definitely buzzed i'm going to relax i don't my eyes lowered a little bit not too much but um i don't think i'm going to want to smoke a joint for a little bit and he's determined to move i'm going to give this weed for the price for a painkiller joint i'm going to give it 3.6 i wanted to go in the tubes because of the taste and the buzz but my friend won a 3.30 my friend want a point higher than me um the reason why i dropped it 1.8 is it's like two three dollars uh more than other joints that they sell at that store which to me might be a little bit better maybe not cbd wise but thc wise and uh i got it on sale so maybe it was dry and that i just want to throw that in i saved like 50 cents i got it on sale um i'm going to stick with my 3.2 my friend gave it a 3.3 price a little over the flavors definitely not there it's a very bitter flavor you might like it i don't like it and the buzz i'm a little bit hyper right now i feel more hyper than i was when i started the video but i don't have any pain hey everyone okay i'm gonna finish the review off uh now i waited a little bit uh because it's a cbd i wanted to give you a real review on it um i got a little buzz i feel relaxed um it's a cbd once again uh straight so i put in consideration i'm gonna raise my final um rating to a 3.3 um for the cell pack cbd takes a long time to grow me and my friend were talking about it for a bit and he raised his rating to a 3.4 and i ended up raising mine by a point as well to a 3.3 it says the price was a little bit high i found it's not bad if you're smoking for uh body pains it's pretty good i do still feel a little bit of back pains but for the most part i feel relaxed and my final rating is a 3.3 thanks for watching have a great day bye", "MhgixaJCLY8": "they rolled up to Lamar is served by a pothead smoking on one of my evening bless that's the flavor you let me put it all spin move let me we'll be looking at a vibes free roll call without further ado jumps a close-up get into the review I burped up some old bird Moody's flap in the comment section have you take a look at the date pre-roll cone today we're looking at vibes and this is a rice cone oh the rice paper kind of burns up completely the word doesn't really leave a s I'm hoping that it also doesn't have that process of rolling paper taste we're going to do and get these out the pack so you can see what they look like alright burn club these are the vibes rice papers pretty decent papers I'm gonna go ahead and run all our chests on that one census looks kind of funky so we're going to use our lean green machine to hold this in place gonna stuff it up with some of this week and see how the smoke so let's get this thing filled up and see what it do [Music] [Music] hi Bertha got this vibe rice cone rolled up and it's real easy to feel we use the lean green machine that's like one of my favorite cone filling devices you're gonna do your own sapphire on in front of this and see where smoke-like begin I'm hoping that their taste of process paper isn't that strong in this but we'll get some firewood see what it do all right bear claw I think it's a fire oh just buy rice drink just raining so my dear to hear that but I do like to smoke on a rainy day so go ahead get some fire on this why be drink see what the first size to each matter was like [Music] all right well there is the descent of process paper um it's not that strong but it is definitely here we're going to take the first poll to see what the smoke actually tastes like I'm thinking that it might not taste that strong because it's not that strong in this ice cream but again I never want to get ahead of myself let's see what this thing you're doing yo now roads up there is a a fine line of paper taste going off the side street but it doesn't show up that strong in the taste other side of smoke like light I mostly just tasting the bud and it's a very Turkey but and that's really all just coming through right now there's very very light very light one of want to taste of it now I've had other rice papers and they perform basically the same way there's a very light underlying taste of rolling paper or both seniors who taste when you smoke powdery rice papers is weak now that side strength as it comes off of the earth is gone into my nose that smells just like processed paper does yeah there's no way of guess around that scent coming off the side string because all of them have that same thing but again the taste of this paper so far is one of the least strongest process paper tape again it doesn't mean that it's not there because I do still taste it it's just a very minimal we look at the ash on this what you see on there is really just the weed this burning of the paper that burns completely to where we look at it you can't you can't see the ash of it at all first bleep well hurry up there winds out there howling right now through trees a very good smoke coming dry like I'm I feel like my esophagus is very dry whoo Smokies that is my bra cubes I brought you a drop it is smoking with them mama daily say this when you see these do me try they know to think if you try them how did you like me again it taste for me it's minimal compared to a lot of the other rolling papers I've done in a long time but what do you think I will smoke the rest of this in five no is -

"kuYZZjtxyME": "[Music] hi guys I'm B and this I reckon crow Rebecca get going okay hey beautiful us it's Rebecca crow here and I'm Pete dog yeah okay so yesterday we went to a very magical place ah beautiful I wish I could live with an enemy really nice office office long journeys Lowell offices oh yeah it was so so so there's a magical place this is a week company in California where we just currently recreationally legal and it was medicinal a legal until very late so anyone could come here and buy and smoke marijuana but we haven't opened any of these bags yet we thought we'd save them to open with you guys they put so much thought into everything that they like make and manufacture everything is natural they don't use any parabens you know anything like that anything nasty all of their pre roll blunts in fact they're kept in glass little cases and they don't cut the plastic it's so good and great the planets here so we're stoked about that smells great my favorite thing about lower yes is that they make pre-rolls like really surgery yeah cuz I know a lot of people have problems with rolling yes these are the first three things I'm gonna grab out of here these are my two favorite one is a sativa we don't know what it's a TV weed is I'm sure we can give you some more info in another time and then there's our hybrids which is a mix of the two types of weed sativa and indica well this is so easy to over there yeah okay and then it's got a little much and nebulae can we see all the love oh yeah the branding is not responding to save God I kind of want to strike for these wretches I think you should see if they're any goods yeah cuz they've got it at the end right being with pyromaniac yeah you got a little much striking thing to the end okay okay okay all right mean I could work guys [Music] that's a nice match I love they have on the inside but this looks up here they've got their story which is wonderful they have the story on the back - yeah I love that it's got a bit of history - I would see America not the oldest country in the world everyone goes very techy whereas Lowell's gone very nice and natural what I love the most about Lowell is that pretty much all of it is designed so so beautifully they were kind of well I don't really know cuz I wasn't around but they're the first like free role in a pack like cigarette yeah joints that I've seen especially with the matches on the end so yeah these three roles are [ __ ] genius and that's only the first thing to get out the back all right let's move onto the other side lucky dip here we go we've got a cute little t-shirt that's cool cute like everything again is natural again I love it I'm restoring no plastic wrapping here [ __ ] hello this soft I like this oh it's so soft oh it's a little crop Oh corrupt oh that is cute as hell right now yeah might want to bad little thing on she's gonna put it on I'm glad it put it how the obvious entering a thing with furniture I know how bizarre Redux putting clothes on for the first time ever on camera oh is that world first this is really cute cute shirt logo it's really nice and soft it smells like wheeze honey was right wrong I love there is good I love this is cute now take it off okay oh this is heavy Oh what is this oh my god you could kill someone with this buy it no oh nice color huh I really don't throw every dog ready a little about that heavy oh I love that back it's all soft and smooth anyway although what that's an ashtray right this this is a paperweight ooh that's the blue-chip it's got a little ridges on their feet to place your please just leave for your blunt or whatever though I'm smoking from that's one of your nice career old cones and it's keep in keeping with the logo it's got the look on the inside I love the way it's etched in kind of like you know a Victorian diagram it really goes back to that kind of 1908 year you know what I mean it's very very heavy very nice very keeping with a brown they have a very strong brownie yes I really we're gonna struggle to get this home yes oh no suitcase way last but not less not least I'm gonna guess it is this is top shelf full hour oh my god I've seen one of these before and I'm really excited to show you guys this this box opens up and so so that you make grind up your wheat from the glass jar that it comes in and keep it in this beautiful little tray that that is just so you'll never lose your [ __ ] weed it will never blow across the table it will never blow out of a window of you a solo is such a massive company so make sure that they credit all of their phones because really like give it a smell be oh dear Lord and it like that is beautiful that's not like it's making me giggle it does smell like it's gonna give you the Google and end in the car as we may or may not know is over nice relaxing body hi so certainly will be smooth this for bed when we not yeah boss across the name of the MLA coach that we've been smile yeah la Kirsch knocking me right out it's a great early on calories yes I'm not dreaming at all which is great for me yeah you just been so great if you ever have any problem to speak or anything I really suffer from it [ __ ] godsend absolutely low thank you so much all your [ __ ] thank you doctor it was so nice it's certainly what they're certain as we Bob this is only got them know I was just gonna say super kind of people and they gave me something that is really really beautiful I think it's so girly with me designs yeah it's a piece of wonder and I can only just imagine playing with it while I'm high it is this beautiful wooden box but you maybe see on the corners it doesn't just stay as a box it opens up into a nice flat rolling surface it's me and sleek hadn't seen it so I can up a second ice tray on your coffee table it's [ __ ] gorgeous comes with two wheels decides who's so good trusty sativas and this one is supreme white the name of that one not sure but I do it now the white is like a long history and we don't think so and it's yes it looked the but is zero women are I do like that that's so strong out here everything in the air smells like [ __ ] this one I love this a slightly spicy it's a little Clementine yes my guess is from lady sativa farm 707 above that so again Predaking all our dessert always that smells so fruity mmm that's Dean yeah it's not like a candy shop it smells like you know you're in an old fashioned sweet shop and you open up a jar you smells like a sherbet or something yeah that's why it smells like okay I'm probably smelling right it's like it's a set this Clementine citrus it's amazing please alright okay and what else we got here we got grinder this is a nice metal grinder as well you know your shitty plastic ones that you get then they don't call it a grinder and there's also something on the bottom which may or may not know it's called a Keef catcher Keith spelt ke e F and this is the actual this is what that contains the THC and CBD and cannabinoids in the week so when you grind your keith falls through here and occasionally you can put it like back into whatever you're rolling and you'll get super strong wrong doesn't wicked so it's like a super super super finance if kind of thing and they're all captures in the bottom here it's got a little scrape fun scooper for your keys which it isn't my kids a little keep keeper little keep keep forgive keeper I love that this isn't actually the grant I believe comes with this kit a little bit small in there but we did request this yeah we did my questions you will get a little grinder if you get this kit yes aliens oceans and then you get obviously some brooches for when you're rolling obviously very important you don't want to be putting a filter in there and wasting all your weed very much story then you got these papers which again all-natural no bleach nothing nasty and they're nothing or and of course again you've got the story on those lateral rounding super cute pants right there so you ain't never gonna lose them I always lose my papers do yes I [ __ ] always like guys any papers now I'm gonna swivel this in a piece of a4 paper right and accidentally always somehow find him in the wash so viola Manville MRI and they all six to go mine let's get down yeah they get down for some unique everyone wrong my dream of papers donor problems I love the whole mechanism says I know the man who designed it yeah months and months and months figuring I have a bit looks beautiful it'll done it together and if you all this is one less little important thing I want to point out oh yeah roll you can probably find YouTube videos on how to use one of these which is it will roll it for you basically you put your weed in you put your Roach in you put your paper in and it will roll it for you so yeah no more dodgy [ __ ] rolls exactly this modeling kit originally a rolling kit kit like everything you need in here exactly and it's gorgeous but you know what being I get something in here because I wanted to show these off because they've got these are the office yesterday oh and I find these are [ __ ] genius so obviously if you're on your own and smoke weed and you roll like a whole joint or whatever I'm really very very very rarely start the whole thing right okay nobody cares about to to just thank you yeah I will always end up talking out a little bit just before the end or halfway through our head I'll roll this one yeah it's not coffee in the morning exactly but close the way this beautiful box yeah we have something that I think they recently brought out I think it's kneeling right thank you thank you these are cools low smokes quick and when I open this pack it up my mind was [ __ ] blown obviously it looks exactly like the other package that we had earlier mm-hmm so it's like a little cigarette packet it's super easy to take around it also has the matches inside so you know even if you're stuck without a lighter will never be actually [ __ ] stuck like you just never move myself club unless you run our matches like me they have a best rating just about on yes when I opened up this packet they [ __ ] blew my mind cuz usually they are lying this way the joints are lying this way inside the packet I opened up this one and I saw to my bewilderment tiny they are dried this brand is doing so much that I've never seen company ever do and there are a lot of companies now doing similar things to Lowell but these guys were the originals original when they say original they really honestly truly mean it yes [ __ ] good this is there's no one doing what these guys there really is I like these smoking packs who else is doing this it was doing like two cigarettes varying especially these didn't quick quick hashtag clicks ups every one of these on your break or whatever have a quick thought I have a sweet think maybe I'm trying to brainstorm something and you're crazy it's like we all have you're just like me yeah that's think of a great idea and by the end of it you [ __ ] genius you know what be what Cheers I think we should spit one of these right now yes I think we should so we didn't smoke one of these yesterday and we don't you did you can't pretty darn high yeah I had a stove oh not really counting it is way way stronger than English food don't make that mistake I don't know where I'm struggling so much I don't know we'll let you for you yeah well I will I'll try and do it all for one match if not I'll use you like a light you baby I got you girl [Music] Thanks okay no girl I'll tell you what I am I say five oh that was a good one out tonight I'd love that we have the full rolls and the quick I look like I don't know so many different ways because already hi ruff flower lady isn't on you can wear this cute shirt too so yeah what it's another loves I think you think that I can spin their ass thank you so much guys for people take care what oh yeah [Music]", "EXSENXs5VTQ": "hey what's good everybody jb here checking in respect my region.com here today to do a quick taste test pre-roll review featuring la cannabis company's in-house pre-rolls the fire o.g kush i went and picked this up at the la brea um la cannabisco i believe they've got three locations um really nice bud tender in there he knew his [ __ ] he took his time he was patient we asked a bunch of questions it was great uh he recommended the indica fire og kush from la cannabisco 22.69 total cannabinoids 20.4 total thc 0.04 cbd uh we asked for this because on the taste test reviews you know a lot of people go around looking for affordable pre-rolls they want it to taste good get them high because they can't really afford the alien labs that connected the cookies every time all the time and so i'm really big on buying affordable pre-rolls and identifying where are the diamonds in the rough and so let's try it out shall we oh it's got a nice sweet og smell inside we've got some darker colored flower in here for sure there's definitely purple hues with the dark green it is packed a little tight i'm going to massage it out just a little bit and then i always like to pull this part out right here because when you when you light it ah when you light it it gives the paper gives off this harsh this harsh flavor so here we go the dry hit is sweet it's earthy it's piney it tastes like kush so far so good on the dry taste test here we go all right so it's burning nice and smooth it's nice and even all the way around the first hits were not harsh that's super important if you get a bad tasting pre-roll and it's harsh on your first couple hits you're not really going to be that excited to smoke it the rest of the way or want to buy it again so it's sweet it's definitely og kush it's not super heavy or potent i am getting a rush of like a body high through the back of my head and through my through my joints that's pretty typical with me and og kush i don't feel much pressure behind my eyes um i'm not really getting much cotton mouth i just don't think that this is the best version of fire og kush that's out there but when it comes to a 12 dollar pre-roll it's not bad tastes like weed it tastes like kush i'm obviously a cannasaur so for me like i smoke really really good expensive [ __ ] all the time and so when i have to kind of drop my standards down and review uh not to say it's a mid-grade product but a more affordable middle of the pack product i always like to look for the positives versus the negatives the positives is that for a 12 pre-roll it tastes like og kush it dry hit like og kush it is getting me high throughout my body and i probably would have to smoke a few of these to actually get sufficiently stoned but at the end of the day i think it would take the edge off and put me in a relaxing mindset and so because of that i give this taste test an 8 out of 10 8.25 out of 10 and then i give the overall score and 85 out of 100 because when you think about quality matching the price point the experience at the store the way it's branded it is just a dupe too but house pre-rolls that's pretty standard uh all the things on this product makes sense so big shout out to l.a cannabis co this is j ping joey bravo here man respect my region buddies brand review coming at you guys live with the official taste test pre-roll i recommend it anybody that comes into la looking for a really uh affordable pre-roll quality it's going to taste good going to get you high definitely recommend visiting la cannabisco and trying out their fire og kush let me know what you guys think in the comments show us some love talk some [ __ ] be sure to follow and like and subscribe to respect my region on all social medias and of course

__ ] pretty still a long way to go it's at the beginning oh [ __ ] well it took us like two three months to get a hold of these since they came out we're looking for them yeah so we bought four yeah we ended up buying four 200 each we drove an hour and a half hour and a half for my lady after three [ __ ] months this is not the cookies collab though i wanna try the cookie i heard the cookies wanted gas this flavor was agent orange yeah i'm guessing they've came out with like different flavors my foot is like so drive from hiking today oh it's [ __ ] [ __ ] and that [ __ ] has not gone anywhere it has not moved the pack the last video we did the parkours they got us pretty high we'll see how high this gets us see how hot bikes this car gets there's not a big car win a bmw it's not a

almost 20 minutes how far are we into it almost done to it i'm done with it oh [ __ ] this morning okay let's talk right oh yeah sure just for that we got done i give it a 10 out of 10. yeah it's way better with two so if you're gonna smoke this dude with only two people by yourself with two people yeah because we did with four the first time and it didn't hit as hard maybe it wasn't as good as the first one maybe the first one was cured better because we waited longer you know set in the jar longer can you see how funny it is says foggy's foot all right we close the doors it's still [ __ ] here but damn look look at all that smoking we already aired it out y'all like subscribe tell me if i like the video and what to do next you guys know what to do next yep bye", "pnZH-k4XYgs": "[Music]

I got this sent to me so I don't know how much it is but you have to be 18 and older to smoke no THC is just pure CBDs man so you guys might wonder what CPD's are man CBDs is like is a comes from marijuana but removing all the th seized you know though the stuff that makes you feel hi this is the body buzz to make you fully functional like it's good for anxiety depression nausea arthritis else timers and you know a bunch of other stuff that I don't know but that's what I was told and that's what I read so let's look at this so you want to squeeze the ends and pop up thud OH squeeze pop man Oh smells pretty nice I'll show you guys yes II see oh oh the goods that came out of it what oh they're broke well I mean the filter fell all the way in at the filter hmm how do I resolve this it is I go lie to you I pulled it out and it was all falling out I had to take this tip off put everything back in and put the tip back on you can see out a little bit where the tip is closed just shoving stuff back in hopefully it still smokes well I'm gonna shove it deeper try it out smells like burning marshmallows mmm burning burning pretty fast smokey they don't smell like marijuana or taste like it just fall into my mouth you know pretty much rain fell out with that ash you think well that's it not one that's it so uh final results I do recommend this for people that's overwhelmed with whatever is going on with their lives I need to relax this could be your solution I feel actually relaxed no chips on my shoulder I don't feel high I feel like I can operate and do whatever I need to

"JRH_-LMXVXQ": "I know that they wanna do what I said I've been doing but they cannot do it I went to my city my gang rolling with me no time to stop we keeping what's good everybody it is your man the ganja guide guns of a peel once again with a brand new video and if you couldn't really tell I tried to fix it up a little bit we're outside we are outside we are outside outside you know what that means when we outside I gotta say I just picked up this rolling tree from my local smoke shop 10 bucks best time but Savas man haven't even used it yet but I could just feel the quality in it metal today we're gonna be looking at a pre-roll that I have not managed to get my hands on I don't believe and this one here is member berri sporting a hybrid lineage and TAC of 20 to 22 percent and CBD of 0.0 now I know Joe jacking on that you gotta hit these at the right spot and it's a new one so it's fresh ooh I remember take a look at that pre-roll god it just looks so amazing every time smells a little it kind of smells like cheese a little bit not cheese at your deep foot the blue cheese strain oh man I can't wait to buy tomatoes Cheers hope you're smoking with me damn I forgot if he said it was a sativa dominant or indica dominant hybrid guess I'll find out huh but I'll flip it tastes like some form of theory that I really have not ever tasted before not fruity per se or citrusy but it does taste like a a tab area or case of the berry [ __ ] it's hitting at about a six six ish maybe a seven ish but it is strong it has an aftertaste of char hard knocked off my ass a little prematurely I saying manage to get a clean cut on the inside [Music] sorry like this that's something very good we white it keeps its form in there they packed it real good literally the Asheville Gulf and like chipped it nothing came out just a basin so so far I'm starting to filled in the cutbacks a little bit haven't even gotten halfway down that's good honestly I feel like two things one with you being so low obviously it's going slower but I feel like truly freerolls just naturally burn slow and I wish I could get my hands on some of these filters I mean it could just be any filter I can use but I don't know just kind of like these chewy filters so if I had to rate this one I give it a 7 it's not bad it's not terrible it's still a very good smoke but I feel like there are most definitely others out there other pre-rolls into leave that outshine this one I most definitely am confident in saying that there are others that over shine this but this is not a bad smoke if you want to pick this up and try it out or if you just want something light for the day go member berri still not even halfway down it's just pulling so slow I love it I hate that the air is smoking it more than me yeah I really wouldn't want to finish all of this because I don't feel like it'll get any much much stronger than this like I can finish it and it just might maybe double my high at the most but I'm pretty satisfied where I'm at right now you could even hear it cracking something but even then with me having high tones that I have is like now starting to fill the indicus sleepiness sleepy feeling real tranquil feeling coming in now but anyway that about does it for me folks and this member berri with you pre-roll as I've told you what's in it up from Street to dispensary only want to keep you all safe and also myself so yeah stay tuned for the next video everyone thanks for watching don't forget to share this video with at least one person but that wraps it

two jp checking in respect my region.com here in chicago illinois we just had to fix and doctor the cookies pre-roll go watch the other video this entire finger length roughly half the pre-roll was dumped into the bottom of this i could literally pour out the dust and so what we did here to give the collins aven cookies flower an actual authentic review just at least on the quality of the flower i went ahead massage it out and forced all the weed that was in the top half of the joint on this side i shook it down and twisted you can see how much paper right how much space there really was so man already failed cookies on the quality of this cannot believe i just experienced that five years in the cannabis industry i've never seen a joint do that before absolutely unacceptable here we go the way we do the taste test pre-roll reviews if you guys don't know yet is one hit talk about it two hits score out of ten three hits overall score now again i already failed this product because half of the flower had fallen through the mouthpiece into the bottom of the pre-roll just destroyed and when you pay 18 and then a 30 tax on top of that that comes up to a 25 pre-roll roughly unacceptable here we go still getting scooby snacks because they put literally just dust they just put dust in the whole pre-roll really just disappointed man it's super frustrating all right there's the first hit taste wise tastes like earthy piney gas it doesn't necessarily taste like gelato kind of gas or like a og kush kind of guys but for the collins ab strain it does have a little bit of sweet gassiness to it the ash is kind of light colored so shout out to them for that scorebox out of 10 i'm gonna give this a i'm gonna give this an eight flat it's sweet it's piney but it's not super super super delicious it's not like oh my gosh i really want to smoke this again uh kind of weed quality but at this point they've already burned the bridge because again i paid 23 four dollars for a joint that's just not worth it at the end of the day so overall 82.5 is the final score in terms of this smoking experience if it was a half gram indoor growing pre-roll for like 10 bucks but the reality is is that this is still gonna get a failing grade 20 plus dollar gram joint half of the flour was just gone disintegrated again watch the other video let me know what you guys think if you've tried cookies in chicago please be sure to drop a comment share your experience if you had a similar experience be sure to let me know subscribe to respect my region and i will see you guys on the next review love you all peace", "5F0Vavzwt9g": "hey guys what is up so i typically save the packaging of cool marijuana products and today i want to share with you some of my favorite packaging it is for the buena vista pre-rolls this is a pack of five pre-rolls it is the clementine strain which is a sativa strain but look at this artwork here this is some of my favorite artwork for me this artwork i'm thinking it's 1955 in cuba in some elegant parlor setting and this woman here is stylishly enjoying her cigarette as she sits in this elegant parlor in her green tinted evening dress and look at here she's accompanied by a black cat statue that is full of mystery and malice and just this entire decor here the red drapes the leather couch this would make great artwork on the side of a cigarette case i checked out the company's website i could not find any additional information on this artwork or its origin or how it ties in with the brand of the company but in any case it is super cool artwork and i hope you enjoyed it", "osKgH8Ur7-Y": "how are we going to smoke weed in the future consumers have spoken they've picked two different ways we're going to take a look at a report about the future of smoking cannabis already being determined and the cannabis consumers have spoken welcome back to the talking hedge i'm josh mccabe capital markets analyst and host of your cannabis business podcast today we're looking at uh some pre-rolls here i guess some joints well cones specifically that's pretty much what's all available uh in the market until companies like this one is able to have those medical joints that is a role pros washington based company that has cylindrical joints finally better draw than a cone shape in my opinion so really excited to see them come on the market in the meantime looking at pre-rolls generating 20 year-over-year sales looking like that's the way to go so we reported earlier that it's based about uh price and convenience that's kind of what purchasing decisions are whether it's cannabis or otherwise so taking a look at um you know this specific product with pre-rolls people don't want the trays the grinders the papers the fillers the rolling machine or even a bomb and that's not even talking about concentrates when you have a 300 dab rig that's that's even above and beyond what people want to do with even a little roller so people want grab and go they want convenience i think that's really kind of the avenue and where cannabis is going to be going and people are willing to spend a couple extra bucks that's something we're going to kind of get into in a minute is that premium people are willing to pay even though the quality isn't better that's going to be eviscerated that's going to change dramatically as people kind of go from floor clippings or party mulch to something that's a more high-end for a discerning customer that actually prefers you know a wider variety of uh cultivars or strains so this trend is coming from two different data points coming about as people kind of want to change their consumer preferences so they obviously don't want the hassle of rolling papers and they want to do as little amount of work as possible so this article from cannabis.net is saying that the recent trend is because people prefer that they have it done for them even if they have to pay a little bit more or they want to do as little work as possible i think that's probably pretty accurate for most other things and it reports uh points to an mj business article um that relies on headset data about pre-roll sales being up 50 in 2020 we covered that on a previous podcast as well which basically goes into showing that you can add two to three dollars to a gram uh and sell that for even higher so grab and go is ready um in washington state at least the average demographic for pre-rolls white women 50 and older soccer moms grab and go they don't want to carry anything dab rigs bongs they don't want to roll anything they just want to light it and go with no um nothing left behind no evidence if you will um i think that's going to change dramatically i think with the proliferation of automation whether you like that or not i agree that hand rolled is a premium for a reason it's generally better however for the masses machines that are coming on board are rolling pretty good options that provide for really good experience in my opinion uh much better than a cone shape which is a novelty which is why tobacco hasn't taken on that shape the draw is a better shape so it looks like the other trend there's dry herb vaporizers also trending looking like some added benefits it's discreet um still not accepted everywhere cal um arizona rather doesn't sell a lot of pre-rolls they sell a lot of vape pens they're just a lot more conservative in arizona and don't want to look like a stoner apparently but there's health benefits obviously as well that come with dry herbalizers and so um joints and herbalizers are trending so a lot of people kind of cut back on smoking from the pandemic they were afraid that they were going to catch the rona a little bit easier maybe that's the trend towards uh not combusting there was already a trend towards vaping before accurate dosing vaping all of those hardwares have become really popular with investors and entrepreneurs alike i see a lot more states come online there's me a lot more products i think edibles are obviously popular with stay at home because it's powerful and potent so fridays are going to see a ton of edibles probably a third of all edibles being sold between the hours of three and five on a friday afternoon versus pre-rolls are going to be incredibly cheap as they're able to be mass manufactured with these machines literally just pumping these things out so look for a better product to be put in there and then all of that shake and party mulch being thrown into edibles or concentrates instead not going to smoke that garbage anymore now that you're able to mass manufacture high quality pre-rolls so looking forward to that come back to the talking edge to find out more with that we're going to roll this one up

MacGuffin 4/20 review today from the Edison cannabis company we have Rio Bravo these are pre rolled as you take it sealed so units contain 0.5 gram per roll so I'm guessing there's two joints in here and no expiry date has been determined it was packaged on so this is May 11th May 11th 2018 this was packaged on awesome [Applause] so yes yeah well these push these in [Applause] but there's only one join here yes all right I gotta check my receipt here this is I thought there would be at least two in here well I was gonna rip it open and see how much it weighed and everything but I want to see how good the roll is how she burns so 0.7 so the filter is 0.25 to go it's got a little bit of a white ash doesn't taste good at all no this is this is a three out of ten its pre-rolled so I guess if you weren't able to roll your own joints but I don't even enjoy this it's a sativa yeah so there you have it I'm gonna in this video short I don't want to smoke the rest of this it's leaving like a film taste in my mouth around my lips and everything it's a little ticklish no definitely junk doctormick puffin does not recommend Rio Bravo from the Edison Company shame on you guys alright guys to the next one don't forget to Like and subscribe we're almost at a hundred and again the gross series will be happening shortly to the next one", "DmiG8VK5-X8": "thanks for rolling up until I'm royally

the review [Music] all right Burke that thing's gonna be looking at these vibes this is a help tree road cone three cones and Harry says these are actually my first time seeing these you got a mad the purple ringer which is a head shop in Fort Myers Florida we're going to get these off the pack so we can see what they look like more stuff and then just catch some barb so just get these out to pack you see what they look like [Music] all right bird Club these are the volume imp combs pretty decent looking phone right there got a little stuff first row in each one of these back in the box we'll be using or a lean green machine to fill these up so let's get on that together you're ready get these things stuff and get to smoke [Music] [Music] [Music] all right birthday we got the vibes help cold rolled up and using the lead the lean green machine it stuff pretty decent well gets a fire on this I'm hoping that that bleach paper taste isn't on there but I'm sure that there's gonna be some reminisce of it but let's not speculate let's get some fire on this let's see what it actually do hi Berkeley buck spark this bicep cone up it tasted like well it smells like it smells like bleach paper so I'm sure it's going to have that bleach paper sent plant a young also smelling my weed pretty good in here so let's light this up and see the first side [Music] well the first size to smell is that of burning bleach paper but this take the first pull see the first pull is like I'm pretty sure that that bleep 8% is going to be coming through hopefully is just not too strong [Music] [Music] actually that's not too bad mostly mostly taste my weed I don't really taste beach paper and this at all as I'm pulling it though it is sucking in and constricting especially like down here at the bottom it might not be like pack that well down at the bottom gonna suck in it it is giving a very good droid oh yeah I'm holding back off I think this looseness down here is letting the smoke like build up a little bit this shotgun through because um it's like a dry cough hanging right here I'm trying to keep back exactly burning right yeah it's not burning right it's burning kind of wrong but pretty sure that's because I did it stuff it correctly already and break it down good enough it is put a decent dope just looks like looks like that series just gonna fall out but it's like it is a decent length if I'm gonna smoke for a decent amount on the ashes a little dark you know I really like the more greyish it did fix yourself though so it is very smooth [Music] who else is this where do you see these give them a try if you try to let me know what you think um this pack is about three dollars a little bit yeah three hours or so about a dollar at : you pay about a dollar for back would they I saved you imma try let me know what you think um they got some more of these vibes we won't be getting I'm checking them out zine about those I like them Omari my favorite comb know I'm

doesn't the only thing I'm really tasting isn't a wheat so yeah definitely say try these out if you don't want that bleach paper tape they with that - look buddy about Berkeley left left [Music]

today I'll be showing you how to use a J where eighty four millimeter comb loader as you can see there is thirty four pre-drilled slots [Music] so you're going to need a lot of freshly ground dry herb as well as your pre roll combs [Music] now you're going to want to insert the cones one by one into each slot [Music] it's really important that you don't let the papers get bunched up or wrinkled [Music] now once you've inserted all the columns you're going to want to start loading them with your dryer now we're ready to start filling our cones [Music] now it's really important that when you start filling them that you fill them evenly and as you can see I'm getting rid of some of the excess material [Music] personally I like the top decide to pack the joints a little bit tighter now you're going to want to use some kind of tool I used a pen you can really use any cylindrical object so just kind of pack your joints a little bit tighter before you take them out now once you have all your cones filled you're going to want to take the lid that comes with the rolling device and you want to insert it to the bottom of it and as you can see it's going to push all of your pre rolls up to the top [Music] now this one you're going to want to take them out one by one now personally I like to pack them a little bit further before actually roll them up and put them into now just twist the tip and you're ready to put it in a joint [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you for watching and be sure to visit we're 20 comm to get yours today [Music] you", "WESwnQoG4fw": "[Music] in this video we're going to cover how to take bulk flower and convert that into pre-rolls or into joints first thing i'm on my inventory tab as you can see within my flow hub classic i'm going to come to the top here and i'm going to sort by bulk flower now that i have the strain that i'm looking to pre-package i'm going to highlight that strain and on the bottom right i'm going to select pack bulk flower this is going to bring up a modal for us for packing our flower the first thing i'm going to select is going to be my weight category i'm going to scroll down i'm going to select joints as you can see this is going to include more fields for us to fill out before we can roll these joints into pre-rolls first i'm going to add is my quantity i have 1362 grams let's say that i'm going to roll 25 one gram joints so i'm going to put in 25 here next i'm going to move this to a specific room i'm going to add these right to my dispensary floor the next thing we're going to be adding is our cost per unit we want to include the cost of the crutch the paper the flour and labor for getting this rolled up i'm going to say this cost us about 3.57 next we're going to fill out the weight so i'm going to put a 1 in here and we're going to see this 1362 decrease by 25 grams next we've got our total weight of this specific pre-roll this is going to include the paper and the crutch let's say this is coming out at 1.12 grams total lastly we're going to put in the price that we're selling these joints for i'm going to say i sell these joints at ten dollars next i'm going to select pack the buds you'll see that our quantity has gone down here for the quantity of bulk flour but if i come to the top for category and scroll down to packed bud we're going to see our recently rolled joints in the system now these will have the same package tag number as the bulk flower that they were rolled from and we can come in here and make an edit to these if we'd like if we were to change the package tag we have that option and then we can put any other uh information in here but we want to put in our unit of measure for each save and close and that is how we roll joints within flow hub so to recap we went to our bulk flower we selected that bulk flower scroll down and select pack flower from there we then pack the flour into 25 one gram joints", "keFVGcvuMCM": "not gonna die I know oh excuse me

11 for watching and being subscribed staying subscribed arm oh yeah and thanks to people who are just started viewing whatever video you start viewing of my on my channel of any of my videos whether it be my first video or my last video um and I just made a video a couple years ago that said I was gonna get bud and I did so I'm a little stuff I took a snap of what I got and not high quality definitely not top shelf but this strain is hairy as [ __ ] I'm not joking it is hairy as [ __ ] and I also i went to a place I've been do this is my second time doing here I went to Kanna Grove Relief Center it's the deal arm first person patient i think is a 5 gram eighth it was a seven graham eighth but they just changed it they just changed it so if you're a California patient in Orange County who has their recommendation I suggest checking this clinic out I already get a review um just checked in my last couple videos you'll find it um you know what yeah yeah i think it was in my last video his last video i did a couple hours ago um the other video i did i think was a couple days ago so check that out yeah um what I got now you go I know you guys just like hurry up and show a [ __ ] Weed Man we just want to see the weed will care about you I know I care more about the weed than myself at the moment and the deal they have there is pretty cool so they want to save on recycling right they don't want to have to build up and spend so much money on containers they don't also want to be giving out so many containers so the program they have is to recycle program it's not really recycling because they don't take actual containers anymore from people is I don't know what they've been and it's just it's a lot of process cleaning them getting sand flies getting this old stickers off it really is i had agree and i like this just little program you bring in your own yard fill up your own order or fill its going to call it and you get a free joint every time you do that you know nothing hard about it it doesn't matter if you're getting a freaking out or an eighth or a gram for that matter it doesn't matter you bring your own you're in your own jar you get a free joint that's what I did and what I got was a okay gdp I have no idea what GD P stands for I should because I was in there obviously but I saw this on weedmaps I was like you know what it's it's it's it's cheap I only had ten bucks and I knew what their deal that at least I get a little extra which is a joint and I'm surprised they have a name for their joint that they give a a trail mix which I'm I'm imagining it's just [ __ ] shake shake I hate shake but it's pretty Joey and at least if it's shake its actual [ __ ] from nug shake you know from good dank nug not something from [ __ ] Mexico in a [ __ ] brick yeah I know we're coming up on 420 I'm not gonna be able to take the dope then I know you guys like you have we just take the two oak I can't because I'm showing you the weed I know you guys like that's no excuse man no I'm joking I'm a little hyper and happy about it I don't go to Graham so it's not like it's gonna be the biggest [ __ ] fettino you've ever seen but it definitely is a nice numb I like it I think strain is good for the price uh I will set a little tweezers I found in a emergency kit huh this is what i use these are my tweezers my cheap [ __ ] plastic tweezers but as you can see that and I'm trying to keep my screen lit up I can do this you know so here is foot strain that's for sure let's give it a smell mmm get a really pungent smell punjah t smell you know very pungent marry a strong smell from it smells good um this is the free joint you know Fredo I i think i'm just going to cut this open because i don't i think usually joint i get there always rolled too tight and they never smoked and it's just a waste of weed so I'm probably just going to open it up and put it in a bowl which that's what I'm gonna do of some of the set gdp I can find my bowl piece Oh yourself don't you hate it when you think you misplaced something and it is literally right in front of you and you just like what if we report we report oh there it is I hate when that happens but it happens so um yes I'm back to using the webcam because for the laptop I don't know the virus I had and you guys check out my last couple two videos which talks about it so yeah the 1i the one video I talked about this was I think three videos ago so check it out yeah round there check it out um I was talking about the fact that i'm not going to have this anymore or for a while and I was right and then up for a while so I got it back you know I'm happy I am extremely happy it's a good karma when I can finally figure out how to fix a damn problem on the gay and watt bulb just gonna break up a little bit of this small nug right away good flavor yeah so we're going to get away just taking a toke if you guys can hear anything in the background I apologize for a lot of background noise but I live in a neighborhood that's pretty noisy most of the time and also for some reason the the mic the microphone on this laptop it's actually really good the good it's just a good mic on the fact that they can pick up small Moyes is very small down here that here that if you can then that means yes it is if you get it oh well you know important thing is you see me smoke and you hear me talk background noise isn't really the thing we're talking about or it's not the subject of the video subject the video smoking ball that's luggable um out of this nice yellow and blue with some black pipe i got from garden grove alternative care that is actually write like a few buildings next to UM just quality which i went there a couple times a couple a couple weeks ago and that

be putting out couple videos just be talking in the next week or two two or three maybe in the next week or two I hope to just talk about what I've here is on the news local things national things not just about marijuana though either you know I think I've been focusing a little too much on marijuana it I'll of cannabis so much and I'm such a passion for it right now just feel like I'm going too much I'm going too much into it I'm it's not the only thing in life to think about you know like I don't think about it on a minute to minute or hour to hour or day by day basis but it is one of the main things in my life so I do think about a lot I do talk about it a lot but I think for me right now I need to back up a little bit take a few steps back still listen of course they'll talk about it but focus on different things you know um like like I heard this thing about on The Young Turks I heard this thing about um Germany and their military and it turns out the soldiers in the military are getting breasts breasts breasts always I always say that word was just like breasts it's always the S that gets me um and they talk about the fact that men are growing boobs I'm sorry's them I'm any women for watching this video I'm sorry I'm I'm not insensitive I'm not trying to be messed up for anything but I'm just saying the grown boobs in Germany mainly because of the fact that when they're doing drilling exercises they have an exercise where you hid the rifle like hard up on your chest on one side your chest and because they're doing that it makes their you know their breasts grow out more and I guess that's a problem it mean I if that happened to me I'll really suck but then again I am a fat guy who already has [ __ ] these which are you called tit tit man all the time you know and as I tell the people there they're not tip there man flops get them right to the man flap see ya there flats and aahing will hit third there's two [ __ ] saggy anyway I know I know I'm probably grossing a lot of people out sorry about that oh well did you know it's coach Barry's gone wild except it's not that attractive and it probably get you to throw up a little hydro two don't worry no it was a good clinic overall I really thought that the staff was nice there you know the only thing I don't like is a damn door they have a security door there which is a really good door it's not simple to get into it seems simple but it just made eight all right and this is simple what you read the directions but it's annoying it's like okay let's do this fast slow just a paste kind of way all right what it says on the door is push and then pull does it seem to heart I i think i did at not when i went there my first friend went at night and it was so annoying doing that yeah that's so that's the only problem I got with it you know maybe the parking lot could be better like they could make their parking lot a little more not cleaned up because it looks fine but I think they should put the white line so you know is because they should measure out how many cars are able to even fit there you know because they have like a space and it's like but I don't even know how big the space is but it's like as maybe as why does a building you know like good prepped angular building something like that but overall the clinic is good the bug is good there I've been there before the first person patient deals still good I brands still good it's not seven but it's still [ __ ] good even you got to admit that forty dollar cap deal awesome top shelf I haven't tried to edible so I'm not sure about the edibles but the next time I go there at that point gets mad about and I'll definitely try out some it hash you know I've mainly tried out there any codes right now so I'm not sure about their sativas but next time i go i'll be sure to check out some he was along along with some of their indicas as well as already checked out a bunch arm and then a few edibles and i'll show it alright guys i don't want to driving this on so i'm gonna finish up my bowl and then i'm going to go because the this is a strong string and good this bowl i think is just going to get me on my ass honestly but that's indica Fauria its physical it's not mental its physical get physical physical hits the bone stuff on here cheers what a [ __ ] still cheering oh and next time I pick up I definitely want to roll couple more joints and I know probably a lot of people like joints trust me aren't that special there are a lot of people who like joint ed but there are a lot of people don't that just prefer glass mmm damn the congestion just went out for a second mmm damn spoken Sierra's [ __ ] up your system your throat so it's like clogged up [ __ ] I know that sounds gross i probably this well but honestly these are handy just on the go and you don't have a pipe you're like out in the middle of nowhere you know it's not good to smoke that all really because smoking anything will [ __ ] up your lungs in general but then again canvas fights cancer cells so it really isn't that bad honestly they're probably some tar that you get in your long but not as bad as so I think it fights at the same time just [ __ ] you up [ __ ] up your lungs but the same times it's protecting your lungs um I definitely don't want to keep getting further in cannabis learning more about its effects um about you know um I don't know how cannabis works i guess in your system um I understand that you have a I think TC receptors in your brain and you get that I'm not totally sure I know I've heard a lot of documentaries about it so far you know about cannabis what it does to you honestly after a while i'm not saying i think i have to see if something like that a few times for me that really remember the hard facts and the small facts to you know honestly I know what it does to you but I can't always get explaining when I'm stoned like this and tired I'm just tired right now and I think I can't function as well when I'm tired that's why oh I would have got a sativa but then again I've insomnia and I need something to sleep during the night and it is daytime sorry sleeping I can't sleep I don't want to waste my [ __ ] sleep during the day I'm gonna be during the night where it's you know useful um that yeah next time I'll definitely get sativa I'll probably just be smoking the sativa come my videos for now on because i realized that when i'm doing the videos i'm wasting weed you know play I Vanstone but I'm using it to sleep you know my smoke at all during the day use all during the day I won't have it and i'll be done within a couple nights you know but then again if i wait just until nighttime smoked two bowls bowl you don't pass out not asking you probably a week you know good eighth um i think as soon as I get a job I'll try it affording more than an eighth a week and I like a quad a week you know I think I will alright guys I'm gonna shut up finish this bowl to these I honestly I'm talking so much right now even even it is bothering me right now that just shows how much I not talking come on I don't usually get mad at myself talking so much mmm but it just coming up in my head I'm just getting annoyed at myself cheers from shutting up now legalize dirty ashtray haha you guys want to know where to find this you can find this gesture in line and I'm pretty sure anyone who lick it up cuz anyone can wear this comes from and you can look it up legalized ashtray I'm these they have a bunch and the place i got from that's not the only place you can probably find these at a pawn shops head shops glass shops pong shots um just based the tobacco shops but where I found it I where I know it will probably be if you go there is Spencer's in which Spencer's and um yeah wasn't good no no I'm right I know it is it was in westminister and um it a bunch they had a big one with just a [ __ ] fatty you know marijuana leaf style thing on you know it's like it's [ __ ] big you know and it's just in the shape of a marijuana leaf but it's cool i would got that it was just it wasn't actual glasses like wood or something I like watch batteries I think it's easy to clean and would you don't wreck the would do what does it work the wood rocks out eventually and gets them would eventually it doesn't matter i think as it gets old it's all messed up is probably just gonna get you know [ __ ] termites and [ __ ] I don't probably take a look good while but the way everything is made now but I like glass bladder blue blood blood blood ER i mumble in my [ __ ] words sorry about that i also have a a wood one actually it's um you guys have seen it but I'm gonna show it one more time before it go I'm just mad at myself even more I'm talking too much sorry about that yes I'm just happy I got my video I guess that's all I can explain it as you know it put up a video to smoke bowl and you're freaking legs feel better after that said bowl that's a nice free of mine I saying hater you say they ever especially in town he did what I see it he day he day he did I'll be dead so his crown center in town he say it I went all the way to Kentucky for [ __ ] real fried chicken and he I there i'm doing a hillbilly style [ __ ] family got a Peter Griffin ironically i did the hillbilly did pretty good but i think i [ __ ] [ __ ] up on pier after i start i just got in a rhythm [ __ ] son like hillbilly i shall be [ __ ] hillbilly do now I don't have a problem people from the South they're pretty cool I got family who lived in the south and they had a lot of respect for them some smart ass [ __ ] people you know it I'm gonna take this a little longer just because I'm going to show a few things and I'm gonna rip this joint open and it's probably sativa so smells like sativa so I'm going to smoke a little sativa in a bowl and feel more up I don't like feeling too down there the day it's annoying because I try to stay up on I'm on indica and it just it makes me irritated it really does hey I just don't stand i want to sleep when i smoke in a i feel it i want it oh don't i feel like i'm wasting we then just in a major way you know does definitely ground up it's probably shake yeah oh yeah shake I knew what trail mix probably in it to be trail mix try to mix I gotta let my lock my trail mix [ __ ] name no it's pretty catching neighboring little joint and betrayal minutes i'll get my trim enjoying the house get my garden grove style [ __ ] trail joint and you'd only hear trail [ __ ] joint in garden grove no i don't think that but uh i like the name i think it's catchy you know what I mean open because I really don't like going over the time it should be actually is pretty annoying I'm doing that no and I just feel like I don't want to use up too much time making videos and I want to you know overdo it figure people don't want to watch 20 30 minute videos you know it's like you don't have 28 I don't know what I figure is people probably just like anyone else common sense people have to do [ __ ] in live if they have a job they go to school they'll do all that [ __ ] and honestly it's the truth same thing with me same thing going on mom yeah we're not spending every second on the computer and I don't think I'd want to either my dad does that and you know what who he's obsessed I think he has an addiction he's honestly he'll spend out of a 24-hour basis he'll probably spent 15 hours on his computer just playing fight/flight [ __ ] simulators you ever heard of Falcon for 4pc yeah he's one of those guys who's real into it and spends you know ten hours out of his day trying to learn you know a couple maneuvers I don't know I've played a game it's fun I played the simulator it's not a game simulator it's fun honestly just doing the regular missions i guess on campaign mode but what he did i bet was really fun and I probably would do what he did and do it online and play it online but honestly he eat like you don't need to put that many hours in a day to one game you know it's obsessed it's bad it's unhealthy in my mind um I used to spend seven eight hours on video games when I was younger I can't even [ __ ] play a video game for more than 30 minutes about without either either it just [ __ ] annoying me because it gets boring or it given me a headache but literally I can't just sit there like this all the time looking at a screen it hurts my [ __ ] head I get a headache from I have migraines and I don't like it anymore so I don't really play that much even though I actually do have a bold xbox one of the original xbox original system which was from my cousin too yeah they didn't push they put bud shape like big just blinded of nug so that's it is none whoa how Clyde it's [ __ ] ugh it's not [ __ ] shake that's a good thing so I'm happy um we're going to end this at a good time so appreciate it did I love the fact this is already ground up so all I do is pick it up and put it in a bowl what the [ __ ] is that it's not a [ __ ] seed yeah so [ __ ] but but yeah you guys don't know what it is cheers guys here's some of the ground up trail mix joint I opened up sorry candy grove I'm not much for tight roll joint that much anymore I think they waste and I think I want to learn how to roll my own and get my own kind of liking how I like my joints you know what I mean thanks guys love your clinic guys check them out I'm serious koosh berries you can freaking subscribe you can look you cannot comment on it oh shut up cheers my [ __ ] your boy [ __ ] that way oh I got peace out",

yet it's with my stuff so um wait a minute what the hell is that it's the plate of pot and it's got eight items on here and it looks like one two three four pre-rolls and four three point fives um well let's go through them i guess we've got edison ice cream cake we've got weed me mandarin cookies uh ignite crescendo that's a pre-roll no idea what that is scotia lemon dory then we've got canna farms super critical uh silver haze or something like that then we've got captain's choice it's some sort of mysterious sativa blend of pre-roll then we've got another new lp here dixtra green houses i think that's what they call it dixtra something like that um lemon pepper spice and finally we've got ignite gg number four pre-roll oh my goodness this is very exciting eight new items on this plate of pot right in time when i ran out just giving a shuffle here so it's all nice and random super random and here we go i'll take anything except a pre-roll please no no it's the captain's choice oh maybe these will be good i don't know we'll see it's the captain's choice here it is it's the captain's choice sativa blend uh 19 or 195.5 milligrams per gram uh and this is two pre-rolls in here for a total of one g and let's see here united greenery so that's who makes this that's who the captain works for and we've got the date is november the 3rd of 2020 so not too bad not too bad so if you're wondering why i got these four pre-rolls on this plate of pot here um when i made my last order i had like 20 bucks left over so i thought you know what i'm going to get a couple 1g things but there's not many of those around anymore so i thought i'll just get 20 worth of pre-rolls and i tried to get stuff that uh we don't normally see as flower right so this one here right you don't even have the lp doesn't have anything so i mean or the brand that's why i thought it'd be cool this one here for two dubs that are each supposed to be half a gram this went for four dollars and 38 cents which is not bad um for two half grams supposedly half ram joints we'll find out soon first we're going to check out the scale here because uh that's what we're gonna do so like on my last video we're gonna do it a little differently here we're gonna put this on zero it out because somebody suggested this and you know in my mind this would be technically slightly slightly even more uh accurate so here we put that on 50.00 perfect perfect see look at that [Laughter] i guess that's cool anyways let's open this up and see what these things look like and way holy shit oh my god that's not even a i thought that was a flip top i've been trying to flip it like this that would pop open but nope that's the hinge they hid the opening over here somewhere oh boy that is a little bit difficult to open but there we go we got it and hey you know what these are actually out of all the pre-rolls i've seen these are some of the nicest looking the filter isn't insanely huge it's big i would go half that size but that's it's not half the size of the joint like those quest ones let's see what they each weigh with filter because normally we don't check it with the filter oh my god 0.8 that's good what about this one 0.8 also wow that means that these might weigh the proper amount let's find out let's empty these in here and see if it makes uh oh and look at that nice little spiral we'll see if it makes it a gram look at that i just pulled the filter out all nice oh very nice and now i should be able to just just sort of go like this and empty it all here look at that 0.49 i did get a couple tiny little bits out so you know that's that's fucking close oh my god i've never seen one that was so accurate i'm impressed i'm impressed let's try this one i have no idea what strain is in here though that's a mystery [Music] there's a little bit in the tip come on get out of there come on get all of you come on oh my god look at this they actually did it the captain did it all right so i went and got this nice box and i'm gonna check out the uh we'll check out this stuff here with the microscope and see what kind of stuff they're putting inside here see a little stem right there hopefully that's the only one right well let's take a look at it we got this nice box it's black so we won't get a lot of reflection should be all right so one thing i didn't think of when i was getting this box was how tall the box was it's pretty tall i can barely actually know what i'm going to turn the box around and i'm gonna put this thing up on here and check there we go i figured they were so here we are looking at the captain's choice this is what the captain smokes when the captain's looking for a sativa apparently um so you can see some chunky trichomes in there you can see it it does look a little bit like uh it reminds me somewhat not as nicely of but somewhat like shred i i don't know if uh can see some bits of stem here and there you can see some trichomes they're kind of cloudy and chunky looking let's see if we can zoom in closer that's about as close as i can get without it getting all horribly blurry oh there we go a little bit nicer there yeah so that's kind of what it looks like there and you know i don't see a ton of stems i see some little bits of of stem and leaf like you can see right there the big reflection you see all the reflections shining so much off that pretty sure that's a leaf right there and so it looks okay it doesn't look as bad as that one time i got the pedros from color that pretty ready to roll garbage that stuff was horrible but this looks okay it doesn't look as good as shred but it looks okay so hopefully it is okay and i'm gonna go try it and then i'll be right back so i just got in from trying the captain's choice sativa blend oh sativa blend i didn't notice that before interesting at 19 so i first out there when i was trying i thought it was kind of weak but um after a while uh it's sort of sort of a creeper on there and it sort of kicks up to like maybe just below a medium for the high so the high on here is uh it's all right but at first it kind of was like it felt weak but there's a bit of a creeper there and it sort of creeps up to maybe a medium maybe just somewhere around a medium maybe just below a medium to a medium that's kind of nice and it's kind of like uh it's got like a i guess it makes it kind of alert sort of um sort of really awake it's kind of woke me up this thing it made me really um make me feel really awake and stuff i don't feel like energetic or anything but i feel really kind of like i could go and do some sort of physical activities or some shit um yeah so that's kind of all right i guess not that i want to go do anything like that but you know i guess it's okay it's okay it's a nice it's like kind of like um like a clear-headed kind of a buzz maybe not clear-headed but it's kind of it's not a couch lock at all we'll say that and yeah but this stuff is quite dry so i don't know if how it would burn in a joint or whatever there was absolutely no flavor no flavor at all and there was no smell too so that you know that sucks for both of those things unless i guess some people they they like it so it doesn't smell so i guess for you that will be okay but the high on here is okay um the weight i'm surprised actually had the proper weight on here for um pretty much for both of them they came up to well combined it came up to one and uh yeah and it was actually packed really nicely in here it's a probably one of the nicest pre-rolls i've seen so far it was a little bit large filter but it wasn't insane like some of them and as it came out it was all nicely packed it had it felt like there was no hard spots or anything like maybe there would be really good air flow through there there was no no hard spots or anything that was all sort of nicely nicely packed so yeah you know for five bucks and it's okay there's better for five bucks but you know whatever it's uh it's the captain's choice so [Laughter] if you like captains and maybe i don't know who knows i wouldn't i don't think i would ever buy it again but you know i had five bucks to spend and i spent it on this and i don't regret it because there was nothing else available so i would have had to have spent well i would have had to have less stuff so i don't regret it because it just gave me more stuff to try there how old was that i wouldn't buy it again though anyways though that's the captain's choice um this uh seven more things on the um what is that called there so we got seven more things on the plate of pot uh come check it out hit the subscribe button uh in the notification bell it'll tell you when the next um one of those videos goes up and that yeah that's uh that's all there is for this well we'll see you later have a good one i just remembered something that i wanted to add in here real quick because i just remembered it i was just stopped recording but anyways when i was saying there was no flavor in this there was no flavor but there's a little bit of an aftertaste which is not the best aftertaste and it's a taste i know very well and you guys probably know very well it's the taste of when there's a seed in your joint you're smoking it there's a seed in there and it burns that taste it's very unique taste that was the there was a slight aftertaste of that so i don't know if maybe a seed or two got ground up in this also maybe who knows but i did have slight aftertaste of of a seed you know that's unmistakable aftertaste it took me a few minutes to figure out what it was and then when i realized that i was like oh yeah that's that yeah anyways just thought i'd mention that because uh yeah anyways see you later have a good one",

to our how-to and product review videos here at es studios today we'll be discussing the raw cone filler this relatively new product was created by raw with the intention of easing and expediting the process of packing raw pre-rolled cones they come in both king-size and 101 quarter to fit every smokers needs let's go ahead and take a look at what this ingenious new packing tool has to offer attach the raw cone filler itself you'll also find a bamboo packing stick as well as an additional packing tool which detaches from the bottom of the cone filler to make it easier to pack the trench an extra mouth tip for the filler and a short instruction manual are also included will take you step-by-step to show you how these nifty tools will come in handy when filling your pre-rolled cones now that you've unpacked all of your cool new tools you're going to want to take your ground up over tobacco and begin filling the top of the filler with it then using the packing tool that comes attached to the bottom of the cone filler pack down the herb into the trough until you can securely closed the filler then you're going to take your pre-rolled cone and slip it onto the mouth tip of the cone filler being careful not to wrinkle the paper now close the top of the filler ensuring it grasps onto the tip of the cone then at a slow and steady pace slide the top part all the way forward then all the way back to its original position being cautious not to detach the cone as you go some users like to partially slide the top back and forth a second time to pack it further while others use the bamboo packing stick to slide the rest of it through the mouth tip and into the cone as always pack your herb further down into the pre-rolled cone using your bamboo packing stick to ensure your cone is packed evenly throughout finally twist off the top of the cone and there you have it a perfectly packed pre-rolled raw cone despite the fact that Rob's a great care when creating this innovative and effective product we have run into a few minor issues with it and have received several complaints from customers regarding them personally the biggest issue we've come to find is that the cone filler will oftentimes leave a partially unpacked space near the filter tip causing the cone to be flimsy our solution to this has been to pre pack the cone slightly before using the cone filler in order to avoid cos the complaint which we have received them most from our customers however is that the pre-rolled cones will at times not fit onto the mouth tip of the cone loader unfortunately this issue has been addressed by Josh himself the founder of raw rolling papers as he has stated that because of the fact that free rolled cones are all hand rolled there will always be instances where they will not fit perfectly onto the comb through it in any case the product itself is still quite effective and convenient as it makes the process of packing pre-rolled cones ten times faster and simpler thanks for watching our video we'll continue to release videos every week if you have any questions suggestions or comments feel free to leave them below and most importantly don't forget your parachute", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea",

way that might you know hamper your work ability CBD actually has most of the same medicinal benefits of THC but just without the high and it's the medicinal stuff that is in a more concentrated form yes like you're not getting as much CBD yeah from traditional okay yes smoke so you got cannabis and you got him so cannabis is actually very strong very concentrated in THC a very low concentration of CBD industrial hemp is actually very high in CBD but very very low if not anything of THC so actually a lot of the CBD comes from industrial hemp it actually doesn't come from cannabis lucky for us and lucky for a lot of people that are that need the medicinal benefits of cannabis while CBD legality can vary from state to state CBD is not only legal in Missouri but it's also legal on a federal level they actually just passed a new farm bill that was an update from the 2014 farm bill completely removed it from the controlled substance act is it legal yes however do be smart about it this stuff especially our flour and our pre-rolled items do look a lot like the quote unquote real deal so I recommend that the customers leave that in the package until they arrive at their home if it does feel a little disjointed yeah studies have shown that CBD reduces pain inflammation anxiety depression migraines seizures IBS psychosis and mental disorders and nausea so thirdly how is CBD take it you have sublingual sublinguals are a quick way to get in your bloodstream usually just drops under the tongue topicals creams balms there's even patches that are great for muscle and joint pain then you have your pills pill form is great capsules really quick and easy way no hassle no frills way to take CBD then you have your edibles edibles are delicious there's all different kinds of edibles vape available form of CBD can be great for somebody who's already using an e-cig or already has a vaporizer that they're using on a daily basis and when it comes to flower we have the jars of loose flour we have the roll-your-own kit that has the filters and papers included and then we have the pre-roll we have regular pre-roll and then we actually have a Keith and honey rolled pre-roll concentrates concentrates include wax shatter crumble any sort of concentrated CBD isolates and CD is also pet safe there are specific products designed just for pets you could also take a sublingual that's meant for human consumption and give that in small doses to your pet either through their water or in their food meow the fourth thing is how much CBD do I take we always recommend in your starting dose you should usually start about 25 to 50 milligrams and then kind of go from there start a little smaller work your way up and just see what works for you it's not uncommon for people to take upwards of a hundred to two hundred you can't really overdose on CBD so take it you know if you want to start at a hundred start at one hundred if you think that's what you're gonna need one good thing to know if you are using any kind of sublinguals or anything like that with the dropper most droppers are one mill per dropper so you can figure out hey I've got a 30ml bottle it's got a thousand milligram of CBD and you just divide that a thousand by 30 mils and that's basically how much each dropper will be so the fifth and final thing that we're going to talk about will I pass my drug test with CBD yes you will however some CBD products do have trace amounts of THC in them the legal limit for CBD products is 0.3 percent or less THC a lot of the products that we carry are 100% CBD pure CBD or isolates isolated zvt if it says full spectrum that's where you get into that gray area where yeah I'd include something like that and the flower and and yes again it's very trace amounts but if you are using CBD on a regular basis at all I would recommend sticking with isolates and pure CBD and stay away from the flowers and the multi spectrums in the full spectrums now quality is a huge factor know where you're getting your stuff from know where your shops getting their stuff from if you're into CBD at all you know the names like green rose and fresh leaf and summit stuff like that that's what we carry so it's all lab tested most products aren't only just lab tested they're double and triple lab tested and keep in mind even if you're at the point three percent you're not gonna get high from it on the other hand if you're not getting drug tested the multi spectrums are fantastic they have what they call an entourage effect because you're getting all those camp cannabinoids to work together all that synergistic stuff going on aside just all they say all the harder right pretty role in the flower stuff it's some of the best stuff for anxiety and insomnia sleep disorder sleep IDI is an excellent way to go for for anxiety alright guys thank you so much for watching I am Steve this is Ian we are at 5-star vapor lounge in st.

called the selfie this is a maui wowie one gram sativa joint coming in hot at what where are we at in the testing cbd 0.11 thca 14.81 and total cannabinoids 15.14 so this is not a high potency pre-roll by any means this is going to be more hopefully flavorful and terpe but we shall see the grower on this it says ieso illinois one gram pre-roll single slow cured premium ground flour i mean it is what it is dube tube nothing too crazy let's see what the smell is looking like yeah you get some sativa in there you can smell that little citrusy pine the pre-roll is packed pretty tightly i'm gonna massage that out looks like your classic just raw paper nothing too crazy and then the way we do these uh taste test reviews you all pretty simple one hit talk about it two hits score out of ten three hits give you guys a score out of a hundred definitely remember to like follow and subscribe to respect my region and please be sure to go support modern cannabis aka mocha moca here in chicago i'm downtown you guys can see beautiful day a beautiful view shout out to recreational cannabis man so dope to be able to go to a store wait outside for a bit pop inside and get treated like a patient all right here we go first hit it's light citrusy piney not overpowering in any one of those flavors but you can taste them all right taste test official score one hit talk about a two hit score out of 10. this is more of an affordable pre-roll so i think the score out of 10 on this taste test is going to be closer to like a 7.75 you really do get this light citrus this light floor this very light pine but it's not super pungent it's not super loud it's not super citrusy so because of that can't be a super high score on the taste it's just not the best version of any one of the flavors i've ever had or the best version of maui but the ash very light colored so that's solid and the high right now is very much not necessarily like energetic but i'm more focused i feel like i'm ready to either go run or just start the day and so maybe it's mood improving i think that would be the right word but either way when you start to think about a score out of a hundred and the overall score basic packaging no terpene information not the best tasting weed but also not bad tasting as well i think i'm gonna have to give this product a 75 out of 100 with a 7.75 official taste test score you want the thc to be a little higher you want the terpenes to be a little higher on the sativa strain so that way you actually get the effects you want the entourage effect the thc and the terpenes to come in and provide a strain specific kind of high maui wowie known for you know the cerebral clarity an energizing burst maybe even a little bit of appetite suppressant um but definitely you know creativity inducing for sure so 75 out of 177.5 i'm sorry 7.75 out of 10 on the overall score and the taste test let me know what you guys think drop a comment smash it like if you've been to chicago you've tried legal weed let me know what you guys think drop some recommendations and i will see you all on the next review big shout out to ieso illinois and modern cannabis for the plug love you all peace", "2Z3QMthmlXU": "hi this is Josh Kincaid giving you the recap from MJ Pez con about some joint rolling equipment that I saw there was a automated joint rolling machine it was one gram he couldn't really adjust the the weights of it just spits out one gram but it's interesting than the less at 500 a minute they also had a sixty five thousand dollar grinder called the flood Buster there's a video of that as well but first I wanted to show you the Pulver set 19 it's a grinder from fritz it's thirty thousand dollars and it's really precise you know pharmaceutical grade you can do coarse or fine which is really nice based on whatever cultivar you have or how you grow and then apparently it also doubles your yield for extraction so all in all it's a really nice piece of equipment wanted to kind of show that as an option as a scale the future of cannabis if you will and then dive into that joint Rowland machine and touch base on a blunt rolling machine as well so come check it out see this crazy thirty thousand dollar grinder [Music] some tickets different different grinds different sets the Culver at nineteen a beast it's crazy all right the bud buster it's only 65,000 so let me know how many you need put in a couple of grams in there it's got a filter screen so spits out these see further down the stems so as a beast that's probably half a ton at least check out this joint rowing machine at 110,000 on a bobbin system you can do mints and bleach natural white paper whatever did a hopper it's got a vibration shows it in there it's got a grinder I mean a wheel spits it out all in one length and then you have to get a filter you're shooting to slap that on there as well as an addition but it's nice and compact I like it very limited though and not tested [Music] here's the size I don't think there's anything in your the relevance small maybe one ground oops correction on that apparently those machines were specifically made for cannabis so I can only assume that they have been tested fairly certainly had been but regardless the scale and scope of automation is here it's just a matter of when you know Big Tobacco decides to to get into play the one exception I think that we have to survive is is canna gars but in the meantime you have blunts already being rolled there's options of hemp and mint and natural unbleached white papers with filters and rolling at 45 a minute on low speed eventually 200 a minute on the high speed so that's there I think it's gonna take a while to figure out how to infuse canna gars with oil or rosin with filters and make them look just as nice so again I think that's something that it's gonna still be handmade for a little bit but that's my analysis from MJ biscone definitely let me know what you think in the comments you can find me on social media at super chronic Josh or you can email me at Josh at Seattle super chronic cough a.com if you want some more information on how to buy these machines and then if you want to hear the recap of MJ biz con you can go to baked and awake you can find them at peyton awaked on youtube and amazon and mars all over the place so that's it the super chronic Josh I'm out", "ONsNd63vZHw": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respectmyregion.com i am here today to do a quick taste test review featuring a pre-roll eighth from a chicago-based cannabis company we're in illinois right now this is the king crasher from revolution cannabis recommended to me yesterday at modern cannabis aka mocha moca in downtown chicago coming in at a uh 27.05 thca 28.63 total cannabinoid content check out the jar real quick on the back we've got all the testing information and then they also put the genetics look at that four kings times wedding crasher 19 and then they put the the terpene content right here so on this one we're looking at limonene beta-carotelline linoleum beta-mercene and alpha pinene relaxing stress relief and mood elevation is what it says so here we go let's check out some of the i saved the best nugs for last for the review super frosty and covered in trichomes right so smell-wise this is supposed to be a wedding crasher times four kings four kings i wanna say is like king louie and a couple other ogs and then you've got wedding crashers which is a cake cross so i'm going to go ahead and break this down we're going to get this nice into the joint real quick and we're going to do a one hit talk about it two hits i'll give you guys a score out of ten i haven't stood outside in a park and rolled the joint and i don't know how long and so how you know i don't know where i can smoke in in chicago i don't know what the rules i don't know where even we're at necessarily but one way or the other i'm going to get you guys your content shout out to jazzasaurus on the on the camera today y'all big show some love follower on the gram all right here we go last little bit of weed and then we're gonna get it twisted up and sparked good time for you guys while i'm rolling always remember to go like follow and subscribe to respect my region on all social media and on this case check out

that's in there you really get that all right here we go not the best drawing i've ever rolled but it's gonna smoke wow so you definitely get the pine you definitely get some limonene you definitely get the spicy beta-carotene and you get this sweet sour bed of mercy it's delicious taste test out of ten 8.8 8.8 final score on the taste test overall they had plenty of information on the packaging plenty it's definitely high potency it's a smooth smoke harvested on december 6 packaged on march 3rd it's about as fresh as you could possibly get it to me the 8.8 on the taste test and the flavor and then combined with the experience i'm gonna bump it up to a nine flat and then when you think about the price point sixty-five dollars plus tax unfortunately it just doesn't meet that high highest shelf top level premium in my opinion but in on all in all honesty i feel that this item is arguably a 90 out of 100 overall so definitely a premium product for premium flavor and potency let me know what you guys think in the comments be sure to go check out modern cannabis this is the king crasher four kings times waiting crasher 19. i love you guys appreciate you all for the love i'll see you on the next taste test review peace", "sQF8-dl5fls": "[Music] yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing some of my orange cookies wax so hopefully that does look good on

"zUCAiM5DLdM": "[Music] what's going on loud fam I'm so loud 7:10 welcome to my channel I'm back with another video today's video is lift tickets if you never heard of these don't know what these are these are cannabis infused rolling papers it says right here 5 cannabis infused rolling papers there's a flavor it's reckless rainbow so I don't know what that's supposed to mean or what that's supposed to taste like but I hope it tastes really fruity it's a 5 pack made with shatter Lumpy's flowers I don't know what that means but lumps that is Lumpy's flowers that's like the instagrams I guess it's probably like the shower what the shower was made from their flowers so thankfully the Lumpy's flower lip ticket laboratory so that's where you could probably get these on Instagram to is if that's there at lift ticket laboratory it says there is 15 milligrams of THC per rolling paper and 0.0 21 milligram CBD that's probably how much like it takes you to get like a decent high because you got to count the fact that we're gonna stuff this with weed and there's 75 milligrams of THC in the whole package and zero point I don't even read that I'm CVD yeah so that's pretty lit you know what's funny I've been calling these lit take it's for like a really long time for a couple months because I've had these for a while now guys shout out to sack beds nine one six they gave this to me to shout them out and try them and all that but like you don't want dude I've had these for so long and I have been calling them the wrong damn name they're called lit lift tickets that I've been called Himmel it tickets I'm freakin dead it smells like [ __ ] shattered it smells like IRAs okay so there's like a sheep in between them all that shows you that they're sticky is how this is sick okay so you rip you take it off of this I'm not too sure like how to do this but dude this smells like shatter man doctor picking is wild all broken up here I have the wedding punch [Music] ever grams of wedding punch [Music] I want to put some more wheat actually for once he's the grinder I don't know why use a grinder but it made the weed like really really fine in that already like that so here's 2 grams such a backward roller I really hope this is the right way that I'm doing this because there is like no instructions on like which way this was supposed to be rolled and like there's no line of like where the paper is like there's a slight line like you know like that sticky line to where the paper is sticky and we're like you know that's where you're licking it it didn't really have one of those kind like a very faint line and I was like unsure [Music] to think this whole entire thing is gonna get me high not even cuz I'm just the wheat it's like amazing the papers gonna get me high dude that's insane I feel like it's almost blasphemous to cut this off but happy it's thick paper it's very nice [Music] [Music] [Music] this is my first time ever tried these lift tickets shoutout sacrament I want six this is lit reckless rainbow I really don't know what this flavor is but it's very nice I can taste the blood tastes amazing but I know what this weed tastes like I could taste like another flavor very nice and that has to be the paper it's almost like a flavored paper but you know what's getting you high whoever came up with this idea you are a genius [Music] it's a little harsh on the throat [ __ ] alive it's not the easiest to burn it's burning its predict pretty nicely but it's cut a rough and it's getting it really resonated really quickly all in all so far like these whatever I commend them yeah this is a cool thing to try I think that everybody deserves to try like a really cool thing like this but I also think that if you want to spend too much cuz these retailed and where I got them at least for the guy I met you know sach meds nine one six these are 20 bucks he was selling them for it I don't know how much other people sell them for but you get five papers that's five bucks of paper basically like you know technically they've paid twenty bucks for the whole thing five ten fifteen twenty you know actually you know that's that would be 25 I can't do better I'm [ __ ] stoned but still you get the gist though that's like a lot of money per paper like we're in 20 people you shouldn't pay more than like a dollar or whatever I don't know like 30 cents I just like you have to like really want these to buy these like you really want to try them other than that I mean I don't know I'll smoke the whole thing so you have to [Music] so far does it really feel any different than if I just smoke the weed alone and I started doing this I'm already high as [ __ ] I've really started to feel it now I'm not too sure where I feel it it's weird is I just feel it reading the package business a if it's a hybrid or a sativa or it doesn't really say anything on it besides the flavors are like the name and where it's from so I don't know what I'm smoking I just feel it I tasted I'm mmm nice [Music] this package advised me of like a Willie walk-up reminds me of like nerds Willy Wonka nerds are so [ __ ] reckless rainbow it's like one of those um sin nerds I don't know they're nerds ropes but this dust age really gets like okay a regular joint right you were to smoke it down to this size by now it would taste like gross especially the fact that it's resonated in [ __ ] it would taste disgusting but this is still has a very nice flavor so you can tell there's something going on here it's really nice [Music] [Music] Wow these are really nice guys five pack breakfast rainbow lift tickets five cannabis infused rolling papers if you guys enjoy this video because I'm about to end this I want to save this and smoking with a couple people

talking about a growing problem that I have been noticing more and more in my DMS we're talking about fake exotic now some of you guys out there might be wondering what the [ __ ] is fake exotic but I assume most you guys know what I'm talking about here we're talking about those cookies packs the runts packs the jungle boys packs that are obviously not real those are the main three but there's a bunch of other like fake packaging brands where they aren't actually real weed brands it's just packaging companies that sell the [ __ ] to anyone right now for those of you guys who are uninformed there is a very large trend going around in the weed smoking community where people will take some fairly decent weed and put it in a fake knockoff dispensary look-alike bag and then sell it for $50 an 8 which is unacceptable absolutely ridiculous so today we're gonna break down how to differentiate between a fake and a real bag and we're also gonna talk about some information that you guys probably need to know about this now first and foremost I'd like to say here that if you were cab going to buy weed from your plug and he's ever got some some quote-unquote exotic that is prepackaged in a bag like this you should generally run to the [ __ ] hills you should fly as far away as you can you know what snitch on that [ __ ] guide you'd call twelve six nine that dude bro [ __ ] that guy alright he's selling fake [ __ ] and here's why 99% of the time this is exactly what happens people will go on sites like DHgate or Aliexpress or Amazon and they will buy a bunch of these fake bags these pre-made bags from [ __ ] Wuhan or some [ __ ] right get them mailed to him open them up seal them all you know fill them up with some decent bud and ate the bud seal them up and sell them now there's one dead giveaway to these bags that really tells you right off the bat that they're fake right and I don't here's the thing before I ever made this video I figured that a lot of this stuff is like really self-explanatory but ever since I made my reviewing subscribers weed series I've received a concerning amount of DMS of people like flexing these fake bags like a shocking amount of DMS which I feel need to clarify this the number one way to tell if your cookies runts or jungle boys or any kind of pack is fake is to look at the coloring that is the number one way the best example of the throw on here I think there's two in particular that are always a really easy way to tell we're gonna use cookies as our first example here we're gonna use the gelati and the sticky buns bags now you look at sticky buns in gelati right the colors are very vibrant the legitimate bags the colors are super vibrant popping gelati in particular it's a different color for each letter of the word right super vibrant colors and you guys have to remember that with all of these weed companies with all of these legitimate real-deal packaging's right the colors are always really gonna stand out the colors are gonna pop like crazy like it's meant to draw your tension in right so they're gonna use high quality coloring high quality printing on the real bags on the fake ones now the reason I use sticky bouncing gelotti's because it's so easy to tell with these to write the colors always come out faded or dim and worst case scenario they're not even the same shade right but essentially every time when you're buying these fake bags you have to realize they're printing these in a lower resolution right they are printing these with very like just worse material worse quality then the real brands are using right and that's gonna reflect in the print right and the best way to look is just honestly even go online right go on if you guys live in Cali you know go on the cookies website and look at some of their information on there or watch youtube videos where people have some real packaging and do a compare and contrast and you'll note it's almost right off the bat that the colors are [ __ ] I mean even from the images that I've thrown on screen in the past couple minutes here you guys should be able to tell in my side-by-sides that yeah it's it's a pretty blatant Lorde particularly the sticky buns and I I did my research here pretty much every single print of the fake sticky buns I could find had this [ __ ] coloring right and all of them do cereal milk is another really bad offender a cookie strain and then you move on to other brands right let's look at runts and jungle boys for a minute right runts is another one that is pretty obvious because runts their packaging is arguably even more vibrant and popping than cookies right their packaging is just color just Bank Bank BAM right and with them once again just look at the brightness in the contrast of those colors right look at the look at the resolution of the print actually look up close and see okay it is that resolution bad you know is it almost like blurry you know when you when you look at it real closely because you know if I were to take for example I've got a cookies bag on my shelf actually here if I take this bag and I look at I hold it really close to my eyes that text doesn't look like it's bad quality or blurry like I don't have to hold it far away from my face to read it as clearly as I could imagine right 20/20 I can hold it as close as I want and that text still looks great quality with a fake bag that will almost never be the case if you look very closely at the bag you'll notice like hey that image is kind of blurry right it's not looking good but moving on from comparing the bags like I said there the comparison in looking closely at that that kind of blurriness is the best way there's another one that people seem to look past quite often I don't know if people look past it or if they just don't give a [ __ ] but the second one here now this is how it is an Illinois right with every bag that I've gotten of cookies in the state of Illinois yeah cookies did recently come to Illinois it's a very new development but mine dispensary guided him for the first time like two months ago I think but either way with my bag it says resealable at the top right but there's a little like safety seal that you have to pull to actually open up the bag to make it then resealable right that's how the real bags are for example think of like a bag of beef jerky right you pull that you pull the little tab off the top little strip that you have to peel like a bag of cheese from the store right peel that little strip then you can open it and reseal it right it's the same thing with real cookies bags as far as I'm aware now correct me if I'm wrong in Cali but the Illinois bags which they are actually a little bit different from the Cali ones they are like that right and that's what I've seen from a lot of my friends who are in California too now I'm not up to date on packaging I know cookies changes their packaging a lot as do a lot of these other companies to try to outsmart the you know counterfeit so of course but as far as I'm aware that is a thing pretty much consistently on almost all of these bag companies right these companies that use bags instead of a glass container right these fake ones won't have that these fake ones you'll be able to just no safety thing to pull you know nothing to avoid it you'll be able to just yank it right the [ __ ] open right there will be no thing right there will be no thing to peel off that's like a safety thing typically bags will have that and some bags some real bags you'll be able to open without that I'm not saying all bags are like that but most bags will have something like that to indicate to you that it's already been opened if there isn't anything like that that is a huge red flag and you should really really look closer at that bag but moving on from ways to tell it apart from being real or fake let's talk about the real problem with these kinds of things the biggest problem that I have with these fake cookies fake runs fake exotic fake cally packs is that half the time the weed that people are putting in these isn't even bad that's the thing with a lot of these other fake branded things like edibles or concentrates a lot of times it's bunk or it's fake but what I seem to be noticing is a common trend is whenever people put the weed in these bags it's actually pretty decent right it's not it's not always swag and by the way a little tip here I've gotten a shocking amount of UK viewers European viewers who are sending in cookies bags and runts bags I hate to break it to you if you don't live in America you're not smoking cookies I'd nobody is [ __ ] importing the Gary Payton to the UK all right nobody's taking the gelati and shipping it on a boat past customs over to UK all right I hate to break it to you nobody's doing that for a bunch of eighths all right I just I hate to break your heart right but either Webb back on topic you're only UK viewers put the cookies back down right now throw the bag away take the weed out of its decent but back on topic here a lot of the bud that these people are putting into these bags is not bad and that's my problem see back in high school when I first started smoking it was never like this there was no fake Cali bags there was just like carts were just hitting the market in Illinois when I I like was starting smoking right like like carts were just starting to become a thing in Illinois as far as I remember like nobody was hitting them right like like I got lucky and got one early on when I was younger in high school right but like nobody was [ __ ] hitting them and all of a sudden as times gone on right as times progressed these fake bags have become a thing and I miss the good old days when you could just go to the plug and you can just get that bass that gas right out of the plastic bag I don't know I just had passed I'm baked as [ __ ] dude that's like a fat dab of some mag landrace dude I'm like I'm tweaking right now but either way back on topic here so I I just I miss being able to go to the plug and know that I'm getting the best [ __ ] he has straight out the bag right nowadays it's difficult to find a plug that isn't sound this kind of [ __ ] an a in bet here come all the [ __ ] heroes of cannabis who are gonna come in the comments like Mary a goblin huh makes me laugh that you don't have a plug my plug hundred pounds of Kali Zaza ten dollars right hey keep that [ __ ] out of the comments but really it's become a lot harder for the average smoker to find a plug that isn't selling these [ __ ] bags whereas if four years ago that same plug was probably selling that same weed but for a better price and out of a plastic bag like it should have been done and that's my biggest problem here and I want to make this little segment of the video here a call to action all the plugs out there everyone cuz listen this is the Goblin viewer vase okay if you guys are gonna sit here and act like you're not drug dealers you're wrong I know a good chunk you guys sell drugs right so I'm gonna lay it out right now all you plugs out there sell your weed out the bag don't sell it out of the fake [ __ ] sell it right out of that vacuum seal right out of that ziplock dude sell it the old classic way scale it out put it in a plastic baggie give it to your cost to you don't prepackaged this [ __ ] dude and harass and shame other plugs who do cyberbully them if you see a plug selling this [ __ ] swipe up on his story and say damn dude I didn't know you sold schwag in a bag nice bro just absolutely ruin his [ __ ] day because listen the plugs you sell this kind of [ __ ] they always have like egos about their bud they're always like man I'm selling real Cali all the rest of y'all are selling fake so if you guys just [ __ ] cyberbully I'm a little bit and tell them it's swag in a [ __ ] bag they're gonna lose their marbles I guarantee it it's gonna be content for everybody so chat not I'm so used to streaming dude I said chat Jesus Christ ladies and gentlemen the comments section harass your plug selling these fake bags and remember two important takeaways from this video 1 get your bags from a dispo there's no real reason that anyone would ever sell an authentic cookies bag on the street and 2 if you really are in the position to buy one of these if you're in the position where this is your best option before you give that plug money ask him to take it out of the bag and sell it to you for a real price because I guarantee the plug might even respect that a little bit a I'm not trying to get y'all killed out there but hey I've had I've had experiences where I've had bad times with plugs and I'll hit them back up and I'll be like you know do you just serve me some bunk and a lot of times sometimes I'll be like oh my bad and they want to keep you as a customer right so be like oh [ __ ] they'll understand a smart plug will realize oh this guy knows what he's talking about he's gonna be a comeback customer because he's an experienced right but a dumb plug would be like I'll [ __ ] you so a give that a little try that's my recommendation but ladies and gentlemen hope you guys enjoyed this video hope you guys got some information out of this that you might not have known before thank you guys for watching drop a like oh and also don't forget to cop merch if you haven't already ladies and gentlemen do not forget make an investment link to the top description hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did and

right here and we're done all right [Music]", "UPXndTLevVw": "good day cherry blossom family this is derek i'm back with today's monday minute um let me kind of talk about what's on our minds this week or what kind of questions we've been asked um and i'll kind of touch on something let me give some sort of like a point of clarification i guess so a lot of people ask us or or have questions about like hemp and cannabis being the same thing well you sell cannabis like no in a way i do in a way yeah but what i really sell is hemp based products where we sell our products uh based on hemp extractions um full spectrum hemp extracts that have been mixed with or blended with other natural ingredients to create a full spectrum nutraceutical supplement that you sometime are used topically some are used orally some are used sublingually and we may be coming up with some that you may even use intranasally so i guess what what i'm trying to say here is that there are there is one family of plants with a couple of different species under a certain genes i'm not going to get too too technical nor should i but basically we'll just keep it to a family of plants and the cannabis family of plants that includes uh hemp that includes uh what we traditionally call marijuana which is higher in thc it also includes hops believe it or not and if you think about what uh yes we do trying to get some sort of relief relaxation uh you know recreation out of those products but they can also be very medicinal now the point of me saying this is that i i guess what we're trying to achieve here is some sort of different the difference in people's heads about what these plants are so even even though they're in the same plant family even in the same genus that doesn't necessarily mean that they perform the same way or do the same things so i use this as an example um oftentimes what i'll say is that you understand the citrus family there's there's oranges there's limes there's pomelos um there's lemons and we don't always use those in the same way they don't look the same way they don't taste the same way it's like in our kitchens they don't perform the same way we have other families that are like legumes which are peas beans black eyed peas peanuts they're all part of the same botanical family um basilica it's like broccoli cauliflower cabbage kale all part of the same botanical family uh onions garlic shallots chives all part of the same botanical family but you don't use them in the same way you don't you know sometimes you might use them together but oftentimes using it separately for different reasons um nightshade families so there's tomatoes eggplant peppers tomatillos similar and sometimes they are used together it's funny because some of these plants are in the same families are often cooked together you know but they are definitely different independent or individual um plants and fruit of their of their own and they also perform different functions and we just want you to know that hip is the exact same thing it's just because it's related to marijuana doesn't mean it's going to get you high it doesn't mean you're going to have psychological effects it doesn't mean that you're going to get all paranoid um you know i know that we've probably all had some experiences with this in the past um you know we've all most of us experimented in some sort when we were teenagers or in our 20s and maybe even walked away with a bad experience it's not good or bad what have you you know but what we're talking about is one plant is more for recreation and the other plant is more for medicinal uses or everyday [Music] lifestyle uses so don't unless you of course read your labels but unless you're concerned about failing a drug test because you have trace amounts of thc and even then you're not going to get high like it doesn't necessarily mean that you know you're taking drugs that you need to you know go and confess or your whatever you think that may be happening what you're really doing is just taking a supplement that has been provided by nature and it happens to look a lot like something that we have been mislabeling and misinforming about for about 100 years so if you have any questions you'd be more than happy to answer these questions um we definitely want to put some into some of this confusion so please send us a comment you can text us uh or excuse me and message us here uh on this medium or you can send us something in info cherryblossomcbd.com you can send a website submission we will be perfectly you're more than happy to answer your questions but we just want you know there are differences between him and traditional marijuana and do not let those differences keep you from moving forward something that you think can help you that's it that's the monday minute for today a little bit long but thank you for joining", "6ugF-igwm6M": "[Music] again jeremy with superior hemp plums north carolina farms in indian trail north carolina coming to you today to talk a little bit about why you as a hemp farmer or hemp grower should have a buyer lined up and when we say buyer we mean where is your product going when you're finished with it and it's going to be out of your hands i guess the number one reason and this may sound silly and you would think you go without saying but you want to make money right i mean that's why you grow any crop is to be successful without a buyer lined up you're not growing you're gambling just like we've said in other videos don't put any more money into him than you can afford to lose altogether but you're setting yourself up for failure if you don't have a buyer lined up well early in your game when you come to us to to discuss buying him we talk to you on the phone when you come in and sit down we talk about all this we're going to ask you several questions you know we're going to ask what's your business plan when we ask what your business plan is we're wanting to know what are your growing plans what size grow are you looking to do are you going to grow this indoor you can grow this outdoor what product are you looking to grow or are you going to grow cbd or cvg are you going to grow 25 percent of one variety 25 percent of another and 50 of another are you going to go all in on one variety what's that what's that plan but at the end of your business plan or somewhere there towards the end hopefully would be who is your buyer and that's you know one of the most prevalent questions that we're going to ask not that it's any of our business not that we're going to try to reach out to your buyer we don't necessarily even need to know the name or the specifics but we want to know that you've got a buyer lined up too many cases this year across the country several with customers of our home folks had a successful growth they grew a great product then the dreaded question what am i going to do with all this stuff whether it's smokeable flour whether it's a ton of biomass it's it's no good sitting in your garage or in your shed or in your barn it needs to be at a processing plant or in the hands of the empire as soon as you can do that after harvest the call i dread the most and unfortunately i have taken more of them than i'd like to is hey jeremy this is so-and-so do you know where i can sell all this flour i've got in my shed or all this biomass i've got out in my barn and the unfortunate answer that i have to give all of them is unless there's been some miracle that day and i've received a call from somebody who's looking for it the answer is no don't i certainly try to help we have this year jumped on several facebook groups we've tried to not necessarily market any of our customers product but we would certainly go the extra mile to try to put feelers out there without feeling like we're in the middle of being a broker to sell products because that's not what we do i can't stress enough that if you're going to grow hemp it's not just you know if you're going to grow any product that you have a buyer know what you're going to do with that product or if you don't need a buyer lined up if you're going to grow it for your own testing purposes or your own research or your own use that's that's your business that's not the case with uh probably 95 percent of the folks that are getting into this industry you're doing it to turn a profit understandably again have a buyer find a buyer know your buyer trust your buyer you'll be okay but it's all said done thanks call us anytime 704-776-9222 [Music] [Music] you", "prOXM65HmIY":

up everyone? Caleb here with Hemp Daddy's Therapeutics. And I'm here today to\nanswer one of the questions I get asked the most, and it's Does CBD make you high? And how does it make you feel? This is one of the\nnumber one search queries in Google that lands\npeople on our website, so I know a lot of you are answering it so I thought I'd do a\nlittle YouTube video on it. But before we get started, we gotta talk about what the\ndifference in THC and CBD is. So, THC is the component of\nthe plant that gets you high. CBD is a whole 'nother\ncomponent of the plant. It's another cannabinoid. So, the cannabis plant, hemp as well, has a whole array of cannabinoids. All of them have medicinal\nand therapeutic benefits. CBD being the number one\nmedicinal and therapeutic benefit out of all of the cannabinoids. That's why all these\ncompanies are isolating CBD. One of the things you're\ngonna start seeing here in the future is people isolating other\nthings like CBC and CBG. Because they all have unique medicinal and therapeutic benefits. So THC, on the other hand, is the component that is responsible for getting you high. But it does also have therapeutic benefits such as reducing the size of tumors and helping with pain management as well. But CBD, on the other hand, it's got all those medicinal\nand therapeutic benefits and many, many more, but there's no high associated with it. So if you have, whatever it is, whether it's a moral issue, or you just don't like\nthe feeling of being high, like CBD will not get you high. There's no chance of it at all. You could probably drink an entire bottle and not even get high. You know, don't go out and try that, I'm not advocating that at all. But because there's so much CBD to THC, like basically CBD counteracts the psychoactive effects of THC. So, let's say you smoked a joint, for say, if you did that along with a dose of CBD, you're not gonna feel as high as you would if you just took THC alone. So CBD has no psychoactive effects, so there's not risk of\ngetting high with CBD. It just has all the medicinal\nand therapeutic benefits. So let's talk about how it makes you feel. So, basically, it just\nmakes you feel good. So, I kinda relate it to a runner's high. When you get that flood of endorphins and you just feel great,\nyou feel positive, you're completely lucid, your\nmind is in the right place. It's kind of the same as CBD. And honestly, it kinda\nbecomes like your new normal. So let's say you take\nCBD for the first time, you're probably gonna\nreally feel the effects. But after you've been\ntaking it for a full month, you're not gonna notice\nthe effects as much even though they're still there, it just becomes the new normal. Like, you start feeling better. So if struggle with stress,\nor anxiety, or depression, like those things can\nreally benefit from CBD. And so, if you just wanna take CBD just to relax at the end of the day, to wind down, to sleep better, CBD is great for these things. You'll feel nothing but positive benefits. There's no negative side effects. You're not gonna feel tired and drowsy just because you took CBD. So basically, CBD works by\ncalming your mind, that's, so when I say it helps with sleep, it helps with sleep by calming your mind. So if you're the type of person whose mind is always racing when you go to bed and you\nhave a hard time sleeping, CBD is gonna help with that. But if you take CBD during the day, it's not gonna make you sleepy, so don't worry about that. And again, CBD does not\nmake you high whatsoever. It's the THC that gets you high. So if you're taking CBD oil, if it's a full spectrum,\nor a broad spectrum, it doesn't matter, there's not gonna be enough THC content in order to get you high, so consume CBD and you're\ngonna get all of these positive and great benefits with no risk of getting high.
