{"f9L31udeTMQ": "[Music] I woke up today said I wanna be a star walking down the straight into a [ __ ] hello got another good sheep here it's time I'll be doing the Applejack I believe it is a hybrid 87% see they're saying how to do some of the open and stuff just so it could make sense and a whole bunch of other things I just do not have time to do right now there it is so what tip applejack really appreciate the build quality at least how it feels I'll be putting it on this fight for the green apples nice be going you crazy miss [Applause] but I must pretty late harder than most parts I'm gonna start very disability and the low temperature most usually does happen and I like busting out the terpenes in a way if I raise it slightly not too much to wear brush okay there's some apple tart mister I wonder if it's you know Apple and then maybe the Jack to say Jack Herer that's good I feel that in my face I go ahead bill called it everything I recognize we have is displace them I did this really just wasn't happening that is a compromise we get from the dusty four times once room permits mountain to summon three in a row of three round bursts upgrading to intact oh I'm in my shop too little [ __ ] [Music]", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "oNFmWo_JMI4": "yo what the [ __ ] is up guys it's been a fat minute man i am back with another video what's up it's been it's been a fat ass minute since i

jack like you know the cereal apple jacks but anyways guys what the card looks like my plastic government warning all of that the gold stamp silver stamp the scratch me right here and we'll see what's up guys we'll see what's up with this with this one in the new boxes so how y'all doing anyways this is gonna be there's gonna be one more strain i gotta review after this one will be sour tangy that's the last one and now and i'm probably gonna redo the videos of the other big chiefs trains that i did but in the new boxes i might do that guys because i [ __ ] with big chief so much i might even buy me a big chief mask taking the plastic out always the quality big chief gotta have to see the seed sticker right here it's all taken out i'm gonna go ahead and open the box this with the card and so what's what inside it looks like that always gotta look like that to get out the little container i'll show you the cart and the apple jack's gonna be a sativa take the little top out big chief symbol at the bottom so i'm gonna screw that off take the little red top yes sir big chief applejack i've been waiting to do this one guys i haven't got applejack in a long time see if you can spot anybody see that's a bubble right there it's not moving it's staying still like a guard i like them dudes from london london them big ass [ __ ] black cats they stay still bro ca sticker all qualified

the elections man i just hope the i just hope somebody makes a change you know with all this [ __ ] going on around guys just trying to spray positive vibes i already did right here taste a little bit of bud nothing distinctive all right let's take a drink let's take a hard hit now applejack uh i got one more to review left and then that's it oh oh i don't really taste that much i don't really taste apple jacks but i do taste citrusiness i'll tell you that right now i guess i taste it's a little bit of citrusiness in there like no cap that's what i take this that's a little bit of taste that i got from this applejack damn it's already hitting me hard oh this [ __ ] is [ __ ] good i guess if i would have known uh applejack had been gas before because i've been too [ __ ] up but i've been smoking on [ __ ] for the longest i just knew applejack i just knew applejack would [ __ ] hit you really hard bro and i just hate it once i well i did hit the gorilla i did the gorilla glue right here i did hit it and [ __ ] before doing this review so yeah i think applejack's boosted up but now applejack's only packing up at 87. a total 87.4 percent and 9 thc 82.9 so it has 82.9 percent tac 33 cb uh wait point 33 cbd so it has some cbd in there so make you call 0.33 really ain't nothing but see if you got activity you gotta kick into this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire i like i like the little citrus in this you can tell the [ __ ] top that's [ __ ] light as hell this is stupid this is a tiva this is not indica guys big clouds all the time this [ __ ] is gas you see this off the hook with them applejack's good with terps in this one no cow i don't know if i was tripping back then if i didn't taste no chirps and the other apple jacks that i smelled from the other big the other old boxes but in these new boxes bro it's like they put a little bit more citrus in this and there's a little bit more chirps in there bro like that's crazy but nothing much taste a lot of flour like it's 60 i taste distill it too like about 35 and the citrus in this i taste 30 pretty good numbers for this card and the potency i'm gonna go ahead i'm gonna take a little few more hits and i'm gonna give you all the potency and [ __ ] but i'll give you all the flavors right now show y'all what this [ __ ] is all about we have the cali right there gotta say it's gotta say establish 2013 see if you can see that they all gotta have their ca sticker guys that's what they're supposed to look like like that under there but nothing much guys big chief been hitting the same it gets me high as [ __ ] the same [ __ ] high and i like that i like this big chief i said gorilla glue really fire gorilla glue super fire too it just has lower thc percentage than apple jack wait not even my wrong my back your glutes more potent than applejack that's crazy though applejack's hitting me right away but i've been high so applejack's just boosting it up giving me that sativa high bringing that bringing that [ __ ] up even more not [ __ ] with it guys well i guess i'm gonna go ahead and just have a little beer chill just [ __ ] enjoy the rest of the night wake up tomorrow go to work if i go to work tomorrow i don't know if i go to work tomorrow to be honest hopefully i do but as applejack's really hitting me hard as hell guys i'm already [ __ ] up out of my mind just look at that [ __ ] and i kind of jeweled a little bit bro this [ __ ] is too fire he's going to be in this video guys the potency is going to be a straight 9.5 like always stay [ __ ] let's stay [ __ ] safe peace", "hvcAM7yKzNY": "yo how is everyone doing today davon dad hit it back with another video in this video we're gonna be doing a cartridge review and I'm really excited for this review because this is that dang faith now I've been trying to get my hands on this for a while now and I finally found a dispensary with them this one is the Apple Jacks and here is the beautiful pen I'm gonna try to set you guys up here so you can see it better I mean there's some money it is really bugging [Music] there's a good golden color and it's completely completely full there are no bubbles there is no little little bottle bubble there's nothing and so this isn't don't be say there's no cartridge this part is that no it's not from a dispensary now on the back here this is the Apple Jacks one so on the back here it says Apple Jacks is the beautiful and popular hybrid classic jacket and white widow which I believe I both sativas white widow might be a sativa dominant hybrid but let's keeping this potent combination embodies the uplifted clarity of Joshua while applying a warm soothing relaxation to the body this stream works wonders for patients and consumers suffering from chronic or from chronic physical pain and nausea Applejack's aroma as you might guess is one of the sweet sliced apples with hints of skunk and earth so that's what it says on the back down on the side it says all organic no propylene glycol and then it has their little instagram database official account and then on the back here this is ninety point twenty-one percent THC Bush I can get you guys show that but the box is really dope it's like shiny and it pops out and you know it's really dope the oil is amazing so let's turn this bad boy on I've been making longer videos that I've wanted to so let's just get straight into this Apple Jacks from database let's go this closure just makes you want to just keep smoking it without stopping it's so smooth I don't really taste an Apple jobs per se I just taste kind of like that like a cinnamon cinnamon kind of Apple II taste and the hi is already kicking in you're feeling in my eyes I'm feeling in my head only on this cartridge is just not even moving like it's still completely ball good smoke very hard and I had the reason was out of the boxes because I did smoke a little bit took a couple habits before I had to go run some and and yeah so this thing now you can kind of see some little bubbles oh yeah gonna see the foil a little bit better there as you can see it's completely full this is probably after six seven hits let's make it seven right now I'm gonna try it on the lower setting for this battery because this is a three voltage battery now I'm gonna try to get a taste like it's so good it tastes clean like really stays really clean and to see cell cultures as well as you can see there and I'm hi man so [ __ ] I really like this cartridge that she's dispenser I went to they had a lot more of these day vape so if you want me to do more reviews on them leave a like and leave a comment down below the oven let's get it a mom but I'm really high about I get my head I can feel it and I can also feel a body high with it it's not all a head high it's

section down below but we each 500 subscribers so so i'm just i i want to go down and pick up a cart for you my cartridge for you guys i went to up north canada it's one of my favorite dispensaries in the world and the only dispensary i ever go to she beautifully wrapped this up all ready to go like a little happy meal and sir made me happy look at that smile what do i have in the bag what's in the bag what's in the bag no another big cheap extract 20 bucks sees a full gram dude 20 [ __ ] dollars total is 82 thc you guys zoom in alright is the camera focusing on that applejack [Music] big huge shout out to evelyn the bartender for hooking it up you guys say it and if you ever say that this big cheap is fake i'll show you the receipt right now and that's the little serial number here's a receipt right there for my big chief apple jack is it indica good for pain nausea perfect for me because my almost nauseous and stuff like that because i never drink enough water that's probably the reason why but let's unbox this bad boy and if you guys big chief don't have the [ __ ] um if you guys don't have this uh on the big chief don't [ __ ] smoke it throw it away throw it in the [ __ ] trash because that's not if you if you don't have that your product is [ __ ] absolutely fake and make sure you guys have that inside the box and they're still a silver sticker on the side so so you can have it so you guys know you're getting that authentic big chief but 500 subscribers so that means i'm gonna do five blinker hits for you guys so get ready for this banger i tried to um what did i try the last time for them i tried what was black water blueberry blackberry blackberry crystal tray this is another indica hybrid dominant so push and turn i like the safety little things the packaging is pretty nice the good little air bubble in there already but 30 percent of it is already in the coil and this thing is nasty thick it doesn't even move dude i had it upside down in my bag but with the blackberry kush and the bubble didn't even move one bit and i'm [ __ ] breaking it but i got the wood tip little dart i like the wood tip to make it extra more smoothing i like the metal cap to put on the bottoms make it more extra clear i mean for 18 bucks the or twenty dollars a full gram dude that's a [ __ ] steal i like what what legal shop is gonna show a full game if anything for twenty dollars dude [ __ ] that's where you gotta go to up north for the best deals on your product dude and this is well worth the banking bang for the buck man my pockets are kind of tight right now and i'm usually a big full-grain smoker i like the half grams only last many days so once that once i figured out i thought i didn't thought at least we'd be 20 like 22 23 dollars out of tax but only 20.76 at the tax that's [ __ ] insane if she recommended it she knows your [ __ ] so this is got it on there one two three one two three black on green for low temp dab i don't even prime it p prime without battery connected connect the cartridge to the battery inhale and start big chief so i guess that's how he's um supposed to start each cart you're supposed to inhale before i guess that cause priming it i'm not gonna pee here i'm just gonna just hit it on the spot dude so five blinker hits for 500 subscribers dude this [ __ ] game make sure you guys have the eighteen plus twenty one plus stuff they've spoken long dab with long vaping on this camera those nice and deep in your lungs because these are going straight to my straight into [ __ ] mine cheers uh [Music] holy [ __ ] i don't think that was a blinker hit holy [ __ ] dude this is way better than the [ __ ] bro and it's already [ __ ] that one hits already [Music] it made me cough and that's [ __ ] after the first [ __ ] too i didn't do a blinker here i don't think i did a blinker here so holy [ __ ] so i gotta do blinker hits for you guys for 500 subscribers and i'm gonna pick up some black water og daily from uh my friend ed and [ __ ] uh that shit's gonna be frosty i'm gonna roll blunt for you and smoke it for you so we're gonna have two videos for today big shout out to all you guys for just sticking with

nervous on the thinking hit five bigger hits for 500 subscribers touch wood uh to show that by this authentic big chief product locate the scratch sticks here behind the cartridge into the code on big cheap extract i'll probably do that too oh holy [ __ ] damn okay that's one hit dude i might have [ __ ] filmed it in the cup holy [ __ ] okay maybe like okay four more to go [ __ ] [ __ ] hit that with you hey holy [ __ ] i was drinking hit number two man i did three hits already but two thinker hits and that third hit is really really [ __ ] getting holy [ __ ] i do 500 [ __ ] subscribers man you get a [ __ ] huh 500 [ __ ] subscribers man 500 dude i don't mean i don't even have 500 followers on instagram i better have 500 friends on facebook and i know we promote my [ __ ] anywhere thank you guys thank you [ __ ] thank you i love you and stay big chiefy man 18 bucks or 20 bucks dude for a program that's going to [ __ ] and this applejack is really [ __ ] smacking her that the two bling hits to trust that one hit i did [ __ ] like right now to be honest with you i'm [ __ ] already at the um on this the oil i'm gonna give the thickness i'm gonna give the the oil i'm gonna give it i'm gonna give it a seven this honestly if you really want if your pockets are actually really tight man and you really are in the budget i highly recommend you pick up big cheese how are you doing i was running with the followers that um i really recommend you guys pick up big chiefs dude they're [ __ ] well worth the price dude and this is [ __ ] phenomenal man overall i'm gonna give this a seven the oil is a the oil i mean the the bubble is [ __ ] super thick dude air bubble on other currency the air bubble will go up instantly but but i don't get why it's so thick dude and for 20 bucks see that's [ __ ] that's like go honestly guys up north cannabis probably has the best deals in [ __ ] town like like hands down no [ __ ] um no [ __ ] anything dude that because from there like they were all gardens and the that coasters disney and all the other they're about reasonable to 40 bucks for that coast 40 dollars for this daisy 50 dollars for a [ __ ] um raw garden this overall my favorite dispensary it's got me being social right now and just talking is just rambling on not that was big thinking hit number three so there's two and uh two more blink hits get ready to get the [ __ ] up idea 500 [ __ ] subscribers man go ahead uh yeah so overall i'm gonna give this a seven and so far i'm just focused like it says i had to jump my ass not [ __ ] pull this kid [Music] [Music] i'm [ __ ] stuck dude you could tell this is like a good hitting indica or like a indica hybrid holy [ __ ] i have to be careful with this one i probably might pick up a the sour candy tomorrow man they put like 20 bucks dude the [ __ ] packaging is actually pretty darn like nice that was big hit number four so we're about to get hit to get the [ __ ] up idea dude this cart is honestly i can't get up with the price and it's [ __ ] smacking okay i am doing blinker hurts too but even then you gotta solve that first hit [ __ ] made me cough and [ __ ] i honestly dude i honestly think big cheap is a lot better than this piece of [ __ ] [ __ ] rope dude honestly rope step your [ __ ] game up yeah your cartridge and stuff is nice dude but i think i think that's what you're paying for you're paying for the quality of the air flow of the car you're not paying for the oil you're paying for this [ __ ] this piece of [ __ ] man you paint and for um the oil was [ __ ] garbage man i wouldn't recommend getting rolled yeah you just try but other than that it's [ __ ] garbage she's what i [ __ ] think about i can throw that piece of [ __ ] out of here hey no i shouldn't have thought cause the dogs went to go chase it come here coco oh yeah this big chief is [ __ ] put [ __ ] phenomenal holy [ __ ] i know that was gross i know we don't spit because i want to be gross in front of you

whatever with me and do you want to know about this new ion cbd uh applejack delta tc vape cart from ioncbd uh stick around i'll tell you a little bit more about that that's the company that i was telling you about um yesterday that i wanted to bring forward and talk to you guys about today if you'll like and subscribe to this video also uh stick around to the end i will tell you how you can get on a giveaway for uh delta farms vape card giveaway on christmas day giving one of these away flavor of your choice you guys can go to vapeful supply i'll put the link form down at the bottom take a look at them man and see what flavor you guys want because on christmas day when somebody wins this you're going to send me your address and i'm going to ask you what flavor you want and for barring that you can go to maple supply right now and use code whatever and they will give you 25 off on their 30 cards man these are primo carts uh they're the most poking cards i've found so far uh i don't think you'll find one any better if you do we'll put them to the pepsi challenge um so having said that uh somebody asked me you know i've actually had a couple questions and people ask me how i'd dose and uh how i you know what would i choose what i choose tinctures what i choose vapes uh stuff like that so i'm going to answer that question right here um i live week to week like everybody else and let's face it you know uh going to vape car route um tends to be a little bit cheaper in the long run for vape cards but my normal um i've done a lot of things in my life you know i spent a lot of time in the army and whatever guy um so i kind of beat my body up i'm i'm 48 years old um i'm six foot tall probably i range between 200 and 220 pounds i'm in pretty good shape um i can work uh i can work with the best of them i can still put you know some of your young bucks in the dirt and if i don't put you in the dirt at the end of the day you're gonna you're gonna give me some respect um so so i don't mess around um so but you know coming you know the cost of that comes a little bit of pain and i carry around a little bit of pain every day um we can sink back their pain levels whatever cases but you know everybody's pain levels different and i may be a [ __ ] or maybe compared to you or i may you know my pain level may be higher but whatever it is whatever my pain level is i've got pain and and most people do um so what i normally do is what i like to do is if i if i've got the money to do it um i like to take attention first thing in the morning the way i do that is i'll get up in the morning first thing i'll take probably about if it's a 25 milligram for a full dropper i'll take about three quarters of the dropper first thing in the morning and then i'll do my you know uh ablutions and then i'll come back and i'll take the other quarter about 15 to 20 minutes later and that seems to kick it in a little bit quicker for me what i found is when i use a tincture a lot of times is i'll forget all about the vape cart for about three or four hours um and then about the 34th hour what will happen is i'll end up dosing this um you know one two three times an hour maybe you know until i hit about six eight hour mark and then i might dose another one again and then i'm good for a while um if i have to go with one or the other and i don't have the money i'm going with the bait simply because i get uh immediate relief right then um with the tincture is something i know in the long run is better off for me um and i know that it's uh you know cost wise it's probably better but for some reason i just i gravitate back to the babe um but hitting this first thing in the morning it makes me forget all about this for a few hours um sometimes i'll hit it out of habit if it's sitting in front of me but i found that i don't even need this if i hit the signature um and then you know four hours into it i might hit this just a little bit um until i uh it's sparingly until i until i decide to hit another one of these doses okay so moving on from that um the slow stuff so yesterday i told you i went to um pensacola florida uh somebody put me on cbd i'd actually gone on um facebook messenger and hit these people up find out what their address was the symptoms of coal on creighton road you guys check them out um so they claim to be northwest florida's oldest or first uh cbd store and so i'm kind of surprised they haven't heard about them um and that's probably because they you know i mostly deal with delta a products and you know marijuana um having said that um so i take off and go down there yesterday i leave about four thirty five in the morning my girlfriend's got an appointment at i think uh eleven o'clock um at a dentist and my plan is to go down there and and to uh take her to this dentist appointment not just because she needs to go you know who needs to probably need to ride at the dentist's appointment but because i want to get a picture of her with that slight jaw they know they can't turn inside so i have something pickled her about from now on but i didn't get a chance to do that because i had texted her on the way down there i left about you know 5 36 in the morning piddling around dirt roads on the way there and i hit her up and i asked her could she be ready to go by nine because i figured i you know they opened a 10 in pensacola i could get there from her place and then get her back to her appointment at 11 and she said to be pushing it so i ended up going straight to pensacola so i take my old truck i go down to pensacola i get to this place i end up getting there about 40 minutes early i'm texting the guy back and forth i don't know it's a guy by the way at the time i'm texting on this uh the facebook messenger and so i'm waiting in the parking lot finally a lady gets there really really nice lady gets there and i go in the store and i tell this lady sell this [ __ ] to me and she does man and she gives this [ __ ] to me blood raw gives it to me the way i wanted no jaw jack around no messy ass [ __ ] she just she told me what i wanted to hear and she sold me that delta a day card okay so i leave out i get the vape car to go out and i and i get to my truck and the first thing i do is like now on the way out there's a couple in there and um uh they're a young couple they're uh i'm talking to them about my my youtube channel and stuff so i leave there and i go out to the truck first thing i do is screw the pillow and i hit it and i'm like wow i'm getting this pretty good pin man and so hit my truck damn thing won't crank up so go back inside and i you know say hey i need to jump or whatever so a young couple they're from bat louise uh baton rouge louisiana and they're they're living in pensacola uh really cool dude and a really cool uh girlfriend he's got man uh she had pink toenails but uh just she painted her toenails pink but they jumped me off man and i had a really nice conversation with those folks man they were really good folks um so the customers you know the type of customers that go into that place are great too um having said that let me tell you something folks there's there's a few key things about this part that uh that i found out i'm i really was hesitant you know how you like you find something that's like really cool when you want to kind of keep to yourself but you know you don't want nobody else to find out about it but at the same time it's not fair so check this out all right i get this cart yesterday this cart was 45 okay this card is so new this car came

pensacola florida at about uh 10 10 30 in the morning okay and i vaped this cart while i was driving all the way to atmore alabama and this when you get carts they're usually like there's usually a

i have very little time in my life between homeschooling my six kids my business my blog i'm pretty busy so to get a video put together it doesn't take a whole lot of time just a whole lot of forethought and planning so i'm excited to share this recipe with you using one of my favorite fruits [Music] apples are one of the most versatile fruits there are you can make all sorts of desserts and even dishes for dinner but basically i go crazy at fall time with apple crisp you've got apple pie applesauce caramel apples i really could go on with all the different desserts one of my favorite because it's near and dear to my heart it's a recipe my grandmother called applejack she's my little bopty from poland who was a spitfire i called her the energizer bunny because she never stopped and really an amazing woman i missed dearly my mom has adapted this recipe to suit her a little bit and i'm going to add my own little quirks here and there now mainly we are a family who don't consume grains and what i mean by that is we prefer not the processed foods and so on some of us in our family at least one of my daughters can't really consume greens she can tolerate it we've worked really hard and she can get through that but it's just not a good idea for her and if we do consume greens and then we do eat them they are usually soaked fermented and processed in a way that make it healthy for our bodies to be able to absorb them because the grains that we eat in our modern day diet are not what our ancestors hate so with that i'm going to do this recipe as much as clean as i can using the ingredients that are my ancient recipe here this is notebook paper i probably wrote this in high school stained and tattered but still good to go and i will try to work on in the future a grain free gluten-free version of this so that those of you that love to have this kind of thing too and have to miss out can enjoy it as well i just haven't played with it yet alright so i'm going to flip the camera around let's get started this is simple applejack or you could call it applebars you can take a spin on this however you like and i'll explain what i'm changing and why all right let's have fun we've got our ingredients here the one thing i didn't photograph or picture was a bit of milk you're going to be needing that as well you could probably use a substitute i've never done it so i wouldn't know without trying but maybe coconut milk or almond milk or something like that if you have dairy issues but of course then you gotta substitute butter the original recipe called for crisco that is not something i would consume i would say lard would be the ultimate healthy fat for you totally great for your system for your brain next best is a whole butter we get this from a local dairy here really wonderful look at the color of that you just can't beat that but anyway that that is what makes this super tasty we're just going to take our flour and this is unbleached white flour not your common store-bought flour we'll get your unbleached a little bit better for you there and we're going to add our teaspoon of salt mix it in and sifted flour is good so do that get rid of any lumps i'm going to set that aside for a second then i'm going to take a measuring cup and i'm going to separate my egg i'm going to keep the white over here and put the yolk in there okay and this is where the milk comes in we drink a raw milk from a local farmer that we have a herd chair in and we want to add enough liquid that would make this equal 3 4 cup when we get that local milk we get the cream we make raw milk ice cream you want to talk about tasty wow we're going to whisk it all together and then we're going to add our liquids in and mix that up [Music] [Music] now we're going to cut in our butter [Music] so [Music] get it to a good consistency kind of gets where you can knead it we're going to separate half of it roll out half and you'll need a cookie sheet with an edge to it we're going to roll it out and place it in there almost like making a pie okay we have half our dough bowl we're gonna just go ahead and flour surface and flour our pen my surface is clean and we're aiming to line a cookie sheet here like i said that has a lip on it and make enough for the bottom as well as up the edge like you're lining a pie pan [Music] you want to keep it flour but not too far that you dry out your dough [Applause] okay the way we check is you just set your pan over kind of see if you got it i sometimes get it right on sometimes not she can always patch um it's the bottom crust nobody's gonna see it nobody's gonna analyze i'm not definitely a pastry chef but we roll it up on our pin i hope that we get the first draw here reposition a little bit i have it too long on the one side and just like a pie you're going to trim this off and i'm going to take those remnants and patch this is a bigger crust than the top layer so you can even glean a little bit from that other ball if you needed to [Music] [Music] i'm sure many of you seen a contraption like this i've even seen people hook up a drill to this part totally awesome i really don't feel like having one fly off at this point so i'm gonna keep it simple my little apple peeler corer and i've got eight to ten apples i'm gonna do i usually go for more not bad considering this thing's probably about 10 years old so definitely got what we need here i don't mind leaving a little skin though i try not to because they're usually the most toxic part of the apple unfortunately unless you can find an organic farm but got these and what i like to do is just have it and i throw it in my bowl get the rest on these are granny smiths they have that tart tangy taste that we like good for baking [Music] okay we're on to the last steps here we've got our apples all sliced up ready to go thanks to our apple peeler corer we're going to add our cinnamon and our sugars and that's something else i changed as well instead of using your basic white sugar in our family we prefer to use either rapidura cane sugar or an organic palm sugar there's different sugars that do better things for you if you're going to consume them so sugar is sugar it is what it is you could use honey or syrup if you have glycemic issues but definitely skip the white sugar and go healthier that'll be better for you all right let's mix this up and then we'll put it in and put on our top crust [Music] it will look mounded at first but just like any pie once it cooks down it'll definitely flatten out a little bit so just try to spread it as evenly as possible filling up those corners nooks and crannies now we're going to roll out our top crust and when you do that honestly you could have fun with it punch out shapes you could do what my grandma used to do which is a pretty lattice top you could just do a basic pie crust top if you're cut for time so have fun [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] i went for a basic pie crust top because i like the rustic appeal of it and it's faster and i'm running out of time here we have our egg white left we're going to whisk this up a bit and then just do the egg wash on top like you would see on any other pie again this is almost like a pie with it just a slight variation obviously a shape but it will set up nice and firm take your pastry brush and give it a good glazing then we'll throw it in the oven again i have links to all the products i've been using down below full recipe over on my blog with all the other recipes that i share there as well i invite you to come check out also if you want to add a little bit of sugar on top this is a bit of cane sugar organic cane sugar just for that little sparkle [Music] here we go we have our delicious apple jack it is still pretty warm right now it's gotta cool i'll be cutting it up showing you what it looks like plated but man if you could smell if we had smell-o-vision you could smell

well things are going so well flim and flam gave me a promotion just made my first bid as a sales pony no more costumes for this Pony this is more of a uniform if you say so I used to wonder if I was doing the right thing you know pretending to be cured basically lying to folks about this tonic but thanks to you I realized that sometimes honesty isn't the best policy thanks to me curative tonic my granny can do anything just ask Applejack [Music] no this has gotta stop if ponies keep believing that tonic can do things it can't who knows what will happen maybe something like that [Music] granny what lazes does she think she's doing Grammy's gonna break the Equestria ha Gavin record hole and Sykes [Music] [Music] what in tarnation did you do that for that was the most fool Pony thing I've ever seen anypony to in all my life you can't do a dive like that No quit your farting I hate enough Tony to do a dive ten times as high 20 times by my account 30 with a favorable breeze [Music] I hate to disappoint everypony but there's no way granny could have made that dive because this tonic is a fake but you gave it your stamp of approval are you saying you lied I am oh I didn't mean to but everypony seemed so much happier I couldn't bring myself to tell you when I found out the tonic wasn't real I know it was wrong I just hope with time I can win back every ponies trust but if the tonic is a fake then how come granny can swim again and what about all that aqua bag stuff we just did I reckon sometimes you can forget what you're capable of and it just takes a little extra confidence to remember that it was inside of you all along", "dZa5WBUqm8M": "I hate to say I told you so Applejack you and I both know you don't hate to say anything well I've always thought that the most important thing opponent can do is say exactly what's on his mind to anypony who listen so everypony everywhere always knows everything you're thinking hey you don't ever have to listen to any Pony else what exactly [Music] [Applause] partner the cider rich take a look at what I did last night after we made our deal pretty great huh the thing is I don't think I can get you ready what what I did all this work on your say-so we shook loose and everything well you see it's sweet Apple acres we've always been about quality and well your basic jam jar yes it's been a tough harvest this year what with all the blight Oh sounds to me like you're trying to make excuses we never plan to a dealt with Granny Smith she kept her word if you can't do that then maybe our families should stop doing business together Oh together now the thing is rich it ain't really up to us you see gran is sick wait gran is sick I had no idea yeah no Pony did what Big Mac means is we've been trying to keep it quiet don't want people to make rash decisions about doing business with sweet Apple acres just because we're a little short moved at the moment oh ma of course of course ah I'm so sorry please let me know if there's anything I can do much appreciated but right now we only ask for your understanding during this difficult time you are supposed to tell rich the simple truth but instead you made things worse where's on giant why what was I supposed to do you heard rich if I told him the truth he was gonna stop doing business with us all together but that's only because we had any old crumbles for this delicious-looking salad granny that was only because you made promises you couldn't eat but there's got to be a better way out of this mess than by making up some story about granny being sick well the work didn't it sorry to drop by unannounced we just wanted to come by to wish granny a speedy recovery look sis our good friend mr. rich and his fiancee are here oh and they brought flowers for granny on account of she's sick like you said ain't that sweet possible to say nothing can you go up to the bar black Sprayer in the orchard I know but if we forgot to spray her I don't want to get it before dark you go start counting and I'll tell Big Mac we'll be right back okay so from that moment on I took to refer to myself as big were large or Applejack your brother was just explaining why he always wears his yoke even though we asked him how your grand bear is doing oh yeah you know how big that can get to talking especially when he's upset and right now he's just as worried about Greenwich with his eye dear is she doing that bad well one thing's for sure she she shouldn't be seeing anypony right now in fact get more upset just thinking about it excuse me I just decided if I helped you it would go faster well you're too late all the spares are here oh good say granny where do you first fight the Apple bride again it was my second year of hearing holy real they was before I hear the rich on the one knee another say that's how the trees got to growing so tall but the mean is just how I got my cutie mark but we asked when we could come back to see granny Big Mac didn't want to be rude but you just can't see granny right now because she's got a flat bottom the trays got the blind yeah that's usually the case the doctors think it's from working in the orchard for so many years you see we had to take granny to Ponyville general we just got back wrap before you showed up oh ma it's not contagious is it I'm sure he'll be fine but you should leave just in case you're right we're gonna have to hurry if we want to get there before visiting hours are over that's right quick get where wow the hospital of course I'm sure we'll see you then [Music] Delon field orig the grannies in the hospital those made everything honored and worse what are we supposed to do", "8IzZmHlbJys": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] in everybody's life there's certain people they remember more when they're growing up than other people and I want to do a song for you now that I wrote about an old man that was very very special to me he was the best musician in all the Smoky Mountains he was a dirty old man he was not used to slip off and go see him whenever I could [Music] that's not what you think anyway he used to let me cuss he used to tell me dirty stories he used to let me chew tobacco you just let me smoke roll your owns and drink moonshine and we just sing away I was seven years old at the time and I used to go home hi I guess and mama thought I was sick for years and years she didn't know I was a happiest kid in the smoking man no but it's the truth it really did let us chew to back and smoke and all that but anyway he was a person very dear to me and he's only living in my memory and that's a special memory that I'd like to share with you tonight the memory of my good friend Applejack [Music] they live by the apple orchard in this little orchard shank his real name was Jackson Taylor but I called him up no Applejack was loved or sample Jack picked apples [Music] meow daddy last song for me and I'll say Applejack's just almost every day with said with drink Applejack that old Applejack and [Music] [Music] don't let your banjo that's when I was just a kid these memories sold Applejack I need to go which takes me back [Music] [Applause]", "wGsPh51K65M": "[Music] hey it's mad at roughhouse to use welcome to Canada basics today we're looking at the best Penn batteries for 510 THC or CBD cartridges this episode is sponsored by New York vape shop you can find all the devices use in this video at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with a code rough 2 with a growing trend of THC and CBD oil 510 thread cartridges out there you may find yourself in the dilemma of wondering which is the best kind of vaporizer battery to use for it there's almost as many types of devices as there are cartridges themselves we're gonna look at the stylist type the flat micro a variable voltage a mini compact as well as it box mod vaporizers [Music] first up is the stylist now the stylist is the most simple of all of them it doesn't have a power button does it have any controls or anything like that is air operated and it's just usually a simple stick with a 5-10 thread on one end they are compatible with most types of cartridges and are really really easy to use you just inhale and it automatically works just by inhaling through it the pros of a stylus are is they're simple to operate and usually like I said the most affordable the cons are you have very limited temperature options and usually they're small and they have a small battery capacity next up we have the micro or the flat style and you can see it's flatter it's not round like the other ones and it still has the 510 thread at the top and it fits most different types of cartridges one thing I like about these is that they're usually charging by USB and like I said they are adaptable with many different types of the cartridges pretty much any kind the difference between this and a stylus it does have a power button and many times not always but many times it also has multiple different power settings this is a Z steam cloud micro available at NY vape shop comm and it does have three different settings for temperature the pros are the micro Penzer they're affordably priced usually about 20 bucks for these they usually have micro USB charger rather than the the kind of you plug into the USB adapter they're very compact easy to hide a problem again is that they're usually small and have a small battery capacity next up we're gonna look at the variable voltage pin now much like the other ones this is a style like a pin style vaporizer but the big difference on this is that it has a variable voltage and usually this is at the bottom sometimes it's at the top though but usually at the bottom there's a little dial that you can use to set the voltage at different types and then you could use it for different temperatures different types of cartridges or just to get a different flavor intensity when you use the vaporizer these usually have a power button and rather than having multiple settings it's a variable control at the bottom the pros of these type are is that you can dial in the best voltage for your cartridge that you're using and you can use them with other types of add-ons as well - and usually they have stronger batteries than the other two smaller the cons are is that the height of it leaves the carts vulnerable and they're larger and they're less stealthy and can't really put them in your pocket as easily and this brings us to the compact style pin or them this is the actually of the Steam Cloud Mini 2.0 and these are like a side-by-side the cartridge actually goes down beside the battery they're USB charging usually and you can see that there's a little cut out there where the cartridge will go down into it they do require usually some sort of magnetic adapter that will help you adapt the cartridge and so it'll stick into the device when you stick it in there and they also require or they don't necessarily require but they work better with the cartridges that are a little bit longer and unless they have an adapter that actually extends it which some of them do I really like these kind because they're very pocket friendly the pros are that they're compact and stealthy and that insect connection it protects your cartridge because your cartridges handout in the device cons are it does require a magnetic adapter they're usually included but they're small and easy to lose and it's best suited for the longer cartridges as the small ones might get lost out inside and now we're going to look at the box mod you might consider the Box mod sort of the helicopter uh vaporizer pens it's a little bit more complicated most of the others it has a power button it also usually has a an up-and-down button to control the variable voltage it also has a compatibility with sub ohm tanks so you have a lot of vast compatibility here and you also have a lot of functions on these that you may not ever even need to use with a actual cartridge pin because they work with a lot of other kinds of add-ons and adapters and sub ohm tanks and such like that but they are so very effective for the cartridges they fit most 510 threads just fine and you can lower the voltage down to suit whatever kind of cartridge that you have in the device at the time I really like using the Box mod especially this one this is the steam cloud and it's the steam cloud box mod it's a lot smaller than some of the other ones it's very compact and really easy to use with these cartridges the pros and cons are the sizes 510 cartridges and sub ohm tanks it has most options for the power and resistance and different settings and it usually has the strongest batteries the cons are is that they are bigger and less stealthy although this is a small one and usually they're more expensive than the standard types of vaporizer pins so when it comes down to it it kind of depends on your needs if you really want simplicity and affordability one of the micro or the stylus is probably best for you if you like adaptability then you probably want to go with the variable voltage at the minimum I personally like these compact ones because they protect the actual cartridge itself and they're really really pocket friendly and stealthy and if you're a purist or if you really want to get the most bang for your buck you might want to get with the box mods and use it with lots of different devices if you want to pick up any of the devices that we use today be sure to check out NY vape shop comm

it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "89JUgSrkNdk": "what's up boy we're recording the video in the class why don't you

i'm blurring becoming something new i want to be happy with who i am what's up ladies and gents and if you're new to the channel my name is shaka zulu and i'm back here for another video guys so today guys um i really just wanted to get outside and i hate that you know that whole just sitting down in the same spot every time for a cart review so your boy has to get out nature because honestly when i do get my carts guys i go out and chill you know i don't necessarily just be smoking my carts at home all the time i like skateboarding and going out especially to this trail because this trail right here that i'm on guys and if you guys were in the live stream you know what trail i'm on uh this trail right here guys is literally in my neighborhood i can just ride my board like a few minutes and i'm on this trail so this is one of the dopest trails we've got it's right next to the freeway so i hope you guys can hear me um it might be a little windy but i think you guys can still hear me if anything i'll just have to make another car review sorry but um today guys uh we got a new strain and this is a new strain by legion of bloom uh again i got another legion of bloom this time i think some of you guys i showed you guys this but i just haven't tried it yet but um it's called apple fritter so it has 77 thc it is a hybrid guys it's a hybrid um and it's only a half gram so [Music] only a little half gram um just because i didn't see any full grams sorry gotta switch up the hands but um i didn't see any full gram guys so i just got a half gram um it has thc v cbn and cbg in it um and then you know obviously the thc uh delta nine and it's a live resin apparently triple refined cannabis oil and the the thing that i question about this and i hope legion of bloom can even tell me is this a real live resin because it does say live resin vape cartridge but under it it says california sauce so is it a distillate with you know cannabis derived herbs but this isn't even the cannabis derived terp line i don't think this isn't the monarch line so i'm not sure but hopefully someone can explain it to me and let me know if this is just derived herbs to make it taste like live resin or is this just a sauce cart it's not necessarily a live resin car let me know down in the comments down below guys shout out to everybody um for always watching the vlogs um it means so much that you guys check me out and see what your boys up to every day so that's pretty much what we're doing i got my board and let's [ __ ] open this [ __ ] sorry i might have to put my camera down [Music] so all right guys finally got it out open ready to go uh let's see what it tastes like huh so off jump um if you guys seen my last vlog uh i tried apple pie by friendly farms and the apple pie by friendly farms is just super big tastes like a straight up like live resin um it's just super dang guys and uh this time i got the apple fritter but it is legion of bloom but off the back the first hit it tastes slightly sweeter it definitely has a earthly taste to it you know what i'm saying but obvi it definitely has a little bit of a sweeter taste to it like it's not necessarily that that full earthiness you know what i mean but it tastes like it tastes pretty good let me see let me try one more time but it's definitely dank though definitely dank and it still has a little bit of the

mark resembles apples I can't tell what in the hey is that supposed to mean you have orange fur too but your cutie mark is oh well I can't even see it all I wanted to do is find some apple trees to test my magic on I've enhanced the roots of your apple trees with the potion that transformed them into orange trees in the process if you want your trees to be apple trees again then all you have to do is do the same to them using this Apple potion here I'm not doing it I should have had slaves who would have done that for me now that my experiment is a success my presence is no longer necessary here now then begone with you what in tarnation was that all about [Music] well I'm glad that's over with for a second there I thought that I'd be dreaming about angry oranges for the rest of my life

local ranchers Niall rates me all right who wants some delicious cider [Music]", "4AvISpz3z_E": "hey welcome to cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on using your 510 cartridges

thought I was working with ponyville's best athlete you are I'm okay really ha I have an idea watch this oh maybe not okay one more try I'm sure to get it this time [Music] [Music] you're welcome [Music] oh hey there young pony [Music]", "iNcCGMXn2bA": "[Music] we're here with bloom farms and we have some trinkets that you can smoke we here my man my somebody we live in a time right now we're portable vaporizers are in everybody's pocket why not add some style add some fashion add some class to it for every product that we sell we donate a meal to one of seven food banks in California Nevada well we've donated about 1.2 million meals over the past few years really we just try to bring awareness to it so that you can make it positive impact and I'm think you guys are doing a great job you know you got some of this for the host of the show a couple of these to take with me couple of these and y'all are doing good this year I'll tell you the truth the first one right here this is our high THC version we call this highlighter Plus this is about a 80% or more THC right next to it is our rose gold highlighter that's pretty it's pretty right yeah it's beautiful it's a it's a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio and then on the right side here we've got our highlighter uncrate special edition we only made a few thousand of these things a nice matte soft touch finish it's also a one-to-one CBD THC ratio [Music] that's clean give me some pricing so these are right around $100 a piece well I guess the show is the most expensive it's right sighs I'll pull up here how many how many how many pumps in this thing uh well it depends on how big a puffy take yeah so this is the most expensive is tech break and this would actually be smart the great way to check", "ajCmAbusdHw": "hey guys what's up its Keith Ville here with the CVD stored comm so what I want to show you today is how to take those old cartridges and basically just refill them okay so it's pretty simple now there's a few different cartridges out there so this one here let me just move my mic out of the way but this one here what you do is you just simply unscrew the top okay if you can see that so now what you do is there's a little rubber piece here and you're gonna pull that out and you just want to make sure that you don't lose this little rubber piece say see the hole at the top okay so now what you do is you just take your refill container and there's a mail that will just go right into the female there of the cartridge once you fill it up all three quarters of the way or you know just below the top just put that little rubber piece back in let's screw that on hand tight like that and there you go and you can refill these cartridges right now there's different ones there's also um this is a thicker 350 milligram CBD oil so this one here screws off as well but it basically the top doesn't screw it off it screws off on the bottom so on this one you're gonna fill this up to the line max okay because when you put this back in what this is going to do is gonna push that oil all the way to the top so if you fill that glass all the way to the top and you put that plunger back in you're going to I'm spill the oil all over the place okay so this is what it looks like when you have it unscrewed okay this is the other part of the cartridge okay this is the mouthpiece and you're just gonna put that back in like that and screw that in so these are great when you buy a few of these what you can do is just refill them okay so you don't have to throw these out and a lot of folks don't know that so again you just unscrew this here and again you see that plunger now you could actually clean this out if you have a particular flavor in here that you know you could actually just clean that out with a a simple brush to get all that out of there or just rinse it out with some hot water but that's it you just put that together like that and not many people realize that you can filled with cartridges pump okay guys so that's it hey this is Keith with the cvd store look for some more videos guides we've got some great new products we've got the um some bee's knees 1000 I'm sorry 1200 and 3,000 added to the site those are on force we have our new 1000 milligram vape oil that is on the site that's in 12 different flavors so check us out guys CBDs store.com and look for some more videos coming your way pretty soon thanks", "nqT_otOuUnM": "what's going on guys welcome to the deaf connection and today we're gonna be telling you the difference between real authentic and fake serial cards so before I even say anything about this I just want to say quickly about the company there's no like telling if this is even a legit company to begin with so there's like no information to be found on them online the only thing I did find was an Instagram account but it's private so you can't see anything at all and apart from that dang creeps show them a lot in their Instagram accounts so like if not every day every other day they'll be posting sharing cereal carts and a lot of people know cereal cars by 10 faves actually but with that being said because they're unknown if they're legit or an authentic company in the first place they could be fake overall but we're still not too sure and um we did encounter like this is a legit when a supposedly quote-unquote real one and we did get fake ones we knew we noticed right away so the first indicator to tell if they're fake was not packaging so check this out the one in the right is fake right this one's fake or this one's real this one's real the one that has oil in it or distal is fake and look maybe a little hard to see but if it's a little difficult to tell the one in the right has a lot more holograph like a holograph package to end appointing left doesn't at all so hey let me show you the back actually so you can see a little better yeah I don't know if you could tell from this video we look at that on the logo or says serial cards to see how the one in her eyes a lot more shinier than the left so that's a huge indicator right away both of these cartridges are plain looking like bland that you could say they have no shine or hologram to it whatsoever so that's the main indicator a another one is the coloring the packaging so if you take a look this one's actually a lot more lighter the cereal itself is a lot more lighter than this one like this one's a darker stronger color not darker but stronger color so just a really light faded go6 internet so scrunch one so with that with a packaging excuse me with the packaging you can tell that right away but you could also tell with the cartridge itself so the serial card stands beeps and all of those companies they use authentic cecil cartridges and this thing you can actually tell this um with this you could tell if they're fake with dankmemes c or any other cards that you see sell cartridges but okay let me show you and another thing the oil is a sometimes the oil will be really really dark or really light make a strong clear gold color it usually it it should always look like this actually like with these fake ones the oil looked exactly the same so and they're not like too dense to quality oh and i've had to tell you another thing to notice is the taste so the every single car should taste literally exactly the same as this whatever the strain is these ones didn't taste nothing like the cereal itself it just tastes like artificial chemicals and flavors and vapors pretty much it wasn't strong but it was it was a light taste too but it still don't say it's that good so another indicator to tell is if they're authentic cecil cartridges check to so it's a little hard to tell if you can see that this only says Cecil it's just say all three stems here I'll show an image right now but it's just say all three stamps the case stamp see so and a see a stem and apart from that they should all have a the same font style they shouldn't be a different different color and misplaced or different font sizes or anything like that they should look exactly like the one that shown an image right now so yeah those are the main indicators to tell there's legit or even if they are legit legit cereal carts so you know a lot of fake vendors are something a lot of Chinese manufacturers are selling these things so alright before I let you guys go I'm on let me just show you really quick how this hits well you can see anything I'm Trevor yeah not very sad anything at all but those smoke is really light another thing I realized with these fake off and not been sexy cell cartridges the atomizer is weak so I have one pointers I was actually collecting a lot of reclaim up here I switched the batteries to a stronger stronger battery and it didn't go away but yeah those are how to had identify the fake serial cards if you guys ever encountered these have any information about them at all please post them in the comments below I love hearing about this and hope to see you guys soon see you later guys", "XSFrzkVRPNY": "[Music] what's up guys simplisec here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another reaction video but this one's going to be on the clean cards not the fake carts you guys have been asking for a part four for a few months now you know and uh now that um for tuesdays i'm mainly gonna be doing reaction videos till i can stream again i wanted to do a clean cart one because one of the videos is actually picking up steam right now and if it's picking up steam might as well add another one because that that tells me that people are watching that and i know you guys have wanted this one as well and uh before i start this for any further the clean cards moderators i do not know any of them i don't give a [ __ ] about any of them uh because most of you guys say that they're mostly douche bags and stuff and like self-righteous in some ways but i would like to say that i am in no way affiliated with them it's just me reacting to their subreddit and uh just seeing what the legal cards are in the whole country you know what i'm saying i do have a card for this video you know i've been slacking with cards in terms of you know i'm making a fake cartridge video i don't even i'm not even smoking out of a cart this is actually the moonwalker brand uh video will be out in a few days but you know with these reaction videos i try to get these out the day that i record them that way you can follow along you know while i'm watching the video i guess but cheers for those of you who don't know this is delta eight it's called moonwalker the strain is called grape runts and honestly it's one of the better distillate cartridges that i've tried d8 or d9 it's just really flavorful now you do get a strong taste of grape if you guys are interested in this it will be in the comments below you can actually buy these in 38 states so shout out to moonwalker like i said videos on this product will be out in a few days but let's take another hit oh you can see the clearness in it that was bad so as usual with these reaction videos i like to post the comments from the previous video at least the best ones so here we go right now [Music] all right now that we're here let's just see what the clean card subreddit's been doing since uh since the last video right tnt extra expo in new york is this legit or did i waste 40 bucks [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] let's just let's just take a look at what people say use your account to rebound or another thing [Music] well if it last time made you sick and you bought another one come on come on well let's be honest washington state bans iso isomerized tse and recreational marijuana system what is isomerized oregon to limit use of delta eight tac and other artificially derived cannabinoids really this week's lineups from com can in millis massachusetts we get the pax error okay okay friendly farms terp hogs so this is clean cards guys so don't be expecting any like fake ass bougie cards just appearing i know there's probably going to be some because people are you know still going to be questioning what card they have if it's legit or not and uh most mostly on here you're gonna see legit [ __ ] and i'm interested to see what's legit in oregon washington colorado all that stuff so i feel like these videos they uh show shed light into that you know ever more dark safety but recently learned about reagents and leeches during isomerization and when i understand the only d8 that steak will be extracted from real cannabis to avoid these leftover cans and crusts however these are sold in dispensers possibly because of height delta 9. what method which method to make delta 8 is used to get a real clean stuff and not bathroom chems or is it all blue also i don't care about your favorite brand coa unless you got tests for reagents and bleaches i like you you get it from what i understand the only thing this is the case which method to make d8 it could be clean but they did a lot of lots of cleanup work after the synthesis but not real rn no one test enough for us consumers to know and worse every time so far that brand has been independently tested it variably turns out to be low potency and contaminated to be considered clean synthesized or hemp derived d8 must have safety tests for each and every of the following solvents metals pesticides microbes mycotoxins and reagents and bleaches block to prevent the chills from the dirty pizza from telling you to smoke their dirty deed so disturb spark or whatever i think i mentioned him in the last video he's one of the guys that a lot of people are saying is a douche bag in some sort of way and um he brought up some really good valid points you know obviously d8 has to be safe when it comes out from what i've tried from delta it seems like pretty good you know this is just some stuff maybe that they write to scare people honestly i don't know but uh it is some good stuff that they brought up because obviously you would want your delta eight stuff tested as much as your delta knight and i do see that um but speaking for myself the delta eight brands that i've tried delta eight hemp moon walker serene tree all pretty good i didn't taste any you know chemically ass taste or anything it was just you know some good old distillate and stuff um but then again distillate can be you know iffy as well you know you really can't tell um but just be safe you know just be aware of certain brands and just look out for your own health at the end of the day um like i said this this guy right here that brought up the d8 very good questions but uh i'm gonna have to say that the guy that responded is a moderator of this and he's been known to be like questionable you know what i'm saying like i don't know garlic cookies life hazard ross or live hash rosin cartridge clean pleasant trees that's a [ __ ] nice name liquid trite okay yeah this is only a half gram too it's probably worth so much we're selling for so much real or fake there's the flare right there it says fake and y'all i need help bought this from the weed man and i can't tell if it's there's no lighting and it came in a plastic bag came in a plastic bag come on can i post a picture of a few raw ground cards to help try and verify authenticity and see the community's minions 99.5 percent sure they are real from this message just am super skeptical about cards given my poor health but lemonade lemon pepper from cookies in there not bad yeah i don't [ __ ] with i don't [ __ ] with half gram cartridges or i mean i do but i don't [ __ ] with companies that only sell half gram questions i think that is some [ __ ] [ __ ] and i think that that's their way of saying hey i want your money and i want you to pay for less or get less from it so to be honest anything any company that's still to this day only half grams and are selling it for 60 to 70 for a half gram [ __ ] you washington dispensary anyone tried 30 a gram put in a card in the skittles tastes like grape soda with the hint of wine that's crazy this doesn't taste like great so this is delta eight as well and honestly this is one of the smoothest hitting cartridges that i've tried are none like for distillate usually i'm coughing well most of the time when i'm hitting this is plug play and those those pods and that battery they'd be hitting of course you'll be coughing but this is very a smooth this is a very smooth experience i believe moonwalker is also featured in high times too so i don't know if that brings you some sort of uh clarity but i mean it's it's high time right cheers all right where can i get this tested i know it's fake but i'm curious just about how just i'm just curious to how bad found it on my sister come on bro what the [ __ ] is this 1.1 like what stop solvent free 97 tac like what solvent free or solvent lists and there's a difference right i believe solvent free is no solvents in it at the end product solvent list is extracting without solvents so what that's at best is going to be distillate uh making my own cards terps plus delta e can i mix tears in delhi i want to buy from natural extractions so i've read something about we don't really know how much terpenes we're supposed to be in taking so it's not really good to mix terps homemade you know you don't know the right amount you're not a scientist you know what i'm saying and most of these guys on here aren't scientists as well they ain't going to be able to tell you how much terps and all that stuff to mix delta 8 with so just be careful with that do your research uh i recently just saw that article so it could be like some brand new study or something but it says something about not taking too much or too much terpenes might be a bad thing if uh paraphrase it oil forms around oils from local dispensary here in miami truly i think i've seen truly videos and they're from florida so that should be good i don't know uh the cartridge scene in florida so if if true leaves are fake then just be careful you know what i'm saying you eat raw garlic let's see peanut butter bread sauce never seen this [Music] looks okay that looks so lame with their instagram handle right there on that packaging it looks so crafty looks good west coast cars real or fake no comment i do have some west coast wax though actually no more but did i have some very popular in my state i mean you know a couple people with them obviously improvement there's no branding and everything do you think it's fine because they're getting high i'm not sure i'm just going to pass that anyone recognize this brand as a fake oh sorry it's fake live terpenes delta 9 thc distillate cartridge live terpenes huh not live rising terpenes just live terpenes how do you spot a fake delta eight disposable my buddy runs the smoke to tell me this but there's nothing but the paper and vaping inside come on bro getting from a smoke shop albeit there probably are some delta good delta 8 products and some smoke shops but are you willing to take that risk buying it no like when you can buy it online these people these are the type of people that want it right now they can't wait they can't wait to order online they want to go to a smoke shop and get it they want a little club and get it they want to go to their buddy and get it no patience on these guys really all i have access is to black market but dispensary or so can i put that rsl on but it's working possibly it was probably going to make your butt taste like [ __ ] i bought rso before and i thought it was just regular dab i thought hey you know in a syringe it it was black as [ __ ] i dabbed it it tasted like [ __ ] rso is for the medicinal side rso means rick simpson oil and i guess that's the guy who like popularized it or made it or so so uh you basically use it to to fix your ailments you know what you're smoking on tonight that is the yocan right i believe okay cleaner trash this brand from a local dealer there yet [Music] keep fake carts it's your plug okay i'm gonna end this like if you're getting it from the plug 99 of the chance it's fake you know there's maybe a one percent chance that plug can somehow get it from from the real [ __ ] but come on from the plug from snapchat like really that's gonna be end of this clean carts video hopefully you did enjoy this one i believe this is number four or so let me know in the comments if you did enjoy it let me know if you want a part five and uh like i said like when you comment and leave likes it it motivates me to do more of these and like i said i'm gonna try and get this out today today is tuesday tuesdays i usually go live but i'm thinking that since i'm not going live anymore maybe just do reaction videos on tuesday and maybe on friday as well but or rest it just depends on my mood i guess that day but hopefully you did enjoy this video uh like i said let me know if you want to part five and i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] so", "bkGog2nHO2w": "I didn't want to spend my life on the muddy

acting like a true Maine had a night in no time and how are you finding good old Maine Hatton oh it's simply divine very well said my dear although I must admit the city noise took some getting used to where I'm from nights are so quiet you seldom hear a peep until the Roosters wake you then what I say idea what in the world is a rooster what's he talking about I say don't look like a fool dinner is served thank goodness they in a city pony's hard work I'm so very activated I could do to do I wonder what we're to spit them baked McIntosh you're up to Huff it there Apple bucking their way through the Red Delicious trees Oh what I wouldn't give her just one bite I never felt so homesick in all my days as I did right then it was a nice a rainbow right back to home in that moment it all became clear I knew right then just as I was supposed to be I've been happily working the farm ever seen", "3qqP7SXaAVE": "hi tim here i just wanted to talk about one of the new cartridge products that we got called core pods this is the core pod hawaiian haze is the flavor of this one these are a little different than all the other cartridges that we carry and that they're not actually a cartridge they're a pod system so it's going to use a different type of battery than the standard c cell that the rest of our our cartridges use but i really like these they hit really well they have really good strains this one is hawaiian haze it has like a really nice smooth coconutty flavor really smooth hits really strong and it's from the brand core which if you tried any of our tiara grow flower it's the same same company that's making these core pods really high quality i just really like them be sure to make sure you have the right battery to go with them if you do get them but it's definitely worth the investment to get the battery because they're great great price great effect i really like", "xq4tmWQmcBU": "what's up guys welcome back to my channel hope you guys are all having a lady day if you are new here don't forget to smash that like button subscribe to the family i really need a name for you guys comment down below any suggestions you guys like would like to call us like what can we call us something cool my name is rocio what can match with rosie the only thing that comes up to my head is roosters and i don't wanna got you [ __ ] roosters because i don't even like [ __ ] chicken like actual chickens in real life the animals i'm scared of them enough of that though i'm gonna be reviewing this really pretty cartridge today look at it it's so [ __ ] pretty it's the new edition the new strain addition to roaf the strain is apple pie it's a hybrid and the packaging is definitely different than the other ones it's like a i don't want to say rose gold because it's more like on the pink side with some sparkles on it and then it has some gold as well i mean maybe you can just call it rose gold right but i don't really like apple pie but we're gonna see what this is all about this is a half gram and i'm really digging the packaging let me before i open it though let me go ahead and let you guys know how much thc percentage it does have and this contains this holds up to 88 i mean this has 88 oh look at that right when we open it the packaging is gold definitely different it has the rove what has the r right here for rogue which is [ __ ] sick i think i'm gonna keep this packaging just because of how pretty it is i really like like packaging that grabs my attention and this for sure grabbed my attention even the cartridge itself is so different i wish i would have brought one of the older ones to compare it but if i do i do have one at home i will be inserting it to show you guys the difference oh look at that it does have a big-ass air bubble though i think that was because i did have the cart in my car like upside down and also what i do know is that these usually come black i don't know it it came red this time which is pretty interesting and i just noticed this one says happy holidays how cute all right enough of that i'm pretty sure you guys want me to tell you guys how it tastes is it getting me high [Music] and let's talk about to blinkers get you more hmm are y'all fans of blinkers or nah personally i don't like taking blinkers every single hit that i'm taking out of a cartridge obviously i mean i don't know if anybody's out there like that but i feel like majority of us that do do blinkers we won't be doing it just for fun it's mostly like well we will do for fun but we'll only do it for like challenge wise i used to think for a while um when i was first smoking cartridges that inhaling it inhaling the smoke longer by just holding it until like there is no smoke to exhale was like much better and it would get me more high and i came i ended up doing some research and turns out it don't even get you more high the longer you hold your hit so there's no really reason for you to be doing that i connected it to my every let's go ahead and take it oh my god it tastes super super super good super super good i do have it on one of the lowest settings on every because i didn't want to see um i wanted to taste more of my cartridge and that tastes like apple pie i never tried apple pie but i feel like this is how apple pie would taste because i can taste the apple flavor but it don't taste bad god definitely i like the flavor i mentioned this i mentioned this the other day that i i haven't i have said that i like more um constituents on the terpene side but and i so i think i like strange that tastes sweet to me on the flavor side it's fun smoking them i'm gonna go ahead and change the setting to green i've got more clouds in the green setting i can still taste that flavor for sure but i for sure notice that i got more clouds right off that hand the thing i do i like about rope is that i feel like no matter how long of a hit i take or even just a hit in general because for all my cartridge smokers you all know there comes a point where cartridges just mess with your throat it like feels rough on your throat from smoking it so much but i feel like rove i've never had that problem with rope it's always such a smooth hip and their flavor um accuracy is on point like all the time i think my favorite one from them is wowing like wowie is such a good strain i wonder if in the future they will come out with any live reds and cartridges because this is not live resin this is only distillate the only thing was that they did have like a special edition the strain they went all out with the packaging shout out to bro not sponsored obviously but they they're doing it right have you guys checked them out which is your favorite strain i definitely recommend trying this straight plus it's a hybrid mixture of both indica and sativa so i actually just checked you guys i don't know how i was mentioning oh you know they should make um they for sure should drop live resin they actually do would you guys like a live resin review on robe versus regular regular distillate uh just live resin review comment down below make sure you guys drop a like any comment to show you guys support i really appreciate you guys who show endlessly love we are now at 7k [ __ ] subscribers like i don't know it's just so damn mind-blowing like damn we hit we did that

whatever with me here to talk to you about the chill brand delta eight thc bait cartridge uh apple fritter flavor um and if you will do me a favor and like and subscribe and stick around to the end of the video i will tell you how you can win yourself a brand new uh vape cartridge from delta farms i'll order that from vapeful supply on christmas day for a winter you got a really good chance of winning this because i don't have a thousand followers um you can check that out if you stick around if you like and subscribe stick around in the video i'll tell you how you can get on there okay so today we're doing a uh review on chill brand's apple fritter vape cartridge delta at sea based cartridge and i had um talked to you guys about them yesterday i did a banana kush yesterday um previous to that my girl had ordered from them um uh last thursday night which would have been thanksgiving night she ordered at nine o'clock um and they advertised two days shipping on their um on their site and so the cars were 70 off and somebody put me on something they were really good brands so i said you know go ahead and do that so thinking that i you know that they would be back into work friday you know friday morning saturday get my order you know run and then you know i possibly have my order monday or tuesday and i would have you know two three days to do vape cars because um they advertised the two days shipping for orders over a hundred dollars and i obviously got over 100 um point of fact was that i actually didn't get my order until thursday night at nine o'clock i was at ups fault um it's just the fault of diamond cbd not having a skeleton crew on friday and saturday or not uh you know loving their employees enough to go around and ask somebody you know they need the money and maybe work some overtime i mean that's that's the way i was when i was uh you know in charge of things you know where i was running and maybe maybe i'm wrong y'all tell me uh regardless of all that um i would have liked to have got my water monday or tuesday like the advertising alluded to um i didn't get that and so i ended up doing some other reviews uh so i've got a bunch of stuff from chill uh from from diamond cbd but i i just i'm not gonna have time to do them because what's gonna happen is i'm going to get another order in and they're going to take a back door step or a back step you know and then i'll just have to get to them when i get time and it's a shame because they have a really really good product so i like i said yesterday i did oh i'm banana kush about an hour after i got the package in and i told you that the banana kush was um a really intriguing card because it was like when you hit the vape card it was the very first time every time um a lot of times when you hit these vape cards what will happen is like two or three four hits into it you just won't get that taste anymore until you put it down and then maybe pick it back up and you get it again on that first hit with banana cushion i was getting the same hit every single time and that was really crazy to me and it was a really good high and i ended up vaping that throughout the night and into the day um and now what i'm on is this apple fritter excuse me okay and this apple fritter is a really intriguing flavor also it took me a second when i hit this to realize that i was easy on a high because it eased me in so slow um this is something that you can hit throughout the day again the flavor is there man i don't know what they're doing with their carts that are different than the other ones like i said i love vapor supply they have a really premium car they've got good flavor on theirs and their card design i'd have to give chill brand a heads up or a thumbs up simply because their flavor lasts throughout the cart um i don't you know throughout the hit and i'm obviously not to the end of it but i've hit this thing probably 15 20 times and it's extremely uh apple fritter it's got like a cinnamon um kind of cinnamon hits down in your throat and you get like a almost like an apple pie type of thing going on and it's a really good flavor man i'm really intrigued about these carts man simply because they're easing me into a good high it's something that i can work with all day long and they got good flavor too man and that's crazy so for a lot i would imagine this would appeal to a lot of the women out there because you know they love the fruity flavors and stuff like that this apple fritter and that banana kush yesterday with a bomb um they're really good flavors uh really light high no anxiety no paranoia and i'm really where i want to be hey folks y'all check it out man uh like i said if you'll stick around to the end and this is the end so i'm giving away one of these vape cards on christmas day uh to one of my viewers um if you'll look down in the bottom there'll be a little thing for giveaway if you'll get on that on christmas day what i'll do is i'll pick you a uh or you'll give me a flavor if you go to vapeful supply by the way they are selling their cars for thirty dollars if you use code whatever you get another twenty five

about is the potential dangers of CBD oil or more specifically the potential dangers of a CBD oil vape pen CBD vape pens are often marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking and it's probably some truth to this whether you're talking about tobacco or marijuana most experts agree that vaping is less severe on the lungs than the smoke that's inhaled from combusted plant material the reason for this comes down to a simple temperature comparison standard joints and cigarettes can burn anywhere between 800 and 1600 degrees Fahrenheit but some high quality vaporizers operate at less than 400 degrees nowhere near hot enough to produce the tar and combustion that wreaks havoc on the lungs in fact there's really no reason to inhale at temperatures much hotter than 400 degrees Fahrenheit as most of the cannabinoids in marijuana are already fully decarboxylated by this point that being said the dangers of CBD oil vape pens come from the fact that improperly processed products may contain compounds that pose hazards to respiratory health the first thing to be wary of is something called cuticle wax cannabis flour is covered in a thin outer waxy layer which when smoked in a joint or Bowl is simply burned off under the extremely high temperatures of combustion in low-temperature vaporizers it may be possible for the wax layer to break off into tiny particles rather than burn away some have suggested that these particles may end up in the lungs as solidified granulomas to avoid this potential hazard look for CBD vape oil that has undergone winterization this is a chemical process that removes the cuticle wax from the plant material before it ever reaches a vaping device another concern to be wary of is thinning agents like polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol more commonly known as PE g and PG in its natural state cannabis oil is much too viscous to be compatible with vape pen heater coils for this reason thinning agents are often added to make the oil more fluid and also to produce the tasty thick vape clouds that so many people love the only problem is both PE g + PG are known to break down into carcinogenic formaldehyde when exposed to temperatures above 440 degrees Fahrenheit a range that even top shelf vaporizers commonly operate in while the dangers of formaldehyde are most evident in other kinds of products it is probably not a substance that you want to be inhaling on a regular basis lastly in terms of the potential dangers of CBD oil vape products be advised that when you're shopping around for a vape pen you're going to get what you pay for some low end vaporizers have been known to operate at temperatures of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit this quite obviously defeats the purpose of vaping as you're still combusting the oil and plant material into a thick tari residue in other words try and invest as much money as you can into a good well reviewed unit also try and find a vape pen that has manually controllable temperature settings this allows you to adjust the operating temperature to around 340 degrees Fahrenheit which many suggest is the perfect vaping temperature for CBD and cannabis for maximum safety and to avoid the potential dangers of CBD oil vapes as much as possible try and also look for winterized VAE boils as well as oils and eliquid 'z that RP eg free thanks for watching and of course if you have any

called Applejack's same as last week we're going to be layering up from more foundational simpler movements rather than doing things sequentially first you do this and then you do this then you do this then you this that's a little more complicated so we're going to go with simpler and is and if you ever get stuck on any step just go back to the previous step in so they can really master it okay so first things first you need to be able to stand on one foot without falling over so go ahead and try that you can do that you can move on to step two which is putting the weight on your heel and pivoting back and forth with the weight on your heel if this is at all difficult that's my handy dandy chair here I'm gonna put one hand on the chair and use the other hand to counterbalance this makes it a lot easier but if you want to practice your balance practice it without holding on to the chair that will switch feet outward switch feet outward in order inward so you can hear me saying outward in with every inward inward that's because we're gonna use half of that movement and I want you to distinguish which half are gonna use so this way is about word I'm gonna come back the other way it's inward so pivoting towards the outside of my body the front of the toe towards the outside of my body is outward and that kind of waste inward we're gonna use the outward pivot and basically what we're going to do is pivot but switch feet outward on the other foot so this is getting very very close to the move that we call Applejack's so if you start with your toe pointed inward and you know outward done switch weight on the heel pivot switch it switch you know switch pivot switch pivot switch switch switch switch pivot switch pivot switch yeah couple of important things you need to know I'm not actually lifting up the forefoot very much off the floor I'm not waving at you with my foot I'm actually hitting in the floor or in my case I'm petting the carpeting okay so this move is eight counts it starts on eight so it starts before the one 801 it's kind of hot dogs are sure is actually an upward lift where you sweep your right leg in there go ahead try don't worry about when or how you live just get up in the air with your right foot sweep it forward so I'm thinking I want to land on the left but I want my right foot to touch down first so I'm going to sweep up with my right and actually land on that foot okay and then I'm gonna just really quick switch to the other side but it happens really fast so I try to think of where I'm going not each individual place I need to hit and this is it all confusing all you need to know is I wanted to start on my left when I begin the Applejack's so we're gonna go sequential II now and we're gonna go through aware it is the rid of the feet fall and which counts now that you have a basic understanding of what the applejack a foundational movement is would be like this 801 that's my left two three four five six plant your foot eight a one two three four five six Flint eight a one two four five six plant eight on two three four five they go into that six seven eight one two three four five six seven so if you liked this

performance but it heats up faster than your standard ceramic now let me show you the stainless here we have the stainless steel performer tank I paired it with our stainless steel Gold Line battery as you can see it's a very good match each one of these tanks is a half Milka Pet fill capacity on it and we're going to jump into how to fill it very quickly and also we have a nice gold finished which I've paired with our Black Gold Line vape battery nothing like mi is a black and gold like a honey stick color okay so each one of these glasses is made out of Pyrex the internals are actually made of a stainless steel as well as the mouthpiece so just can be very durable it's gonna feel very high-end and rugged for your glass tank it's not gonna feel like one of those little flimsy glasses that you know you squeeze on it's gonna break you know it's a pretty solid tank now one thing I do want you guys a note is this will work with a majority of your 510 thread batteries and also your push button concealers however because it does not have an air hole right here let's get a close-up right here on the thread because it does not have an air hole here this is not gonna work with your auto draw battery so don't try to pair this up with your bee box with your elf or your auto draw stick batteries because it's not going to be compatible you're gonna need a push button battery to power this thing up now if you're powering this up on mod batteries I don't recommend you really go over 10 watts because then you could hurt the taste but this one will take a little bit more power than your standard vape cartridges that I would normally only recommend you run it like seven seven-and-a-half watts now how do you fill this tank this is a little bit more of a process and you do have to be careful because you don't want to overfill and you don't really want to top these off because then you could make a mess so let's go into how you're gonna fill these now if you're one of those guys who orders ten cartridges at a time on our website you know who you are there's a lot of you out there that are filling your own cartridges this is actually a really easy cartridge for you guys to fill if you guys are feeling quite a few cartridges because it's very simple you just unscrew the top piece and the whole center post comes out so you have this really nice big filling area and the tank stands securely on its thread so you have this wonderful nice filling area that you can fill with a syringe you don't have what you have with several other to where they would have a center post that blocks up a majority of it where you're filling on the outer edges and with really thicker oils that can be a real problem for you to fill because the oil kind of doesn't it doesn't pour down fast enough and it kind of comes out over the edges and can take a really long time with this it's very simple you have a big fill surface area you could put thick gunky oils in there and wait for the oil to kind of sludge it down and you don't have to worry about coming out from around the sides or bending the center post the one thing you need to be careful of when you're filling it is don't fill it beyond this max line because when you put the center post and the top assembly back in you're gonna cover up and that that level is of the oils is going to come straight up to the top and if you fill above that max line it's gonna come out the sides and you're gonna waste your precious oils or CBDs so just to demonstrate how he would fill it I have some gold lines TVD here what is it it's our 500 natural gonna purge it a little bit all right so I'm just going to slowly fill it I check my level nope I went a little bit over the max line because I wanted you guys to see it more than I was trying to do a good job so I'm just gonna take a little bit out yeah that looks right about perfect I mean I still might be just a hair over but what we're gonna do now priming this tank is really simple all's you have to do is make sure when you're putting it in and you're screwing it in you do that very very slowly then once you have it screwed on tight you're just gonna let it sit for about 20 minutes and these these pores are wide enough to where it's gonna be pretty good priming for the tank so I'm gonna go ahead and very slowly put that in okay you put on too fast the oil could shoot up too quickly and then it can come out the sides as well and you don't want that then you want to get a nice good hand tight on it don't over tighten it but you're gonna feel the gasket make contact with the metal and you're gonna feel it compress right when you feel that you stop which is I felt that let's take a look at this level yeah it looks pretty much like it's right up to the top like I said you don't want to top these off then you're gonna put it onto your battery and generally I would let this sit for about 20 minutes but also you can do to prime as once you've let sit for the 20 minutes because I'm not actually gonna be vaping on this right now is if you click it twice it goes into preheat mode you see it flashing that means it's preheating so with that really low voltage heat cycle did it put soother your heater is actually priming I'll let it run through the preheat cycle of it priming once it's done flashing I'm gonna put it into the temperature I desire let's say I want to go middle and it is ready to vape if I want to go higher oh yeah I can hear fizzling so this is now ready to vape make sure that you guys definitely get a good prime on the tank you do not want to you do not want to you know fill it up right away start ripping on it at a high temperature and then you're gonna get a metallic taste because that's gonna ruin your vaping experience is a nice ceramic high performance cartridge you definitely want to enjoy the taste that it has in it so make sure that's properly primed and you set it up good and then this is definitely gonna be one of the higher performance small tanks that you have in your arsenal so I hope this video was informative for you like I said you can check it out in one of its three colors pair it with

juice so the alpha jack is a move where you throw one foot up so you can either use your right foot or you can use your left foot the thing to remember is that you want to keep your hips up and you want to throw your hands back in a comfortable position on paper with your hips up practice putting them up and bringing them back down for the movement so you're just gonna kick one foot up put your hands back and come back forward and that's the basic apple jack yeah so that was the apple jack tutorial and if you're interested in learning the kick which is using two legs and follow me to the next video", "9HLGL5fEt2k": "[Music] hi guys I'm van Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we are doing a helpful Pro tips video that I have been getting tons of email customer service requests for which is basically how to clean and maintain your tank or how do you get the most usable life out of your throwaway tank several people are refilling these and you want to get the most number of uses or you want to get them cleaned up so this video is basically gonna run through how to clean up your tank maintain it get it back to you level whether it's a complex tank like our sub old carbon fiber a Cannabis Cup winning tank or whether it's a simple 5-10 thread thing fact the matter is as you use on certain oils certain terpene profiles get in there certain areas get gummed up they don't get cleaned you want to get the taste out get your tank back to new level and this video is going to give you some really useful tips on how to do that so Before we jump into the video I don't know what type of level of Pro cleaning you guys are into but I'm gonna go to the extreme and basically supply all of the equipment that you will need in the worst possible case scenario so you are prepared for everything so let's go over what I have here I just have a couple tanks so I poured some dark eliquid into I don't believe in wasting CBD or medical oils I let them sit for a week so that so that they they get a little bit discolored and they go and get on to the gaskets and get all over the insides of tank I had my guys keep them upside down and whatnot so we can get the tank dirtied up a little bit just enough so we can show you guys how to clean it so we have our example tanks then over here let's get a nice little shot I've had this for a couple of years this is actually a little coiler kit that I bought off of Amazon anybody who's into vape mods vaporizers or small things for 10 bucks or 15 bucks whatever I paid for on Amazon it is super useful I use it in here in my office taking apart vaporizers - tampering with small things constantly I mean for 10 15 bucks you can't beat it it's called a mod coiler kit it comes with these really useful little ceramic tweezers so there don't conduct static electricity they come with these almost like like a little dental tool so you grab little small gaskets and little bitty things you can play some with small screwdrivers with all different types of sets scissors thanks for 10 bucks if you're tampering around these things definitely an awesome investment we have our tanks always good to have rubber gloves before you start cleaning your tank these things are gunky some of them are borderline gross you know the oil gets slippery the rubber does give you a good grip when you're taking the tanks apart much easier to throw away the gloves than to you know try to scrub off your skin afterwards the key component that you're gonna need whether you need any of the other things or not is isopropyl alcohol there's over 90 percent purity this stuff is not going to mess up your electronics do not use soap and water to clean your tanks or anything they'll come in contact with electricity only use isopropyl alcohol this stuff kills all the bacteria will definitely break down any type of oils that are stuck to the gaskets in your tank it's gonna give it a nice clean smell it's not gonna mess up your electronics this is your best bet to getting your tank close to you you can pick these up at any grocery store any type of you know CVS Walgreens little convenience shop usually will have this or you could order it online then I bring some styrofoam cups some thick styrofoam cups this is what I set out my bets are basically my little quarantine centers in two and then I have paper towels they do not particle eyes you don't want to use the types of the types of paper towels or napkins that once they get wet and you and you try to turn on them like almost like a toilet paper that they can particle eyes or fuzz up because you don't want that stuff in your tank coming in contact with your electronics it is just not going to be good so any type of paper towel that doesn't really particle eyes once it's gotten wet that just absorbs will be good for what we're doing so let's jump right into it let's get our gloves on and let's perform some open-heart surgery here all right first things first my first cup is gonna be like tobacco chewers not a big fan with polar spit cup where I'm going to dump my residue is it getting wasted or CBBC here we are simply using discolored thick and hardened to e-juice so I'm gonna get out whatever I can get out there upside down then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start disassembling the tank into as many parts as I can while I wait I don't want to get my glass all dirty so put on paper towels so then I'm going to start a little isopropyl alcohol bath where I'm gonna take these cups and put some isopropyl alcohol in them for the various parts as you can see I fill them up about a quarter way just so the components can become submerged now make sure that when you disassembled your tank you remember kind of what you're doing so that you reassemble your thing properly so now that this has pretty much soaked away I'm going to remove the glass piece and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take off all gaskets and separate them put them into one of my little bath cuffs I'm gonna have one of my bath tubs b4 gaskets that gaskets off could need my tweezers to get this one out make sure that you remove all of your gaskets because a lot of times if you don't remove them and you get them lost when you're assembling or disassembling your tank and then you put your tank back together you're missing a gasket you cannot have a good connection or you can have leakage which you definitely do not want to do now when it comes to the sub ohm tank you don't want to remove these bottom gaskets here because they are your seal between your glass and your base and just removing them wears them out a little bit more so you want to keep those as good as possible so we're not going to remove these those are tight on the base we don't want those to become looser now you're gonna remove your heater you might have to put some muscle into it you might have to get some pliers because some of that residue might have been down there it might have hardened and this could be oily and slippery this ejuice propylene glycol I'm definitely feeling that slippery on my gloves so in the event that this is hard to unscrew a bigger set of pliers or you know or you gonna get a really put a little muscle into it yeah it was definitely on there pretty tight so I'm going to take this away now if you are cleaning your heater make sure that you get it into an isopropyl bath but most of the time when people are cleaning their subloan tanks they're just gonna want to switch it off once they clean it with a brand new heater to top it off so we're actually not going to put the heater into the best since we're gonna give it a brand new heater since we're essentially rebuilding the tank here with this so we're gonna give the bottom base a nice little bath and that is also going to bathe with the mouthpiece make sure it's fully submerged if it's not always just add a little bit of isopropyl we're gonna drop the glass in with the gaskets because it's not that dirty heater we're gonna throw away and the top piece which has the airflow control we're gonna put into a separate uh separate bath there now this guy is not fully submerged so I'm gonna add a little bit I'm gonna make sure that it is fully submerged there you can see and while I let those absorb generally what I like to do is depending on how dirty the tank is I'll leave it in there for probably four hours it's just to really let it soak up let is sterilized let the parts break down you'll come back and depending on what type of oil or CBD you have in there you'll come back and it will look like the eye so the clear isopropyl is now like Coke or coffee or something like that you know so depending on how dirty is what you had in there but I would say leave it in there for a few hours on the minimum and go from there sometimes people even say you know if they set this up at night they go to sleep and then they put it back together in the morning the longer you let it sit in there generally the deeper of a clean you're gonna get for cleaning purposes we're just gonna let it sit while I set up and show you guys how to clean a 510 threaded tank so we're gonna take our 510 thread tank that we have filled up with some yellowish ejuice here all you could do is you're going to unscrew the top piece there's any residues in there you're going to take the spit cup here and you're going to dump it out this is obviously thickened and hardened so there really is only a little bit of drops coming in and out now there we go it's kind of shaking out the is really much thicker you can remove the mouthpiece here because we will clean that - no you're gonna do is reassemble is appropriate we were just gonna let the tank submerge the tank body submerged in there and next to it we're gonna have a little mouthpiece submerged in there then we're just gonna let it sit and we're gonna let it bathe with these generally it helps because you can't take the tank apart in the cept several pieces like we can wear sub ohm tank it comes apart into about four pieces this is only one piece and because that center post that you have in the tank there's not a lot of area for that liquid to get into so when you're cleaning this it's not a bad idea to just kind of slosh it around for a little bit kind of wiggle it around to make sure the alcohol is working its way into the tank and into the heater is generally you gotta just I just spilled that isopropyl all over the place but you just kind of wiggle it around and then let it sit make sure that there's isopropyl getting into there now the next thing that we're gonna do off is before you would start any type of reassembly is you want to make sure that you clean off your tools because you just use these tools this is the one that I really used that was dirty I don't want to get the dirty residues back into a clean tank that is the last thing that I want to do so clean your tools you simply take a nice clean paper towel soaking a little bit of isopropyl you can clean off all the areas that you would have touched make sure it's nice and sterile now to be extra extra cautious while I'm cleaning my tank I'm actually for the final phase I'm going to remove my dirty gloves that have eliquid on them and all different types of tank residues and I'm going to give my tools here a little final final touch always get a little smell test that smells like clean isopropyl let that dry and we are gonna get some new gloves and we are gonna come back and now we're going to talk about reassembling the tank alright guys we've got some fresh clean gloves and we are back to start reassembling the tanks so as you can see here you can view the cups you can see that my isopropyl is definitely discolored and we didn't let it sit overnight I said we let it sit for like 10-15 minutes while we're showing you the other tank if that and this is just strictly an example but if you let it sit for a few hours you're definitely gonna get a lot more discoloration the liquid in the more discolor it is the better sometimes if you want to go the extreme once a liquid becomes discolored you take the components out and plort it into a clean isopropyl bath you know again that depends on the magnitude of cleanliness that you want to go and how you really want to let this stuff sit but now what I do is I set up what I call a little drying station well I take the paper towels that I had and I fold them up so I can basically take the components out of the isopropyl bath and allow them to dry Oh as much intro track as you can and for our little tank we are actually going to take that out and with 510 tanks what you want to do you want to try to let them sit upside down just let all the isopropyl to drip out now this this guy wants to tip over a little bit so we're gonna do these and this guy we want him to be upside down as well it's a little isopropyl drip down and that's going to take a little bit of a while if you want to spread out speed up the process of getting the isopropyl out of tank you can always use a hairdryer use either the hairdryer if you have it only take each setting from a distance or use it on the non heat setting on just a cool setting because if you hit it with a heat gun or something like that or hiking you do run the chance of compromising the integrity or warping the gaskets or the rubber pieces of tank so do not use any of those natural drying is usually the best or use a hairdryer but don't use it on a higher heat setting or each setting at all so now what I do with each one of these little components I haven't given it much much of a chance to dry put this guy off to the side I haven't given it much of a chance to dry so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a clean cloth clean rag and I'm actually gonna clean and dry the glass and all the components within the tank to make sure move any residue and all so that I get it as dry as possible in the short amount of time so we can do this video do it properly okay that's nice and clean the base it looks brand-new it's nice and dry I'll see any isopropyl so this one's ready to go now if my gaskets I'm also gonna dry them off whatever you do don't pull on your gaskets like the rubber bands that weakens them it shortens the life of them it does compromise the integrity of the gaskets so be gentle with them don't flex on them in other words that's nice try it's back to white it was pretty yellow before we clear it into the eye on the alcohol that there so that one's done clean up this long these aren't exactly the most form-fitting gloves but you get the picture never clean off the mouthpiece generally a lot of residue with these sub ohm tank builds up around the edges so if you want to you take a little bit of isopropyl you just dip the cloth in there to give her a real final scrub you can really get a nice clean on it there even kind of fold up the towel towel a little bit clean the inside yeah you get that as good as new see no it's much better there you go now let me get a dry paper towel I can even clean the internals here a little bit oh yeah that's nice that's basically bringing you there and again you can use a q-tip you can go much more extreme I'm just really trying to give you guys the basics now we go dry long dry this guy off here okay now let's get to the bottom base a lot of times oil will set up in there the isopropyl actually did a really good job of just getting that out as you can see I haven't touched it since we pulled it out of bath so for this one you can take some isopropyl a really scrub down but in this event I don't see that as being necessary I'm just gonna go ahead and just dry it out give it an extra little clean I mean this doesn't look bad at all I suppose I mean the e-liquid and the ISO the isopropyl got rid of a liquid stains rather well just by even dipping it into that sometimes with different oils or CBeebies you could have a little bit of a tougher time you might have to give it a couple baths and a couple cleans but like I said case-by-case basis you will know exactly how far to make it so that's done there now we're gonna get the top air flow piece for this you want to twist around the airflow piece sometimes you get residue caught in the middle there or on different ends always good to twist it around to get the inside this gasket also removes because we didn't actually use this tank much there was really nothing caught in there it looked pretty new but you can actually remove it also so you can see because we didn't use it there wasn't any residue trapped in there but you could have removed this gasket also and dropped it into the bath with the gasket so we're just not gonna best so we're just gonna clean off the outside of it it's sat in the bath this will be fine get this we're going to dry off the inside and again if you want let these sit out natural air dryer more it might be better or if you just blow dry them off we're really doing an express job just to not make this video seven hours and for us to get it done so that now the most important part is is not to forget your gaskets so you want to make sure that you drop in your gaskets now with the sub ohm tank what's very critical about it is that you have a gasket that goes into each side of where the glass interacts so one of your gaskets is gonna go right here into the very top of the mouthpiece let me get these form-fitting gloves a little bit better you want to go in there you can take your little tweezers I'm gonna push them down to make sure it's in the crevice nice and easy just kind of go around don't poke the gasket to compromise it that gaskets in there nice you want to take that put your glass in there you gotta feel it line up then your other gasket is going to go inside the crevice on your bottom base you're gonna want to make sure you drop it in there it drops them there good because otherwise that will give you bottom leaking because your tank most the time sits upright so if you had to pick one of the two to do perfectly this is definitely the one the top gasket really compromises only if you leave your tank upside down or on its side with the air vents over so you put this one is good to your bottom base now we could have cleaned up the heater but in this event I just grabbed a new one this is a sub ohm heater you can pick them up on the website they come in five packs I already took the liberty of removing it out of five pack that's brand new then you're gonna want to screw it on to the tank you want to get a nice tight screw you're gonna feel the two pieces of metal connect you don't need all the time if you when you're cleaning your tank the next time you're gonna fight with it that much more get a nice good hand tight where you feel the metal connect and it's making electrical connection you're not gonna get any bottom leakage and then you're going to connect the glass and you're gonna screw the actual body of the tank together with screws into here and you want to get it tight don't want to over tighten it don't want to put too much pressure on the gasket is completely unnecessary then you're gonna take it you're gonna fill it prime it that's the place you do it but before you do that you want to do a quick atomizer check to make sure you did everything right in your tank works screw the top piece on and then you can do an atomizer check this is a brand new tank out of the box that hasn't been used and I gotta say if we do a close up even though we rushed through the cleaning procedure I mean this is this is pretty closely it's not a bad job for doing it really quickly and we could have done a little bit better but basically looks brand new so now we're gonna do an atomizer check before we fill it up because the worst possible thing you can do that we've gotten a lot of angry phone calls and we don't want this to be an angry phone call if somebody just goes to the process of cleaning their tanks takes a gram of very expensive distillates or something puts it in there and they didn't do something right or the heaters not working and now they're in a big dilemma where they just dumped a whole syringe in there and we don't want to be the cause of your frustrations so do a quick atomizer check to make sure you put the tank together properly you're all cleaned up and dried out what you're good is you just screw it onto a battery of 510 battery you're going to turn it on in most of the time when you turn it on it'll already give you an atomizer resistance reading right here it says point 5 ohms if we get good close up of that right here in the lower corner you'll get a resistance reading you see that resistance reading generally that means that you have an electrical connection now what you're gonna do then is you're gonna turn your wattage all the way down all the way is down as far as it goes then you're gonna push the fire button and as long as the timer starts don't leave the timer on a long time because then you could get a burnt taste in there burn up the coil but as long as the timer starts you know that you did a good job and that tank is gonna work and you put everything back together properly the atomizer you put in there's legit everything is good on that end so now you can take this tank and you can go through the priming and filling procedures that you would as if you purchase the tank from us a brand new so now that showed you exactly how to maintain and clean the most complex tank that we offer and it's not is only going to be easier than that one I promise you so we're gonna jump right back to the tank that has been sitting upside down now what you're going to want to do with this is now it has an isopropyl in it so you can see there's still a little isopropyl in it so you have two real options you could do here is you can take a very nice thin piece of thin piece of napkin and you can use your tweezers and actually get inside there to get it out to kind of spin and twist it around that might take you a while or you can use a blow dryer trip on this one - is he use make sure that you get it nice and dry on the inside I actually take my glove off for this one because this is a little bit more delicate than these gloves weren't exactly sized for me the glove does not fit so what you do is you take your napkin sorry not a napkin your paper towel you can roll it up into a nice little fine braided string so it has a little bit of substance and it's ultra thin then you get this string in there you get it between the center post the inside of the tank and you can actually kind of move it around and get any remaining pieces of the isopropyl out it's working just fine here it's gonna take you a little bit of time because a very thin very small very delicate so I honestly suggest using the blow dryer method or letting it sit upside down for a few hours that will definitely work for you too once you've gotten basically all of the isopropyl particles little droplets out of there you know that you will be all set to check to see if the tank works and get another fill on it including these little 510 tanks if you're putting different strains in there or if it stops not performing but it still works that's because there's residue gummed up in there you want to get a better taste out of each one to make sure it's a taste neutral and you get Paul residues out definitely good idea to clean your tank before you fill it this one I can still feel my hands it has a little bit of isopropyl on so it's good dry it off get inside the mouthpiece get the air holes now when you screw it back together and we're gonna do the atomizer test we're just going to use this mod battery remember when using your honey stick carbon fiber that carbon fiber battery you're gonna use a five ton tank on it make sure you flip the ego adapter upside down otherwise it won't read and it won't work so you flip it upside down let's turn it off move this little silicon protector screw it on now we're going to turn our battery on as you can see now it's registered at one point three ohms which is actually the factory specs for the tank as you get residues and they're dirty the resistance will actually go up on the ohms so now we push it oh wow I even heard it hissing there actually burned off some of that a little isopropyl and I still be trapped in there but now we know we clean up the tank the resistance is back to the factory specs on the original heater and it is ready to vape so this is a good way to clean you little 510 tanks get a little bit more life out of them get a little bit more usage out of them and when you're going in between tanks to make sure

There is so much money in vapor pens it's unreal. I'm in the vapor pen industry simply because I know that. You can be too. One of the most important parts of being in the vapor pen game is understanding what cartridge you should buy. But what do you do when there's so many of them? My name is Drew, owner of MrExtractor.com. My terpene profiles are in millions of pens all around the country. I'm here today to tell you the truth about what cartridge you should use in today's episode: \"How To Pick Your THC Cartridge\" from The Terpene Institute.       Okay so look; you've got your distillate, and you've got your terpenes, and it tastes really good, and you're loving it, and you're like, what products should I pick? Look, we could go on for hours about the differences in cartridges. And to be honest with you, later, when I have a little bit more time, I'm gonna bring in some vape cartridge manufactures and they're gonna explain the exact differences. But what I'm gonna do today, is give you just a common-sense breakdown of some of the things you're gonna run into when picking out a cartridge for your line. Now, without getting into all the intricacies of every different cart, that is a whole other thing. I don't manufacture carts, I don't want to manufacture carts, I could. It is a huge pain in the ass with a million competitors and no money. I don't deal with it for a million different reasons. But I can tell you a few things. When we first started this company, we were testing our terpenes with distillate, and we were like dude this sucks. We suck. We don't know what we're doing. We should probably give this up. We tried a different cartridge after a couple months, everything we had tasted better. It tasted right. And I was like, \"Oh my god this whole time it's been the damn cartridge.\" We never knew! All cartridges are not created equal. Aside from their whole sizes, and their glass, and the tips, and all that stuff, some of them just don't taste good. It can make your product taste like shit. So what I always recommend; when you first start out, grab like five different cartridges, just in general, and just start with which one tastes best. You're gonna have to look at a whole bunch of different parameters when you're operating. Taste is gonna be one of the most important, followed by cloud size. It's hard to debate on even which one is more important than that. If it leaks, it's no good to anybody. So instead of going over every single different aspect, I'm gonna save that for a whole series of videos where I bring in a vapor pen, a couple vapor pen manufactures, and we're gonna go over every different aspect of the cartridge, and why you should or shouldn't pick one based on that. Problem with that is everything's evolving all the time. So let me just tell you kind of some of the pitfalls you're gonna run into. Keep it simple. So first off, your cartridge can taste different depending on the manufacture. It can make your good product taste like crap. We got tricked with that very early in the industry, like I said. We didn't realize it was the damn cartridge, we thought we didn't know what we were doing. I'm sure you guys have run into that too. Always try a few different pens. Now, you can find a pen that tastes great, the battery it's coupled with can also make it taste like crap. We do so much testing here, I've honestly ran through thousands and thousands and thousands of cartridges that we've personally tried, and I understand the differences between a lot of them, but sometimes we ran into this when we thought our test was terrible. Again later, it was the stupid cartridge again. Even from the same manufacture. China is not the most honorable country in the world, believe it or not. They sell you a bunch of good stuff once, they say a bunch of crap the next time to offload some parts. So, make sure that you have a consistent, quality supplier. Make sure that your cartridge tastes good. If your cartridge does not taste good, try it with a different battery. It is essential that you understand that the combination between the cartridge and the battery is crucial. You can have an excellent cartridge with a different type of battery that burns it too hot, not hot enough, tastes like shit, vise versa. So, before you even go into business, you need to pick the battery that you want to use, make sure that you can get a lot of them, couple it with the cartridge you want to use, make sure that you can get a lot of those too, and then start adjusting your product based on that. Now there's all sorts of different types, there's the wicks, there's the ceramics, there's the c-cell's. So many different parameters that you want to operate under. Exactly why I don't do this. But what I can tell you is that, if you're running into problems, our products taste good. We've tasted- we tested them in a bunch of different products. Enough to know that we can't control the manufactures of the battery in the cart. Switch your battery, try something different. Switch your cartridge, try something different. It's not your distillate, and it's not our terpenes. It's most likely your cartridge. Some of them burn hot, some of them leak, whatever. Make sure you get a cartridge that doesn't leak. Leave your pens out for a week, set them out in a little bit of heat. You don't want it running out into your packaging and ruining your product, giving you a bad name. So many things on the cartridge aspect. So I'm leery to even get into it. That's something that, you know again, for the millionth time, I don't like getting into it just because of the variety of things when you're buying a cheap product from China. I'm seeing so many things from those people over there that is just crazy. You don't need to spend the most amount of money. Now I can tell you this; for product testing, I use some of the cheapest carts that I can find. I use the wick carts, it's the simple black ones with the wick, they taste great. They don't blow the hugest cloud, but it really pulls out the aroma, it doesn't burn the oil. They're inexpensive, they taste great. Other people, they want to use the really expensive ones, that's cool. It depends on your product. If you're blowing really good clouds, and all that. What I can tell you is that the amount of terpenes that you use with the wick system is gonna differ from the amount you use with the c-cell. If you got something that burns really hot, it's gonna flash off more terpenes at one time all during the taste. Versus something that does it a little bit slower. Make sure that you watch some of our other videos. I'll probably pop a link up here as to what videos you should watch, and how to blend your terpenes based on how they flash off, and why you can't do things- smell versus taste because terpenes do flash off at different amounts and different temperatures. So if you got some major ass coil, and you're burning them all off real quick, it's gonna hurt your throat. Versus something a little softer. It is a combination of events, just like these terpenes. We've got twenty different things that work together in harmony, mixed with your THC, mixed at a certain temperature, mixed with the oxygen when it hits your mouth, and create a pleasant flavor. It's complex. Your pen is the same thing. You've got your cartridge, you've got how viscous your distillate is, how many terpenes you have, what temperature you're vaping it at, how the voltage of the battery is affecting it. You are creating a symphony of items that, everything's just as important. The THC gets you high, that stuff's the flavoring, the battery supplies the power, the cartridge does the burning. You got to orchestrate it right, or you're going to come out with a poor product. The good news is all you gotta do is just try some things, process of elimination. Get your cart, throw a few different batteries, which one tastes better? Throw a few different carts on the same battery. Just narrow it down, it's not that hard, and stick with it. Talk to the manufacture and say, \"Hey man, can you get these all the time? How long have you been in business? Do you switch the model all the time?\" Carts man, they're something else. Someday we'll come up with something even better then a cart, alright? So look, The Terpene Institute was founded just to give you simple, commonsense understanding of the terpene industry, and how to make money from it. I'm gonna expand into cannabis, and business lines, but for right now, just helping you understand how this works aside from all the crazy, stupid bullshit that you find on social media. I'm here only to tell you the truth because simply, the more products you sell, the more products I sell. I'm gonna do my very best to make sure that you sell the most things that you can, and make the most money you can, alright? Because you're gonna spend it here. So, go to MrExtractor.com. You've got all the different terpene profiles there, watch some of the other videos, you should watch them all. College is expensive, and you can't learn what I'm teaching you anywhere. College that you go to, you're gonna have some broke ass professor teaching you something that he doesn't know anything about, or you can take it from a person that started this industry that is a multi-millionaire and teach you how to do the same thing. I ain't even gonna charge you, alright? Thank you for watching, see you at The Terpene Institute in the next video.

to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail one mil or one gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges let's take this to the deck okay well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sell brand we're going to take a pair of vice grips common rice clips and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this caller right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged all right I will show you again on this one here you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it", "880TLs3fjmg": "okay so I'm gonna show you how do you save my oil transfer this is just a small kit that can help you transfer your oil from one to another and it's kind of small so you could keep this anywhere you want this is what it looks like when you open it up what you want to do is on most of them you can unscrew these tops if not you have to figure out another way to actually get it off and now I just want to place this one down here sometime these are gonna be a little bit tight when you first get it because once used to last for a long time you'd see there and they'll stay in there so that's the one that I want to actually put in another one what I'm gonna do is take this cylinder filler and you could use a toothpick if you have one put that in there and now what I'm going to do is pull this out a little bit put this on so it keeps it straight connected and then put this right on here now we have it connected and what I'm gonna do is flip this over sometimes I like to put it on a little bit of an edge so that way it will stick to that glass and that is how that is set up right [Music]", "7aD2VE0X6Lk": "hi my name is ryan and i am the developer and founder of vapejet and today we're going to talk a little bit about our semi-automatic cartridge filling solution the jet fueler some of the things that make this system different than other cartridge filling systems on the market are our fluid dispense path and the extreme care we take for process control temperature so talking about the fluid dispense path we start with a stainless steel one liter reservoir which is connected down into the pump housing which includes a ceramic on ceramic mechanical valve as well as a syringe pump you'll also notice here at the bottom is a needle connected to a lure lock adapter connected to this heater let's talk about process heat real quick because it's vitally important to keep the temperature of the oil as it's pumped consistent throughout the entire process we do that by having three independently controllable pid heaters the first is on the reservoir the second is in this pump housing and the third is the lure lock adapter here at the bottom this first heater is a silicone heater pad connected to the stainless steel reservoir which is controllable through our software to set the temperature and eliminate oscillations in temperature keeping next up is the pump housing this is a forced air heater also hooked up to a pid controller and controllable through the software and that maintains the temperature of this system inside the pump chamber as well as this hose to keep the line nice and warm as the oil flows through it finally we have a heater here at the bottom which heats just the last quarter inch of tubing along with the stainless steel lure lock adapter and what that does is it gives the product a final blast to heat before flowing into the cartridge by keeping this a little bit hotter than the rest of the system you're able to maintain lower oil temperatures while storing it another key feature of the jet fueler system which is enabled by that ceramic on ceramic mechanical valve is our pressurized supply side we pressurize this reservoir using clean food grade nitrogen to about 20 to 40 psi depending on the viscosity of the fluid and what that does is it allows you to keep your fluid at a lower temperature than would otherwise normally be required to pump it through a system like this so let's talk about this reservoir a little bit more and take it apart and look at what's inside again this reservoir holds one liter of oil and is easily accessed by taking off the top clamp removing this plate taking care to set the o-ring aside and you'll notice there's a dip tube in here which once it's installed into the system pulls oil from the bottom corner to ensure you get all the oil from your reservoir let's go ahead and pour in some preheated oil remembering to put the clamp the o-ring back on and now this reservoir is ready to be reinstalled into the system once the oil has been loaded into the reservoir we're ready to reinstall it onto the system simply take the reservoir place it on top connect the electrical and then connect the supply line with the supply line finger tight then take a 9 16 wrench and give it an additional quarter turn once that's complete take your nitrogen quick connect and connect it into the system now we're ready to prime the pump now that the reservoir is loaded and pressurized let's go ahead and turn on all the heaters so from the interface you can simply click toggle all heaters which will turn on the needle chamber and reservoir heaters you'll notice all those heaters are currently heating up which is why the power levels are all at 100 percent as each section comes to temperature you'll see those power levels start to throttle down so that we maintain temperature without a lot of oscillations up or down now at this point we're going to let the system warm up for 10 to 15 minutes before we proceed now that the product is loaded into the system we need to prime our pump the pressurized aspect of the jet fueler makes that incredibly easy so what we're going to do is we're going to take a beaker and place it underneath the needle and then on the front panel of the machine we're going to hit bypass what bypass does is it connects the input port directly to the output port because our reservoir is pressurized that pressure is going to push the oil through the system so i'm going to hit bypass and you can see the oil starting to flow out nice and smooth done that's it now our system is primed and ready to start pumping we're ready to calibrate it and set the fill level for a cartridge we're going to need a few empty cartridges and a scale you're going to tear out one of your cartridges so that it displays zero on your scale and then we're going to use the interface and click the calibration button and walk through this wizard the first thing we want to do is set the initial fill level these are one gram cartridges so i'm going to drag the slider to somewhere around one click the next button and on this screen we're able to set how fast the system pumps so you can change the speed of the charging motion and the dispensing motion independently of one another the reason that's important is with some cartridges you don't want to pump too fast or the oil can overflow and bubble out one side before it's had time to fully flow around the center post so we're going to set this one to one so the fastest charging and a dispensing speed of about 10 which is mid-range click next and on this screen what we're going to do is dispense a couple times and tell the system how it did so we want one gram so take the teared out cartridge put it under the needle and hit cycle pump you can see we dispensed in and we dispensed 1.2 so what we want is 1.05 and we dispensed 1.2 hit the next button and that's all it takes to set up this machine so let's take another cartridge tear it out hit cycle pump and we are at 1.06 so very accurate and very repeatable dispenses let's do it one more time to make sure 1.05 perfect now that the system is set up and calibrated one of the things we can do is save and load those profiles for later so if you click the configuration button and configuration list we can call this a one gram low this and say we'll call this the live demo configuration hit save new and there we go now in the future to come back to this calibration all you have to do is hit the load button now that we have the system calibrated and our configuration saved we're ready to start filling cartridges so you'll notice right here next to the machine is a foot pedal this foot pedal actuates the pumping action so that the operator has both hands to position cartridges i'm going to take this one and just set it down and then let's get some cartridges and start filling so we position so please and that's all it takes to operate a jet fueler system if you have any other technical questions or just want to talk to somebody in sales please don't hesitate to reach out we can set up one-on-one individual remote demonstrations to go over any aspects of the machine you may want to know more about thank you again and i'll talk to you soon", "AZViYFUeDac": "[Music] hey what's up guys logan here from o2 vape today we're going to address the question as to what cartridge you should choose for your 510 thread battery when it comes to cartridges there are a plethora of options to choose from it will mainly come down to what type of oil you're going to be putting in your cartridge what the viscosity of that oil is and what voltage your battery will be operating at as a general rule of thumb the thinner the oil you are using the smaller the intake hole size you want to use think of it this way if you have a super thick oil it is not gonna flow very well through tiny holes just the same if you have a very thin oil almost water like you would not want a very large intake hole because you would then most likely flood your atomizer this could result in leaking and could ruin both your cartridge and your battery here you can see the difference between a 1.2 2 millimeter intake hole in a 2.0 millimeter intake hole the smaller holes ranging from point 9 millimeter to 1.2 2 millimeter are going to work best with a thin oil such as an e juice or thin CBD liquid then there are medium oils such as a cut extract oil or thick CBD oil which are going to work best with about a 1 point six six millimeter intake hole the largest intake holes such as the 2.0 millimeter or Oh to vapes very flow cartridges are intended for very thick oils such as an uncut extract oil as for the tanks they generally come in glass or pei however the older cartridges could come in polycarbonate or plastic as well the glass tanks typically give you the highest quality however you do lose some durability most of the pei cartridges look just like glass however they are going to be much more durable these cartridges are meant to hold up to your terpenes and solvents better than the older plastic or polycarbonate cartridges which used to break down the plastic or polycarbonate cartridges are durable but not ideal for anything but thin oils such as an e liquid or highly oil there are also different types of atomizers or wicks in the cartridge the wick technology is the original technology that was used with eliquid x' this type of cartridge uses a wick to soak up the oil and then directly touches the heating element which will then heat the oil in produce vapor wick cartridges can come in either a plastic polycarbonate or glass tanks as for the ceramic atomizers they are the pinnacle of cartridge performance when it comes to using thick oils they are able to heat hotter quicker and more evenly than a wikked cartridge here at o2 vape we use what is called a wickless ceramic atomizer what this means that there is no heating element that directly touches your oil this will give you the cleanest burn and also help produce the best taste from your oils ceramic cartridges come in either a high-grade Pei or glass tank another big factor as to what cartridge to choose is going to be what voltage your battery operates at if you are using a ceramic cartridge then you will want to make sure that you are using a battery that is about 3.7 volts or higher to give you the optimal experience if you use a battery that has a lower voltage than 3.7 folds then you may be able to get a draw however it most likely will not be very big if you are using a plastic or polycarbonate cartridge then you will want to use a voltage that is lower more around 3.2 volts or so if you use a higher voltage than this on plastic cartridges or polycarbonate cartridges then you run the risk of frying that cartridge which will then lead to a burnt taste every time you draw in the cartridge unfortunately if you get to this point there is no way to fix the burnt taste one last important thing to take into consideration when choosing the right cartridge for you is going to be if that cartridge is heavy metal free currently about 99.9% of cartridges on the market come out of China with that being said there are a lot of inferior products out there that are being made very poorly some of these cartridges are starting to test positive for heavy metals such as lead cadmium arsenic and Mercury rest assure that if you are using an o2 VAP cartridge that ours have all been thoroughly tested and have all passed I hope this video helps you guys select the correct cartridge for your oils

Jason from best friend this is a demonstration video of the best one guys cartridge fill the gun that I have here today is our fifty CC gun it'll hold 50 ml and it's capable of doing one milliliter shots it comes attached with a heater controller this one currently I got set to about 110 set it a little bit higher because you know you have the heater on the outside that's wrapping your inside barrel and sometimes a little bit of a heat differential I have some prepared oil here I also have that on a heat pad and then I have some cards right here too so just to start with it you can clean your components and all that kind of stuff but it comes with is a 14 gauge tip it's already pre bent and we also have an extra plunger that goes on in the setting gun in the event that may be soaked in an alcohol and you damaged it you replace it shouldn't need to though it's very easy to disassemble and clean you just unscrew from this end it's very simply product so you install your tip it's a little lock tip Luther locks you know we can buy them all different variations and sizes so you don't have to worry about whatever I give you if it doesn't work for your products you can pick them up and get a bag of 100 of them for 6 bucks the cards I have right here are 1 ml they're also sitting on a heat pad I like to kind of keep my tarts a little bit warm when I'm doing this stuff too so to fill it it's very simple you just make sure you plunge it down into your liquid and you pull back slowly as you're filling it the nice thing is this will stay warm why are you using it ok grab my cards here you want to make sure you depress on the handle entirely sometimes the first shot is a partial shot just because the gun may have not been filled up or backed up all the way but there's my full shot there you just kind of keep moving along pressing the handle all the way there's notches on the inside of the plunger and those notches will ensure that you don't over pull it but if you do under pull it you will get a half shot but it allow them make sure you can fill each cart exactly the same every time we will also have these available in point 5 ml increments those will be coming

company that i've seen around for some time i've seen them selling their flour at a lot of uh shops here in southern california especially the long beach area for it seems like a couple of years uh and now it looks like like a lot of folks they are branching out getting into other kinds of products um i know uh that this these people are now doing cartridges they're doing uh different concentrates and they are also doing tinctures of uh different varieties uh and what is that company that company is cresco cresco and this is their indica cartridge just uh nominally called rest it is their half uh gram cartridge 500 milligrams um and i picked this up for i actually couldn't tell you what the real cost was i it was uh some combination of purchasing this and one of their tinctures some kind of uh discount but i think they're a more affordable brand i think this is probably in the realm of like 20 to 25 for a half gram cart not too bad um in terms of packaging um it is uh refreshingly minimalistic not a lot of uh you know extra materials here just simple cardboard but all the information you want to see uh so the it is also in addition to being their rest line uh it is the critical purple push strain uh excuse me critical purple kush rather we all knew that and then you've got lab testing results there on the side a little sticker and then on the bottom you do have the um thc results and that comes in at 76.5 percent uh for 382 and a half percent or 382 milligrams of thc if that'll focus so uh this is pretty standard 510 fare here um uh no special pod or different kind of battery involved just your standard good old-fashioned 510 vape thread battery which you know feels to me like is uh becoming more and more of a uh a rarity to find uh the universal beloved 510 thread okay so we've ripped some tape off here at the bottom now we've got some push to do pushing pulling and there we go ah yes and this is a liquid live resin the uh still uh lost a little bit of its luster the term live resin not as much of a buzzword as it once was but still a lot of uh live resin devotees and this is apparently live resin uh and so here we are here is our cartridge design um got the plastic acrylic tip which is not my favorite uh but otherwise pretty standard looking 510 thread doesn't look like the nicest materials in the world but i don't think it's the most expensive cart either so let's go ahead and use my trusty 510 here as you know if you've watched me do some of these before i used to try to use nice 510 batteries uh to do these reviews with uh but for a variety of reasons i no longer do one because even the nice 510 batteries suck and they break down and then two i realized most people don't actually who are using these cartridges don't use a nice fancy online purchase battery they use the one that came free in the store the one that costs 10 bucks at the convenience shop or whatever they're not you know out there looking for the best so this is more uh in line with what a lot of people are experiencing uh not that this one's terrible just a standard 510 uh this one is raw garden branded i think it cost me like 12 bucks some number of months ago so uh without further ado let's go ahead and shut up and try this cresco uh critical purple kush half gram cart yummers wow yeah that is pretty good that is a pleasant surprise that that both hit harder than i thought um also came out more than that's a pretty nice hit for a um 510 thread and it was uh quite tasty it didn't taste like any added terpenes um tasted like your good old-fashioned full spectrum there wow yeah this is an unexpected trait this is pretty good stuff um i was not expecting to be as enamored with this as i am um super tasty it's very strong um this is a pretty remarkable amount of draw or um pardon the term cloud for such a small hit watch this not bad at all not bad um feels every bit of that advertise what was it 76 76 and a half percent for sure um and then again very very um nice flavor super smooth um and if you like your cartridges to have a very authentic non-added artificially terpene taste this is gonna do it for you wow this is uh a a nice little surprise i'm i'm quite enjoying this cresco liquid live resin uh and even the cartridge itself is is surprising me in terms of the kind of draws i'm getting here so let's get one board yum well this uh first half of this review is extremely positive but you know you're gonna have to stay tuned for the whole thing because here at wheats we don't just review the first half of our cartridges we do the whole gall darn thing um we do it from top to bottom so that i can come back to you guys give our whole thoughts let you know that the whole thing went through smoothly it never started to burn uh the wick didn't go out the uh didn't start to get clogged all those things that can go wrong with these uh 510 threads make sure we'll give it the whole wheat's review really really looking forward to uh doing so and uh i'm looking forward to come back in here coming right back here to report those results so i will see you guys right back here keep sitting right back here uh in probably a couple of days or so until then take care stay healthy and stay high my friends welcome back guys it has been about 60 hours two and a half days uh since i had started our journey with the cresco rest purple critical purple punch live resin cart uh and i still really enjoyed it uh this is a very good little cart um that oil is uh very quality stuff uh it tastes great um never got this super super hot burnt taste there at the end that you sometimes get you would get those sort of um uh they would burn a little bit hotter at the end but not nothing too much to worry about uh the one thing that i would say to be cautious of uh and i haven't had to say this in a while um is the thing that i brought up in the first half is uh there you're gonna get some unexpectedly big draws off of this uh i was very surprised uh more than once uh sort of devolved into a coughing fit because i took bigger draws than i um intended to i don't actually mean that as uh um a slight against it i i wish actually more carts uh had uh the ability you know you didn't have to uh draw as much on them to get such big hits but this one uh definitely does not have that problem so uh be careful if you're accustomed to other ones this one can give you a huge powerful hit without much effort uh it's not the oil is that much more powerful it's you know good oil but nothing crazy it's just that whatever this card design is airflow or whatever heating element uh causes much larger actual intake than normal uh but i did not think of that as a bad thing i just screwed up my implementation every now and then um so on the whole really really enjoyed this cresco rest critical purple push punch excuse me i assume they probably just have uh hybrid indica and sativa with the generic name but they have different strains it's like this is called the rest but it is also critical purple kush don't quite get that um but what i would get is this cartridge if i saw it again for an affordable price uh i'd love to try their one grams if they have them i'm not sure if they do or not but this half gram was a big thumbs up for me uh again that is the cresco liquid live resin indica rest cartridge pretty good stuff especially if you're a live resin fan well guys that's going to do it for this review here on wheats thanks for staying tuned here till the very end it's been a blast hanging out with you and until our next review guys be sure to stay high and even more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you back here for the next video goodbye", "_fQ7ZBXKNgM": "you [Music] [Music] he's looking for

my oh hey hey I want your seeds hey hey that's all", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "gVRdnEq4in8": "[Applause] today an alarming breaking news report about vaping it's a new piece of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting

making this review possible now y'all know I'm I this is one of my favorite CBD companies their flower is amazing if you haven't seen it reviews are linked I'm at the end and I am so blessed to be able to experience their cartridges yes and it sent over a few but we're gonna take it one by one we ran into Jack come on suck it this is really chop roof I mean we don't get this open all right got it but I like that cuz yeah I can't office yeah let's get into it focus jack herer my same is right Herrera Hera OC so we're getting into Jack Herrera and it's a sativa strain 63% CBD under 0.1% TAC so what it is not going to get you high but it's gonna make you feel a hella good cannabis derived terpenes Oregon made the package is made 400 side plant base yeah I like that it's very serious about the environment so that's your your cart it came with a cap [Music] so with the sativa dominant strain and what do I get from it so piney woodsy kind of tastes like it's really again giving me a herb well I think all of so that what I'm getting from it I got notes is the earthy pine woodsy taste all them to come together this is giving you a look at her beau blend you know when I first started very benign I was like okay this is a little it's kind of little peppery but not so much so I put it more towards to her beau side and for me what it is this a cheaper strain so I found myself to be very focused very focused and I chose us in particular because I was doing before I was getting ready for work and I'm like you know I let me not mess up and do something that's not put me to sleep now I would definitely recommend this if you're about to do some work whether it be gardening whether it be school work because like I said for me it has has it had me focused and I like that and this is something I would do definitely in the morning yeah before I start my day definitely we recommend again it's an earthy Pineywoods he kinda tastes enjoyable you want aces this um see like lesson pressing in here putting it yeah somebody answer I see we burn in your throat yeah yeah this is not this doesn't bring it though that's important so it's smooth yeah it doesn't burn your throat and again this one for me it's just a cheaper so but against the TV affects people differently some people sativa it affects them like it's an indica this just kept me very alert so I definitely recommend that you give them a try I'm really happy that they also do cartridges and we're going to get into more about them so stay tuned you know where you get all the information to get some of your honor

yeah this is the oil and awfully proud what I like about this cartridge it's that when like you do get high it's like a really clean hi I like that and as you can see the oil it's a really good quality oil um what I don't like about this cartridge though is that if I put it too tight on my battery like if I put it all the way so it doesn't move or anything it just doesn't work on my battery as you can see I press it and he just blink I'm gonna take one hit and then I'm gonna go buy food I think I'm gonna get a tropical smoothie [Music] and what I'm just gonna go all right that was like a

simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "Mdj33_JHSDw": "[Music] what's up youtube this is shabazz and i'm back with another cbd hemp flower review what's up to all my cannas sewers hope you're staying healthy hope you're staying safe today we have a new vendor to the channel i've heard about them a couple times there's the biggest company out there but they're not unknown and i do believe that they're a california company so that's cool i'm talking about revel valley now today from revel valley i have a full spectrum cbd cart that's dope there is thc in this it is hopefully you want to be like smoking flower and not just like the cbd isolate carts that most companies sell i also have an eighth of their flower strain is tangy all right so just to start off unfortunately there's no letter to law enforcement it's packaged that's mandatory maybe something to fix rebel valley but let's get into this cart first now as i said almost all of the cbd cartridges vape cartridges that i've tried are all made with isolate meaning that they have zero to very little thc in them which is not cool because cbd does need that little bit of thc as a catalyst so that you can really get the full effects of it and this one right here was a 0.5 milliliter mango skunk is the flavor 200 milligrams of cbd that's great 30 milligrams of cbn wow 1.4 milligrams of thc that's perfect that's a perfect amount of thc especially with all that cbd 49 milligrams of cbc 17 milligrams of cbg so this sounds awesome this sounds like this might be a new favorite product right here the packaging is nothing fancy whatever slides right out here goes the cart right here has that little rubber stopper on there and this is of course a 510 cartridge goes on any of these little 510 vape batteries you already know bam all right mango stump [Music] they didn't overdo it with the terpene it tastes like flour it doesn't taste like sweet candy like a lot of terpene rich cards are you get the slight hint of terps in there i do get that sweet little hint of fruitiness but this really just tastes like flour and it tastes like skunky flour of course this is vapor so it's perfectly smooth no harshness at all [Music] i'll tell you i'm impressed by that that flavor it is not overly done it still tastes natural it still tastes like plant matter with just the tiniest hint of fruitiness on the end [Music] can't wait to see what kind of effects this has and of course you know vaping is always going to be healthier than combusting flour so if you can't smoke or you're just worried about health effects or trying to stay as healthy as possible vape carts like these also dry herb vaporizers are a great option out there that allows you to get the cannabinoids in without actually combusting and inhaling smoke all right i took a few good puffs from this i'm really really interested in seeing what kind of effects it has so i'm gonna take a little break and really let it kick in and analyze what this feels like i'll come back and let you know 11 minutes later all right i'm back now i chilled for the whole duration of the effects i actually went and played a little bit of plunder and war zone let me just tell you the effects that i got from this cbd cartridge that's all i'm asking for in a cbd cartridge it felt like i smoked a few bowls of some good flour it wasn't overwhelming but you could definitely feel it it didn't get me all stoned and dumb feeling like delta 8 and it didn't leave me feeling so much to be desired like a lot of the carts out here that are made with cbd isolate this replicates the effects of smoking flour almost 100 obviously in a convenient and smell-free healthier version i felt super hungry i got the munchies really bad the effects i got from this were i want to say a hybrid effect i didn't feel super energetic or motivated but i also didn't feel drowsy or sedated at all i just kind of felt like a good hybrid feeling like i smoked a couple bowls or a joint or a blunt of some good hybrid flour so i'm definitely going to give this the shabbat silver approval i really really like this and this is definitely my new favorite cbd vape product all right let's get into this flower now this is tangy i did try tangy before from cbd help direct it was pretty good strain pretty good effects nice sativa sativa dominant hybrid effects now on the website it says that this is indoor i highly doubt that but let's look at the test results total thc 0.51 so that's a good mid-range amount of total thc enough to get the job done 11.19 cbd it's not a screaming high amount of cbd but as we've seen here on the channel lately that doesn't always mean a lot so here goes a flower simple packaging they don't brand their packaging or anything just plain mylar bag no smell i don't think this is indoor there must have been a there must have been a mistake on their end when they updated their website or something it's also not price like indoor this is priced really good i i really think the pricing structure on this is good but this is not i mean yeah i bet my bottom dollar this is an indoor it smells pretty decent it has a good kind of light airy citrusy foody smell to it a little bit like sour space candy but it this definitely does smell kind of like that tangy that i have from cbd hemp direct it has that citrusy orangey mandariny smell to it let's get it out onto a tray all right so taking a close look definitely isn't indoor this is outdoor flower for sure i haven't found any signs of seed so if it is seeded it's not heavily seeded the trim looks good it might be a little bit dry but not too bad overall it looks like decent outdoor flower and for the price this makes sense check that out this is just you know this is just some good classic sun grown outdoor flower there's nothing special about it but there's nothing bad about it either all right so so far rebel valley impressed me with their cbd cartridge so i'm anxious to see what their flower is like so let me break this down load it up into the bowl and while i do that i will put a high resolution image [Music] here all right so breaking that down release this super pungent kind of cat piece smell when combined with that fruity smell it smells exactly like as if a cat just walked up and pissed on like a bag of oranges or mandarin oranges or something exactly let's get into it [Music] okay unfortunately it doesn't really taste as good as it smells like i always say my real smokers though it has that potent layer of film kind of left on the back of my throat a little bit harsh not too bad once again a little bit harsh just kind of a neutral mild taste to it i do wish that it had that fruity citrusy terpene taste that it has in the smell [Music] it's definitely a little bit harsh but i'm gonna go ahead and say that's probably because the flower is a little bit dry i think if it was a little bit more reinvigorated it would be easier to smoke so i'm gonna go ahead and give this a a six and a half to a seven on the smoothness scale all right one last hit all right that last hit did get pretty harsh so as it burned down through the ball and really dried out it got really harsh so revel valley first you might want to check on the listing is it outdoor greenhouse indoor make sure you clarify and correct that and also check on the moisture content the humidity level of your storage with your buds i'm expecting a sativa sativa dominant hybrid effect but uh who knows so let me kick back for a little while i'll come back and let you know how i feel a few minutes later all right so the effects that i got and i'm still getting from this tangy is definitely a hybrid effect and i'm not even gonna say sativa dominant i'm gonna say this is like 50 50 hybrid effect because i am getting the slightest amount of pressure in my torso and i am feeling kind of couch lucky but i'm not feeling super drowsy or sedated or sleepy or anything i'm still a little bit energized and motivated but i definitely do feel it in my body my eyelids feel heavy i feel pressure behind my eyes i feel that pushback on my chest so definitely some heavy hybrid effects i don't know why but i feel like this would probably be a really good strain of smoke if you're like at the beach or something it's heavy enough that you're gonna feel it but not super heavy that uh it's gonna kill your time or your mood of what you're doing my only issue with it was that it was so harsh to get down so i think that if that little issue was fixed this would be some really good flower for a very reasonable price [Music] well revel valley you really impressed me with this car flower was decent too but this cart right here is a shining star i love the effects of this i'm gonna keep this handy for sure and i may just check out some more stuff from revel valley in the future before you click away from the video make sure you go down in the description check out the link for the merch where you can find shirts like the one

couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other questions leave them in the comments below let us know subscribe to god vape for more videos like this thanks for watching peace", "y3Bjg6nlYyY": "what's up everyone john here from respect my region and today we have another west coast wii tour review and we are going to be doing a vape review we have a tomahawk 510 cartridge from napalm it's a live resin diamonds they're one gram cartridge so let's read a little bit about we'll see what they got on the back here it says tomahawk live resin diamonds vape cartridge 69.01 percent thc 0.78 cbd and one point seven two percent total thc um weight one grant net weight and then just tells you the total weight with the cart um twist the cartridge onto the compatible 510 thread battery and draw from the mouthpiece to start vapor flow repeat until desired effect is achieved so um pretty vague on the information on the box but the box itself looks [ __ ] stunning i mean look at this napalm it has nice raised edges you just like grab this and this really does feel like a luxury cannabis experience you know you buy this and you feel like you spent your money well i guess is the the best way to put this so napalm is partners um with exhibit exhibit is behind napalm cannabis and he fancies himself a firearm if you've ever watched excuse me if you ever watch exhibit on his instagram he's always shooting all kinds of guns and so the brandy napalm cannabis the grenade pre-roll it all kind of makes sense you know all kind of based off like military hardware um so i'm gonna go ahead and slide this open and a nice slide box boom and right there we got a nice nice the cartridge is beautiful with the green um some of these are orange too so it just kind of matches with what the strain is you've got the green branded flame look we can really see the color of the oil this is a gram cartridge i have smoke been smoking on this i was on vacation in wenatchee so um yeah but you can as you can see the color of the oil is really translucent really good definitely looks like live resin let's see if we can see it move that's the other key with live resin is you want to be able to see it move like with your eyes and yep it's definitely um moving in there you can see the the liquid is starting to go to the top of the cartridge so i'm going to go ahead and pull off these little rubber stoppers scroll this onto my battery you never want to over twist so once it's on it's just boop stop most vape pens click five times and it's on let's see what's up super turpy terps hit your back your throat you definitely i have no idea um what the tomahawk is what if that's like a into mix meaning they just took two different types of starting material and blended it during the extraction process i'm not sure if tomahawk is is a strain of theirs one of their uh you know flagship strains but i definitely get like a really florally earthy taste it's nothing spectacular but it's really smooth and yeah let's go down this uh the rating score 10 point that's a 10 categories 100 point rating system let's see what's going down presentation presentation i got to go with 10 it looks wonderful from the sliding it out with just the the little raised edges of the flames and the whole the gold trim it looks different it stands out and that's and uh you know napalm cannabis it's easy to remember it sticks in your head so yeah i'll give the presentation a ten product appeal nine um i i think it would get a little bit higher if there was a little bit more information about the oil in it about the the strain that went into the oil it says live resin diamonds but uh you know a lot of people don't even know what live resin diamonds are honestly so i would like to know a little bit more about the strain and stuff to to maybe get that perfect that perfect product appeal score color yeah you know you go with a nine it looks really really good the oil is just uh fantastic it looks really good nine color i did color smell um you can't really smell you know i don't really get like a turpy smell through the car or anything like that but when you rip it you just get like a basic vape oil smell it doesn't smell crazy terpe so i go five taste seven i said didn't blow me away by any means the taste uh i didn't really get like a potent terpy taste potency uh i would give this this is gonna get a good potency for i'd give it a nine um i started smoking this last week i ran out of dabs and i switched to my pen and this more than got me where i needed to go um when i wasn't smoking on dabs you know five or six rips of that and i was blazed for sure so high potency score experience um i'm gonna give the experience a seven i definitely didn't hate it but i definitely didn't love it you know i wish i just got more flavor when i think right live resin i just think of crazy terpy flavors and i just kind of got like a basic vape distillate taste you know didn't really give me the live resin experience more information they definitely give me all the basics about you know manufacturing packaging things like that i wish i got a strain lineage more information maybe about what live resident diamonds are somewhere on the packaging you know they have two boxes you could put some stuff right here just because uh you know then the knowledge around extracts is still very um niche in a lot of ways and so i would like brands to take that step up to educate the consumers more on their packaging would you recommend i actually would recommend this though i would give this you know not a strong mega recommendation but i definitely you know my friend hit me up was like yo what do you think about napalm cannabis i'm like bro you should probably get one of those you know live resin diamonds cards because they are nice they look cool the the cartridge itself is is awesome like the design behind this is very cool it looks cool so yeah definitely a seven on the recommendation and overall yeah stick with the seven as well like i said the flavors didn't blow me away but the quality is obviously present so i think napalm cannabis is definitely on the right track to um you know just absolutely crushing the game and that's all i have for you today make sure to like the video subscribe to the channel uh check out respectmyregion.com on youtube because we have a bunch of content coming soon video content and make

minutes without removing them from vendor-supplied foam blocks we'll show you how in the demo for now let's do the math 50 carts in 2 minutes 1500 carts an hour 12,000 filled cartridges in a single eight-hour day from single a 10 hotshot system reason to control and precision fill any volume cart from point 3 3 grams to one full gram with total volume control in point 0 1 gram increments point

precision flexibility you're 100 percent card filling solution our new 810 hotshot systems are available in two models and both are detailed at hotshot cool jars comm check them out right now however there's a lot to know about the new a 10 and you probably have some questions so here's an in-depth up-close very detailed look how to put our new hotshot to work let's start with system setup this is the super speed 810 hotshot 1500 the fastest of the two models cool jars offers it weighs around 15 pounds and takes up about 2 square feet of table space just make sure it's on a stable level surface to start find the 16 ounce bottle of blue heat transfer fluid and pour the entire contents into the blue reservoir now slide the Innova stainless-steel immersion heating element into the reservoir twisting slightly to make sure it's fully seated positioned correctly you'll see three dimples level with the top of a reservoir next mount our black nonstick oil tank onto the a10 to ensure proper connection align this white cam with the slot in the a10 press down firmly until seated then turn clockwise to lock in place here's something that will interest you our oil tanks features self sealing one-way check valve so you can swap out tanks and batches mid run to remove the tank turn counterclockwise to unlock then pull straight up model 1500 comes with two oil tanks and you can order additional tanks as an option more about swapping tanks later next install an a-10 oil injection needle our component kit contains needles of varying sizes which gives you options to fit style cards your filling we suggest you select the shortest length you can to lessen pressure on internal piston assembly and thread the needle into port and use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit to tighten being careful not to over tighten now install your selected fill switch in our high-performance model 1502 options are available our new button activated speed tray plus our foot activated fill pedal both options plug into the USB port on the left front side of the a10 we'll use our new speed tray for purposes of this demonstration next connect power source plug the round mail and the power transformer into the rear of the a10 control box now plug the transformer and the Innova heating element into a switched power surge strip that's rated for at least 10 amps that's it for system setup let's talk about operation first activate the a-10 system by powering up the surge strip now power up the Innova heating element by pressing the red button on front of the display panel the button will display white when activated quick note press and hold this button for a few seconds to switch readings from Fahrenheit to Celsius press and hold again to switch back select whichever scale you prefer now pour desired amount of batch oil into the nonstick tank it will hold any amount up to one thousand grams per tank cover with lid next adjust system operating temperature using the thumb wheel on front of the Innova display rolled up to increase roll down to decrease you can adjust the Nova in 1/2 degree increments an initial setup adjust he's set into 170 degrees Fahrenheit to fully heat the a-10 system and set the onboard heat switch this is important when the a-10 system is fully heated actual oil temperature will be anywhere from twenty to thirty degrees lower than the Innova setting depending on viscosity of oil use a heat gun to determine the actual oil temperature then adjust the Innova as necessary to reach your desired oil temperature once the a-10 system is activated the main touchscreen will light up the screen will not show operational controls until a system and oil are fully heated if attempts are made to operate system prior to heating this waiting for heater message will be displayed when operational controls appear on the touch screen the a-10 is ready for use use a test screen for all inputs first select this casa t from one of three options available on the model 1500 olive oil glycerin and honey select the option that best describes the estimated miss custody of your batch at fil temperature now select shot size from one of three options point three three grams point five grams at one gram a custom setting is also available volumes are adjustable in point zero one gram increments next select speed using the up and down arrows on the five bar graph each bar represents a 20% increase or decrease in fill speed finally select end count to input the number of fills you wish to perform once desired fill count is reached the a 10 will stop flow of oil to reset press hole to reset for a few seconds to zero out the reading with these few settings in place they're ready to go following initial setup first prime or purge 18 system by holding a container under needle and pressing fill switch several times until oil is dispensed returned priming oil to main tank so you don't waste it next test cartridge fill volume using a very precise scale weigh the container you're using to prime the system inject a shot then weigh container again the difference will be the shop volume repeat as necessary adjusting volume on touchscreen to achieve desired amount adjustments can be made in point 0 1 gram increments as an alternative volume testing procedure way an empty cart before and after filling and make any necessary adjustments once made these volumes will remain consistent throughout the batch now let's fill some cards the a-10 model 1500 features a new high volume speed tray with a button activated fill switch it is really really fast to use it cut a typical vendor-supplied 100 card foam block in half and place a 50 cart block in speed tray this lets you fill carts directly in the block instead of removing and filling one by one now position needle in corner cart inject pre-measured fill using onboard switch and move on to the next cart you will be absolutely amazed at the speed you can achieve with our new 8n hotshot with speed tray once comfortable with the process you can typically fill this tray of 50 carts and something under 2 minutes even a 2 minutes per tray that's 1,500 carts an hour and that's 12,000 carts a day if you prefer to use our foot-activated fill switch there's no need to cut a hundred cart foam block unless you prefer to fill smaller quantities so you can cap them quicker simply position the foam block under injection arm insert needle in the corner cart depress foot pedal to inject each shot and move on when you fill 50 cards on one side reverse block and Faure it could not possibly be quicker and easier incidentally flow rates will depend on a number of factors including viscosity of oil heat of oil size of carts etc you can fine-tune your fills by adjusting viscosity speed and shot size settings to achieve optimum flow rate finally we'd like to show you a few quick procedures that will keep your oil processing operation running smoothly first a quick needle change demo use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit unscrew the needle and return the kit insert new needle tighten lightly with tool and you're good to go next a tank change if you're changing in the middle of a batch run the tank will be warm so make sure you're wearing gloves turn tank counterclockwise to unlock and pull straight up a check valve will stop the flow of oil though you may have a few residual drops to wipe up now insert a fresh tank it can be empty full or partially full twist a lock and you're ready to rock fix maybe 30 seconds since we're talking about the tank if you wish to do a total clean-out and would like to replace oring in the valve first remove tank as previously described and empty remove valve with three-quarter inch socket using six in one tool in the kit without the bit push up spring-loaded valve to reveal Oh ring remove old ring with a single edge razor blade replace the spare o-ring in the kit we install valve with socket and you're done additional earrings are available on our website if you're having problems achieving a consistent shot size it may be a partial blockage of the upper or lower valve due to oil residue here's how to replace both for the upper valve remove tank as previously demonstrated and use supplied socket drive to remove valve model 1500 comes with replacement valves so look for one in the kit screw into place tighten lightly with socket drive replace tank reprime system is described previously and continue filling procedures finally here's how to replace a lower valve remove tank as previously demonstrated using Philips screw bit on the 61 tool in your kit unscrew the 90 degree bulkhead on front of the injection arm next use the hex wrench to loosen the two screws on either side of the arm and slide injection arm straight out using the six in one tool without the screw bit carefully unscrew the lower valve reverses procedure to install that's all there is to it as mentioned early on our new cool drawers Hot Shot cart filling systems deliver the speed precision and flexibility you need to achieve optimum profitability from oil product lines and here's something else to consider if you're like most current 810 users you have at least one filling system gathering dust on your shelf because it just flat doesn't get it done enough you've tried the rest not ordered the best the all-new cool jars a

90 cbd and 95 total cannabinoids that's almost double from our previous batches hang on charlie i don't think they heard that right play it again for the people in the back averaging about 90 cbd and 95 total cannabinoids yeah you heard that right our team was able to create a high potency formulation that is a single source true full spectrum crystal resistant distillate with live cannabis terpenes this means that our oil is naturally distilled from the plant and not some concoction of isolated compounds thrown together in a lab like almost all cbd isolate-based vape pens we are also able to leave as much thc in there as we legally can around 0.25 since we are big believers in the benefits of full spectrum oils cbd distillate usually starts to crystallize when the oil reaches 60 potency and beyond because of its molecular structure however we figured out a way to naturally maintain the distillate in its oil form without adding any artificial ingredients or cutting agents like mct or vitamin e finally we introduce real cannabis derived terpenes extracted from freshly frozen cannabis plants in their live state pre-harvest and cure giving our vapes a true-to-plant taste and authentic farm-fresh cannabis experience i have with me here today two of our newest full-spectrum cbd vape pens white fire og and gelato 33. that rhymed lit let me unpack these and give them a try

there like that the lettering and we're gonna open this up and i do want to tell you guys a couple of things about these cards and say what i'd not like about one that the oil of the wax moves quite fast you know you guys i'm gonna say that right off the bat as you guys can see look at the oil it moves quite fast a little faster than the krtz you know but the characters don't even move or the mohammed's don't even move but these you can tell when they move especially when you hit them it gets really hot and yeah you guys the wack starts moving like crazy but that's one thing i do not like about these cards when you're taking many hits and you're doing consistent hits you know of course the wax is going to come out of the freaking circle where you inhale right but once you stop you know smoking it some of the wax stays stuck onto like the cart of the tip and you can see right through it as you guys can see you guys this is like see-through you can see right through it but you can see the wax later on when you're emptying the cart you can see the wax stuck onto the edge of the tips of right here like everything around where my finger is as you guys can see everything around this whole part you can see and i'm gonna show you guys what i mean in a little bit but as always yeah we're gonna review the flavor from one to ten high white flavor-wise and i like how the wax moves fast you know and i do not like how the center inside the wax stay stuck onto the tip you know the wax um smoke it reflects and turns into a wax on the tip see but i'm gonna take a couple hits you guys let's just get right into it this is a apple flare review let's get it it tastes kind of weird hey guys it tastes [ __ ] weird i'm not like it does not taste like apple but see what i mean by the wax moving fast like let me show you guys that's what i mean by the wax moving fast the wax is running quite fast we're gonna take another hit but the waxes went quite fast i could see it in my screen i might i don't know if you guys can tell on camera i'm gonna take another hit it does not taste like apple flare i'm already telling you the flavor is disgusting is zero out of ten i do not like it tastes like nothing near apple flavor normally it tastes like a tropical you know and just tastes awfully disgusting you guys and i don't like it but now the high is like whatever i guess it could be a 6 out of 10 but the flavor is really disgusting i don't know i like it this is the downside to these cards and i like these pushcarts are not okay you know i don't know like um so far i smoked a couple of them and i like i have reviews on those i will be uploading those sometime soon but i'm not sure when but i want to show you guys this one in particular because i've already smoked a lot of them and i want to you know give my honest opinions about these and these are not going good for me you guys i'm being real with y'all and i like them much but we're gonna take another hair you guys make sure you guys have that wax out and yeah just know i'm not enjoying this hit [ __ ] it yep kind of does taste this [ __ ] raw apple not gonna [ __ ] lie you guys but this was the apple flare review guys i do not like it and the high is six out of ten like i said and the flavor is zero out of ten i don't know i like it this [ __ ] is wack i'm not gonna lie these push cards i'm not liking them you guys i'm just being real with y'all i have smoked a couple of them there's only one that i kind of did like but overall it's still [ __ ] i do want to say that it's been a couple hours since i last said that word yeah [ __ ] the last one you guys heard me say was [ __ ] from the last clip that cut off but it's been a couple hours like i'll say five out of four hours i'm not sure like to say six max no more but as you guys can see i smoked a lot of it not really i've been normally [ __ ] around with it i do not like this car i like the way apple flair tastes it tastes really disgusting you guys literally look at this you guys so did you get remember i told you guys earlier in the video that the wax stays stuck onto the the cart into the tip right here yeah you guys right there look at the cart on the tip i do want to show you guys the q-tip right there but look i'll put the q-tip and you can tell and there's wax right there like see look it's just and another thing to look i'm gonna show you guys that i'm just gonna press the button and you guys gonna see it preheat hopefully you guys could see that as you guys can see that right you see that preheats and but overall i'm not [ __ ] with this or these cards really you know i don't like them the wax moves fast i'm gonna do a time lapse and see how fast it moves even though i'm talking right now it's gonna be moving quite fast i'm not gonna lie i do not like these kind of cards but as you guys can tell these cards are practically most likely fake when they move fast like this you guys get the melody you guys the [ __ ] wax moves fast as hell i do not [ __ ] with these cards overall letting you guys know i do not like them i don't know like it's hard practically with smoking them i've just been pressing it and letting the wax freaking hit like that you know as you guys can see look at it the smoke is coming out as i'm pressing the button right but i'm not inhaling that or nothing not hypothetically i was smoking it i was smoking a little bit of it just to get slightly a little high but as you guys can see there's a bunch of wax stuck onto the tip inside the cart and that wax stays stuck into your mouth when you're inhaling you guys and i'm not like that [ __ ] i don't [ __ ] with these cards i don't like them i would say let's do one more blinky when i end this video but we're not going to take any more blinkers because i do not want to feel that [ __ ] nasty taste in my mouth but just for the video i guess i'll do blinker you know [ __ ] it it is most likely a fake heart it is a counterfeit and i like these cards this is the first time i've ever tried them if this brand if you ever smoked this brand let me know if you guys ran into this kind of counterfeit or do you guys have this kind of problem you know in the comment section below if you smoke this kind of cart or this you know whatever you want to call it you know push carts you know it's just yeah prophetic i don't [ __ ] like them this is my first time ever trying them and i don't like them [ __ ] that let's just do the blinker i guess [ __ ] it there's no it's not bad you know you guys as i'm taking it but it's just i don't like [ __ ] smoking cards that wax moves fast because the oil is not thick it is not good if it's not good i don't want to smoke it but we're just gonna do it [ __ ] it let's get it i peed my lungs it takes nasty you guys spit in the toilet right there you guys but i hope you guys have a safe and amazing day stay blessed don't stress as always peace the [ __ ] out subscribe

little family the son of a farmer just like us they lived in a village that sat at the foot of a gigantic volcano and the village was protected by an elite group of czar Thomas called the mighty help young rock have wanted nothing more than to be part of the mighty hem he was told that he was too scrawny and weak to protect the village [Music] but Rocco wouldn't take no for an answer [Music] then one fateful day the volcano erupted the molten lava poured down the side of the volcano and try as they might the mighty helm couldn't figure out a way to save the village they had to evacuate but the village ponies didn't want to leave their homes they spent their entire lives there they had nowhere else to go [Music] so what cook decided to do something crazy he thought if he could divert the flow the Lhasa he might be able to save his  he started digging a trench wait a minute all by himself it'd be impossible for one Pony to dig a trench fast enough to stop the lava even I couldn't do that good thing Rock who didn't believe in the word impossible he continued to work no one else here against me but determined to push through something magical happened [Music] rough-cut visibly strong but the lava was getting closer [Music] [Applause] through his extraordinary determination and sheer force of will Rock hoof more than earned his place in the mighty head good story Applejack

behind it and what you do is you just pull this glass tube out of here you see this little little bubbler here it goes all the way down you want you see this ring here you want to seat that ring right to where that silicone is eventually you're gonna fill this up with water here when you're ready to use it right now we'll just go ahead and attach it in here just squeeze it down push it down gently

your day Chivas vape supplies that kind of everyday", "RQw25ed-2c0": "welcome to the shed this eye style images coming at you with another product review this one I never even heard of this company before I don't know other than the guy I picked it up from I don't know anybody else that has ever bought this this brand or ever at a house party or anything you know there's no idea it's getting a little a little stuck now just so you can see from my bounnam Pro like sticks right there now I don't really [ __ ] need it but it comes in handy so this is super Lemon Haze it is not platinum veins for the one guy that I asked me to do the Platinum babes one I did a super lemon haze in the MKX card so I believe it was and now this one is cure super haze C so cartridge 510 threads you know the normal really unless you're getting a pod or something no no the kid I got this from was telling me how the oil is really thick and it takes a while for the bubble to move he said it took like a half hour for him to get the bubble to move from the side to the top it was in my pocket for not that very long and the bubble moved so not fast so I'll show you that in a second so on the label I get a batch test number tested by steadfast love labs I get a test number a test date 224 20 20 this is from one six eight zero market a vase City Michigan four eight 706 one Graham says activation time immediate but nowhere on this entire box does it tell me anything about percentages of THC so I'd have to look that up myself so I'm going to attempt to do that in a little bit and then I'll throw that in the description below you kind of see it in the shiny part it's a sativa and it's got the little little push button right here it's got the little weed logo poison control number we're gonna try to do this as easy as I can it was giving me difficulties earlier oh so this box reminds me of like the rogue watches that I see people doing reviews on I've never had one of those so I don't know anything about them other than I've seen packages from watching real man he smokes he did a lot of Rose cards so I've heard from the kids that I got these from but you know at the end of the day the salesman he's not gonna tell me something bad per se he told me that these are really good he enjoyed them every one he sold one to really enjoy them so we're just gonna get into this and formulate our own opinion pretty fruity on the on the dry head so you know it's got the the gold colored thread stuff in the mouthpiece the glass on the center just a seashell on the one on the bottom it says three when sea for three nine zero doesn't have the cush logo and it doesn't have the little fire looking symbol that the the Jupiter symbol or juniper one of the two I forget I kept saying Jupiter I think it's juniper um a little logo that they put on the bottom so we're gonna then turn this on nowhere on here did I see anything about bolts so we're gonna drop this back to the three point two that I usually run it instead of the three point seven for the Presto cards raise that up drop it down let's give this go and see what we got pretty tasty get a slight bit of that burn back here like you get from some cards usually I get that closer towards the end of a card or unless it's like a really earthy flavored one is sit back here or usually the coils burnt out and I'm getting like a real gross harsh flavor in the back of the neck throat I mean say yeah I'll say that's pretty tasty for being a company I've never dealt with before you know you get a little you get a little area because I don't want to pick up stuff like the myth next track ones that I got the one time that I didn't enjoy at all four flavors did enjoy them at all this one's actually not bad at all oh I'll have to wait and see you know just the type of high that it's gonna give me my eyes are watering a little bit I think I got something actually in this eye cuz I can feel it dry like up in here but yeah I would use this brand again I see no no reason not to now most are you gonna sit here and ask me hey how do you feel that these compared to say platinum based MK Church any of the other bigger named ones I would say this is it's not better than a lot of the Platinum vapes I've had this specific one um but it's right on par with a lot of the other platinum base I've had it I would say it's no worse just there's certain flavors and the Platinum vapes that I just really really like purple champagne purple pawnch Sunday driver galactic jack those were usually my top five I would definitely get this specific flavor again and I'm definitely willing to try this company a few more times the guy go through happens to have a few more these and I will do my best to get my hands on another one who's got cherry pie gelato blue dream is another one he's got but most of them are indicas and I was looking for a sativa at the time so that's why this one got chose blue dream he told me tasted really really good too so I may try to get my hands on that so one cuter boom super Lemon Haze you're on the channel can't wait to check out some all your products and give some more reviews taystee um so with that being said well try these if you can I can't tell you specifically that every flavor is good and every single car it's gonna be top-notch but as of right now one-for-one peace out guys like sub comment hit the bell for future videos and got a couple more reviews to do here in a little bit catch you guys in the next one peace out", "cior4pVoKCA": "hi guys I'm Dan HOF chief operating officer of honey stick and today we're gonna give you guys from popular demand a little tutorial on 510 thread stick vape batteries now we've been getting a lot of questions on what the differences are between different types of stick batteries so this quick video is gonna give you guys a nice little tutorial about what the key differences are between stick batteries and a lot of these we actually do sell so the first question is what is 510 thread 510 thread is the actual thread adapter that is used by a majority of vape cartridges these are cartridges they're prefilled with CBD or different medical oils that you can pick up at your dispensary and what companies will do is they will pre-fill these so that you buy just a cartridge and then you go and purchase and attach it to your own battery in order for you to be able to vape so 99% of the cartridges sold in dispensaries and CBD shops use what is called a 5-10 thread which is actually just the threading of the cartridge now not only do prefilled cartridges use this but a lot of just vape products like even slim wax adapters like our silencer they also use a 5-10 thread so they can appeal for the dabbing crowd so once you've figured out what you want to vape then it comes down to picking your battery and what the differences are between your batteries and what i've done is i've narrowed them down to four main types of batteries the first one and one of our most popular ones is the twist style battery so it has a 5-10 thread which will allow you to screw in the cartridge like for example our performance cartridge to screw that into the battery so it has a 5-10 thread adapter there or an end right there it has a push button which means that you have to push hold the button throughout your inhale and because it's a twist battery it has a little twist knob here that allows you to adjust the intensity of your vape and this one goes between 2 volts and 4 volts 4 volts being higher giving you greater intensity now how do you turn this battery on once you have your vape Karcher attached you simply push this button 5 times to turn it on 1 2 3 4 5 and you see it's gonna flash and that means that you are ready to vape once your cartridge is on there now most of these twist batteries ours included does have a preheat function on it for when you're using a cartridge for the first time there's thick materials in there that need to be preheated before you can vape and that's achieved by pushing the button when it's on twice in succession so you push it twice rapidly one two and you see the LED is changing colors there that means there's going through a low voltage preheat to get your cartridge right of vaping at any time during the preheat you can push the button to exit so that is our twist battery it is very simple to use not a lot of clicking adjustable power there nice 510 battery these are a high capacity and they come in several colors I brought along the multicolor in the red and we actually even just launched a brand new carbon fiber version which it uses real carbon fiber so there's a real carbon fiber version right here the other battery is a 5-10 variable voltage non twist battery so you have your 510 adapter here that you can screw your cartridges into or of a products that you buy like for example your prefilled cartridge show you guys we're prefilled one looks like so here's a pretty little prefilled cartridge simply screw it on in there this one is a variable voltage but it's a non twist this is actually a pass-through as you can see a pass-through meaning that the charging port is here at the bottom so you can actually if you're vaping and it's running down or you're one of those people who works at your desk or in your car you can have it plugged into microUSB have the battery on in succession while you're charging the battery which means you don't have to take off the cartridge to screw in a charger so this one does not have a twist function on it this has just a button but you still have variable voltage and preheat the difference is is that you would change the voltage by clicking the buttons and Wogan that so to turn the unit on you click the button five times rapidly one two three four five as you see it blinks right there now it's on if you wanted to go in to preheat as we do it the other battery same thing push the button two times one two and you can see the LED again is going into the color change mode you can exit that at any time to get out of preheat mode and if you want to change the voltage what you do is you push the button three times quickly one two three and what you'll notice is that the LED changes different color now what that signifies there is that now you're on a different voltage level so your power intensity has been adjusted and this battery actually comes with three voltage settings three different intensity levels and you can cycle through them by just clicking the button three times one two three now you see the LED turn blue so blue red and green so that shows your variable voltage nan twist five ten stick battery for your reference the other battery that I've outlined is a 5-10 thread a lot of people refer to this as a stylus because it has a little stylus tip that people used to use for their Palm Pilots and you could use for your cell phones and touchscreen devices but as you will notice this battery is a standard it's a buttonless battery so it doesn't have a button on it so what you do is when you put your cartridge on there you don't have to turn it on or anything like that just make sure it's charged all you have to do is inhale so it's a different action you don't push and hold the button throughout the duration your vape as the other two batteries we showed you you just simply inhale and it will turn it on a couple of things to point out at this battery so a lot of companies do sell batteries like this we don't because for auto draws to fire ceramic cartridges they have to be much more powerful and we offer auto draw models like our elf concealers and elf twist but they provide a lot more power so they can fire ceramic cartridges that have thick heaters this little battery doesn't have much power to fire some of the more modern cartridges the other thing is it to be Auto draw it requires your cartridges to have an air hole at the bottom like this one let's see if we can zoom in to make sure people see that there's an air hole here so this cartridge has an air hole which means that when you inhale it lets the air travel through the cartridge which then reacts with a little sensor microphone in the battery that signals the battery to turn on into vaporize now if we take a look at these two cartridges we'll notice that they don't have air holes so you would technically not be able to use these two cartridges on this Auto draw battery stylus battery when you would be able to vape them just fine with the twist batteries I showed you before or the non twist variable voltage battery that I showed you just before that so that's just a little bit to keep in mind when you're selecting your 5/10 or your perfect 510 third stick battery now the last battery that's pretty popular is this ego style battery now this is a 510 and also stick battery and I see a lot of people carrying these with cartridges that ask however you'll see this is a little bit different than this because look at the the difference this this right here is flattened flush where you screw the cartridge in and this one kind of pokes out and you have this exposed piece that's because there's two different 510 threads is your standard 510 cartridge thread so it's your 510 C thread and this one is your 510 ego thread an ego thread means that there used to be cartridges for a liquid that would screw on to the exterior of this and make an interior connection so you can use it with the older style eliquid tanks as well as with prefilled cartridges well you'll notice is if you're really into just prefilled cartridges is when you screw it into this ego tank it this transition looks a little funky it'll still work and they work good but you'll see that this just doesn't look that nice it looks like I need like a transition piece of metal there like a skirt or something like that and you know this is a fatter battery so as you could see the widths don't exactly line up like other tanks like this you'll see it's a much smoother transition it looks like they're all one piece versus like this now there's lots of ego batteries on the market there's ones that have twist knobs there's ones that are longer the thing is that you can these are about 500 milliamp hour batteries for so that's a pretty good decent capacity for a battery these ones are usually between 350 and 650 they're this size you can get longer ones or all the way up to 1200 or 1100 milliamp hours so you can get ultra high-capacity powerful fat ego batteries like this but one of the trade-offs is if you do use a lot of cartridges they're not gonna line up they're not gonna look a hundred percent with these stick batteries they line up so you can use all different types of heating materials like ceramic cartridges standard a stainless steel or organic cotton coil cartridges you can use high performance ceramic like our performance tank you can even use wax tanks like our silencer with these little 510 thread batteries so we hope that today's video was useful in showing you guys the differences between the different 510 thread battery types and we familiarize you with some of the pros and cons are of each one so when you are on the market trying to pick up a 5-10 thread stick battery you can see some of these differences and figure out which

cartridge glass in the process or your oil cartridges almost empty you just want to get those small remnants just below the airflow hole or maybe a cartridge is faulty and it just hasn't worked from the start here's a few quick reasons why you shouldn't throw away your cartridges just yet so the easiest way to get the most oil out of your cartridge is with a syringe but let's say we don't have one so we're gonna resort to some more primitive methods but first you're gonna need a few things plastic bowl ziplock bag a microwave and a sheet of foil you can also use a zig zag paper rolls if you don't have any foil if you want to transfer oils from one cartridge to another then you're gonna need a new empty cartridge too if your cartridge glass is shattered into pieces you run the risk of transferring oils with small shards in them and I don't recommend that but if it's just cracked and it's leaky then it shouldn't work all the same just be gentle with it but first put the oil cartridge that you want to transfer oil from into a ziploc bag and zip it up and set it aside for right now second is to get your plastic bowl and fill it with water then take it and put into the microwave for about two to three minutes or until you see it's steamy third step is to take the bowl out for the microwave and place the bag with the cartridge inside of it again make sure that's airtight so no water gets in and just pop it in there for about 2 minutes place the sheet of foil down on a flat clean surface this will act as your work station to catch any oils and then take the mouthpiece off of the cartridge and make sure that the heating post is exposed after about two minutes of the cartridge being inside the water bowl take it out remove the mouthpiece usually use a napkin or towel because it's gonna be hot and once the mouthpiece is off flip it upside down directly mirroring of the cartridge below and just set it right on top and I promise you that the balancing act is a lot more easier than it looks make sure not to get any oils down the heating post because that's where the airflow comes from heat makes oil less viscous and allows it to run so the oil should just slide right into the cartridge if you don't want to transfer your oils to another cartridge you can just put them directly on a cake batter or cookie dough you can also place the cartridge upside down on the foil to let it catch the oils and use it for later sort of the refrigerator use it for dabbing or use a dab tool to peel it off and put on your dry herbs once your oils are transferred to the new cartridge place the mouthpiece back on and you're ready to date so we hope this video was helpful to you guys if you have any other questions please leave them down in the

that's just keep that in mind just you know do your own research where there's a will there's a way get get resourceful i had a friend who who had the cartridges so i got lucky with that i don't really know where he got them all right so i'm not really like in a very talky make a video mood but i wanted to document my trip so uh if you don't mind i'm just gonna get to it and then if i feel like speaking about it later i will speak about it later but maybe i'll just do that tomorrow or something i just wanted to film the actual trip itself because i just wanted to trip tonight you know you get it you know what i'm trying to say so so we'll see or i might end up talking afterwards i don't know sometimes i have a trip and it's just so like intense i just sort of feel like waiting a bit like i said in my last video i lost the mouthpiece the tip just the tip i lost and um so i have to like make sure my lips go around it you know so that's why i'm hitting it funny if it looks like i'm hitting it funny and i'm gonna lie down i prefer to lie down usually sometimes i sit up but usually i'm like taking a hit or something and i got to deal with that so it's nice to have the pen i can just lie down and put it in here after i that's why i got this because because the tip is missing it will leak out if i hold it upside down so i gotta like keep it upright that's not quite small enough actually i'll put this cloth in here there we go genius such a genius okay guys thanks for watching the video i do lots of videos like this so check out my channel for more trip reports and stuff like that and um there's music and there's just you know okay boys and girls i bid you farewell is that that's that is that what they say it's an old english thing right i bid the i bid the farewell okay i think that's about it i'm ready i'm tired i find dmt is good if you're like tired and getting ready for bed if you're relaxed skip you're in a relaxed mood for sure i'm stalling i'm stalling [Applause] here we go [Music] uh [Music] huh [Music] [Music] so [Music] sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep [Music] um [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um oh my god you guys oh my god [Music] oh [Music] oh my god [Music] it was pointing at me it told me oh my god you guys [Music] the coordinates tracking my like eye movement i'm just saying this so i don't forget later sorry if it doesn't make sense the coordinates it's pointing out to me what the fuck it's trying to decide whether or not to close my eyes it's always something i struggle with and when i was doing that it felt like the trip was getting mad at me and then when i just and then i decided to leave them open and i think i was telling it was telling me like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter like nothing you say or do matters really it's in control always and my god the further i get away from it the less ability i have to describe what i just saw fuck still really high i wasn't blacking out at any point but like i still can't it's like it's trying to make me forget like i saw how the universe worked there's some being that can just do whatever it wants whenever it wants it can move wherever it wants and just you know i saw different reality different universes multiverses and just oh my god maybe the details will come like what the fuck i kept saying too like i should talk about this because i'm gonna i'm gonna forget later but i'm like no no i'll remember i'll remember it all makes sense and then just every minute that goes by makes it's less and less sense but i just saw what the fuck [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] watch i wasn't recording this whole time i'm still recording thank god well that was cool i just saw the universe work to you guys and it looked like it was like okay hear me out it's not gonna make much sense but this is the best i can describe it like every universe was on like a string and it was like sort of moving they were sort of moving towards me like they're all connected but when i was trying to decide whether to open or close my eyes this like entity came it was invisible an invisible entity but i could sense it was there and where it was it suddenly moved like through the realities and was getting mad at me it's like it came from wherever it was all the way here to tell me that sorry let me just mute my music i came from wherever just just to tell me like just to tell me where was i holy fuck this is so hard to talk about i came oh yeah i came from wherever was just to tell me it doesn't matter like when my eyes are open or closed like stop thinking about all that stupid shit and i didn't see any entities as usual i don't see entities sometimes i do they're usually robots but uh this time it wasn't except that that that entity i guess you would call it but it was like invisible and then also when it was telling me not to um it doesn't matter if your eyes are open and closed it wasn't telling it to me it was telling it to something else i don't know what that was and i was just like obser observing that that that message what was it talking to like maybe my brain and i the observer like the soul i guess you can refer to it as or whatever was the one observing that you know which sort of like lends to the idea like the separation of body and soul you know like two separate things like you and your life aren't the same thing look at this pose i'm sitting in this very i don't know it feels right though okay i'm not a two-year-old sit like a man oh where did this come from was i holding this the whole time i don't know i don't know i just don't know um the visuals are very cool like yeah i realize now definitively i know now it doesn't matter if your eyes are open or closed people always have that debate if you smoke enough um like maybe it will vary the experience but it not the intensity of it or how good it is necessarily you know like if you smoke enough if your eyes are open it'll take whatever you're looking at and transform that into whatever so like i was looking at you know my room became all multiple universes like on a thread like reeling past me and then this fucking being darting around it was like this that was like the master i don't want to say god because it wasn't that it didn't seem benevolent either it didn't seem evil but it just it seemed like it was getting shit done it was busy and it didn't it seemed a little angry that it had to be there to tell me like deal with this trivial shit like it had better things to do i got the sense and it's like you know tell this idiot whoever it was talking to he doesn't need to or he wasn't he didn't call me an idiot but i got the sense that he was frustrated like short he she whatever it and um it was like yeah tell tell him it doesn't matter you know or it wasn't even saying tell him it was just talking to him it was like it doesn't matter and i was just like observing it and i didn't hear those words it was just i got the sense that's what uh it was trying to communicate to my body or whatever it was talking to um the visuals like afterwards and then before that seems like a short trip also i start talking like while i'm still tripping and i think that's what sort of takes me out of it because i'm like aware i wasn't for a second or two but i'm aware that i'm recording and doing a chirp report so i start like i start talking sitting up while like most people still probably have their eyes closed i don't know or maybe it wasn't short maybe just uh that's my perception of it that was fucking intense though it's funny the visuals i had on my screen oh yeah another thing too the audio went it muted itself i'm gonna have to check uh the playback and see like if my actual audio muted because i have music playing i'm just i'm gonna cut out the parts when i'm not talking um i'm going to check if it actually muted because that was weird because at one point i was hearing the music and it just cut out completely it was silent for a few seconds which is a weird hallucination like canceling out your sound that's pretty like intense like it has some like pretty high permissions in your brain to be able to like access that that sort of shit like mute all sounds you know that's like administrator privileges you know like you can't just mute the fucking sound in my brain like what are you doing it's crazy it did though and then well oh yeah when i was closing and opening my eyes i don't know if i was or not but i think if you if you look in the video they'll show a part where i'm like sort of like opening and closing them i was like going back and forth at least my memory tells me that's what i did during that part like all the effects were like flickering on and off like i mentioned in my when did i mention that i think it was in my live stream i don't know but i was talking about how sometimes the effects they just flicker on and off like an rgb cable being wiggled in the back of an old computer you'd see the colors just flicker instantly right and what was oh yeah that was happening when it's opening closing the eyes with everything all the effects it's just like very computer simulated like themes of simulation here but not not totally this time that that entity seemed beyond beyond like a computer simulation you know uh it's weird too when that's happening it's like oh my god i have the answer this is crazy but so that's like a delusional thought obviously but i'm still there i'm still conscious because i remember thinking like wait till i tell my subscribers i got to see her to the universe like this is going to make a banger video you know meaning of life and i'm at for a good 30 seconds 20 seconds 30 seconds i thought that i'm like i know i know everything i know the answer and uh i can't wait this can make a great video isn't that funny and then slowly it starts you start realizing like wait a second that can't be true and i know it's not true because every trip is like different like last trip like something else was the answer now the answer is this you know there's several meanings to life apparently but this i've never had a trip where i imagined something that it's like beyond like something i couldn't come up with myself you know so i'm not convinced that dmt is um anything supernatural just yet but i don't find it any less poetic or beautiful or spiritual or anything like that you know it's just to me it's a testament to how complex the human brain is and how incredible nature is you know in life itself life is the trip as i say dmt is just like i made this analogy to someone earlier in the comments life okay dmt is like a program and life is like the operating system you know what i mean like psychedelic trips are just a small thing that happens within life oh my shit's about to shut off i think or no i just split the recording so part of it might just cut out so i'm just gonna repeat what i just said i forget what i just said fuck am i scratching my nuts geez okay ignore the last 10 seconds i'm probably going to keep it in for comedic effect but ignore it that was a really cool trip that every trip has a different vibe to it there's like a few main categories each one is unique but there's some broader categories too like some of them are funny some of them are very spiritual and uplifting like my two live trips one and two those ones were very spiritual and uplifting and afterwards i felt like at peace with the world i don't really have that this time although i do feel good but um i this one was more like the ones based in outer space always have the same vibe to them and those ones are all about like how the universe works and god and stuff like that and higher powers and those ones are fascinating not necessarily positive or overwhelmingly positive or scary just it feels like it's showing me the truth so it's it's not trying to be anything it's just the truth right and it's those ones are like awesome not like awesome like you know like awesome dude like it's full of awe you know awe inspiring like mind mind-blowing and just i don't know i'm going to have to look back at the tape but i'm pretty sure i was just like oh really good like five minutes not that long three or four minutes maybe i don't know it's funny i'm like the visuals on my screen ended up being like the least interesting thing ever i'm like looking at universes suddenly i'm going to watch i want to watch this youtube visual oh i've had youtube visuals turn into amazing things before so that's why i throw them on sometimes thing barely went down too how many hits that i i tried to take more hits but i couldn't feel the pen anymore it felt like it was over here and my jaw was like disconnecting and like it was like numb and shit you know when you don't know like where the pen is or how to hit it or and this thing's easy to hit when you you can't feel it you know that's when you're good to go this is a pretty strong pen or the liquid i think both um seems to work really well compared to most anecdotes i've heard about the efficacy of these pens a lot of people say it's really hard for them to get like a breakthrough dose that was like borderline breakthrough so that was like a low-level breakthrough dose i would say i don't like the term breakthrough but for those of you who go by that system i would say this is like a barely breakthrough barely i broke through barely it wasn't like uh as intense as some breakthrough trips i've had and it doesn't definitely wasn't sub breakthrough i was yeah i was out of here and when that fucking entity started beaming around i felt so powerless like i felt like oh fuck like this thing is boss whatever you i couldn't see it i just sense where it was it was invisible i'm wheezy okay that was great guys i think i'm gonna play some video games smoke a big bowl of marijuana and um maybe have it no no i gotta quit drinking fuck for real for real i gotta quit drinking i gotta stop masturbating snow not november is not going well guys what is it it's fucking february i think i need another extension i failed again i failed every day every day i failed no not november in february so the ninth extension this thing is dope as fuck i hate smoking empty even if you're doing bong hits which is like the easiest way to smoke tmt it's still kind of like a bit of a process to get the lighter to pull the ball out you know just it's it's hard on your second or third hit to do that this thing's fucking easy though i took double poles like someone suggested to me in the comments whoever what that was thank you good idea because this thing cuts out after five seconds so but if you just stop and then start again it resets the timer so um i could take two hits in one that that way essentially that fucking second hit i took or was it the third i don't know that was a huge fucking hit and i held those in for a long time you guys i have a pretty big lung capacity so i think it's easy easier for me than most people to get the dose in you know like i imagine for someone who doesn't smoke weed every day um it would be much harder much much harder to take hits like that because dmt is pretty harsh it's harshly different way it doesn't burn because it's vaporized but it's it's it's spikier you know it's got a i don't know if you know what i mean by that but it spikes your lungs more than weed weed is like it's hot obviously because you burn it and it can burn if you take a big hit but i don't know vapor has like it's like the initial feeling when you you take it in is harsher for the empty for sure but then once it's in there then it's fine work weeds the other way around it kind of burns more and more the more you hold it in uh no nausea at all which is good okay guys i'm sorry if the camera just uh changed angles and it was jarring i apologize but i finished the vlog then i went and got a hot dog which i would which i can't wait to eat but but a couple more details came to me and i will forgo eating this hot dog i'm not foregoing it i'm putting it off i will eat this hot dog but a couple details came to me while i was in the kitchen that i forgot to talk about so during the trip i talked about i think i mentioned i blurted out like eye coordinates or something like that that was supposed to be a reminder for me to talk about it later because i couldn't explain it at the time but i knew i'd be able to later i want this offering so bad this happened to me in at least 10 trips before and in a couple of my last ones i keep forgetting to mention it though but at the very beginning when i'm coming up and i'm looking around i'll see numbers in the corner two numbers and i'll see like a crosshair in my vision like tracking my eye movement and it moves wherever i move my eye and the numbers change depending where i'm looking like they're coordinates tracking my eye movement like an x and a y coordinate it's very weird another thing too is in the trips where like it's the universe being revealed to me how it works in those trips like in outer space at the very beginning often it's like you've been chosen we're selecting you it doesn't say that but i it's like i hear i sense what they're trying to say without hearing the audio so it would be like you know you're chosen like you're special basically we're showing you how the universe works and you're going to be the messiah you're going to be the one to like tell everyone about this and i i get that sense and i've gotten that sense in several trips probably at least five before where it's like you've been chosen almost like a lottery like uh out of like trillions infinite number of souls they chose me to like give me the secrets and then i'm gonna go and tell everybody apparently that's how it works and that's weird that i get that but i've gotten that yeah several times i just wanted to mention that okay back to the video or maybe the video is ending now i don't know where i'm going to insert this clip so maybe bye i love you guys or maybe back to the show i don't know i'm leaving my options open it's hot talk time i deserve this hot dog pro tip pro tip if you're microwaving a hot dog throw the bun in there for a good 10 seconds the water molecule something happens to them in the bun in it it gets soft and like reinvigorates the bun especially if they were in the fridge microwaved that bun i had a couple drinks too and um smoked some weed not like pretty much right before the trip i broke the rules guys i broke the rules that pro pretty much is a rule though i would say if you do if you don't have a tolerance to weed or alcohol oh that's black that's black that's not a good color no weed you're smoking weed yet um i guess it's essentially resin building up in your in your in your in your phlegm i'm gonna say it no one likes that word but it it is it's phlegm you guys that's fine though doesn't mean anything bad it's just black you know black doesn't necessarily mean death you guys doesn't mean it's bad doesn't mean it's evil you know it's just but it's black there's a little blackness okay okay you know guys i've been feeling good in the last few months relatively speaking and [Music] i pretty i pretty much attribute that directly to my channel and how it's been doing it's been doing good and i just want to thank you guys again really thank you thank you so much you guys rock and i hope you enjoyed the video you know more to come more to come this thing hasn't even gone down that much so i feel like i got a good i don't know 10 10 videos at least out of this pen so that's that's gonna be great for the channel and it's great for you you guys like it right so everyone's everyone's winning i get i get what i get charlie sheen now that's it i'll end the video here like i said i didn't want to make a video tonight right but i think i got everything i think this will be a good nice easy edit i didn't stall too much so there's not too many cuts and that's it okay all right thank you guys for watching peace out uh i love you cheers much love be safe [Music] [Music] alright [Music] you", "HqA9UOkw-lE": "[Music] a lot of times they're putting in unknown substances to cut it and to make a bigger volume and to make their their money stretch so we don't know what's getting put in those vials good evening and thank you for joining us I'm John overall dime Angelique Lizardi some may think vaping is harmless but the Centers for Disease Control might have data to prove otherwise here in Pima County the counter-narcotics Alliance says violence can also be associated with sale of certain cartridges or carts used for vaping our digging deeper team uncovered information about some recent cases here in Tucson news 4 - sauce Lupita Mario shows us how bad the problem has become this is a vaping cart it contains THC found in marijuana it's also sold at dispensaries and sold on the black market for half the price that's where the trouble begins in January three masked individuals went to a Tucson home where fake carts were being manufactured counter-narcotics Alliance officers say the suspects beat and robbed the homeowner of cash marijuana and the illegal carts he was manufacturing we've been to several home invasions this year where individuals have been shot because of cartridges sergeant Alfredo Meza is with the Tucson Police Department assigned to CNA his unit investigates violent crimes associated with narcotics a lot of the time dealers are dealing in fake vape cartridges a lot of times they're putting in unknown substances to cut it and to make a bigger volume and to make their their money stretch so we don't know what's getting put in those vials vial such as these all of them fake sergeant Meza told the digging deeper team these were seized during a home invasion the homeowner was shot and a CNA officer found evidence he was making the THC vape cartridges inside his apartment there's not a lot of consistency in the manufacturer of this stuff anywhere there's no FDA regulation that goes through to make sure that they're not putting in cases in California they found cyanide in vape cartridges Captain John Leavitt is also with the Tucson Police Department and heads CNA and it's extremely dangerous it's toxic to your system and it can not only make people sick but it kills people according to the latest numbers from the CDC 2290 cases were reported from 49 states 47 deaths have been confirmed in 25 states and the District of Columbia the median age of the people dying is 53 it's an extreme health hazard and if you look at the guidance from the CDC they they vary circumspectly suggest that you don't vape most of the carts come from the black market these are pictures of the fake ones authorities say the active ingredient in the carts is THC that gives the people the high but people are now adding other ingredients to the carts such as mineral oil and vitamin E a toxic combination the CDC has discovered that is causing nearly 3000 people across the United States to have lung issues all we know so far is that in its infancy it's caused the terrible problems for a lot of people in his destined to do even worse investigators say that the raw THC oil is brought in from California because it's legal there and then smuggled into Arizona to manufacture the fake carts police say just days ago a 17 year old was shot in Tucson and is in critical condition at a local hospital they say he was buying carts and when he realized they were fake there was a dispute and shots were fired digging deeper Lupita more real news for Tucson", "g9ZTomapqVg":

"what's up guys this is Nick from disk have a pen and today we're going to tell you about the difference between using a ceramic made cartridge and a cotton wick baked cartridge [Music] alright guys so when you have your 510 threaded cartridges this guy or this guy you're gonna have two types one of them is going to be a cotton whip like this and one of them will be a ceramic heating element like this guy well they both have their advantages and disadvantages if you're trying to do a lower voltage meaning the lower power setting you want to go with the cotton cartridge they can't handle such a high voltage from the battery which would mean you know if you know especially if you have one of the ones that are adjustable where you can turn it up or down you're gonna want to keep at a minimal setting because if you put too much power into one of these guys you risk burning it out early or you know you could turn your juice dark and black because it just stresses the heating element out too much now with our other guy these ceramic these are gonna be a little more up to date where you're gonna be able to run them at a higher setting not super high but with the spinner batteries or the adjustable voltage batteries you'll definitely be able to turn it up a little higher and will give you a little more of a kick with your v the way you can tell the difference is if you look inside the barrel of this one the cotton one you can see a little cotton poking out at the top of it as opposed to the ceramic where you have kind of a cage sitting down on it onto it and you'll have some wick holes where you'll see where the juice will flow in both of them are gonna be 510 threaded and both are gonna be acceptable for batteries like this so you know again just to make sure if you're adjusting you're gonna want to have a ceramic type that'll let you turn your battery up a little higher we recommend a voltage no real higher than about 4 volts that should be the highest you go if he's something a little higher but take it bit by bit and then if you're using a traditional cotton cartridge that's gonna want to stay at a minimum about 3.7 volts you don't really want to turn it up much higher than that and obviously the question too is well what if my battery doesn't adjust well then you're fine for both you know that's going to run at a lower setting that'll be acceptable for both types so if you liked the video give us a like subscribe and if you want any of these products available for purchase you can check us out at discount vape pen com [Music] [Applause] you", "tdT_TmGGODc": "Oh God oh god what have I done oh god no oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] is she dead oh oh oh [ __ ] and welcome to weights everyone the marijuana review show where we help you find folks make sense of that big ol honkin weird place called ear dispensary or that website that you go to that is also a dispensary you know it's less weird that way and I know firsthand having just picked up an order from ease calm a huge retailer here in California a huge online dispensary and I picked up a variety of cartridges from them and perhaps most intriguingly of all is the old pal classic shareable cannabis oil cartridge this is their hybrid half gram here and one reason I'm really intrigued really interested in this one is this was purchased from East which is a totally licensed legit dispensary and it only costs 15 bucks for the half gram granted that's pre-tax so it's probably close to you know 20 or more when you add all the tax in but that is still for a legal you know recreational dispensary that is incredibly affordable so I'm always looking out for those there's sort of diamonds in the rough for the the products that you know aren't gonna hurt the wallet as much but are still just as good so I am pretty excited about giving this one a shot and as I said this is comes from old pal classic this is their shareable hybrid um and it looks like actually on the back it says that it is packaged by a loud pack or manufactured by a loud pack not that's showing up that well but loud pack is a huge weed company they make all kinds of different products they actually have several different brands I don't think this is one of theirs I think maybe they just do the manufacturing of the cartridges there I don't know for sure but I don't think it's one of their brands but yeah so here we go here is our old pal very very simple you know modest packaging just a bag there on the back it shows us you know exactly how to use it which is kind of nice for use with the 510 thread which I've got my trusty brass knuckles here um so then it has just ingredients cannabis oil natural flavours terpenes there uh and then it shows it does not actually give us our th C percentage but it shows boy I really suck at getting that to focus and I am sorry to everybody anyways it shows that it has 400 milligrams of THC in there which would mean if it's a half gram cartridge that it's what 80 percent which again for a $15.00 cartridge seems like an incredibly good deal and you know it's it's lab tested this is their they've got the batch number all that great stuff there so you know it seems like it should be legit well let's stop beating around the bush here and get to the important part of the review we've got some childproof packaging in here very easy for a dumb dumb like me to mess it up but I got it I got it okay alright well I can see first and foremost the materials are very cheap for these cartridges very cheap plastic tip just it does not look like the highest quality materials just flimsy some kind of like you know aluminum or some other metal there and the oil itself looks you know I mean you can't really judge oil by the color and you just have to judge sort of by the the consistency and the viscosity it looks fine it looks totally fine and this is a very standard looking 510 cartridge design you got like the for intake holes that's obnoxious there's the big California weed warning sticker on it but you know I guess it won't affect this too much and then you can also see their little logo they're on the side so let's go ahead and screw her into our battery here power this sucker on and get to the test oh wow I forgot to count down to one second here oh wow okay um very subtle flavor really not much of a flavor at all to to speak of actually what is there is kind of it's a little piney um not bad not my favorite flavor or strain to taste in the world in terms of the hit pretty easy um it comes out a little hot I think not super hot not gonna burn your lungs but it's a you notice it a little bit more I think than some of the other cartridges but not in a bad way it just it's it comes out a little bit heavier it does come out um it gives you a surprisingly big draw for your inhale like I was getting bigger clouds than I would have imagined with the sort of modest draws I was taking um let me do another one we'll talk about the potency here excuse me copyright in the microphone although I always do um wow this is good stuff um I just coming off plug in place so nothing will ever be as potent as that but this is totally totally you know I would say average just better slightly better than average quality and potency of the most cartridges I've had out there so right now I am pretty pleased with this uh Wow Wow yeah I am sufficiently high I you know feel like I could sit down and you know just sink into a chair and watch them king of the hill reruns and be blissful right now this is really good stuff um right now my impressions of this product old pal classic shareable cannabis is pretty great actually again it's not the best stuff you'll ever try in the world but it was 15 bucks pre-tax for a tested licensed cartridge you're not gonna find anything cheaper than that and in terms of value this might be for a legal you know you can just buy it anytime cartridge wow this is one of the best deals I've come across all of that being said hold it you in suspense I'll just go quick all of that being said we do know that this cartridge is cheap the materials don't look very great on it I mean they've been you know fine now but um I would be I'd be curious to know how it's going to last over the two days to three days it's gonna take me to get through this half gram and hopefully it is good like Folgers to the last drop we have no problems along the way but as we all know these things tend to be faulty and certain brands are more faulty than others that's why I like to review the whole cartridge I'm gonna really enjoy this guy for a nice cheap high over the next while that sounds really druggie a nice affordable cannabis experience the next three days or so two days who knows I'm rambling that's how I already a.m. good for you old pal see you back here in a couple days I hope to be as effusive as I am now bye guys [Music] howdy everybody welcome back two weeks it has been right at two days since I first started enjoying old pal classic a shareable cannabis oil cartridge this was their hybrid cosmic hybrid as they say on the back and my first impressions pretty much borne out throughout the entire process I really like this one guys as an affordable product materials aren't great and it did have that little tendency at the very end to get that sort of hotter burn where you get the kind of harsher clouds but it was really only at the end and and it wasn't as bad as some hammock cartridges and again it has kind of you know the cheap plastic tip and all those things but again it was only 15 bucks pre-tax here in Long Beach which is such a good deal in comparison to you know pretty much anything else out there I really don't have a problem recommending to you guys and as you can see all that oil is gone gone gone so you get it all out and just have to uh you know really try those last couple of puffs but totally worth it um I could not be happier if I'm looking for something a little bit cheap or to pack a bunch of you know for a long weekend this might be what I go with you know if I'm if I want it like five or six cartridges for a bunch of friends to go out on a trip or something you can get a lot without breaking the bank and you can be pretty sure that these are gonna be you know clean good stuff they're all lab tested all that wonderful fun stuff um so big big thumbs up for me really enjoyed it again is $15 cartridge with some of those caveats that you would expect for something that much cheaper than its competitors but um the the trade-offs are totally worth it for the price thumbs up loved it that is the old pal classic shareable cannabis this is their cosmic hybrid half gram and of course anytime I find something I enjoy as a much as old pal I like to give a little cherry on top something you can you know take with yous and then that I can recommend to you guys that isn't necessarily weed related this one I'm gonna recommend to you guys AMC's movie pasts if you haven't people live in an area of the country where there's a [ __ ] ton of AMC's and especially in an expensive part of the country like me here in Southern California AMC movie past is the best deal on the planet my wife and I both subscribe for 24 bucks a month you can see three movies a week doesn't matter if they're 3d IMAX whatever three movies of any kind of week 24 bucks a month incredible and of course you can reserve your tickets weeks ahead of time especially if you live in an area with reserved seating which you know can be a double-edged sword it's great AMC movie pests I've been a customer for like four months I can't imagine canceling anytime soon love it if you like movies and you live in an area with a lot of emcees it's 100% worth it and that again is the AMC movie pass which I love and that is also old pal shareable cannabis something I also really really enjoy alright guys that's gonna do for the cherry on top that's gonna do it for the review and that's gonna do it for this whole shebang here on wheats thanks so much for watching and I will see you guys back here on a future review bye bye", "8lGAMgGDjI8":

know I love this part of the show cuz this is where I get to talk about my smoky mountain memories and I've written a lot of songs about my growing up days in the Smokies and this particular one is very special to me because it talks about the best friend I had when I was a little girl growing up there there was a snowman that lived up in the woods not far from us he lived alone in an old shack and my momma didn't much like for me to go up there she was kind of afraid of him because he had real long hair and real bushy eyebrows and the beard and he had a bunch of old hunting dog because he used to do a lot of hunting bear hunting back there in the Smokies but anyhow that passed away I thought about him a lot of times and I thought well I'm gonna write a song about him and here it is now and I hope you enjoy it it's a happy song it makes me feel good and I hope it has the same effect on you he lived by the apple orchard in this little orchard Shack his name was Jackson Taylor but I called him Applejack the old Applejack was loved by everyone he ever knew a horse Applejack picked apples honey picked a banjo too every day that's when hours just the kid and now that I am grown all I have are these memories for goal Applejack well he's gone oh but he left me the banjo and it always takes me back you know every time I still", "pQIp6xChq0U": "I so basically how you want to start is with wires just like this just from a USB cord just like that and you just cut the charging part off and then you'll have this right here so you want to spread your wires out evenly and then I already nipped down the green and the white cuz you don't need those you just want to want to cut those off and just leave the black and the red you don't need to Greener the white just make sure that when you cut them off you just have two wires that aren't touching and you'll be completely safe because the other ones don't have anything to do with power so once you look like this you're perfect that's exactly what you want to do alright so then what you want to do from here is get these Clippers these little nail clippers and then you just want to kind of score the wire and pull it off this is if you don't have a wire stripping you could do this cuz this is what I did as you can see I suddenly cut it right there but after you just strip this little coating off you're gonna be done you're gonna be completely set it's that simple you're gonna be able to vape without a battery it's literally that simple right after you get the it stripped alright so this is exactly what you want to look like right now you wanna have your two wires your red and your black wire and that's exactly what you need for this to work just the silver tips right there it's already stripped and everything that's perfect so what you're gonna do is you're gonna take your device your cartridges your vape cartridge you're gonna stake the black wire into the hole and then once you get that and you're gonna use the red wire and touch it to the side of the thing and then that'll start eating up but it won't burn don't worry it won't burn through fingers so you can see smoke inside of the thing there you go there you go so that's exactly how you do it you just need to be plugged into a source and you can just keep hitting it over and over and it's infinite all right let me know if you want to see another video like this guys I could teach you how to make your homemade bait battery an entire battery that you could take on the go portable let me know if you want me to tell you how to do that let's go for a hundred likes and I'll do that are you", "xv-7QYC1HhI": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to pop on 4/20 as always thank you for joining this channel won't we get started in this next video guys I'm gonna need you to do a few things as usual i'ma need you to like my video make sure you hit that notification bell and definitely make sure you watch the last deal which I did on candy this week guys I'm so excited because we're doing I'm super excited about this product guys I had a chance to be the representatives of this product at one of the dispensaries that our frequent and sunny day in Vegas Nevada we're gonna get into this product right away alright alright guys so here I have the air pro battery this is an advanced vaporizer system it comes with a graphite air pro vaporizer with a micro USB charger in it so let's get this open and as you can see battery is in here we won't get right into it guys this is you open it up you get a user user manual sorry it's early in the morning this is gonna be a battery it's the graphite I can get it onto the package and there's a USB cord attached to it for the purposes of this video you cannot see this charging but I so guys not enough got it all charged up and as always guys before I attach my cartridge to this I do want to make sure parents know that this is a canvas product we need to keep it out of the reach of children so make sure that you have these items laying around for your children anyone under 21 is not allowed to consume cannabis I'm gonna go ahead and plug in my charger I mean I'm sorry my cartridge guys see that this particular cartridge is a 0.5 grams and this one is called the black mamba and I picked it because it says black mamba but not only that guys and this particular one is the sativa so I want to just start showing you guys to Tevas because I usually use us that even during the day time just to get my day going it doesn't tie up my day and make me tired so I thought it would be great just don't get my work done and I will be able to use this as you guys know I got a bunch of product reviews to do and I need to keep my head straight sativas keep me right but this particular one is black mamba it has a pure distillate oil which only means that they have some clarity and purity to this oil I'm not sure from the research I did how they dissipated the oil there's different ways of getting me away with distillate form so you always want to do your research whenever we serve this particular product we go to air procom shut up at air pro we're gonna open this package up as you can see the package is a little tough to open I have no idea how I'm opening this but we're gonna figure it out okay guys obviously please change our location because it was a little noisy outside but the last you saw I was holding up the package that was childhood but it's also adult food so now we got the package shop guys I'm just gonna get closer got my 0.5 cartridge that's Black Mamba here is my battery is the graphite battery and I'm just gonna show you guys I've already charged it literally the charge only took maybe about 10-15 minutes so you didn't see that because of the purpose of editing the video but the charging takes really fast and it did turn colors when it discharged so I'm gonna go ahead and figure out how to put my cartridge on there we go so you just pop that mouthpiece off and then Oh Meg Nick magnetically it clicked idiot let's do it again wow I like that and I like that because guys it keeps it from leaking some of these cartridges you'll get they'll start to leak into your battery this one is magnetic and I like the way it just draw someone you don't have to like screw it on so you just sit this part to the side guys and we're gonna get ready to see if this thing more all right so remember it's supposed to find rate there's a manual a user's guide so I'm just gonna look quickly and see what it's supposed to do okay so it's supposed to vibrate lightly in your mouth yes I just said something's gonna 5r8 lightly in my mouth so let's see the vibrations oh my gosh that's amazing okay instantly guys this is amazing I can taste the blackberry as the top note with the hint of citrus but it's not a tangy centrist now let me let you guys know that I do know for a fact that this particular cartridge the Black Mamba cast terpenes in it the terpenes is what really brings out the benefits of the particular oil or the flour which is made out of flour so guys what I really love about this particular one with that citrus taste in it that's that limiting coming through and I love a terpene limit because for me is the antidepressant and anti stressor so it has that has pine all in it I think it has some lemon linen all in it as well so if you're looking to do Turks that's what you really want to be at to understand what the oil is doing and what is it bringing out of when you're inhaling it so for me um wow that feels really good in my chest this system is really great and this has been on high time magazine's top when our air pro and I love how sleek it is can you see that you can slip it in your pocket it's really adorable and right and it gives off a nice cloud the smell is great idea I'm like truly in love with this one and I feel like because it is a sativa guys I can go on with my day actually we might film doing some more stuff doing my day so you guys can see how a sativa will work doing your day so when you have a sativa this is gonna be great because you can still go to the gym you can still get your grocery shopping all those things that you need to do in your day sativas won't allow you to do so remember if you need it during the day so theses are going to be the way to go and air pro has some excellent sativa cartridges and these are dissident oils so they have already made pure fighted and clear it up so it's very clear on your chest the second pose you see I didn't even have a call back which is great and I still feel like I'm consumed inside kind of thing I know that sounds really weird cuz this is like my new friend like I can actually like in my little pocket and my yoga pants matter of fact let's just go to yoga and I'll just keep it in my yoga pants done nobody knows it's there let's don't get on my nerves boom vibrating in my mouth oh yeah I feel like dancing this right here alright guys I'll be right back and I'm going to show you how my day went on this air pro all right guys as you can see it's been about what about an hour or so and you know I met the guy named Jim on Stairmaster owning every Pro what I've let one that make you work tell you what I'm working up that's what it's this evil dude that he paid to this we're feeling great I just got a great workout in on the Stairmaster [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] it was amazing that gives the clarity and the purity of this I [Music] [Music] because I [Music]", "SsC4jaIY8sQ": "[Music] welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my trusty pour one out 510 vape battery that is finely [ __ ] the bet on me after 15 cartridge reviews or something it finally [ __ ] the bed and my trusty 510 battery has died so I'm pulling out the backup the cheaper chintzy er one here that's okay we'll get a new one we'll get a better one but I'm gonna miss my old friend there has died but outside of the funeral for our trusty 510 vape pen we are here for a joyous celebration and we are here to review the product that I have had to me suggested the most of anything I have ever reviewed or intended to review and that is brass knuckles we are finally reviewing brass knuckles I have had you guys a lot of you recommending me check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles and I've used brass knuckles in the past and but we won't talk about that but today we are going to be reviewing brass knuckles finally found some here in Long Beach and I'm very very excited to give it a review so this is the one gram Gorilla Glue cartridge and it comes in some a primo packaging that I have no doubt I'm gonna have difficulty opening here really nice packaging as you can see plastic on the outside it's got all the information you want on the inside lab tested contaminant and pesticide free that brings me up to the controversy I I know that there was a big controversy with brass knuckles for a while about pesticide usage but apparently that is no longer the case I hope that is no longer the case I I would a vet suggest you do your due diligence and research if you're really worried about those kind of things what you might probably should be maybe so do your own due diligence make sure you know this is something for you but from what I've heard they have all of their problems in terms of having pesticides or whatever fungicides or whatever I was that was in there it's no longer the case so Gorilla Glue is my favorite strain as I have said many a times I have seen it listed as both hybrid and indica this is a hybrid gorilla glue I like it both as hybrid and indica this cost me as you can see $52 at my dispensary which is a bit of a miss which is a bit misleading because really with the 35% taxes it can cost considerably more than that but $52 is the base price so you know pretty expensive but not outrageously more expensive than other cartridges this one just has the reputation sort of throughout Southern California as being the best of the best and I think I actually got it open without too much trouble there maybe here we go here's our cartridge in its little packaging there for medicinal use only not for redistribution and we can see their weed maps all that logos blah blah blah blah blah they have a snapchat how fun alright we have got our standard 510 pen here not our former best friend bottoms cap just like all the others with these little rubber stoppers whoever makes these little rubber stoppers must be doing pretty bonk owes business right now I would imagine let's screw this in ooh I like the color of this oil nice dark golden oil beautiful looking oil there a nice brass tip I guess that's where the name brass knuckles come from and a nice wide intake hole there so very excited to give this a drop let's give it a go oh wow that is a premium experience that is a smooth with smooth draw Wow ignore the cough that's my fault not theirs I'm a coffer this does not burn hot at all you can barely feel it entering along it's wonderful the taste is exquisite and Wow I'm already feeling pretty nicely medicated actually oh wow they use a bad word on their packaging here I'm gonna have to read that for you guys I don't see what their THC potency is listed at on here but I do know that they are among the highest in the state I think I've seen before that it's over 90% it certainly feels that way I'm already feeling quite high after just 3 3 little puffs there one negative thing and it might actually be this pen is I'm not getting this huge a draw as I would want for pulling I like the bigger clouds but it's sort of ameliorated by the fact that even the small draws are getting me quite high and it might actually just be this pen doesn't have the voltage to get the huge clouds I'll double check I'm gonna be getting a new pen before I finish this so I'll I'll be sure to let you guys know in the follow up if that still the case Wow but up into this point brass knuckles definitely definitely earns their reputation tastes great hits like a dream oh man really really really enjoying the brass on my brass knuckles experience here guys if only it were a little easier to draw from it would be perfect but again that maybe the pen and I'll be sure to let you know guys because I'm gonna review this entire cartridge I'm not just gonna take a couple of puffs and say it's good I'm gonna come back to you guys after I finish this whole Graham here to let you know exactly my thoughts let you know if anything's changed if the starting to leak if the oil got tacky whatever the case may be I'll be sure to let you know in the follow up so I'll come back to you guys probably in four or five days after I finished this bad boy off and let you know exactly what I'm thinking thank you so much for watching weeks to this point guys and I will see you in just a bit it has been actually I believe eight days since I last checked in with you talking the one gram brass knuckles Gorilla Glue cartridge so right off the bat I wasn't doing this really any less than any other cartridge I don't feel like but it lasted a long long time I really got your values worth with this one certainly a gram in there the other thing is it is still very potent this is a potent a blend that they've got in here this is certainly as strong as its sort of reputation lends it to believe but all that being said my initial I'm not as emphatically as in love as I was with my initial impressions or as I was when I gave my initial impressions there have been a couple of things that have walnut spoiled me on the experience have certainly damper the experience one is it became significantly more difficult to draw as time went on I did get a new battery to test it with and even with a new battery it was still kind of tough to draw from and it got harder and harder as time went on and which is something I really have a problem with with the VBA I much prefer the ones that have nice easy drawers that you can make nice big you know take nice big inhalations with as the kids call them make nice big clouds this wasn't really that and I'm not sure if it was this cartridge in particular as you can see there's actually some oil left there at the bottom I just had such a tough time drawing from it that I think I'm just gonna have to leave it there the other thing is it did start to get a bit of a burnt taste as I got closer to the bottom the closer I got the more burnt the taste was it for the most part tasted great I really enjoyed the taste but as we started to get near the end or trim it's the end of its life that burnt taste started to amplify so tough to draw from and increasingly tough to draw from and an increasingly unpleasant taste those aren't good things for sure those those weren't those theirs don't keep it and there's hold it back and getting in my highest remarks for sure but I feel like I'm definitely gonna get brass knuckles the second chance I've heard enough about them that I'm wondering if maybe I just got a bad card what the case may be so I'm gonna give him a second chance we're gonna review something else from them in the future but for now between the two because they're so often compared and they're so look alike I actually think I might prefer the heavy hitters to brass knuckles maybe yeah I think in my initial impressions I would go with the heavy hitter of the brass knuckle but let's get let's go ahead and do another brass knuckle review before we give it any the definitive conclusion and overall my impressions are still pretty positive this is a potent a long lasting cartridge that you're gonna get your money's worth from so you know I it's still really positive review it's just not as good as I initially had hoped but we will be examining them and given the future so fingers crossed and that guys is gonna do it for this review but before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top just something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related but could be enjoyed with weed or with or without weed and so on this cherry on top what I wanted to share with you guys was something nice and simple something nice and easy an 11 minute web clip from the fine folks at where I guess fine folks the mostly male folks over at Adult Swim make Krueger's of creators of chosen Rick and Morty or at least the hosts of such shows as Rick and Morty but that's not we're here to talk about is Rick and Morty we are here to talk about their 11 minutes short too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks it is an 11 minute video and if you haven't seen it a lot of you I'm sure have that sort of tries to replicate many 90s opening credit songs but things go awry and that's about all I want to say because you should know as little about it as possible before going in because it is who it's gonna be one of the most surreal 11 minutes of your life Definitely Maybe recommend if you do have some cannabis on hand doing some before hand if you're not prone to paranoia if you are definitely pass on it but it's gonna be enjoyable I think for you guys again that is called too many cooks on Adult Swim I'm sure you can find it on YouTube just search too many cooks so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat sand that's gonna do it for this cherry on top as well thank you so much for sticking around to the very end here guys I appreciate it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "9Vj4eYcumj8": "okay granny one more time when you accidentally sold my base at the garage sale who did you sell it to yeah a day I sold it to the owners of that new

that and Florida being their newest warm we got three strains for right now San Fernando Valley oh gee which is a hybrid Jack Herer which is a sativa and Master Kush which is a indica so the one thing that I saw on here that I wanted to show you guys was the cartridge that it comes in the Saran cartridge think this is supposed to be the newest version of a C cell which means it has a ceramic ceramic coil which will help burn the product better than a wit coil I know a lot of times with wit coils they can burn out real easy but with this ceramic oil you won't have that problem this is just the newest version of C cell truly uses C cells for most of their babes except for their cheapest distillate faith and their true pod so it says this cartridge is supposed to deliver up to 110 percent larger hits I'm not exactly sure what they're comparing this to but it seems to hit about the same as a regular C cell from B and you also have the open 2.0 battery which you can get if you like you don't have to get this battery this cartridge will screw on to any 510 thread battery alright so let's check out what all we get when we purchase the bait cartridge so we have that then it comes in a separate little two as you can see here open bait and right here it has the terpenes listed the dominant terpenes are turpino lean trans carry opaline and our lemony and the cartridge is coming in at 87% THC and 0.4% CBD total so to open you simply squeeze the sides and it will slide out just like that nice tip I like the tip on it it's a plastic hard plastic type tip that looks like glass but it is plastic on the bottom you have your little cap to keep it from leaking we won't need that anymore and this oil in here looks great too i mean it's some really good looking product inside of here so you can see it's really nice [Music] so as you guys can see right here this is as full as the cartridge is they say that that's headspace where it has go as gone into the coil but I remember the first time I got one of these I actually had to get it going before the oil was even in the coil that's the only thing that I see so far as it looks like they could fill the cartridges a little bit more and I have had this same problem with these cartridges they're just not quite as full as they could be that's the only thing that I don't like about these half Graham carts is it doesn't seem like I'm getting the full product for the price that I'm paying I mean if I'm buying a full gram of this stuff I'm paying you 110 dollars just make it full at least and I have seen them completely full so I mean that whole headspace thing to me just doesn't make sense so let's try it out I'm just gonna screw it on to my favorite battery as you can see here it's a 5-10 thread it will screw on to any 510 battery and you can also see it says jupiter-c cell that's how you can identify if you have a real C cell it will say Jupiter on it just like that alright you guys so everything you've seen so far has been recorded over the last couple of days and I've really had a good chance to try this product out now and I really like it it's a good product but I'm not quite sure I like it better than the co2 bait cartridge right here from truly do like how hard the new C cell hits it does rip really good check this out [Music] nice hit hmm so and then rips really good you can get really nice rips off of this especially with an adjustable battery which is what I have here it's an adjustable battery goes from 4.8 bolts down to 3.8 bolts in a 3.3 volt so that way you have a choice of what temperature you take your head out and how big of a hit you take and that's kind of similar to the 2.0 pin that they have as well I'm sure it's just a little bit more pricier than the one I have here so if this was a jack herer cartridge what would be the difference between these two cartridges since they're both co2 cartridges well this company right here open they have some award-winning strains that they have and they have the terpene profiles on them so that terpene profile is basically what the difference is between these two things right here you of course have different phenotypes of plants you may have jack or air and jack or air so they're gonna be two different phenotypes and they're gonna have two different types of terpenes in them this is just the terpene profile for their phenotype of Jack Herer so what is a phenotype well to make it easy basically not every plant is the same and every different plant is a phenotype and some are better than others and this is why sometimes you guys will see let's say blue dream and it will be really nice-looking and then other times you'll see blue dream and it won't be as nice-looking it's because it's two different plants and you have two different phenotypes we'll get into all that some other time but you guys did want to know one other question and there is one other difference on this product let's jump back on this screen real quick and check this out all right so I'm on true leaves Instagram here and in the comments of one of their pictures from this new product someone asked as anyone tried these what can we expect are there any cutting agents so truly the answers with cut with nothing but terpenes so everybody wants to know of course what these terpenes come from are they fruit food terpenes or the cannabis terpenes so we see right here that the answer they will be botanical or fruit terpenes basically and down here we see some people are not really excited that they are not cannabis Dr terpenes like the co2 pin the co2 pin from truly has cannabis derived terpenes and right here in this message they tell me one is botanical and their co2 pin is cannabis derived terpenes now true leaf also has to do this with any other things that are distilled that of course is a different process than the co2 distillate but regular distillate who has the terpenes added to it to recreate that strain the profile of that strain this is why they came out with the co2 true clear or distillate is because they are using food grade or botanical terpenes and the regular distillate and that is pretty common practice around the country but the co2 distillate has cannabis derived terpenes in it regular distillate does not have any terpenes in it until they are introduced back into it because it is cooked off during the distillation process and is basically just raw THC without any terpene profile to it at all and it is built from there you guys may have remembered a little while back when they came out with Gainesville green this actually is a strain from a long time ago long time Florida strain from way back when was supposedly lost about 30 years ago well this is how the strain was recreated they actually went to Naiya being godfather of gainesville green and had him approved the terpene profile for Gainesville green and that is where we got it from this is actually derived from gorilla grapes though and this is why you don't see any Gainesville green actual flower in the dispensary because only the terpene profile is available for it and only Rick nya supposedly knows it so that's enough for right now take that in and let me know down in the comments what you guys think would you rather have food grade terpenes or cannabis derived terpenes keep in mind both of these products are half grams and they both cost fifty five dollars I hope you guys liked the video give it a thumbs up if you did and subscribe below to learn some more we'll see you guys next time [Music] [Music] [Music]", "Lok3M6al86Y": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoffman ring officer of honey stick and today I am serving up a nice platter of oil pens for you one of the most commonly frequently asked questions that I get personally and the rest of my service staff get is how do I choose my perfect oil pen and based on the successes of our other videos about how to pick your perfect concentrate and dab pen and also how to pick your perfect concealer well we really worked hard on this week was trying to put together a comprehensive checklist and run through our units to see how you can pick out your perfect oil pen so what our team did we put these factors together and then I did a job job of going out into our warehouse and assembling all of the various units that we have as options for oil pens that we felt viable and we're gonna run through them all based on our eight criteria that I've outlined so let's jump into my criteria I outline and I'm gonna rely on the audience of course to drop into the comments if there's a criteria that I forgot so people who are tuned into the video following along watching the comments can really still see and make the best informed decision that's what our videos are about is really presenting our products and just helping you guys to make a better purchasing decision or to just get a little more education awareness so let's jump into my eight factors my first factor when choosing an oil pen I think is based on the availability based on your state now oils are not necessarily accessible everywhere so it might not even be an option for you but in the event that it is some states they're only have it seemed to be available already prefilled into 510 threaded cartridges or they could be placed into so Changez already pre Lord or they can only be available in tincture bottles so based on what kind type of oils you have access to or what type of texture oils you have access to could really be a determining factor of when you when you're trying to select your perfect oil pen the next factor for you is to keep in mind and I think it's a second probably the most pressing factor is budget I know there's a lot of eight ballers out there who price is not a thing but a lot of medical patients and people who are on let's say disability or things like that that are using cannabis for medicinal purposes budget is a very important thing to them so we can't just go crazy on the price spectrum and we should definitely keep a price as a major factor when choosing a vaporizer as an option the next factor that I think is the most important is how stealthy the unit is so stealthiness can play play a factor in a few ways whether you have it on the go and you want to be discreet whether you just want to be small and compact or whether you are really taking your vaporizer places that you shouldn't and you just don't want to get caught or you want it to go incognito which is perfectly cool but that definitely plays a factor when you are choosing your perfect vape pen I think the next next factor number four is the ease of use is how easy is the oil pen to use and really what is your vape level I have a lot of people who have never turned on a vaporizer before who contact us and we have people who call in to educate us on our own vaporizers on how the best way is to use them so there's different places where you can fall in your vape knowledge spectrum and those will definitely have an impact on your buying decision when you are selecting your pur Victor oil pen is how easy is the vaporizer to use where's my current vape skillset or how am I willing to learn now we do try to make educational videos so that you know even if you do pick up one of the more more expert level vaporizers you know you watch our videos will walk you through how to get it up and running and really be able to use it next I think is battery life you know that comes into play when for me personally like when I'm buying a phone because I cannot stay connected to a charger you know certain people have certain lifestyles they take them on that or they can't get to a charger it takes a they want to be able to have a few days charge on it or they're going on a hiking expeditions is something we've gotten to where they want to make sure they can go about a week without having a charger so the battery life really does play into when you're making a decision of how long and how much you can use it in between charges I think that's important factor when choosing an oil pen next I think it is mobility is can you take it around or is it just gonna be something that kind of stays at home because generally you can get more power and performance out of units that are larger and you can get more kind of back to our other point of of being convenient and easy to use or stealthy out of smaller units so I think that really the mobility factor does play into it as to how and where you plan to take the vaporizer can you drop it in your pocket do you put in your backpack can you just you know throw it on a lanyard or keychain and call it a day next I think it comes down to the next factor really we're going into the nitty-gritty here is the power how much power puts out how intense it is I think that makes a big big determining factor to people because some people really thrive to get an intensity and powerful vaporizer that hits hard and to some people that's believe it or not that that can also be a turn-off to her they want a vaporizer to be very smooth and and and not you know be have any type of traits that to some people could lead off as harsh and I think in the last one is flavor everybody loves to taste good flavor when you're buying spending a lot of money buying concentrates or CBDs or whatever it is that you're buying a nateing sure surrender prefilled cartridge everybody wants to taste what they're getting fact is they're not they're not cheap and people want to get a unique and flavorful experience so where they rank on a flavorful level is also very important when choosing a royal pen so now that we've gone through all the factors and again if I miss something a really thought hard to try not to but if we did make sure to drop in the comments below so people can can see exactly what what other factors they should consider is let's jump right into our different assortment of oil vaporizers and start basically ranking them so you guys have a good knowledge and awareness of where these would rank first off we're a gold or honey stick oil disposable pen now I grab this has had some prefilled CBD in it some a gold lined CBD from our warehouse this pen ships empty so in terms of what you have available whether you if you don't have tinctures or syringes available this is not a 5-10 thread cartridge so you cannot unscrew this cartridge and screw your own cartridge in there so if in your state you only have prefilled cartridges this pen might not be for you however if you have tinctures and syringes available in your state you can definitely use this pen in terms of budget wise this pen is very cost effective because it is a disposable it's not recharged I think it's on our website for $15 so it's very convenient however on the same budget side it's not that economical because once you run through the tanks you would have to buy a new one and once you've ran through two three four of these you could have bought a rechargeable pen and price saved a little money in the wrong long run but if you're traveling or you live that certain lifestyle to where you don't want to take care of a pen maintain a pen you just want it to go through the tank or the the tincture or the syringe then this pen does definitely become convenient in terms of stealthy it's not stealthy in the sense of hiding the pan or the cartridge but it is stealthy in the sense that it looks similar to a lot of illiquid units and it can be disguise' belit is relatively small I mean it's basically about four and a half maybe five inches in length you can easily fit it into your pocket each one comes with a plastic tube and we did do a full review on this oil disposable pen it's actually very easy to use you just unscrew the top to fill it and we do have a step-by-step on there and there's no buttons to push no locking mechanisms you just inhale in terms of battery life this battery is good to run through the tank I tell people it is you should only really rely on it to run through the tank once even if the battery is not completely dead you don't want to get caught refilling the tank and then having to try to siphon or salvage oil out of a disposable pen because then you do have wastage and it is expensive so these they generally say are good for 200 puffs or one tank which if you look at the number of puffs on a half a mil which is the capacity of this tank it's between 150 and 200 puffs so that's what the battery life is mobility this thing is very mobile very convenient for traveling running around it's small it is extreme lightweight.you basically you could have a real lanyard and not even feel that it's here in terms of power that this unit doesn't have a high output this is more focused on smoothness and flavor it is auto draw and in general and again I say this is in general push-button units tend to hit harder than auto draw units simply because you're not using the power of your actual draw to activate the unit so this is a very flavorful a ceramic heating core and it it is not super intense it is more of a very smooth rolling and flavorful hits so that's where our disposable oil pan ranks one really select your perfect oil pan it is convenience oriented it is lightweight mobile flavorful but isn't going to deliver those those hard hits it's not rechargeable and it will not work with 510 threaded cartridges so let's move right along to one step up now this is not a unit that we have on our website however a lot of you guys have seen these these are the stylist standard disposable units this one we make exclusively for one of our distributors it's called the honey stick bee buzzin it is a stylus battery that comes with a high quality classic plastic wick cartridge what's cool about this stylus pen is it's basically the next step up from just plain disposable a lot of people do view these pens as disposable even though it is rechargeable in terms of availability this no matter what type of oils you have available whether it's prefilled cartridges or whether it's tinctures or syringes you can if you buy this kit you're able to use it because it does have a 5-10 thread battery that cartridges can screw on to however these auto draw batteries are not the modernized drawers like in the elf so if you're a cartridge is a high-capacity ceramic cartridge or a really wide cartridge battery could be a little underpowered in terms of budget price these pens retail for about twenty to twenty-five dollars they are their simple easy to use there's a very budget kit it's a very budget starter kit it is auto draw you know and with this carry case on our next level it is pretty stealthy because you just have in this little wallet case slip it into your pocket and you're not gonna hear or say anything about but once you have the the actual cartridge and the battery screwed on you know that that stealthiness kind of does go away now this cartridge is very similar to the cartridge that we have stock in our beekeeper unit and we have a detailed video on how to to fill this unit how to fill this year and up and it is actually very easy to fill up and to function there's no buttons there's no clicking there is no unlocking you just simply fill up the cartridge screw it onto the battery and your ready to vape it is an auto draws very easy to use battery life battery life for a rechargeable unit it probably does fall on the lowest end of the spectrum of our comparison it is basically about the same battery life if not less than our disposable unit so this thing it is you are gonna need to charge it more if you're on the go when it is charged up it's definitely gonna give you some good hits you're gonna run good with it but it is it is really the entry-level unit if you're just getting into vaping don't know of vaping z' for you you want to pick up a nice cost-effective kit that is gonna be easy for you to get started with just to see if you like vaping but it's not you know gonna be your daily driver or your long hauler mobility with the carrying case and even without it's a very lightweight it is a mobile we unit so you're gonna be able to run around with it you know it's it's a very small compact it is a little bit taller than our previous unit by about an inch with the cartridge on there and power this is an auto draw unit and it does have a more basic cartridge which has a wick so in terms of power they're not going to be that powerful when you when you draw you're not gonna get monster clouds because first of all it's not push-button second of all is because it's more of a traditional cartridge however it is very reliable of a unit now in terms of flavor again these kits were not knocking them at all we do make them they're very entry level in terms of flavor I don't think that you will get blown away you would have to switch it out to a different cartridge if you have very high quality extracts then I would probably consider upgrading the cartridge or stepping into a different level of a kit but very basic very good way to get started very easy to use lightweight a starter kit on that end all right next up our upgrade from our disposable pen we have our Gold Line vape battery okay which is a push-button variable temperature battery we did a very thorough review of this and it is actually paired up with our cloud tank here what's cool about this batteries it's 510 thread it works with all 510 thread batteries and also if you purchase this cartridge you can definitely take advantage of tinctures and syringes so in terms of what's available in your state if you buy one of these you're basically covered on all your ends in terms of budget this tank goes for I think $12 on our website and the the battery is $20 so it's actually your under $35 for this starter kit the way that it is and for that price you are getting a lot of bang for the buck because you are getting a very good battery it has three different temperatures it has preheat mode you know also chargeable very good we did a full detailed review of this pen if you want to see the features and specs it is actually very easy to use however because it's push-button it adds you know one level over the auto draw units that we just discussed here so you would definitely have to have some very basic vape knowledge but again this knowledge is very basic nothing to get freaked out about battery life this unit has a high-capacity battery it has a 650 mah battery so it is actually a very high capacity battery for a little vaporizer which is actually more than twice the the capacity of this so if you're looking for something more on-the-go and something that is definitely going to go to need less charges this is is a better unit option for that in terms of mobility it is a little bit long but it's still relatively light can still fit into your pocket still very transportable light enough to hold on a lanyard but it is a little bit long in terms of mobility in terms of power it has three intensity settings so you can hone in on what power you feel comfortable with so if you're not sure what you're gonna like it's definitely a good idea to have something that has variable temperatures and on the most intense setting a lot of our customers even have commented on the YouTube channels of of this pen that it hits really solid so for a small pen it definitely delivers the power if you pair this with not somebody else's prefilled tank you're filling your own you pair it with our cloud tank with a ceramic heater you're definitely gonna get good flavor so I really think that where does this pen rank in terms of an oil pen I think if you're looking for a beginner pen on a budget you cannot go wrong with this pen and it is a deftly a solid choice and the first step to get into the big leagues now let's move on to our most popular vaporizer that's being sold as the honey stick beekeeper it is a concealer so it is it's also been ranked by a lot of people as one of the best oil pens and the cartridge it comes with is a thick oil similar to the disposable very basic because most people do utilize 510 threaded cartridges it works on magnet adapter we have a very detailed video about this this this unit so because it does come with a tank you can use it for basically everything from tinctures to syringes and also 510 thread tanks that you could screw the magnet adapter on so no matter what your state has going on if you pick up a beekeeper more than likely you're gonna be able to take advantage of that it's pretty cost effective unit its selling on our website for 39.99 so it really isn't a big high-dollar unit and it delivers a lot stealthiness the concealer unit because it keeps the cartridge concealed it is actually very small as you can see here it definitely ranks very high on the stealth factor nobody really knows what's going on on top of it all it's a matte black looking like a stealth bomber I think it ranks very high in that level ease of use there's no variable temperatures there's one small button that's push button five clicks on five clicks off push and hold while you inhale super easy to use you can see our detailed video on that battery life this unit also has a high capacity battery which is just about twice the capacity of of these standard batteries so you're definitely going to be able to take this on the go more and get more out of it mobility I don't think you have a much more mobile unit to carry around it'll fit into your little jean pocket wherever slide into a little bitty groove into the purse it's not much bigger than a little thing of lipstick so in terms of power the beekeeper definitely does deliver power it doesn't have variable intensity sync so if you don't like a larger volume inhale you know you can't adjust it down real so it has a good power spectrum that delivers nice power if you're looking for flavor I really highly recommend you buy the high-performance beekeeper cartridge which has a wickless ceramic heater in it and it definitely brings out a lot more flavor notes and smoothens it out if you're filling your own cartridge and if you put your Magna dap tour on there it just drops in it even has a very cool stainless steel tip alright so now we're moving right along to our elf unit we just got done going over the beekeeper so the elf has basically a lot of the same characteristics in the sense that it's a very small actually a little bit smaller than the beekeeper concealer that works well with but that's a magnetic that works well with prefilled cartridges tinctures as well as fills a notable differences is the elf already comes with high performance good tasting ceramic cartridge so you can get a little bit more performance out of the stock elf cartridge it's glass then the stock beekeeper cartridge that that one comes with however a notable difference is they have the same battery capacity but this one is actually easier to use because it is buttonless so you don't have to unlock anything it is an auto draw unit now even though a lot of times Auto draw units are less powerful a lot of people have set the elf is actually a very powerful auto draw unit because the sensitivity of the sensor when you start drawing so you're still gonna get good power you're gonna get better flavor the unit is actually very stealthy it's a little bit easier to use if you're just getting started you don't like pushing small buttons a lot of people say they're medical medical condition doesn't let them to to push small buttons so it's very easy to draw the unit is very mobile has good power and because the high performance cartridge you do to a little bit of extra flavor out of it so this is also another good concealer now if you looked at the if you determine that hey I need a concealer based off of you know the characteristics that we went through our eight important factors but you want something that has a little bit more or has a little bit more battery power your next step up is our phantom unit which our phantom unit is basically a concealer as you could see it's very similar in size it's a little bit bigger but the reason it's a little bit bigger is it has two and a half times the battery capacity of the elf and the phantom so you're gonna go a lot more between charges it's also squeeze action so it's you're not pushing any small buttons however were the key differences is that it has four different temperature settings so you can really tune in on that power and flavor level that you want it comes with a high performance cartridge and what's cool is it also comes with I don't have it here on the table actually I do it even comes with a wax adapter cartridge so if the availability of prefilled cartridges oils that you can fill aren't there but waxes are you have the wax adapter as well so it really allows you to be very very versatile when you're using the phantom it's a very cool looking unit feels very good extremely stealthy because you can't see the cartridge still small but it does have more power more capacity and it has a four available temperature settings on here again we have a couple very in-depth videos about this year on the channel so if you're a going concealer this is probably where you're gonna be however it does cost more it is our most expensive concealer that we have over here which on our website think it's about 129 on here but really solid unit just you can feel the quality so if you're not sure if you want something like a stick a battery or concealer and you want something in between and you're really trying to get the vaporizer into places a vaporizer shouldn't be we have our minimax Pro which is a switchblade action key fob battery which will does not come with a cartridge the elf phantom and the beekeeper all come with their cartridges so if your state or your availability doesn't have 510 thread cartridges you will need to buy a cartridge to pair this with in order to get it functioning it is not that expensive of a unit it retails on our website for $40 it is pretty easy to use it does have three temperature settings but it only has one button here that you push so you'd have to unlock it and relock it and cycle through the temperatures through here what is cool about it is that it does have a pretty high capacity battery it has a 650 million power battery so it does actually have more capacity than the elf and the beekeepers so it falls kind of right in between these two units in terms of battery life the thing about it is though is it is extremely stealthy because it was designed like a car key it even fits on your keyring so it's extremely mobile so you can see the cartridge hides over here and you push the button and it flips open so you keep it completely hidden this is where the key would be I mean this thing is gonna fly under the radar basically wherever you have it as long as you pair it with your wallet or have it on your keychain because the three power levels that it has you can wind up the intense and you can get some really good power rips out and I know some people posted reviews on our in-depth video about this product and they said that on the third power level they will have able to get some really good strong power and depending on what cartridge you pair it with if you have it paired with like a cloud tank like our cloud tank on our website that has a good smooth ceramic flow your also get some really good flavor notes out of it so this little unit if you're really stealthiness is super important to you but you still want to have some good features in there and stay keep a pen that's you know under $50 pad your you're looking pretty good with the minimax Pro for your oil needs so we just went over all these regular oil and cartridge devices now I want to take take the next step to jump into a new level of vaporizer which is our sub ohm I have a video that really goes into sub ohm and oil vaping and I really truly do believe it as a future trend a lot of customers do ask me hey what if I just buy the most expensive pen is it the best pen or not well the short answer is generally the most expensive pens are better and more performance but it still might not fit your personal 8 characteristics that we went through as good as some of the other pens but the sub ohms are our favorite they're one of our fastest growing areas and honey stick is really one of the best innovators in this area so let's start off if you like the concealer but you want a sub ohm we have our old unit the Ripper which we actually have the new one here's the shell of it I don't have a finished unit because they are gonna be delivered this week so just a couple more days guys I know a lot of people put in their pre-orders and the new version is actually gonna look just like this really cool shell and it's gonna be a two in one it's actually gonna have a wax adapter as well but the Ripper is your sub ohm concealer so now just really really quickly what a sub ohm unit does is it just brings really low resistance really high power and intensity and what I would say is much greater flavour notes to oils and I put up a video about sub ohm oil vaping and we've reviewed a lot of our sub ohm devices now the Ripper is your sub ohm concealer it does not work with 510 thread cartridges so if you only have 510 thread cartridges in your state this is probably not a vaporizers that you're gonna pick up because you either need tinctures or syringes but it is actually disguised to look as a lighter you flip it open you have your button you know it has it has a telescopic mouthpiece that comes out here and we will have a full review of a ripper when it's in stock it only has one temperature setting which is in tense however this unit is extremely stealthy a lot of people have confused it as a lighter it's very easy to use because it doesn't have any digital settings it's not variable temperature it's just a 5 click lock and because the lock is covered you don't even really have to keep it locked the the cartridges just pop in and out which you do have to fill because they are subohm they just pop in and the top screws on it's a very simple extremely durable mechanism it does have an ultra high-capacity battery which actually has about 20% more capacity than even our phantom so very high-capacity battery it's extremely mobile extremely durable very tough unit and on the power scale it is off the charts in terms of intensity you can YouTube some videos of people using this device in terms of flavor I feel it has better flavor than most cartridges however when we get down into our digital mods and tanks you can really fine-tune the flavor so I think in subohm in the sub own category it has better flavor than a lot of standard units however because of all the power and because you can't really fine-tune it in it's definitely higher on the power and intensity spectrum that is on the flavor spectrum for sub ohm so that's our Ripper check out the full review on that one so moving into the sub ohms we really have two units that a lot of people often compare and contrast we have our our Cannabis Cup winning sub ohm original kit which a lot of people on the YouTube channel refer to as the OG cannabis cup kit really like that name possible name change there and our newest sub ohm Sport kit now both of them have very high capacity batteries both of them have really awesome tanks both of them are in terms of budget wise they're definitely on the higher end of the spectrum there there both under $200 the subohm sport is 169 and the sub-ohm original kit is right around that $200 mark so these aren't your regular budget kits these are your luxury kits but they definitely perform now in terms of availability of what you have available if you have 510 thread cartridges available you're not going to be will unscrew this tank and use a 5-10 thread cartridge on this battery without an ego adapter on our sub ohm og kit you do have an ego adapter that you unscrew right here you just flip this over put it back onto your battery and you're able to use 510 thread cartridges you can fill these with syringes or tinctures I would probably not consider these as stealthy as versatile and versatile even though they do fit into the pocket they are heavier I mean that's a good in terms of a quality standpoint but they do have a little bit of half so in terms of mobility and you know stealthiness you don't really get away with that the subohm sport is slightly stealthier than the OG kit because it has a window covering around the glass so you don't really see what's in there it also offers a little bit more protection now the battery life these things are both ultra high capacity they're way over the 1500 mAh as well so you get a lot of capacity of these you charge these things up a lot of people go days without getting a charge even without having to recharge it even our very heavy daily users both these units you can dial up the power big-time this one goes up to 36 watts which is more than what you will need this one actually goes all the way up to 60 watts which is definitely way more than you're ever really gonna need which which can just really you know melt the whole power spectrum in terms of hits now in terms of flavor they're going to be a little bit different you can use a blender option on here which uses a solid block ceramic heater and then this one uses a ceramic and Kanthal heater in here which has different bottom draw and orifice holes a lot of people say that this kid is really easy to get started with but basically you start off with this kit and then you graduate into kind of this tank with the the taste delivery and the power and how you're actually able to use as a blender and put solid concentrates into there so power these kits are both way up in the spectrum flavor I would say they're both up there and the very high rankings of flavor but once you you know really want to fine-tune your experience there's nothing really like the og cannabis cup kit that's what the judges and socal thought and really that's what a lot of our audience things but these kids are really closely matched now the only other thing that I can say to add to these two that's going to decrease your mobility but increase the power and flavor you're gonna be all have on tap is adding our bumblebee bubbler we did a full review and demo on this with honey girl or another one of our videos is you can pair it with our sub ohm devices and it can because you'll run it through water you can really crank up the power and really smooth out even more flavor to take your vaping experiences to all new levels however what's this gonna do to your oil pen definitely gonna increase you know it's gonna sorry decrease your mobility it's definitely gonna decrease any stealthiness that you had it's gonna increase the power I would say it will definitely increase the flavor notes as well it's gonna tack on another about 20 to 30 bucks to your budget cuz you're watching this video so you're gonna wait for the discount code at the end and it's also what's cool about those availability wise you can actually pair this thing with 510 thread cartridges to still put them on so this is still compatible with 510 thread cartridges so that's the bubbler lastly the only other way that you can improve your oil vaping experience is by having a battery like our speed barrier it has a lot of features but you have to be a really an expert vape level to really use this battery you can set the Watts in just fine but there's features and temperature controls and how you want your power to come on that you're not gonna get in standard batteries it really takes a step above even these two batteries and it has twice the capacity and power availability of both these batteries so you know you can also get one of these batteries to pair with your oil tanks however this battery is too powerful for a lot of little oil tanks so it's not gonna be fully compatible there alright so just to summarize guys thank you so much for tuning in I hope that walking through our old oil devices and showing you guys how we rank them in terms of what's available to you your budget your stealthiness your ease of use - battery life mobility power and flavor

a good idea of what you're getting into next time you make your oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils can build up to a semi solid state on the wick so if you're looking for a cartridge that won't shadow around it though this is the cartridge for you the ex3 is a glass cartridge with a surco me of fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best vapor production

we're checking out the rhythm cartridge and about a third of the way through this thing and let's take a look at the light too you know it's it's okay it's not really great and it's not really strong this is the energy one and it's about 70 to 73 percent THC and you know it's it's not terrible it's just not strong as the other cars and considering that it's $45 which is the same price as other cards that makes it not that great of a value because I right before this I was eating this the serene heart and the serene cart kind of blows us away and then I was also hitting the can of eight if I got at the same time as this and that blows it away so comparing to the other Nevada brands there's just a lot stronger out there for the same price now if someone wants something it's not super blow you away this might be it the one thing I do notice about this this is the energy one and it really doesn't make you slow it doesn't really make you that tired and that is a good thing however if I was looking for an energy one the city trees energy disposable that I tried I don't know a few months ago I thought was more energetic than this and this will still get you there you just got to hit it more so essentially the value is not as good because I got hit this five times you get the same effect is hitting you know like the city trees or roots like twice then that's means I'm paying more than twice as much for to get the same effect so for someone that's not like a hit at all the all the time kind of person like most of you put it right for our site are you know and this might be a good cartridge for you if you want somethin weaker or you want something like you know for your dad who's smoked in the 70s this might be a really good option I think it's I think they'll come back with something stronger and we'll be testing with them again and it'll be better this is usually how how it goes you know we try some of these brands well these smaller bands when they come out it seems like they got something like sixty some seventy seven percent and then come back and it's way better you know and I would say that happen with lucid oils the lucid oils original I tried their syringes like 68 percent I was like it's really good oil but that's strong then they come back with the new one it's 86 and it blows you away so I think rhythm will come back with something stronger and I'll definitely trying them again other thing I didn't like that much about this was the taste this has more of a co2 ish taste than a distill it tastes I prefer that nice distill it taste that one of the cleanest tasting distill 'ti kind of taste was that can of a taupe cartridge I really like that one so this on straight not so hot on taste not so hot room for improvement totally and I bet you will be reviewing this again and will be much better at some point but for now the rythm cartridge is probably something I would not get again when there's other cartridges available but it may be a good option for someone who does want to get too tired and you know isn't you smoking stuff that's as strong as how strong some of these really strong cards are at this point so we'll take a hit you can see how it hits good thing about it real Cecil hardware I believe let's just triple check that pretty sure Tyrell so you saw let's see yep you got the Jupiter it's real see so so we'll go ahead and take a hit on this and you guys can see how it hit so hold on one sec so now we'll give it a head you guys can see how this thing hints it's good yeah I mean I'm down in my absolute best C cell battery let someone borrow my vessel so this is still a pretty good battery that's king cloud mini I think it works really good clones but still gives it a good hit and yeah it's just not as strong as the other ones but it's alright so not gonna get this one too thumbs up but not giving exactly two thumbs down either it's just something I wouldn't get at this point and I think in the future they'll make it stronger and then the rhythm cartridge something I'll probably try again definitely thanks for watching guys this dab connection and have a great week", "t5Mtbx-W0D4": "hey guys dr. Shawn Mira vici here and I'm gonna do another cannabis product review for you despite all the craziness happening in the world right now with Koba 19 I'm practicing very strict social distancing but that doesn't mean I can't keep doing product reviews for you so today we have the another vape cartridge product using the 510 thread system today is going to be the sundial Zen very also known as shish kebob and so this comes from sundial growers they're based in Alberta some things of note about this company is that they really emphasize that they're putting out pure products meaning that they're free from additives fillers and artificial flavorings so you know you're getting a really pure product they do a glass and ceramic cartridge so a very high quality cartridge and they use single strain extracts so it's kind of like a single malt scotch meaning that your extracts just coming from one strain rather than a mix of different strains a lot of the other cartridges out there are really a mix of a bunch of different strains so kind of cool that this is a single strain extract it comes in at around 72 to 82 percent THC meaning that it's very strong THC level it's available on the Ontario cannabis store retailing for about 49 actually it's exactly forty nine ninety-five putting it into sort of the middle midpoint range in terms of price for for a vape cartridge but I don't mind paying a little bit extra if I'm getting a really good quality product so let's open it up it's also got a sort of a unique box most of the other fake cartridges I've received come in this paper box this one is this plastic round container and you open up by you see those notches you match up the notches there and then you pull it open or at least you try to pull it open yeah there we go okay let's pull it out you could take a look at that looks really nice it's got their logo there a nice glass container and the tip feels really nice too so you could tell it's high-quality and that just fits into your 510 cartridge battery system you screw that in there okay and then you're ready to go one thing I also wanted to mention about this particular strain is that they're terpene profile includes cario Filene Mersin and humulin and alluding to its name they say that you're gonna get like a nice sort of berry flavor with this vapor and I agree so you'll notice like it doesn't really taste obviously like berries but there is sort of this hint of barrenness in the flavor i had previously ordered the aurora indica cartridge and that was just like really just straight-up like cannabis ii flavor this one definitely has a hint of barrenness to it so i've been using this for the past three four days not a huge long time but but I do like the vapor it's nice and smooth it's got that sort of berry finish to it it is quite strong and it's a creeper meaning that you don't really feel this one right away it sort of creeps up on you after about 10 minutes so definitely go slow with this one because it will sort of creep up the effects and they are quite strong so it is quite calming it hits Li you like in a whole body way but it's very short-lived like it only lasts 60 to 90 minutes and then you kind of feel a little sleepy afterwards so I wouldn't recommend this as a daytime strain definitely best suited for evening nighttime use and that's really what I've noticed about this product is that it's strong but the effects wear off quite quite soon after so like an hour to an hour and a half taking all of those factors into account so you know a good quality product stressing that it's added to three which you know is what I want in a vape cartridge it it's that single strain all around like a high quality product but the effects are short-lived and the price is sort of mid to high range so taking all those into consideration I'm gonna give this one an 8 out of 10 good product a couple limitations with it but but there you have it the sundial Zen berry thanks

thieving Birds Applebloom hey sis how'd you get your cutie mark I never told you that story hey I thought we were gonna ask Rainbow Dash we need all the help we can get uh fine ah why shoot I was just a little filly even littler than y'all I didn't want to spend my life on a muddy old apple farm I wanted to live a sophisticated life like my aunt and uncle Orange so I set out to try my luck in the

demonstration on how to do Applejack's since my Monday night class has been asking probably won't be the greatest quality video because I'm looking down at my feet but this will be the best way to do it is to sit in a chair and just to practice the motion of it and then it eventually come it is a tough step but once you have it your brain will just be able to do it so I'm sitting here I have weight on both feet the basic motion of Applejack's is to take one toe out to the side as the other heel comes in to the instep and bring them back together and if I was going to do one to the right the right toe would be going out and the left heel swivels in towards the instep so what's happening is one toe is going out as the other heel is swiveling in oh yeah boom what makes this happen is the weight changes so as I start to swivel the weight is going on to the heel of my left and the ball of my right and when I go into the other direction the weight is going on to the heel the heel of my right and the ball of my left so again you can't really see it but my left toe and my right heel are off the floor right now and then over here my right toe and my left heel are off the floor so you're just swiveling and swiveling and swiveling in okay quite often in the dances you'll get a double Apple chat to the left a double Apple jab to the right often you'll see single single double double single single double double Applejack's are counted one and two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight okay so that's how you do them good luck in practicing that and if you see me around the studio I'll be glad to help you", "YpziYHdrR_w": "hey guys this definition we're reviewing arrow pros live resin series particularly this is wedding cake it's a hybrid coming in around seventy nine percent THC so this is the new thing from arrow Pro that they're doing live resin now all the carts before were just really distill it and I got to say I really like this the flavor is more cannabis oil type flavor it's not as you know flavored with different kinds of flavorings like mosteiro pros are and i like those flavors - I gotta say mountain mists which is a menthol kind of flavor I like it as long as the the carts are clean and it's done right I'm down the flavor carts I've had some that just weren't that strong like the rad vape but I've never had any AeroPro cart that was not strong so I really do like AeroPro and again this live resin something I like as well it's it seems like the oil is a little darker color than the distill it it does not have any like co2 which kind of taste it tastes like a good live resin so people that like that live resin taste and enjoy the Arab for hardware might like this instead of their regular cartridges I probably would still just be hitting both I think strength wise they're pretty comparable so this new method didn't really sacrifice any strength and I found that even arrow pros at like in the high 70s like I've had mountain mists at 78 be stronger than some of the other carts out there at you know in the low 90s so actually I would take I've had an arrow pros at 78 I would take over a Eureka I had at 96 percent THC which was still a Eureka was great but the arrow pros a little better and arrow Pro they've sold over three million cartridges and not had a single health complaint so everyone's worried about oh cartridges people getting sick you know that's all vitamin E acetate and cuts and stuff like that arrow pro is a multi-state company you know I they do have individual people that I think it do something with oil in different areas but it's all like a very high standard and that's why three million units sold and not a single health complaint so I know I mean who safety teas but I'll be hitting AeroPro for for a while so let's take a hit take a look it looks like you know I didn't take the fattest hit here's about what mm-hmm yeah you're a pro hardware it's basically a magnetized automatic magnet I see so with the vibrating function puts out a little more vapor than normal I like it and take another look at that resin and this also has been vaping pretty slow and hit this thing a lot and the oil Dave's pretty slow so AeroPro live resin you got to say overall two big thumbs up and I got to say I kind of expected that from AeroPro everything they've done has been super high quality the only issue they've had is they've had some batteries that have failed and I know there was a bad batch out there so you did have that the information is on our site on one of our prove ease we'll put it there to get that replaced but that's the only issue there I Pro has had and they warranty it so besides that I mean everything has been so great about it the product is excellent it hits well the live resin takes good so our po2 thumbs up this dab connection thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "A2k1Q7rTNJg": "hey everybody its cannon Joe we are checking in today at Stinson Beach California one of our last days out in California and today we are very excited to review a Willys reserve distillate cartridge this is Mountain mist this is the flavor and we were super lucky enough to be introduced to a woman that basically gave us these and donated these products here to us from Flo Canada and we are very very excited to try this Willy's reserve as a Willie Nelson brand and of course everybody hears about that and they want to try it out and here today we are about to so let's just go ahead and get in on it so we've got our warnings of course this is awesome packaging I really like it local farmers you can check it out online recyclable packaging that's cool yeah this is nice packaging everything's nice I like the colors really stands out they did a good job they're got Willie Nelson in the background right there that's cool 81 percent THC again this is a distillate and then you've got 0.33% of CBD so oh I like that big packaging there I've never seen one like this now okay but you take that out like that wow this is this is a heavy-duty case right here [Music] okay that was an extremely long horn blow again we are at a beach so it's probably the get in or get out of the water call so here we go this cartridge is very high-quality we've got like a stainless steel feel here on the mouth tip it's a very large hole this is uh it's heavy too it's got the WR right there on the right there on the logo and so we're gonna just go ahead and try it out here see what happens okay here we go mmm that's good lemony hmm Wow mmm that's got everything you're looking for I mean it's got the Terp tic it's got the back of the throat choke it's got the whole tickle in the nose it's got pretty much everything but it's not bad in any way shape or form because a lot of the times that all those things can go into a bad you know they can be too much term tech too much choke throughout all them things that you don't want but this is pretty much all that you do let's try this again just get one more try see what really happens excuse me I didn't expect that okay who's that my friends excuse me all right so you want to be careful with this this is no joke this is not a joke this is the lowest temp a lot of times with your vape pens you know you can take the whole hit sometimes maybe even two you can time out the pin to really get the flavor saver going but this one here no this is a one I mean you can barely get through one time out with this and yeah I feel I feel a little on the road again so yeah I definitely appreciate this

guys haven't added the snapchat or the instagram go ahead and do so i will leave all the information down in the description box below but other than that guys i've been pretty good myself um just got back from my dispensaries so so today i ended up picking up a platinum vape guys this is like one of the one that stands it out um it's the first time i've seen them in my dispensaries so i really you know i definitely had to try it out so i've never seen these around before um so if you guys ever had one of these let me know what you guys think about it it's like i said the packaging really caught my attention how it has a little cali you know little logo cut out right there and uh it's pretty dope so i ended up getting the gelato this one's around this cartridge is around 90 so it's one of the reasons i got it and gelato strain is always good you know they're always good they taste good and um so this cartridge was made like about last month or two the good thing about the boxes um it shows you the flavor on it it says it's earthy it's citrusy and it's sweet and it's known for relaxed happy creative uplifted energetic that's pretty dope you know shows the details on the box and stuff like that not that many boxes show that so that's pretty dope so i haven't smoked all day so like i'm just like trying to get high man it's like it's like 12 in the afternoon so it's kind of my waking break you know for my first time so there's ways to open it in the box but you know some some people just like to show the [ __ ] box open i'm always shredding my boxes open man they're supposed to be child proof and sometimes i can't open them by themselves so here we have a tube guys if like i said if you guys ever had the platinum vapes before let me know if you guys enjoyed it you know the price is pretty good on these cartridges honestly i paid like 31 it was 30 dollars flat but with like a dollar tax i think so that's pretty that's pretty cheap for a cartridge no i i don't i don't mind whether it's live resin or distillate you know before all this live resin it was just this is like cartridges and you know i don't mind smoking distillate it gets you high as [ __ ] and it's just it tastes good some people are like ah this list not good but you know i'll smoke this a little i smoke like resin it doesn't matter as long as it's good it tastes good that's all that that shouldn't matter so so this one's a gelato cartridge um i'm gonna go ahead and dry it just see if there's like some flavors in there or some [ __ ] honestly you don't you just get like a little taste to it flip ultra honestly this battery is hella good right now i've been using this um flip ultra for like the past couple weeks and it's been really good you know i had gone this better like a couple months ago and it's a pretty good battery you know it's a flip battery you know you can put it in your pocket and it has a lock on it so it won't [ __ ] flip open in your pocket and break so that's pretty good you know so here we have like so here we have the cartridge guys give you guys a close-up on that as you guys can see the little sticker the california logo sticker it's legit i'm just gonna go ahead and flip it over just to show you guys the quality on it gotta be thick you know i can't be running you guys know that and uh so here we have the battery i'm just gonna screw it on here try and get baked right now man i'm gonna hit the [ __ ] out of this pen so here we have the pan guys and um that's pretty dope though like once you connect it it shows you like the little posts so far on this battery i have 575 puffs so far that's like five cartridges ran to that [ __ ] so other than that guys hopefully you guys are smoking along with me i'm about to get hot as [ __ ] right now so cheers guys i'm gonna let you know i'm gonna let you guys know what this tastes like these batteries hit oh [ __ ] honestly these cartridges are pretty good you know they taste really really clean you know i didn't think they were gonna be as good just the simple fact that they were like 30 bucks you know i thought they're gonna be like 40 so that's crazy it tastes really really clean you know like on the packaging it says it tastes so on the packaging it says it tastes earthy citrus and sweet it's what it says back there i don't know if you guys can see but honestly that's what it tastes like it does taste really sweet and it does taste earthy so to be honest you don't really get like a citrusy flavor it just tastes really clean like an earthy flavor to it so it's pretty good you know i'm gonna go ahead and rip it some more big clouds right i don't know i don't know about you guys but the tip on these cartridges i really love those tips you know those round tips it just makes the cartridge more appealing and they hit way better i don't know that's just my opinion let me know what you guys think about that but i'm trying not to cough right now this cartridge is like 90 you know i'm just trying to hold my coffin i want to start coughing and [ __ ] off my bed on the videos you know it's just my schedule's kind of [ __ ] up right now but i'm still trying my best to bring out some more videos for you guys and uh like i said if you guys have it out of the snapchat go ahead and do so i'm more active on instagram and snapchat but if you guys would like to add both go ahead and do so but just has me going you know she has me high as [ __ ] already and i just took two hits it's around 12 in the afternoon so you know it got me feeling pretty good so and the reason i really like [ __ ] with distiller is just that some distillery cartridges have more thc in them than what a live resin would have like i was looking at cartridges right now my dispensary and most discs to the cartridges they range from like 80 to the high 90s you know compared to a light resin which which ranges from like the low 70s to high 80s you know it's kind of hard to find the live resin with like 90 in it you know i'm still on the lookout for those but other than that yeah there's like a [ __ ] little dish of the cartridges at my shop there's a lot of live resin but i never knock off distally you know there's people that say uh distill is bad but you know it's pretty good you know it depends on the cartridge you guys get and you know there's some cartridge to be honest there's there is some distilled cartridges that are not good i just give you a headache and it tastes like [ __ ] like fake this or like cheap you know but there's just some distillates that you know some companies really do spend their time to make them a little better and they are pretty good so you just got to go ahead and you just got to go ahead and you know start trying new brands that's what i do so like this was my first time trying the platinum vapes and i'm really enjoying it you know it gots me going cheers guys and this battery also if you guys would like to if you guys would like to purchase this battery i'm gonna go ahead and leave the information down in the description box so you guys go ahead and check it out it's pretty dope you know it's a flip battery and also comes with the little lock so you can't open it so like if it's in your pocket you're up and down at work it's not going to open and break up on you which has happened to me before and it's not good so it's dope it turns on automatically as you guys can see so that's one of my favorite cartridge batteries that i'm using right now selenius but other than that guys um i'm gonna be having some more hotbox videos soon for you guys i know i've been lacking on those two so oh [ __ ] i got the ac pumping right now this thing has me sweating man and as you guys can see it says 90 thc hopefully you guys can see that cartridge is really good so if you guys ever see these in this in the store go ahead and purchase one you know they're really good and for the price i paid 30 dollars flat for this [ __ ] guys and that's that's a good thing about living in california you know right here where i'm from in modesto california everything's cheap like a top shelf eighth is like 25 bucks if you want like an exotic uh if you want like an exotic eighth it's like 30 to 40 dollars max you know you know it's pretty dope you know but if you guys enjoy videos like this give this video likes don't forget to subscribe you

welcome to another one of my videos thank you for taking your time and watching them i also want to welcome other new youtube subscribers twitter followers and instagram followers to the family remember to click the subscribe button below to join the fam that way you don't miss out on any new episodes new giveaways and more let's get right to it on this video i'm going to tell you about the all glass 1 milliliter vape cartridges that i got from o2 vape dot com by delivery order i paid 40.99 for five of these cartridges i could have gotten one by itself for 9.99 but i can't do just one of anything this right here is the most beautiful coil system i have ever ever seen gravity does its job oil is absorbed by a ceramic coil and it vaporizes so flavorful on this beauty i have run at least six syringes through my main cart and it still hasn't clogged due to its design this is the cartridge side at the top even the paper pass is 100 glass too makes any oil tasted on this is the tank put together after the first fill as you can see once the oil had gone to the glass part of the cartridge i removed the blue phillip tool first and then i installed the coil on the cartridge by just screwing them together as usual we will start with the cons the first con i found was that learning how to fill the tank was a steep learning curve for me and i'm used to filling up tanks the syringes with the plastic tip in the end will need the little blunt tip extension that will fill it'll fill the card without spilling over that's the only issue i found with this tank as of now onto the pros because the design is all glass the tip never gets hot so i can use it all day long without ever burning my lips the flavor on these cards is amazing on every single hit no matter how much you use it through the day plus due to the coil design it doesn't take more than three to five hits in between strains to see the flavor change completely and cleanly they are super easy to clean if needed for example i spilled some oil into the vapor path while filling up the first one and i was able to just stick a q-tip dipped in alcohol in there to clean it right up i don't know what it is about being able to see right through the whole thing or being able to see the vapor path fill up and empty out as i hit it that just warms up my heart it makes me giddy inside too i can honestly say i had never up to this point in my life used a cartridge that didn't clog this one i haven't been able to clog it up yet that alone makes it the winner in my book then you add the flavor and how long they last come on now and as i sherry on top there is the savings from buying your oil and syringes instead of paying extra for the cards every time you need oil that right there turns in from a winner into a champion in my book i use these cards all day and night i hope this helps you medicate right have a great day", "qnJnuDTWlms": "hello everybody my name is J and I am coming to you with some problems with these vape pen cartridges so specifically these are the world's most awarded brand which is King pen and I've got multiple cartridges here that were given to me or lent to me with the purpose of figuring out why they won't work for whatever reason so I've identified after taking them apart and unscrewing them and messing with them and trying different ones and different contact points and cleaning and watching all the tutorials on youtube I have come up with the most comprehensive video in my opinion not how to fix these so there are three points here one is the air flow disrupted you could pause the video now and figure out so maybe as your air flow disrupted but I would suggest to wait until I start explaining all four areas and how they can get clogged number two is the center with coil displaced and not touching the contact pen so we're gonna use a special tool to recenter one or both coil wires and that is what you see here lastly are your wicks out of place if so you're probably gonna need to transfer the liquid from your cartridge to maybe another cartridge that's empty but still works so first and foremost I just wanna let you know I'm not an ambassador at all for kingpin butts if they want to bring me on board I clearly know what I'm talking about so mmm here's your product disassembled Kington and here are three of them put together you know I'm a thirty on this I've been reading the manual so I didn't read a book I didn't read a zine I didn't read a meme I just very curious about how things work so without further ado let's talk a little bit about point number one is the air flow disrupted all four areas so you might say what are the four areas well let's pick up this empty one I'm going to use this little pin for pointing purposes this is just paperclip and there are also many uses for this obviously specifically with these pens and the cartridges I should say first things first disclaimer do not stick this into here and all the way down do not stick it into the bottom and up and in because in the middle chamber you'll see there are two holes in this middle chamber which is the same as this middle chamber that I just knocked over this middle chamber is what is in sight at a glass tube this is a one-gram pen or one gram cartridge the two holes that you see right here and right here are blocked by a wick this is the wick here and the wick is wrapped around the coil so that's a little bit about the anatomy of what we have here this is the entire cartridge disassembled - the glass because I had to break the glass off once I screwed the top off the top does unscrew and will come off there are rubber washers in the middle there in the middle of the cylinder and there's a rubber washer on the outside so the rubber washer makes contact with the glass and the rubber washers here block any oil from moving up into the mouthpiece as you see it fits flush is the air flow disrupted the four areas are one the mouthpiece is a clogged we don't know the bottom is it clogged we don't know and then number three there are actually four holes next to the thread one two three and then four one area two areas and three areas the fourth area comes from the battery itself where the cartridge meets the pen battery there are four slots this is the use Oh oze pen also not affiliated with but if you guys want to bring me on board clearly I know what I'm talking about here we go this is the 650 pen 650 just tells you how much battery power is in this particular particular pen and there's also a voltage dial on the bottom so you can really dial in how much vapor you may potentially have because of how much heat will be transferred up into the cartridge and into the coil and then into the wick which will be full of your liquid content this is the fourth area if this areas blocks because you're holding it like a noob or some other person who has never handled one of these before you will be blocking the airflow from the two areas where air goes into which again are the four holes next to the threading or the bottom hole you can plug this hole and suck through the top because air will flow through the holes next to the thread you could theoretically plug those holes and then intake air through that bottom hole once you have your mouth on mouthpiece and are attempting to inhale is the airflow disrupted check all four areas you may have to use a flashlight and look inside of there a headlamp something but we suggest that you do not take off the little rubber nipples that they give you to protect your cartridge when you get these keep them on when they are not in use so that nothing does go in there unintentionally do not carry these loosely in your pocket because something could go in the mouth hole something you'd go into that bottom hole there the mouth hole could be clogged because maybe you've been using your pen for a long time you never cleaned it but as we see there there is a hole right down the middle it's nice and clear but we can also clean it I just use a paper towel and I just clean that's twist it up and clean it or you can use a pipe cleaner which is obviously a great tool for pipe like devices you can clean inside here and you can clean there make sure that that's good also too you know when you're opening your cartridge make sure you don't set it flat inside for too long like I just did because the contents might leak out but I had that off-camera nothing happened over here I didn't lose anything thank goodness because this stuff is expensive so what we're gonna do is gonna set that back down so that that liquid goes back down into the container then another area we check is that bottom that hole there a lot of people know that this part slides out and one of the problems the most basic thing that people say is when you just adjust this you pull this part out right here and all that and then inside of the battery the battery there that part has to touch that part right there and then you got to raise that part up and then you gotta raise that part and then they got to touch each other and like that that you know that's that's a thing sure but that's probably not gonna be your problem so you if that's what you're looking to do you could very gently raise this part up and you can very gently raise this part out you can kind of pluck it through the middle or you could just use your nail cuz your nail fits if it is that thin and you can see how it was once recess and is now not and I can even push it in gone flush dunzo doesn't need to be sticking out to make contact and for it to work how do I know it works because when I press my pen oh that's the actually the error code that's the does not work code so if you don't have it doesn't work for some reason that's great that that just happened because that brings you to a point number two so we already checked our air flow just messed up my whole stage here we're gonna check our air flow we did that at point one point two point woops 0.3 which is down here point three in point four which is when it's connected these pens so number two what does it say it says is the center wick coil displaced well I'm gonna cap this back up because that's just good habit good habits are hard to find put that right there this cartridge is relatively empty on purpose because this one wasn't working and I transferred the liquid into that one and on the way during that journey I found a couple of things this is level 2 all of the videos just deal with not even one they just deal with the does this part touch this part do they touch if not adjust that part or just that part that's fine cool but we need 50 people to make that video we need 50 people make this video and then 50 people to make this video in 50 people to make this video but luckily for you kingpin and furrows I am keeping people happy and satisfied so bring me on board because I'm tired of doing what I'm doing for living anyway where were we oh yeah fixing your product for people this cartridge has this and down here again this cartridge that I'm holding is the same as this right here this is the mouthpiece this is the metal middle cylinder which is down the middle of this glass and then you have a wick wrapped by a coil and a wick wrapped by a coil this wick is missing I tore it off intentionally then you have a rubber gasket and then you have a metal contact point this is the point that touches the battery inside of your pen this is this I know I'm over explaining things but a lot of people don't and also too you know a lot of people space out at the 11 minute and 40 second mark so good on you for staying involved moving on if you were to move this piece out of the middle what would happen it would fly out then you would expose the rubber gaskets is this rubber gasket the same as this yes that's what it looks like when you pull it out you pull out that way you look just like this boom so this is this and then that right there is that inside of here is supposed to be two little thin wires which are these two little thin wires and they would be connected to a wick in this case let's get that flashlight in that bad boy you could see one of those right there I'm gonna try to focus and get the flashlight on and just bear with me I know you don't like watching long videos but hey maybe your pen is broken and you're all bummed out and you're just being held hostage mr. informative over here because you know you want the thing to work because you have a desired effect in mind check it out there's one coil right there a one wire there should be two and if I personally look at it which is not gonna be helpful to you um I can see that the other wire is down in there put my flashlight away boom what I used was I went to my sewing kit yes sewing kit and I got this little tool this is for threading this is an assistant this is an assistant for threading go through the needle head go through the eye of the needle jeez Louise go through the eye of the needle and then you would put your thread into that part and then you pull it through that's what this is intended for but today it's for THC vaping products so that is a very thin gauge wire even more thin than that stuff down there how we get that out as we just kind of go fishing you can see that when we go inside of there the metal wire is hooked on the end conveniently and we can see that I have hooked onto that wire there are two of them though you gots to go get yourself another one and I'm very close to getting it I also don't want to waste a bunch of time because you might space out but lucky for you I got it they had two wires so this was the one that wasn't working I'm gonna see if miraculously this which I know this fixes it I just don't know if I can't kind of can't see what I'm doing and I'm just making this tutorial video just to show you what to do so once I put my peace back in and it's gone flush up against those metal coils I try it back again this is against for problem number two and once I put it back on there if those wires are flush this will just stay lit normally it won't give me that weird blink code so let's just see what happens boom it lights up normally just fixed it in your face contracts in my Inbox what do we got moving on don't just love it when you watch a video and everything works accordingly because the person that's teaching you is an expert alright sorry that's the last time I'm gonna do that I'm just really happy you should be happy too because these are the really expensive things and when they don't work you can give you really bummed out I read that in an article because you know I don't do this kind of stuff that's that we'll move on to problem number three now oh and then so that tool that's just like a sewing kit tool we covered that you're not gonna get with tweezers tweezers are big and chunky you know how big they're I'll show you and I'm back here our tweezers you think that's gonna get in there inside that teeny tiny hole you ain't getting in that hole tell you that much right now boom good luck with those big fat tweezers getting inside that little hole it's just not gonna happen and this is probably the only tool you'll have that's even close to what you need and you're gonna say well it's the only tool I have I'm gonna make it work you're gonna mess it up you're gonna mess up something and if you do mess something up well something's gonna happen it's probably going to be step number three are your wicks out of place in that case you're probably going to need to transfer the liquid and that's what happened to me I had to transfer the liquid from this one to this one because those coils that are attached to that wire that we just pulled with this tool got knocked out of place if you look at this sorry right there that is the wick it is wrapped around and around and around by this little wire so wire comes up wrapped around round round round round round round and then it comes back down that wire one set is on the outside of this rubber washer the other set is inside the rubber washer the inside set is the one that we just did on that cartridge with this tool that's one that we just plucked out of that was in the middle this sensor cylinder would have inside of it you see right now that is a clean hole this again would be attached to the mouthpiece on this side and on the bottom this is what would screw into the bottom of the bait pan except for it's missing one thing what is it the glass I had to break the glass off because yes it's open on the one end but on the other end it's molded into place I believe so I broke I broke it off for the demonstration in this video so that you don't have to go injuring yourself or somebody that you love we're at 18 minutes now this is the metal sumela this is a middle cylinder all the airs are staying in I don't care I'm a professional middle cylinder clean hole it wouldn't be a clean hole though because it would be one two wicks blocking the view of the bottom that hole will be occupied by the two wicks if you held it over a flashlight remember a flashlight familiar I'm gonna blind you for a second to demonstration if I cover this hole and just plug this little bad boy right in there we should see Hey look at that we could see through there and there are some obstructions it is not as clean and open and empty is this again we're looking right here if it had fluid inside of that cylinder it wouldn't be a clean light what color would the light be you guessed it it would be this color we would be able to see down the middle if there was fluid leaking into that middle cylinder so the middle cylinder could get clogged because one of the wicks have been moved out of place somehow and that might have been our fault earlier using this little tool or maybe something happened during shipping or maybe this little metal piece went up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down too much or maybe we dropped it or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of pennies or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of posies we don't know what the case might be but for whatever reason fluid is now going into those holes and again what are those holes for those holes have the wicks inside of them they go straight across the fluid goes into the wicks the wicks are wrapped with coil the coil gets heated by an electrical current from the battery the battery makes contact with this metal piece which is this metal piece right here and on the inside of this metal piece are two wires that are attached to a coil which is it wrapped around a wick and on the outside of the rubber washer which is now here is another set of wires if any of those wires are displaced you will get a blinking code which we saw earlier if those wicks are out of place you will have drainage wreckless a drainage into the middle cylinder this fluid will start to fill up this compartment with fluid and it will sound very Slurpee and wet and bubbly when you take a draw from your mouthpiece the oil can leak out of the mouthpiece and the oil can leak out of the bottom and potentially the oil could leak out of the air holes all of which equal a gurgling Slurpee sounds when you draw on the cartridge so if your wicks are out of place you're gonna need to transfer the liquid so what I did was I took the cartridge that was good let's pretend this was the good cartridge it's empty for the most part I put the cap back on why so I could stand it up without a fallin over which it may anyway but if you have a good level surface it's gonna stand up straight but before I did that what I actually did was I unscrew the top to make it open and ready to receive new liquid that is what it looks like again do not get any liquid into this hole that shouldn't it be nice and clean the only thing that we should go in through that hole is the vapor of your oil once it is heated up by your coil heating element there so I've got this open I've gotten a nice flat service it's ready to receive I hope I took the cartridge that I wanted to empty the contents out of let's say this was a cartridge that was broken for some reason and it wasn't lighting properly and the maybe the coils are pushed in maybe I'm getting some other weird blink code maybe I just I did steps 1 & 2 it's not working I'm just going to get this cotton get the content out of here and put it into this other cartridge so what I did was I also unscrewed its top note there's a rubber washer to go flush up against the glass and they're rubber washers here on the middle cylinder that will go flush up against the mouthpiece as you see so that the contents won't leak up into the mouthpiece once I have my two cartridges disassembled I'm gonna show you a side view you would be doing this straight up and down but I'm gonna show you side view so what I did was I touched I waited for all the fluid to go down into one side and then I heated it a little bit with a lighter so it became more more runny and then I ran it down the side let these two tips touch but not inside but just on the outside what enough happening was the fluid ran down touched this middle cylinder and it touched then this middle cylinder and this road right down the side and into the new vial once I got to about the empty point what I did was say it got nice and full like that we're just reversing here it got nice and full what I did was I set it down like that and I took the other cartridge so I can get the last few drippings out of it and I put it right on top and you're gonna say no way that's ridiculous what kind of factory ancient aliens countertops do you have over there and what kind of skills do you have I mean I might be an alien it's okay boom I just stack things on top of each other I can also stack tennis balls on top of each other golf balls you name it again kingpin looking at my inbox still nothing it's okay we get all day these two things go on top of each other then your fluid can leak down into the new cylinder what does that look like from a side view it looks like this they'll be sitting right on top of each other and that fluid will be dripping from this one to this one will go right down the middle we hope and if not I made this I just got this this is look up this is a piece of mail now this was a piece of mail mm-hmm so I took this is the clear part which would have you read it from the outside this is the part that the mailman had been touching I use the inside and then if you were worried about anything spilling but you wanted to contain it and get it back later I put it right on top of there and I done this the first time I I didn't know what to do you know I stacked them on top of each other like that cuz again skills to pay the bills and then any fluid that went down in here like that I was able then to us to just fold my piece of cellophane or whatever this is I fold it in half like that and then I just had my my fluid right there in the middle and then I just cut off the corner and then I just squeezed it out like I was doing them like some pastry design or something you know those like Baker's bag the icing stuff you see how like it beads up and you just move it down can you squeeze it down into the side of your cartridge depending on how much matters and means to you you know maybe $50 or $60 or however much you're paying is a lot or maybe it's not but an either way at either rate at any rate it's not bad to save your time to save your money and these things can be pricey and expensive so hopefully I answered some questions for you I know this video is 28 minutes long at this point so just a recap of everything they have here the sharpies were kind of pointless I was doing something earlier them the tubes for the cartridges the cartridges themself the pen by use Rosie II kingpin cartridges most awarded brands in history thus far these are mouthpieces this is the anatomy of the whole cartridge the mouthpiece the center the center piece their two coils with two wicks one wicked missings I removed it the rubber gasket and then the metal contact point that makes contact with the battery of the pen the battery so that's that I know this is helpful for you hopefully at this point if something else is wrong I'm not aware of it maybe leave some more solutions down in the comments below if you have any questions feel free to ask again my name is jay and i know this was helpful to you have a good day",

internally refer to it as the c6 cartridge so if for any reason you give us a call and you are looking for this cartridge you can refer to it as the m60 or the c6 cartridge however it is very tricky to fill there are a number of small details that you must pay attention to to properly fill this cartridge without any issues so I'm going to separate this video into two different portions the first portion we're going to identify the proper technique to fill this cartridge as well as the tools and techniques used to cap it now in the second part of this video what we're going to go into is more of a troubleshooting mode when we show you some of the common mistakes that can happen why they happen and how to prevent them so without any further ado let's begin [Music] so to begin explaining how to fill the m60 cartridge we will first review all the parts and identify each piece of the m60 so you know how they all fit together and what order they should be put together that's very important to note these should be placed together in a particular order number two I'm going to identify the tools that you'll need to put them together two of these tools are a blunt tip syringe as well as an arbor press now this Arbor press is maybe something that you have not seen or you may not have however it is available from air vapor for under $300 and it helps greatly with consistently and reliably capping these cartridges in fact it's recommended by the factory again we have these arbor presses for sale but it's highly recommended that you use an arbor press to cap these cartridges so that you can consistently cap them properly now to begin let's identify the pieces here of the m60 cartridge it actually consists of four pieces the two main pieces are here the cartridge body as well as the cartridge tip now the cartridge tip is available in two styles you have a round or a flat mouthpiece tip available these other two pieces that you see out here to the side this piece here is the mouthpiece cover it goes on after the mouthpiece has been mated to the cartridge body and this other piece over here is the bottom thread cover for the cartridge body this also goes on after you have maded the tip and the body together so these pieces last these pieces first to begin filling the cartridge properly you will first notice that the m60 here is a side fill cartridge meaning that you're not going to fill the center post in the middle although it may be tempting what you're going to do is you're actually going to take your blunt tip needle and insert it into the side of the cartridge between the center post and the the inner rim you're gonna want to use a blunt tip needle for this because blunt tip needles are not sharp and it will prevent you from injury once you have your material loaded inside of your blunt tip syringe you will fully insert it all the way into the cartridge and for this syringe I am using a 15 gauge blunt tip needle that a 15 gauge needle is somewhat wide and allows me to easily fill this using thick material I will push my material into the cartridge and begin slowly raising the needle as it fills taping taking proper care not to fill this past the bottom edge of the metal top metal collar that is the fill line for this cartridge the bottom edge of this metal collar is really where you should fill this too and not above the explanation for that will be later in this video then you're going to take the mouthpiece and place it onto the cartridge and you won't have to press it in hard all you need to do is place it onto the cartridge so that it seats it self partially and then you're gonna take this cartridge and put it into the jig for this Arbor press then all you'll do is take the handle for the arbor press and push the tip all the way down until it fully seats into the cartridge body you want to make sure that this kind of bottom edge here of the tip makes fully to the top edge of the cartridge once that is done you now have a fully filled and capped cartridge and then you're just basically going to add the two other portions onto it which is the mouthpiece cover as well as the bottom thread cover to complete your cartridge and there you have it a full m60 C cell cartridge okay now that you have seen how to properly fill in cap the m60 cartridge we're going to move into the second portion of this video where I describe to you some troubleshooting scenarios and explain the actual physics of how the m60 cartridge fits into itself so that you can see in diagnose any issue that may arise during filling now the m60 cartridge has a very unique capping system what it features is a tip that pushes down into the body and remains in place through friction the way it creates this friction is by having a reinforced rim around the top of the cartridge body and then a tapered plastic tip at the bottom of the tip so that when you place this taper tip into the cartridge body and push it together friction causes it to mate to itself and hold it in place much the same way that friction acts to keep these two plastic cups connected together now if you've ever pulled two plastic cups out of the dishwasher or maybe out of your cupboard you might notice sometimes these things can get really hard to separate well this action where two plastic cups fit together and don't come apart is the exact same way that the m60 cartridge fits to itself you have a bottom cup here with a reinforced rim this top cup has a tapered bottom to it and as I insert the first cup into the second you have this tapered bottom eventually widening out all the way until it meets this reinforced rim and with just a slight press down further friction begins to engage around the tip holding the two together now the two ways in which you can counteract that friction is by either a over filling this cup or by be getting material on the inside rim of it let me show you how this can occur so as you can see on this cup I have a fill line drawn on it this fill line is meant to resemble the bottom edge of this metal collar the top collar around the m60 that is the filled line for the m60 cartridge whether it's in a point 5 ml size or a 1 ml size the bottom of the metal collar at the top that bottom edge is your fill line do not fill past that edge or what I'm about to describe to you will occur however I'm going to explain it just so you can see it just a little bit better and see it in action using these two cups now to represent the material that I'm going to use I'm just gonna have this right here this is basically vegetable glycerin with a little bit orange food coloring in it I'm using it solely so that you can just see what's happening in these plastic cups now I have drawn a fill line on this Cup as I mentioned before and that is to represent the fill line on the m60 or the bottom edge of the top metal collar now when I take my material and I pour it into this cup and I do not pour it past the fill line making sure to not overfill what happens is I get a great seal because there's nothing preventing me from or nothing preventing the cup from grabbing itself and from friction engaging around the rim in the taper tip and you can see because the I only filled up to the fill line the material did not start creeping up the sides nor did it overfill however let's see what happens when you do overfill so I'm going to take this out here it's dripping a bit but let's overfill this just attach shall we now this situation here is meant to basically replicate what would happen if you were to fill the m60 cartridge past the bottom edge of the top collar basically essentially over filling it what happens when you overfill it let's insert this cup down again and see what happens hopefully you can see there that the liquid starts to rise up the sides as the cup is placed into this overfilled vessel here displaces the oil forcing it to go up the side so when that happens what you don't see is the oil starts actually pushing back in wanting to raise this cup up right now that is essentially what happens if you overfill the m60 what will happen is the oil or the liquid that you have placed in there will begin to push back against the tip as you push the tip down pushing the tip which will then force the tip to pop back up on you now if you really try to force the tip down this is what's gonna happen hopefully you can see all of this material starting to pour out the sides of the cup what happens now is basically this this VG juice does two things number one it's providing pressure against the cup so it's pushing the top cup out but because I've now displaced so much oil that is pouring out at the top what happens is it prevents friction from engaging around the rim to hold the cups in place essentially what the this juice has done is it's overflowed and it started lubricating the rim when it lubricates the wim there's no way that it's gonna hold you see it just comes right out because there's no way for friction to engage this is what happens on the m60 cartridge when you overfill it you either have the oil pushing back against the tip or you drive oil up the sides thus lubricating the entire rim and preventing friction from engaging to lock down that tip that's the tip pushes up and out or it easily comes out during use in order to properly seat the m60 cartridge you have to first ensure basically three things happen number one don't overfill it because if you overfill it this is what will happen you're going to drive oil up the sides or you're going to set the oil or liquid against the tip and it's gonna push it out number two try not to get while you're filling even if you can have if you avoid over filling what you're gonna want to do is avoid getting any material around the inner edge of the m60 so what that means is when you're coming in here with your syringe and you're filling this cartridge what you want to do is when you pull out your syringe do it cleanly try not to get any oil trailing into the inner rim of this cartridge or else that oil or that liquid will act as a lubricant against the rim and prevent the top from completely seating inside there and holding together that's the tip will pop out and third the most important thing which we reviewed in our vision previously in this video is to use an arbor press an arbor press will allow you to fully seat that tip all the way down and you're gonna want to make sure that the bottom edge of your tip is seated fully to the top edge of the cartridge body this is usually only consistently achievable if you use an arbor press I've heard of people with strong hands pushing them together I think hands get tired after a while and a press like this is going to be a much more reliable way for you to see if those cartridges there you have it if you have any questions please do not hesitate to give us a call or send us an e-mail which will be reflected below and you can always drop a comment on this video and we will respond as quickly and as thoroughly as possible thank you for listening we'll see you next time [Music] [Music]", "WA2Z7UUezt4": "[Music] hi guys i'm dan hoff chief operating officer of honeystick and today we are bringing you guys the just batteries twist battery which is a project that honeystick did in collaboration with just cbd one of the leading producers of cbd and hemp products so i was speaking with just cbd management when we had this idea to go in on this endeavor and what we said is we wanted to create an awesome twist battery that works well with cbd carts and to make it really stylish offer some cool color options but what's the key thing is to make it really affordable so you can actually get this twist battery that's a high capacity high powered battery very good quality covered by both of our companies warranties on vapehoneystick.com and also just cbdstore.com and i'll drop those uh those two links into the description you can get them on there for the low price of 9.99 so below 10 bucks is going to get you a super high quality battery from reputable companies that have a warranty on them and this isn't your gas station convenience store battery this is still a good high performance battery now the main thing that i want to focus on because it is a very similar informant function to our honey stick twist battery that we offer so i'm just going to do a real brief run through of the features and the functionality and then the main thing that i want to focus on are the awesome colors and packaging that we put together and now this twist batteries will work great with your um pre-filled tanks 510 tanks that you get from the dispensaries from cbd stores all over anything that's a 510 slim tank is going to work well with this thing it's also going to work well with slim wax and dab applications things like our silencers and wax tanks and definitely be a very good reliable power plant for those so once we do just a real brief preview there of what options we have that you guys are watching now i'm gonna run through the form of functionality and the instructions for this just batteries battery so for the just batteries you're gonna see you have the button right here you're going to have the twister knob right there each one of these kits is going to come with a charger included so for 9.99 you are fully turnkey minus the cartridge that you would pick up at your dispensary or your online cbd store now before you get started you're going to want to make sure this battery is charged if a battery is completely drained it could take you about two hours to charge the battery all you do is take the charge that's provided you're going to screw it in and you are going to make sure to get this onto a charger now i always warn everybody when you're looking for a charger for this stick to desktop computers and non-apple wall adapters stay away from any apple adapters and also stay away from rapid chargers laptop computers or power banks because they won't properly charge a device or might not charge at all so that's a very common troubleshooting question that we get now the first thing that you're going to do is get this on the charger light over here when you plug it in is going to blink while it's charging then it's going to go solid which is the light that's around the led it's going to go solid now to turn the battery on once it's charged so i'd show you the example the led you'll click it five times repeatedly rapidly one two three four five and as you see it blinks up and as you see it is green when i push it now what does that green mean this battery is sophisticated enough to where it has power level indication so when you push on your vaping and the light around there's green that means that you're running basically a full charge once you get down to about a half charge that green is going to turn from green to an amber that's going to mean you're running half a charge or below you probably want to start thinking about charging your battery pretty soon then when your battery is close to being you know needing a charge or dead for that for that word um you are gonna it's gonna turn red now once it turns red that means get this thing on a charger you got a couple hits left so that has a good power indication level so you know when this thing's going to need a charge you're not going to get hit with just a multiple blink no you know surprise power adjustment if we zoom in real close you see you have a little twister knob now you have a little twister knob and you also have numbers going around the battery now this goes all the way up to four volts as you can see there's a little uh divot there in the twister now whatever that little divot thing there number that lines up with means that's the power setting that you're on and you can do that for example right now i'm going to just move it on over to 3.5 so you can see and you can scroll it all the way down to the minimum which is 2 volts now we made the minimum 2 volts it's because we've been getting a lot of demand from people who are now into this low voltage vaping and these ultra low resistance carts that need very very low inputs to vape properly to give you good flavor and activation maintain terpenes and cbd profiles so we want to make sure you have a very nice low starting point from 2 volts but you can bang with the best of them at 4 volts okay which means you can bang out some serious power out of out of these carts to give you guys some monster rips out of standard five-time carts now this battery does have preheat functionality which means especially for cold weather climates you uh you might have a cartridge that's a little seized up needs a little low voltage a little warm up to get it going when the battery is on what you're gonna do is you're gonna go ahead and push this button two times quickly and fast i'll do it right now and what you'll see is you'll see the color light up blue rainbow it's changing colors that means it's preheating at any given point during that time you can push the button one time you're exiting preheat mode once your cartridge is preheated this is mainly for colder climates or cartridges that have gunked up or things like that so since we've gone through this battery the form and the functions let's run through and show you guys a 360 of each one of the colors just so you see what you would be purchasing and what your options are with this amazing battery let's start off all the way over here and check out our slate gray now the slate gray is a matte color very deep gray if you don't look closer it's not under the right light you might even think that it's black i mean this is what this is the same paint that they're putting on those beautiful expensive mercedes and bentleys those amgs those g wagons they are beautiful matte colored slate paint i think this is very stylish battery very clean if you want something more plain we can transition over to the black battery you're gonna have to edit that out how long does that go for you go over to the black battery let's do a nice little 360 of that now this is a matte black it's pretty flat but it does have a really nice pop to it you see of the just batteries insignia there the next color that we have is a matte gold so it's not a sparkly gold it's matte but it has this nice champagne deep champagne finish to it definitely a very nice unique option there on a color then we have a shiny rose gold right here i want to make sure we get it in the right light so you see that it's not like a stainless because it's like a kind of like a copper like if you had an ultra polished you know penny probably want to dim the lights to show so there that is your rose gold and again you guys will have some really nice detailed pictures on both the the just cbd store and the vape honey stick website then you have a matte silver again it's not a metallic or polished it's a nice matte silver no real sparkles but a real nice uh finish on the paint there and then for those who want more of a shiny silver we have the full stainless which is a brushed stainless steel finish nice and reflective the way that they're coated they're not really going to fingerprint up and get dirty so this is really nice clean cut for that metallic look and then we go over to a blue this is a nice aqua that's very similar to our our honey stick blue that's a very popular color that we wanted to uh to emulate here because we have a lot of fans of this blue color and then lastly we have a nice red we wanted to make it shiny to look like your favorite red sports car or fire engine style this is a really nice deep clean red let's do a nice little 360 here you see that just battery insignia the twister so as you guys can see for ten dollar for under ten dollars on these batteries you cannot go wrong at that price with getting a high quality battery that that has really nice finishes and looks for them that'll power up your 510 thread carts you have endless options on the colors here very classy very good functionality reliable and again warrantied by our companies for that price if you're looking for just a battery make sure to go on the website use my special promo code at vape honey stick honey 420

And then guys, at the end of the video, we're gonna have a little Q&A moment so\nI can answer some of the questions that I got from you guys recently when I\nasked you if there was anything you wanted to ask me and a lot of you were\nlike yeah well I think like 10 of you really yeah so but we're gonna do a\nlittle Q&A session at the end and I hope you guys like it also really quick I'm\njust gonna give you this disclaimer about the future of my channel I think\nthis is what we're gonna do moving forward feel like I've done a lot of\nproduct reviews ok I've done a lot of reviews like a lot of products a lot of\ncompanies a lot of reviews I'm thinking about going back to basics a little bit\nand not focusing so much on specific products but maybe more so talking about\nlike what it's like being a medical marijuana patient in Florida why do I\nuse medical marijuana how did you get your medical marijuana card in Florida\nthings like that so let me know what you think about that in the comments let me\nknow if you have any input on that let's get into this video ok guys\nso let's talk about this I'm gonna pray that I can say this right tikkun olam\ntikkun olam vape cartridge in the Alaska strain which is a sativa strain from\nvitae can and this is my first time buying from vitae can so let's talk\nabout what I liked about this a cartridge but let's start out with just\na little bit of information about the product from their website that we\nalready know about the product things to note about the vitae can beat cartridges\nthey're made with a co2 extraction method they're without any cutting agent\nso there's no MCT oil in there it's gonna be highly potent this is a 1\nmilliliter cart with 800 milligrams of THC which leads me to think it's about\n80 percent THC approximately I couldn't find an exact percentage for what this\nparticular batch of Bergers was but I think it's gonna be around 80 percents\n800 milligrams THC in a 1 gram or 1 milliliter cartridge can in addition to\nhaving no cutting agent these guys also have cannabis drive to terpenes\neverybody loves cannabis drive terpenes so that is exciting tell your mom tell\nyour friends also tell everyone you know there is a serious first-time deal\nif by it again it's such a good deal $55 off your first purchase as well as first\ntime free delivery can't be that right so let's talk about its taste and the\nfacts in everything like that this is an 80 percent THC cartridge or\napproximately 80 percent THC so it's pretty high it's pretty intense\nexpect euphoric effects you're gonna get lighten it's an 80 percent THC dose so\nbe careful especially preview with this but I found that I really liked this one\nit really does have a true achieve a sort of effect for me anyway it's called\nthe Alaska strain yes tikkun makes their own kind of strains\nwhich is cool but yeah it gave me more of an uplifted effect more of a sativa\nlike clear-headed effect and the taste and smell of this eight cartridge was\nsuper super natural it was it's just natural tasting I was expecting to taste\nmore of like a lemony limonene pine taste or something but it like it was\njust like super mild super super natural very natural it's a really natural taste\nand I love the taste of this thing it tastes very natural it's made with a co2\nextraction nothing like I said before as cannabis drive tripping mortgage a sport\nand you can get this one gram bait cartridge for like fifty five dollars if\nyou use the first time discount with vitae camp\nit's normally $110 I've had mine for about one week actually not exactly a\nweek now and this is where we are this is where we're at\nmy oil comes up to about here and it was fully filled when I got it it was filled\nto the top so now let's talk about this teeny tiny beet battery really quick\nbecause it is something else just tiny little vape battery that is so small and\nit actually looks like a little teddy bear I never liked a polar bear and I\ndon't know how to feel about that part of things it's kind of so cute that it\nfreaks me out so this is the lucky bear vape battery and it is so tiny it's less\nthan two inches long and if you remember the Uni battery I mean there are things\nthat the Uni has that this guy does not have but this thing is a lot smaller\nthan the Uni like look at the difference there I mean this is a battery this is\nthe whole battery so if we put our bait cartridge in here\nthis whole thing is so small so lightweight it's crazy so it only has\none heat setting the thing about this battery and the reason why I reviewed it\nis it has one really cool thing about it the one really cool thing about it is\nthat it is so small so it's the smallest to make battery that I've ever seen in\nthis kind of shape or at all I think it's really tiny if for some reason you\nwant a tiny tiny tiny date battery then I would definitely argue in the atman\nlucky berry it's so small if you don't like this little string thing - you\ncould probably just cut that off and I'll see why not like you just cut it\nreally close to where it attaches to the bear I don't really love it personally\nI'm not crazy about it at the same time I can see how it could be useful mean if\nyou're on the go and you need a really really small video battery and yours on\nthe go or whatever you might like this thing and I honestly think the pink\ncolors really cute there's a pink there's a white I think there's a black\nso check it out I'll put the link in the description definitely works with this\nand any 510 voted cartridge will work with the lucky bear let's get started on this part of video\nwhich is the Q&A section of the video all right guys so let me jump into these\nquestions that you guys had for me when I asked if there's anything that you\nguys wanted to know and if I skip over one of the ones that you asked go back\nto that post and check the by replied because I might reply to some of them on\nthere instead of in the video so someone basically asked if I found that vaping\nherb is faster or more effective for me with finding relief for my symptoms so I\nwould say it's not necessarily faster I don't know see I like to smoke my loose\nflower like I like to smoke my weed when I have it I don't really vape it too\nmuch I do have a little handheld vaporizer that I like but I hardly ever\nuse it it's just more I guess it's more like familiar for me to just smoke out\nof my bong or my pipe or something but that's what I do with my loose flower as\nfar as the question about any recommendations on affordable dry herb\nvaporizers I definitely invite anyone watching to give your two cents in the\ncomments because I don't really have a lot of experience with dry air\nvaporizers but I really liked this one called the high-low from white rhino I\ndo feel like the loose flower affects me differently than any of the bait\ncartridges or vape pens that I've used it's just a different experience smoking\nthan using the marijuana concentrate concentrates are just not the same as\nflower although they can be a lot stronger with THC I definitely say\nsmoking cannabis or using whole flower cannabis different experience from using\nany kind of vaping or cannabis oil I don't want to say it's necessarily\nfaster or more effective but like it's different so it could be more effective\nfor you I would think and someone asked me how hard is it to find how hard is it\nto find a job as a medical marijuana patient well I have trouble finding one\nif I'm using cannabis so it's illicit you can definitely still get a job a job\nif you're using cannabis like it just depends on what that job is and there's\ngonna be a lot of different factors that play into like whether you do or don't\nget a job and you use medical cannabis it all depends on a number of different\nfactors it depends on what kind of job you're trying to get whether or not that\nparticular company drug tests whether or not this company makes exceptions for\npatients that are using medical cannabis like and it's hard to find that out\nsometimes and you don't always want to ask that on the one hand it's a more\ndifficult and mentally difficult emotionally\ndifficult process because you do have to kind of ask yourself do I want to bring\nthis up and the interview do I want to mention it to them it's a good question\nfor me because I am not only a medical marijuana patient but obviously I post\nthese videos on the Internet so that makes me nervous sometimes when\nI go into job interviews right now I'm pursuing a job that is in the cannabis\nfield so more about that later guys if I get this job I'll let you know but we'll\nsee but yeah so it hasn't really hurt me yet\nI guess my short answer for that is it can be harder but it's possible you ever\nused cannabis before becoming a medical marijuana patient that is such a good\nquestion and yes but not really as much as you might think I'm pretty new to it\nin the sense that I dabbled in it when I was in it the first time I ever smoked\njust probably when I was like 16 or so when I was 17 I had like a stoner phase\nI was smoking quite a bit quite often those bored and I just wanted to when I\nwas like 17 I had a big stoner phase kind of gave it up when I was 18 to 19\nand one thing was I started to feel like every time I smoked any time any time I\nsmoked weed it would just make me feel anxious and make me feel uncomfortable\nand make me feel socially awkward so I kind of just stopped because of that I\nthought I just can't smoke weed like I'm just one of these people that just gets\nanxiety and I don't get the chilled out thing that other people get I react\ndifferently I get I get really anxious and I get really stressed out and I get\nself-conscious and I hate it so for a long time I didn't smoke between lines\nbetween the years of like my life that I was 18 and then up until I was like 23 I\ndidn't pick it back up until I became a medical marijuana patient basically so I\nwas starting to be dabble in and again and then I found out that you could\nbecome a medical marijuana patient and I was like that's perfect for me because I\ndon't really want to go and buy it from a dealer I don't really want to get in trouble\nwhy not just do it legally so yeah so that's how we got to this point I might\njust do one more question because there's a couple left I don't want to do\nall of these on cam I have other stuff I need to get done and I need to edit this\none and pose to it so let's just do one more did you have to have a long history\nof medical records to apply um so it I have to have a history of medical\nrecords I'm not sure if I could have gotten it without any medical records\nbut did I have to have a long history of medical records do not really know I\nused my records from my psychiatrist my psychiatrist I've been seeing sense I\nthink 2016 or 2017 so wasn't really that long but that doctor is who I've been\nseeing to move to where I live now and those documents supported the symptoms\nthat I was describing to my medical marijuana doctor and I believe that\nhelped her to allow me to be able to use medical marijuana so I definitely highly\nrecommend trying to get any documentation that you can of any\nanything pointing to your qualifying condition that's gonna allow your\ncannabis recommendation um get any of that documentation together ahead of\ntime before your first medical marijuana doctor appointment bring it with you or\nif you need to you can have your medical marijuana doctor usually or I have mine\nanyway ask for it from your doctor if you give them your doctor's information\nthey can usually do that amongst themselves but it helps and makes it\nfaster if you bring your documents with you so if you have anything bring it\nwith anyway guys I'm gonna finish answering the rest of your questions\nback over on that text post that I made before sorry that I didn't get to all of\nthem but I did have to fit in a couple of you know different things in this\nvideo so I'll catch you guys in the next one and like I said things are gonna get\na little bit different for just a second not a whole lot different but it's gonna\nget more generalized like I don't really want to do too many specific product\nreviews because I feel like we've kind of just done that and we're not it's\njust not really that exciting anymore for me so I wanted to do something else\nit's gonna keep me more interested and challenged and I still want to be able\nto help you guys and give helpful advice to anybody out there who's looking\nfind out more about medical marijuana in Florida so I'll keep you guys posted and\nI'll see you guys in the next video and thanks for watching this one if you\nliked it don't forget to hit the thumbs up thank you bye", "iTGAmHipYL0": "[Music] filling and capping correctly will preserve integrity speed and cleanliness are

from a lot of our viewers that want to know exactly how to pick out the best oil tank now this is normally not a video I would do because out of all this assortment of oil tanks that I have put together is basically comprising of about everything on the market on our website we probably sell about five or six of them now I have these in our testing lab because I'm always testing them we do have a lot of extractors that we private label for that we might be making this these cartridges for that might not be available but one of the common questions that a lot of our users are having that really wanted to see this video up is I have a honey stick battery when I go to dispensary and I have an option of picking out prefilled cartridges how do I know which one's gonna be good or how it's gonna work you know so this video here is gonna go through from you being able to eyeball an oil 5-10 disposable cartridge and being able to tell bass have a good reasonable estimate of how it is gonna be able to perform what it will kind of features it's gonna have so that you can pick out the best oil vape tank for your battery now what is a disposable 510 thread cartridge so there's a lot of people out there who purchase these 510 thread oil cartridges to fill themselves and they say but if it's disposable can I only fill it one time so the short answer is no most of these tanks you can take if you're buying them empty you can fill them up four to five times without a problem however some of them you can only fill once and we'll go over that other times when you go to dispensary most of them already have oil in them so just because you have an amazing cartridge if you're buying a bad extract not even the best cartridge can make a bad oil taste good so however you can have good oil where the whole vaping experience gets dulled down or made bad or taste burnt from a bad cartridge so what this video is gonna help you do is it's gonna help you make some educated decisions when it comes to purchasing and selecting either the cartridge you're gonna fill at home or the cartridges that you're gonna pick up prefilled to know how they're gonna perform so let's start off by starting from the very top of the cartridges of how you're gonna be able to start making some identification so let's do a close up here and start off with when you look at the mouthpiece to see what the hole size is gonna be let's start at the tip and work our way to the bottom okay guys so here we have a close-up view we're gonna start at the very top of the cartridge so we can go in and start making some determinations so you can see I put together what I thought was the best assortment of pre fillable disposable tanks so the tops let's go to the very top first things first generally the wider bore you have on mouthpiece which is the part that you inhale through the more vapor you're gonna get the smaller that hole is you are gonna get either less vapor or it's gonna have a smoother easier transition into your mouth so let's let's take a shot from the top here just to show the differences in the size of the bores so basically as you could see from this basic stylus plastic tip car it has a very small Inlet hole even these stainless steel ones here right they have relatively small and some of them are larger when we work our way down you have these wide bore mouthpieces which have very wide inlets if you're a person who really likes to vape like this one is probably the widest if you like to get a big cloud and a massive hits that you can really draw air through with minimal amount of resistance you probably want to get a cartridge that has a wider bore hole at the very top as opposed to having one of the smaller tips that are more focused on smoothness now some people have said that the wider bore the mouthpieces sometimes you get a little flavor loss because you're just going straight mouth to lung instead of kind of mouth to thrill to lung on your inhale it kind of focuses more on just going straight to lung however you probably get better activation and more of a hit now once you've figured out what size borer you want there's a whole multitude of mouthpiece materials as you can see you start off with the basic plastic mouthpiece which is very lightweight and then you have stainless steel and then you have ceramic which you can see here you even have wood and kind of an acrylic resin and then you have not stainless steel but more of a aluminum coated metal so I can tell you right off the bat if you are at or if you like tattoo on your cartridges like in high school I wouldn't want people to see what my pencil number two pencils look like but luckily I grew out of that but you know people sometimes chew on their cigarettes chew on their cartridges if you art or you know you have the plastic option that's not going to break your teeth but you don't want little plastic particles getting into your mouth so you're probably best off going with a natural wood cartridge so this is a natural wooden mouthpiece it's very soft wood it's not even sealed with an epoxy for coating however if you're gonna be refilling this a lot do get new tips because when you chew on them they are gonna get beat up and the moisture sitting on wood does not bode well you also have the acrylic and the metal ones if you chew I would stay far from the metal ones you're gonna end up breaking your teeth the ceramic what's a really unique offering with ceramic style mouthpieces is that they say that it's very clean very easy to get clean it also feels sturdy like the metal ones however doesn't feel heavy in your so it's it's very natural on to the lips and it offers again it's super easy to clean off it's much lighter than the stainless steel pieces and it just feels overall more natural to wear as a stainless steel one you know you are putting a little piece of metal into your mouth and what's unique let's say about the powder coated ones to where it's not like a shiny stainless steel and thick metal it's a much thinner metal and it's coated so it's never you know really gonna be cold to your lips if you pick them up if it's been in the AC or whatnot so when selecting your mouthpiece you have your the bore of the inlet hole and you also have the mouthpiece material now mouthpiece shape also makes a difference generally as you can see you're very wide bore ones are very cylindrical and that is to just allow maximum vapor to come up through them these flattened mouthpieces that look more like black and milds are gonna dull the vapor down condense it and make it a smoother transmission so again we're going back to wide bore more vapor flattened is gonna possibly be smoother if you're undecided and you want in between the two you have these kind of hookah style tips that have a relatively wide wide bore but they don't get flattened too much to restrict the vapor so mouthpiece shape and size definitely the first point of contact with the cartridge in kind of a first way that you can determine it now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take all these cartridges out and we're gonna talk about what the body of the tank brings to the game okay guys now before we move on to going over what the differences are between the body of the tanks one more notable thing about the mouthpiece is if you are buying your cartridges to refill whether you buy to a dispenser buy them from guys like us to refill the one thing that you have to know when you're dealing with tops is there is a new type of top which child safety is really big in the industry right now so there are compression tops that once the extractor or you fill them up and you basically crimp them down right you see there's no screw here once you crimp this down this cartridge is not coming back apart for you to refill so then once you go through your initial extract right on a childproof crimp lock here there's a pop top you're not gonna be able get back into this cartridge without breaking it and so you're not going to be all refilled so if you're looking for more than one use out of your cartridge don't buy the crimp tops this is also crimp top as you could see there's no threading and you can see this is one of the newer resin cartridge is actually very popular cartridge so once you push that down you're not getting back into it now let's talk about the body of these things now you have generally two types of outside bodies or reservoirs which house the oil that you're gonna be filling you generally have plastic and you have glass now things to look for is plastic cartridges generally they're not as popular anymore because people you know they want purity when you fill up a plastic cartridge it sits for a long time I don't know if it's true or not I'm not a scientist but they say they could alter the change the oil if it sits in there because the THC can react with the plastic and also the components in there so they say a glass is much better to store things in because it is going to be medically neutral to reacting and if you are going for a glass especially the Pyrex grade of glass is going to be perfect because it's also not sensitive the temperature changes so if you're going plastic tank where are the advantages well the advantages are is you're never gonna shatter your tank and they're super lightweight so they're gonna be much lighter so if you're taking it out hiking or sporty and you don't want to carry around the tank plastic tank weighs about half of what a glass tank does and plastic with a plastic mouthpiece it does not get much lighter and but if you're looking at already a plastic tank you have different grades of plastic and you can tell that from the clarity you see this is a little bit foggy this a lot of people would think is a glass tank but it is actually an upgrade plastic tank it just has a much higher quality clarity so this is an upgrade plastic tank that just has better clarity and among plastic tanks one of the most popular ones now is you have actually resin tanks which are like this generally they come in mouthpieces like this set up right here this is actually a resin tank you really can't tell the difference between the glass and the resin except the difference is is one will shatter if you hit it hard enough and one will not now if you are buying glass there are different grades of glass you know the company that does cartridges like this I'm sure you guys are familiar brassknuckles is a prime example of somebody who focus on cartridges like this this is a very thick grade of glass and you can tell that by touching it and honestly you can probably eyeball it to tell how thick the grade of glasses so you look at it it's gonna be thicker glass this glass this tank right here which is our cloud tank actually uses a very thick Pyrex certified glass so this is actually a very expensive good glass it's very hard you don't really have to worry about it breaking or shattering it's a very thick and sturdy and other tanks are thinner glass for example this one you can tell generally tell if the glass is very very shiny and it almost looks like plastic basically that is indication without touching it that it is a thinner glass so those are just some things out the body you want to be careful of now when also looking at the body center post that has become a big Arian debate within the market because generally plastic tanks don't have center post so we'll just move those over here if you look at a center post you can see some of them have wide bases some of them don't have a base some of them have rounded bases right they all have a different structure now what's the significance basically if you have a center post that has there's very thin it is more likely that the tank if you are refilling it that the center post will not be secure when you're securing the top piece down to the center post that it could wobble go out of place and possibly leak the downside so then people put in a wider base to make it more stable take up a little more space make sure that you can screw the tank down and you're not gonna have any areas of leakage the thing is with a bigger center post is sometimes oil gets caught on the transition areas or on the hills of the center post so then if you do have a wide center post base you want to make sure it's nicely rounded so you're not gonna get oil or any wastage caught up there that would make your tank less fuel efficient for example our ELF cartridge here in pink as you can see it's a wider center post but there are no slopes in there that the oil can get caught on so you're gonna use a much larger percentage of the oil that's not going to get caught in the center post transition however going right from center post talks down to the heater okay let's talk heaters most basically you have your wick cartridge as you can see it has a wick that stays up that is wrapped in a heating element wire usually those wicks are made of silica and what happens is it absorbs the oils and it burns them and these happen just fine however it's not going to do you justice and accentuating the taste of the oils and especially if you have thick oils that dry up around there you can actually taste the heater and burn the heater before you burn the oil so if you don't have a pre heat function you have a wick you could run into some issues with taste there so a lot of upgrades have moved to wick list cartridges this is a plastic those are beekeeper replacement tank it is same concept however it has no wick and it has a ceramic heating element a lot of cartridges that say they're ceramic and you can see they're ceramic generally with seeing a little white block through the inlet holes so you could see some of them have a little white block that means they are ceramic powered generally ceramic heaters mean that you're gonna get better taste better flavor notes better flavor accentuation now it's become really popular lately is this what a lot of people have coined as si cell style technology in heaters which means that you have a ceramic block inside of the actual heater itself let's find a nice example right there that is a perfect example of a cease tell it's a coated ceramic block they have good heat up times and right now they're probably considered a very nice performance tank on the market however your problems with these are is that once you've run through a filler to the taste can drop off with thicker oils if you do not have a preheat function they can fight they can heat differently so generally you want a more viscous oil with your C cells and if they don't have a wide enough Inlet hole which is the next area that we're gonna talk about you could run into some clog \u00e4j-- issues but these have a coated block it's not no rocket science abouts just a different take on a ceramic cartridge if you look this has a ceramic block however it is forced down so this is gonna use oils very efficiently this is actually an updated version of the cloud tank and half mil so that is a ceramic block heater you get good taste notes on these and then you have units that are wickless but they don't have a ceramic heater that have different sized Inlet holes now since we're talking about inlet holes what's the general rule of thumb on Inlet holes you go to dispensary and see different sizes and shapes of inlet holes as we showed the C cell had a very wide end lit hole and other tanks like a cloud tank has a relatively wide inlet hole but not overly wide so the general rule of thumb is is that the thicker your oil is that you are putting in there the wider of an inlet hole you're gonna need so that the oil can properly have access to the heater and vaporize if you have a thin inlet hoyle a hole a small Inlet hole and you have very thick oils it's going to be very hard for that oil to come in contact with the heater and actually burn so you are gonna want if you have thick oils to have a large Inlet hole so that that oil is always having contact with the heater however what if you have a large inlet hole and you have thin oils well your your possibility of leaking down through the post goes up exponentially so if you have very thin oils don't go crazy and get tanks with really large Inlet holes because then you could have leakage you could have wastage or the oil is gonna burn up very very quickly so I think that about covers what we would talk about with the inlet holes now air flow control air flow control is available on some tanks we have our cloud tank it has an air flow control here at the top this all ceramic tank right here has air flow controls at the bottom this tank has air controls atop certain tanks have this and what this is for is to allow you to control your hit when you open up the air hole it allows you to bring in air it allows you to bring an air from the outside to kind of dilute and aerate your hit if you have it closed then you can concentrate your hit to basically only draw the vapor out of the tank and out of the little air holes are located around the tank but if you open it you can draw more air so you can take a bigger volume hit but it some people like to concentrate their hit and not allow you to do that so what is the downfall of the air control the positive is you can control your hits and really tune in on what intensity of a hit you want the downfall is if you leave it open like it is partially open now then you put it on its side and it's tilted well that's an area where you can experience some serious top leakage out of the tank a lot of measures are there to prevent that but it could happen so if you're somebody who gets airflow control and you don't use it just make sure to always keep them closed now since we've basically covered all angles of how to evaluate a tank how to eyeball it let's go over one more piece that is about the bottom air holes so some tanks at a dispensary you're probably not having to see the bottom air hole so this is probably the least important part of our oil tank analysis here but an important fact for you to know is generally the larger the bottom air hole is okay a lot of these run on a ball bearing system so that when you draw or you vaporize a ball bearing moves out of place and allows the vapor to pass through and when it's not being used it goes down and creates a seal so no oil comes and down through the the tank however if you do not have an air hole it is not going to work with auto draw units and a lot of you guys have Auto draw batteries a lot of people have elves out there so if you are buying a tank for your auto draw battery make sure with your dispensary that you have an air hole at the bottom of the tank and that it is compatible with auto draw batteries we tell people this all the time it's one of the most common mistakes people buy a tank they have an auto draw battery or an elf they say my unit or my tank is a dud it's not it's just not compatible with the two so if you have auto draw make sure you have an air hole make sure that it's a decent air hole as you can see this unit does not have an air hole so it is not going to be compatible with Stylus batteries it's not going to be compatible with our elf you could see our elf replacement cartridge has a very nice pronounced air hole with even some side vents so you want to make sure that you're picking up the right cartridge now for the very last part of this because we now gave you all the tools that you're gonna need to keep in mind when you're out tank shopping now I'm just gonna run through these tanks and basically give you the rundown of what you can expect out of each one of these tanks so that if you see one of these tanks on the shelf you basically know what you're getting into so hang tight while we get back to this final shoot all right guys now we're gonna run through each one of these tanks and just give you a very brief description of what you can expect for usage and the pluses and minuses of them so that when you're out tank shopping and you see one of these things you have a good idea of what you're gonna get so starting off with really the basic plastic stylist tank with the flat head tip you're gonna get this cartridge and it has a wick so you're not gonna don't expect a big boy taste or big boy hits this is really meant to be a light on-the-go reliable non leak easy to fill tank these run on the blue plug fill system very easy to fill very easy to mass fill but if you have thick oils and they get coagulated around there you can get burnt silica taste if you're not preheating properly in here so this isn't really a flavor tank or a monster hit tank but what it is is really an Old Faithful tank that you'll fill super light is gonna take a beating so if you're into extreme sports this is probably your tank if you want to upgrade from that stay plastic but go with a wickless something that has a ceramic heater or beekeeper replacement cartridge with a metal mouthpiece same very reliable top blue plug fill not gonna get any leaking the ceramic heater is definitely to give you much better flavor notes and more smoothness over the traditional wick system and the stainless steel mouthpiece is a similar shape but it's a higher quality fit and finish and feel then we have basically the upgraded glass version this is a childproof tank it will lock in place after it is filled it has relatively smaller inlet holes meant for more viscous oils and it is ceramic so you're gonna get about the same taste but you're gonna have the purity of glass that your oils are interacting with over plastic basically same thing except it is refillable you can unscrew this top okay a lot of flavor rx cartridges come in come into this style it is not ceramic you have some decent sized Inlet holes however not too wide and you have good center post support so there's going to be a good reliable glass tank however the mouthpiece on these things is heavy and it is flattened so it is more focused on smoothness not hits you have our elf replacement cartridge full ceramic very lightweight ceramic mouthpiece that you have in different colors it's gonna feel good on the lips and it has the unique design center posts that is wide so it's still gonna give you good support however you're not gonna have any oil that gets caught up sitting on there you're gonna use a big chunk of oil really fuel-efficient nice power awesome flavor tank then you have basically a gold finished tank that is somewhat popular out there similar square tip design nothing really special ceramic heaters the one problem is is you have this really big flat top ledge a lot of oils can get caught up there that you might never be able to vape so this is kind of an old-school design but it does have good seals it feels good in the hand and its relatively light basically here's the updated version this one migrated actually to a CE cell style so you're gonna get a good heat up time it is light however still not a hundred percent feeling the center post because you are gonna get oils that get stuck up there now this is a more modern C cell with a bullet-shaped battery we sell these along with the ceramic mouthpiece style as our elf replacement cartridge you're gonna get some more performance out of these because they have wider heater holes they have that C cell Center and you're gonna be able to get good flavor hits off of them they have you have a nice air inlet hole so they'll run well with Auto draw batteries you're gonna get some good power out of this tank actually this tank right here is a brand new tank I haven't tested it yet it is a fully ceramic interior so it's good to put its advertising that it's extremely pure taste it also a ceramic heater I'm not a hundred percent sure on the bottom air flow generally to me bottom air flow could leak so I haven't tested this tank yet but my team does have samples these because some of our customers are requesting a full blown ceramic tank this is basically just a 1 mil version a different mouthpiece version of this tank that we were talking about so difference is you can have a ceramic mouthpiece it's gonna feel a little bit more natural and this one no air hole not going to work well with Auto draw batteries here and I can tell you from holding it it is a little heavier than I would like to see a tank this cartridge right here generally you'll see them filled in brassknuckles cartridges very good cartridge works with most auto draw batteries as well as battery-powered these have one mil fill size I like the bowling pin style tip it's not exactly a wide bore but still definitely wide begin nice hits and it is thin down for some elegance the gold finish that these guys have done is pretty cool so if you're looking for a good prefilled cartridge I mean these have generally been pretty reliable I haven't heard any problems of leaking they have good taste they don't really excel so much in taste they don't excel so much in vapor but it's one of those tanks to where it does do a lot of all those right it runs at about 90% ultra reliable I've heard here you have the resin and resin tipsy sell style batteries as you can see really improve the the groove there to burn up more of the oil and again our elf replacement cartridges are similar with the ceramic mouthpiece I like the see-through tops it's really cool when you're drawing vapor out of them and also they're easy to clean they're light in your mouth you don't feel like you're gonna break your tooth if you incidentally bite on them and it's a cool little reliable tank this one however it is a child seal once you push it down you're not getting it open so only buy these for the one-time fill unless you see it's got a screw top so ask him to specify same exact thing just a wood mouthpiece for those people who like the the natural wood this one is the same as the wooden except it has a different has a little air flow control here at the top it's kind of unique you just swivel the mouthpiece and that opens and closes the air flow if you want a little bit more control on your mouthpiece these three cartridges all come from the same factory it is I mean the same family it is basically the cloud tank here and they have adjustable air flow for these two the half mil and the 1 mil versions these are probably one of the tanks that I endorse the most i love the wide bore mouthpiece I like the ability to adjust especially for connoisseurs they have a nice ceramic heater with decent size inlet holes so you get nice big hits but you're not gonna lose out on that flavor I think the center post sloping on these were done right they're very stable I haven't heard any complaints of these things leaking this is the same thing half mil except it has a hookah style tip on it it's kind of like the top of a bowling pin it's like half flattened half widened tip and this is the glass version of the cartridge we showed you with a lock top not a thread you push it down and it has also has a resin reservoir this is not glass I have not tested this tank yet but it is very similar to the the other ones that we went over in that facet so it should be a good one so anyways guys thank you for tuning in I hope some of the pro tips and some of the analysis tools that we've given you are gonna help you make better decisions when you're out there looking for your prefilled cartridge to buy at a dispensary or looking to fill your own now one question I know is gonna be a follow-up is which one of your batteries basically fire everything so let me just come out and tell you our be master battery you buy one of those you're gonna fire 99% of what's out there the way that we designed it check out the separate video we did on that our minimax original with the smart chip the electronics and this thing it is I basically want you to find me a tank that this thing doesn't fire and I want to know it exists because so far I haven't heard one really nice powerful check out the separate video on that also our Gold Line battery these two batteries are variable temperature they're a little different in size and capacity however both really awesome should fire anything that you give it both these tanks three temperatures both have preheat functions easily charge work awesome with all these tanks minimax your definite go to so you buy one of these three batteries you can rest assured that basically whatever you pick up at the dispensary you're gonna be all fired so for this and several other cool videos make sure you subscribe to our channel make sure if I miss anything drop it in the comments

[Music] welcome back you guys so we've got the pink kush cartridge right here we're gonna get rid of all those silicone dude ads screw this into the fireside battery and start a rocking with this sucker we're going to start out on the lowest temp come on there we go white light starting on the lowest temp we're going to take a rip through there we're going to go up to the medium and then the high try it all the way through there i'll give you a little bit of my thoughts and opinions on it after that and then we will go on into the g pen battery before we put our adapter on here and we start ripping it through a couple of glass pieces that we have here as well you guys i'm really looking forward to seeing how this pink kush hits taste i'm just excited to see how fido did their transition from the dark black gray market into this legal market so uh only way we're gonna find out you guys is by tapping in and finding out so uh let's do that cheers i like the elongated tip on this they're similar to what trailblazer had but it's a longer glass tip and i like that okay so it is kind of a sweet herbal flavor nothing overwhelming nothing really that screams excitement for me but it's definitely one of the better tasting pink kush products i've tried so now we're on that medium temp let's uh take a haul at this level and see what it tastes like here you guys cheers okay guys so got a good herbal push on that one got a little bit of a pepper flavor as well which wasn't disappointing it just wasn't expected i'm i'm liking it now it balances out with that kind of sweet herbal it's but it's not a really overpowering flavor it's strong when you have it in your mouth and when you exhale but it really dissipates quickly after that which is a little bit disappointing for me but still not bad so uh we've got it on the highest temp guys let's take a rip through here see how it does uh before we switch it on over to the g pen cheese yes we moved over to the g pen from that fireside battery i'm only going to give it a 7 out of 10. it had a nice flavor to it but it didn't hit hard enough to hold the flavor and it didn't have a really enjoyable enough flavor to make me want to just keep hauling on it so i have it in my mouth it's it's that good for one hit kind of a high and flavor not necessarily high but it's good for like a one hit it's not really that sugary treat that i'm finding my vape cartridges are really more what that's for they're kind of for that dessert of smoking right i'm i'm done having this harder [ __ ] i'm done smoking that i'm like bong rips and dabs and stuff like this i just want something light to sip on with a really sweet flavor and that's definitely where these come in handy but uh seven out of ten is the best i'm gonna give it for the fire side moving on into the g pen we've got it set on the lowest temperature let's see how it does and taste through here you guys before we move on and rock it through the glass i'm expecting a pretty good outcome from this let's see cheers okay guys we're on that medium level let's see how it does i got almost more of a sour cush kind of push with this it was nice it was really unique for uh the changes from that fireside battery and it's one of the biggest reasons why i like using different batteries you guys because you do get a totally different experience with these and i'm really really enjoying this pink kush so far but got on the medium temp let's tap in and try it out cheers so we've got it on the highest temp you guys okay let's get into this i am feeling this pink kush already which is not something i am used to i haven't had a pink cush strain hit hard and have a really good high for me like ever the flower just it's a strain that doesn't really do much so this this this pens got me excited you guys so we've got on the highest temp let's see how it does through here before we uh move on and give it a score on that medium level i still got that kind of sour kush taste which i enjoyed i'm i'm not upset with that kind of sour dank cushy flavor but uh let's see if the high temp does the same thing you guys cheers okay guys so i'm gonna give the g pen made out of a tent it had just a little bit more of that kind of sour cushy flavor that i do really enjoy and definitely look forward to when i'm smoking these kind of these kind of carts this pink kush is definitely uh something that's caught me off guard you guys and i'm really looking forward to seeing how it's gonna taste to the glass but uh we've got we are a mad bell here a little mad hatter bell we've got the fireside battery ready to go we are starting out at the lowest temp again working our way up to the high we do preheat on our high temp only because why not so uh yeah i think that's all the info we need y'all let's start doing this i'll see on the other side of these uh these three rips cheers last two let's preheat it y'all [Music] okay guys we're back on the g pen we've got a 420 rig we're gonna tap into this and uh see how this pen does you guys i'm uh definitely looking forward to um seeing the flavor on it but uh the only way we can find out how it does is by finding out how it is low tam first medium then we preheat on the high just like that last bit get to y'all cheers [Music] last rip y'all cheers preheat it sink okay guys so i'm gonna give it an eight out of a ten from the glass had definitely that sweeter flavor that i was looking for um it did end up being a little bit harsher than i was expecting through the rig so that's why it's not quite the nine like it had the potential for the nine for the intensity of the flavor that was there but there was a harshness to it that just i didn't quite enjoy um and i bumped it down the point for that but all in all very well put together card for the flavor on the glass through the just sucking it straight through the vape it was really really nice and i i'm quite impressed honestly overall with this pig kush because i've been nothing but disappointed by it now moving into the high i'm going to give it a 9 out of a 10. the reason the point is docked is easier to explain it doesn't have any body effects it is strictly mental which is what i'm finding the majority of these cards to be is a head high and that's a little bit disappointing for me just because i've heard some really nice and enjoyable body effects that go with this pink kush but i'm just not finding it right now you guys just doesn't quite have it and that's it's a bit of a disappointment for me but there's there's nothing much i can do about it i'm gonna enjoy what i do get out of it which is that really nice heavy head high and overall i i think they did a pretty good job for the high and the flavor you guys moving to the overall with a 32 out of 40 i think it did overall very well um very sweet flavor definitely strong on that side um especially when we got into the glass or through the g pen but that little bit of a peppery harshness to the end when you bump that the temperature up to the highest levels is a touch of a turn off for me and a big reason why it lost at least one point in most of the taste scales and then just the lack of the sweet to comprom to uh to balance it out is typically the other reason why i would uh dock some points but overall you guys this this this cartridge did pretty well and i uh i'm quite impressed uh if you guys have tried it let me know down below what you think if you've tried any of uh phyto extracts cartridges let me know what you think we've had the super lemon hazel one in stock too and i was intrigued to try that one but uh the pink kush was definitely the one i think i needed to try first just to get a basis of where fido wanted to run with it and they they took a hell of a good run in my opinion you guys but uh let's drop this sucker up when the end card slides in you guys are gonna hover over the logo in the corner click

answer a question the question is how long should a cartridge last you and how many hits should you get out of it but before we get into that sure the question I'm asked you [ __ ] a month I guess please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always Sega's always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that things you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] also make sure you go over academy.com get yourself some terpenes shirts get about 10 11 13 [ __ ] I also cuz the contest is still going on you put in cold [ __ ] get 20% off in your whole [ __ ] order and again sirs you into the contest to be able to get yourself a terpene ball I send it out to you no charge you don't be paying shipping and handling under that [ __ ] I take care of everything and I send it out to you so [ __ ] man can't a mink on get your Terrapins o-obviously go over instagram academy kind of underscore me so all right the question of how long should it last and how many it should you get out there [ __ ] I give that [ __ ] all the time i'ma keep my honey with you if you talking about just a free-range like if you get a cartridge and put it on a free a free-range battery meaning that you kind of have up to seven seconds or 13 SEC's something like that's a hit the [ __ ] bait cartridge that's going to determine how much you're getting out of it so it's no way kind of that I can tell you how many hits you can get out of a [ __ ] cartridge so like when a person comes up and says how about a little 1 gram cartridge less I'll keep it 100 with you there's no such thing as a 1 gram cartridge it's a one milliliter cartridge because liquid is Mac [ __ ] measured in grams so it's a 1 milliliter cartridge with an X amount of grams InSAR milligrams inside of it so let's take for instance if you look at the back of a cartridge and it tells you that 3 milligrams is a serving right and then it also say below it the package has 450 milligrams of THC in it okay so that means that theoretically you would have 90 servings if that makes sense you would have 19 servings out of that that that half milliliter cartridge because that's probably what that will be if that if that's the number four right however how do you know you had three milligrams worth of eight and I'm not dissing it I'm just more so say how do you [ __ ] know this meaning it's kind of really hard to answer this question and then I don't know how often you smoke [ __ ] don't to [ __ ] you me how long does come in every two days getting the same [ __ ] I got my burgers coming in every three weeks every week like everybody got that you old [ __ ] habits and they [ __ ] that's like if I gave you a [ __ ] glass of water and on my a man how many sips is it gonna take to finish this that's just stupid right so at the end of the day you got to get the [ __ ] on your own and figure it out so companies try to give you a mindset of what it is but I got I got batteries that I could take a 13 second hit you know long 13 seconds is to be inhaling [ __ ] vape [ __ ] so come on spot it's it all depends on you man if you do like I think it's this matter like oh you didn't help for like two seconds or some little [ __ ] like that that's like a standard but just like I say it also depends on the force of how you inhale for that two seconds you can inhale like little B actually you can [ __ ] hit that [ __ ] up you know so it really just depends on how you [ __ ] hit you as well so those are the things that have to be taken into consideration when you expect someone to answer a [ __ ] question like that it really just depends on you see my life flashing man yeah peanut series it's yeah but it just really depends on what your habits are how you actually smoke at how long something is gonna last you I personally say have more than one method of consumption so don't just have one vape that you just constantly hitting on and then wonder why is going down that's like having one pair of shoes and heel shoes just get [ __ ] up you know versus like man like 27 pairs of kicks that's why my shoes usually all look new because I got so many so I can just switch them out you know so much it lasts longer so I say I've never met this at some edibles that's Mars so yeah I mean admit you [ __ ] I have some real weed my admission up and I think you'll see that the cartridges will last longer but if that's your only source that motherfucker's gonna be here it's gonna be how for like a month okay you have a graveyard of all these [ __ ] cartridges just laying there there's a little bit of [ __ ] oh you know there's no way of saying it now there is one I know some companies that they'll give you like don't dose it out to you it's actually a company called OC and then it's a okay you get 50 hits out of this pin so when you inhale it cuts off at what the proper dose is and you just inhale until it cuts off so think you know aren't exactly how much are the dose you're getting and you're knowing how many hits you get so I would say like if you can try a company like that just so you can kind of have our idea your mind just for shits and giggles I don't mean like all of that gotta make you be in the right place but just for shits and giggles like just think about it and see like man let me see how long this pin lets me hit and how much of a dose this says it is and that might help you out a little bit I don't know that's just theory of mine yeah me but at the end of the day that's what it is just read the back of the package and you'll see what the milligrams are inside look admit it should tell you what's suggested those are some companies do that so anyway that standard [ __ ] I'm out this [ __ ] y'all make sure y'all keep the log or I love each other keep the peace gon be peaceful to each other go over it kind of mean get yourself turn t-shirts I'm out this [ __ ] another one I want to hit the seat blow we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smoking

worldwide Apple's clean eke part in US history but there's one Apple product has gone from mass popularity in the colonial era to near obscurity today Applejack so what happened what caused a drink from a fruit not even native to the continent become the most popular booze in America and then decline until only recently one company was even producing the answer is very much linked to the growth and development of the us the type of apples are typically eaten or brewed were brought over when the first colonies that would eventually come the US were founded amongst the other crops brought over from Europe apple cheese would spread throughout the continent as the colonies expanded one of the most famous people known for helping spread apples was the American folk hero Johnny Appleseed born John Chapman John Chapman help spread apple trees to Pennsylvania Ohio Indiana Illinois and West Virginia contrary to the Focolare image of him just randomly spreading apple seeds what he actually did was start nurseries in the American frontier at this time to lay claim to a plot of land on the frontier one of the requirements was to plant 50 apple trees knowing this Chapman was then able to sell as apple seedlings from his nurseries to arriving settlers a follower of the new church Chapman was a strict vegetarian part of his beliefs also disallowed grafting a zoo is seen as causing suffering to the plants over most apples are produced by the graphing method or the stem of an adult tree is attached to the root stock allowing you to effectively clone a tree prevent any variation of taste to the new trees Apple because Chapman didn't graft his trees were largely unfit for eating but could be used for making hard cider and Applejack the widespread popularity of these hard beverages at this time the results of the isolation of the early settlers with limited access to other beverages and often even the clean water locally produced apple beverages was the best option they had the wane in its popularity is largely linked to America's own development as warmer frontiers evolved became more developed access to other beverages increased grains became more available and then become an achiever method of producing hot beverages popularity declined as hard cider and Applejack that replaced by cheaper to produce beer and whiskey then and the 1920s prohibition gave the near death look to these beverages many of the trees Chapman himself had planted were destroyed by the US government when they cut down any apple trees that could only be used to produce alcoholic beverages today hard cider and Applejack are only just now starting to return in popularity now understand the history of it what exactly is Applejack and how do you make it Applejack is made from hard cider by concentrating the level of alcohol in it the method called pleased distilling the method is actually pretty simple the only real equipment that's actually needed is a cold winter unfortunately it's been rather mild this year we'll just have to use a freezer there's actually some ambiguity about the legality of making Applejack yourself so I decided to let Chris handle this one using the hard cider we had previously brewed left it to freeze overnight he then inverted the frozen liquid over container let the alcohol be followed of the ice in a syrupy caramel color you can repeat this a few more times to increase the strength even more [Music] so we have here is some of the hard cider we brewed previously and now they've been jacked and distilled into various concentrations so the first one here is some of the stuff we grew before this is distilled three times and this one's been distilled five times so potentially you get around twenty to forty percent alcohol our first foray into distilling hopefully won't get arrested or go blind from this all right we'll start with the regular hard cider yes parts letter it's sour we have this normal cider nothing too special about it it's about the strength of a good beer alright this is the three times still no alcohol already oh wow that is strong that is definitely definitely stronger than the standard hard cider I'd say maybe like a strong wine I'm sure a full glass of this would do the job for me something that I'm a lightweight try this five times is still one the last one is a sweeter it's smoother some reason this one's just a little bit more smoother maybe it's got more of the extra flavoring that distilled enjoyed or something I don't think this did anything besides remove a little more water and make it slightly more cloudier as you can see there's not much of a color difference in either one overall is is pretty good there's obvious limitations to how much you can distill it just because the standard distilling you can actually get all the way to pure alcohol I believe this not so much kind of a limit a lot of the cider was probably wasted in this process but ultimately if you're looking for a quick way to get drunk freeze your booze over and over again not the strongest was definitely harder than standard cider and it turned out pretty good so I looked it up to the legality of it and like generally sounds like it's illegal but adult anybody even cares I mean after this I'm going to call the cops on Chris and see see if anybody shows up", "oHhzsm8OXVE": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up place you call your local dispensary today we are taking a look at a vape brand that is quite huge and one that has managed to escape our attention for some time here on wheats and that is the fine folks over at legion of bloom legion of bloom yes legion of bloon they make all kinds of different 5 10 um thread vape pot or carts as well as i think they partner with packs and make um different packs pods uh with their under their legion of balloon bloom line as well we are taking a look at their mendo breath indica 1 gram here today on the back we've got their lab testing results uh showing it coming in at if it'll focus uh 78 and thc uh and then as everybody's gonna want to know this comes in at 45 for a 1 gram but it'll never focus terrible at that 45 bucks for the one gram uh cartridge uh at a dispensary in long beach which puts it right smack dab in the average cost range for uh uh vapes at this dispensary mendo breath uh is a a strain that i'm not a huge strained guy but one that i do tend to like um and let's go ahead i'm a big fan of uh and by a big fan i mean i usually hate reading these sort of uh overly flowery uh pros that they these companies include on their packaging to sell you on them so let's let's lead you a little bit of the legion of bloom's story here legion of bloon is a coalition of eco-conscious cultivators with a deep reverence for the cannabis plant we carefully select terpene-rich genetics and capture their essence through solventless extraction methods combined with triple refined cannabis oil the result is a full spectrum experience unmatched in flavor and purity we invite you to join our legion nate let's join so let's go ahead and open this bad boy up uh let me go ahead and mention this packaging really beautiful packaging by the way uh it doesn't look that um crazy opulent either in terms of materials it's just very neat looking i really like the design it's sparkly and gold and i guess i kind of um uh you know um have the uh the sort of uh brain attention of a bird and like the shiny sparkly things gets my attention like this does uh i want to build a nest out of this legion of bloom cartridge packaging so we've pulled the little tab here let us slide open now is easy not too bad more uh marketing materials there and then in here we have got the thing itself wow okay a lot of materials nice thick plastic there and we're finally to the cartridge itself oh that is some nice looking oil guys yum that that oil actually looks incredible uh very thick looking uh incredibly pure oh i'm excited to give this a try this has got me really amped up uh it's got like the ceramic uh tip with that well it might be some kind of plastic it feels like ceramic um but it is a nice material i've seen a lot of uh the newer cartridges using this either higher quality plastic or some kind of ceramic uh it works a lot better than the cheaper acrylic tips so here we go let's finally give this mendo's breath a try hmm uh oh well my battery was showing that it was drying but i'm not getting anything let me try a different battery i have one here on standby let's give another shot well looks like i've got a bum battery sorry beloved um raw gardens battery you look like you're finally gonna have to join the collection in the sky uh but this battery works fine and this cartridge tastes great i forgot to mention they call this the monarch um with a hundred percent cannabis derived terpenes so this is uh triple refined cannabis oil and then all of the terpenes that are added back in are the terpenes from the mendo breath strain itself um it tastes like mendo breath that i don't know it's a very hard to describe taste almost spiced in a way i like it i like it a lot um and the oil itself is uh appears to taste as good as it looks uh quality wise so smooth um wow man that is quality stuff um yeah that just vaguely spiced taste that uh some mendoz mendo breath strain has this has in spades uh quite high already uh after those couple of hits you saw how smooth it was too i didn't really feel it at all going in um but rather big hits off not very hard draws as well um nice cartridge design seemingly as well from uh legion of bloom or they use a nice cartridge so far so good here oh wow guys i i i mean i barely feel it going in uh certainly feel it in the head as it's going out uh strong tasty um and just some really quality quality oil um this is a big old thumbs up so far for legion of bloom i can see why they have are a ten times award-winning company good for them uh great tasting not bad uh affordably priced right in the uh average price range at the dispenser i go to so so far this is a big thumbs up for a legion of bloom uh with their mendo's breath strain uh i am really really looking forward to finishing this one off uh as like all of our weeks reviews i'm gonna review the whole cartridge not just these first couple of hits because these things tend to leak they tend to clog they tend to break down all these things can pop up as you guys know so it'll probably take me about five days or so to finish this gram off uh really looking forward to doing that and as soon as i do i will come right back here let you guys know our wrap-up thoughts of this legion of bloom experience but first half so far so good anyways we'll see you guys right back here for part two in just a bit thanks for watching [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been about five and a half days since we started our journey with the monarch from legion of bloom their mendo breath strain this one gram 45 cartridge five days later my impressions are just as rapturous as they were before i really really really liked this one i like the quality of the oil like the taste of the strain that sort of spiced nutmeg cinnamony vague taste of uh the mendoz breath here was great um that oil as i said quality top to bottom never got that burnt taste never got that never started to burn that uh or get those big cloudy sort of vapor heavy hits nothing like that um just fantastic quality uh cartridge design worked incredibly well no clogs didn't have to get that like big first draw to get it going just a fantastic uh product really happy uh with the legion of bloom system not sure again why it's called the monarch it's got the mendo breath strain and the name the monarch but we'll forgive them we'll forgive legion of bloom we'll forgive the name the monarch because it's so good big old thumbs up here just as i had hoped and anytime we have a thumbs up this big we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that is not necessarily weed related and you don't necessarily need weed to enjoy although this recommendation might want a little weed beforehand because it's going to make that penis all the better that's right we're talking pen 15 on our cherry on top a show that just entered its second season on hulu a phenomenal show hi thank you a phenomenal show that just entered its second season on hbo and by hbo i do mean hulu uh it is a one joke premise it is about two uh 30 something year old women who pretend to be middle schoolers around the era of y2k and they act with a bunch of 12 13 year old kids and say a bunch of foul-mouthed inappropriate things it sounds like it should get boring very quickly but it's actually hysterical and if you are like me in your early to mid 30s you're going to be very very at home in that aesthetic so check out pen 15 or as i prefer to call it penis on hulu and check out legion of bloom the monarch at your local dispensary two things that i enjoy having in my mouth a whole lot well", "dMgb3UnMx5I": "yo so this is Chris with G farmer TV and today I'm going to go ahead and break down different uses on liquid gold seal to syringes so the first you want to go ahead and do is take off your actual seal on the syringe remove that and I wouldn't want to go ahead and use this right away until I have my plastic needle point only because it actually helps manage the portion of your dab actually helps manage the portion of whatever cartridge you're actually using to refill and it helps you from preventing them making a mess because the last thing you want to do is spill your liquid gold all over the floor or all over your hand one messy situation so not only can you refill just the liquid gold cartridges just by putting the plastic insert along the sides I want to go ahead and recommend to let the wick soak I mean that's pretty much the component that actually keeps igniting so the more drenched your wicks are better taste you will actually consistently have on every plus that tends to be the number one part that drives up I didn't use my whole half randomized liquid ghost range so what I would do is pull back we tracked my oil back into the syringe take off my plastic needle point and put back my actual seal this is the number one part you do not want to throw this away you plan to reseal your liquid goats are in good to go how could you tell if you have a good quality co2 syringe well the lighter and the thicker the better more water down your oil is the more there is a possible chance that it's cut with poly glycol any vegetable glycerin and the artificial terpene that are turns your oil from quality to quantity now when it comes to strain-specific syringes or strain-specific concentrates it's kind of tricky to go ahead and commercialize those actual strains because you do need a lot of plant material to actually run on a consistent basis so if you have a major farm with that one string to go ahead and commercialize our power to you until then I'm yet to see that let me just go ahead and show you that not only can you refill most co2 510 cartridges with liquid gold vapor oil but you could definitely go ahead and use it on different things such as put it on your flower taking a dive out of it different alternatives that you actually medicate with and you just want to go ahead and intensify or increase the actual THC no matter what way helps you out to go ahead and medicate with liquid gold vape boy there's different alternatives I like to go ahead and choose a safe discreet way when I'm on the go so I keep my pen in handy go ahead and get liquid gold go to gene farmer labs calm and don't forget to subscribe to our G farmer TV YouTube channel", "MWDniwcf064": "one two three four five hey how you guys doing just tallying up these numbers right here because I get an experiment on how many full hits it takes to or how many full hits there are and a half gram cartridge you know cuz I was curious so I went ahead and did that if you ever wondered well now I have a almost exact precise number so if you stay tuned and watch this video then that by the end then you'll know the number and you know a little bit more information as well shout out to shout our house you know these are some good good cartridges if you find them out there and dispensaries there anywhere you might want to check them out on that note stay tuned and watch the whole video and I appreciate you guys into the next one everybody has the question so I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys the answer to the best of my ability that is the question is how many true hits can you get out of a half gram cartridge so I'm gonna go ahead no not this one as you can see this one's kind of empty but I'm going to be using this one and this is a timeless sfv og right here but this so you see because most of the time I tap it and I hit them you know a few times at once but for the sake of this test I'm gonna be hitting them one time for through each pool just like this so that's one hit most of the time I like to tap them and try to give it a maximum hit for the back some effect but for the sake of this experiment we're gonna see how many of this take so stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now people see that it might be one more Inlet someone mark 20 34 34 you know results from a berry these were fooled some

here we're gonna rock through this this review real quick so like I said it's just like the last one this one is the green apple though the THC percent on this one is running it at ninety three point five two percent THC so pretty pretty smacking pretty smacking if you watched the last video uh you know shut us to you if you haven't go watch that one that was a good one that cart actually did pretty smack me pretty hard not as hard as the first select card I did but it definitely did smack and if you did watch that what you also know that I got these buy one get one for seventy bucks so forty forty eight thirty five bucks each basically for these cards is what I paid and these are whole grams as well let's see I'll try to put it up here so there's the CBD zero percent CBD this is all your batch numbers and stuff if I get too close it gets blue interesting so I'm not going to show you guys that because you guys don't care I have not even opened this one yet this one is fresh but I just finished the other one today this morning so I've been kind of have been without any hits or anything today so this will be kind of a fresh fresh fresh or hi this look yeah so let's go ahead and pop this bad boy out there same thing as the lightbox is you're inside your carts right there blah blah blah you already know the deal pull that little tab back here we go come on excuse me you guys are like allergies for some reason right I swear just as soon as I started this video they just decided to kick in so I don't normally get them but I'll let my dogs into my room so they're over there just messing around okay so we got this out of the box I do like the oil on these ones a lot there it's very clean oil it's a very thick and it's it's a gorgeous like piss color I mean it's it's it's a really nice nice oil further oil I definitely give my my tent and a plus whatever you want to do good old smack on the ass I don't know you know if you play baseball these ones you're looking with the little I heard I heard they're called like French kiss their french tips I don't know whatever but I like these ones better than the open barrel ones because they don't get as dirty in my opinion you already know the deal comes with your standard rubber cap on the bottom here's the thing like I said it is a full gram because there's a cool little Select logo on the front if you ever get a card that's slight so puzzling from a plug and it definitely doesn't have that or it looks weird well you got a fake-ass car family anyway Wow alright let's I am charging currently charging my battery speaking of that I went ahead and was messing around the other night I got really high and at about 1:00 in the morning I was like going through some comments already replied to but I was just looking at him and I'm just gonna go ahead and screw this on while I'm talking and I was like you know be funny as hell if I got like a sponsorship right Arab League who's gonna sponsor me at 22 subs I'm like nobody but you know we're gonna reach out let's just forget your [ __ ] and get off so I reach out to a battery company for four cartridges um you know like like sea salt cartridges and I'm like hey man one of my viewers got us the we clean up he's loading recommended the PC Kati pocket I'll leave a link in the description for one but it's the pocket battery I'm like let me get let me go let's just hit them up for giggles and I hit him up and I'm like you know like hey I one of my viewers mentioned your video or you needed my videos and I'm like I'd love to do like a collab or something anything just for shits and giggles and a couple days later as actually yesterday I got an email back saying like hey thanks you know we appreciate the sport Buffalo here's a 20% off gift or gift card on a coupon so guys if you want a dope-ass battery I might even call what you get 20% off if you use my code we have a code guys it's camp see a.m. 20 off so see a.m. to 2 sorry 2 0 o FF get 20% off the battery it's a really good battery comes in a bunch of different colors so if you guys are in a mean I don't get any money I don't know for anything it's just it's literally just a code that has my name on it so it looks cool but hey guys you know it is what it is but if you want one I'll definitely put a link in the description go check them out it's I just think it's funny for shits and giggles and for the jokes with it but you know it's awesome so it is what it is it made me it made me laugh really hard to give me good vibes so ah with all the rambling and jokes out of the way and stories let's go ahead and check it hit let me know together smoking on anything in the comments down below that where they do cheers guys um I definitely I do taste green apple in here for sure yeah green apple if you saw it it's not very strong it's like a very low profile taste and the rest of it you're getting a lot of a lot of the Kush taste but it's probably 30 Priestly apple and then 70% coach maybe like 30 60 and then like 10% some random [ __ ] that I can't even describe but I wouldn't say it tops the last one on flavor but ask for a high like that one hand bro I'm already feeling it a little bit so you know that's kind of weird and I'll be here but that's kind of great let's go for a hydration break guys I just spilled some like reject but ah that's okay um I dye it I'm not the way you guys read off that first rip I could tell you I think I'm gonna like it better than the fruit punch as far as potency but flavor I think the fruit punch definitely takes the tub just off of one hit we'll see if that changes throughout the video but that's just the initial hits so no mad at breath already for some reason let's go ahead and do another one guys Cheers that was bad but I still got enough you know it's not the best taste I've ever had but it's it's definitely not bad in that's pretty good yeah they're doing it they're hitting it right away excuse me is there I'm feeling them even like they're smack and hard they really are yeah hydration right hey guys like I said things coming in at ninety three point five two percent teg that's that's pretty impressive prayer card and it's it's select so you know they're not skipping out on you guys you're getting that quality so it's it's some fire I mean some fire it's expensive it's definitely on the higher price range but if you if you it's that's not an issue for you you're just looking to get that good good hit yeah selects the way to go that mean I can't really change my mind on that so far as for premium quality cards I think select has number one I think the next court I do want to try it was somebody like recommended in my last video as well then max I have seen a few buy one get once every once a week usually two times a week so I think either hopefully the next one should probably be a venom X unless I can find something random that's that catches my eye but yeah I really want to try and Vitamix and a few different ones I want to try like this is the Select unicorn this one they have random flavors that come out likes easily like strains I want to do some strain reviews and you know jointly smoking a joint and dabs and stuff like I want to do all that and I promise you guys that's gonna come soon once I figure out the whole camera recording situation I'm trying every time I I do record a video to edit it but it just keeps saying it's corrupted but it's not it's just I don't know I'm trying really hard I feel that if I spend hours but we're gonna figure it out and what do we do we are gonna post the most fire videos possible I promise you guys so make sure you subscribe and you know like and do all that [ __ ] so we can keep it going but let's take one more hit and I think that'll be four we're three that might be three I don't know that's probably three let's take one more and then maybe we'll do it for two you know we'll see we'll see cheers guys no way through you know one no one's gonna make me cough hey guys yep Niger sorry yeah this one's definitely definitely a snacker guys man it's getting me it is it it it is getting me 100% I don't know I'm hi guys I'm I don't even know if that was three or four I had the call but I was like trying a little bit and it was weird I am I'm a little - I hear an ism as a ribbon shape well honestly as far as poems he goes this bad boy it's like a nine point five out of ten this thing is it it is hitting hard I feel terrific guys I mean this is putting me in a great mood green apple by select if you guys go ahead and if you guys go and see this in your local dispensary I highly recommend checking it out and trying it is the high man it is he's pretty amazing they're not you know not made but it's fruit is really good just on three and I would say I have an insanely high tolerance with cards so that's from me so if you have a feel of a smaller tolerance there go ahead and try it out and I'm I had a harder but I just think no I was gonna in the video real quick but I just realized something guys I don't know just really I or or what but there's a little tab here and I'm pretty sure it's on the other one nobody's pointing up you've literally pulled this and you can see the whole last car in there and there's a little camp or like paragraph here I'll read you guys select elite flavors elevates from medical marijuana enjoyment to the higher level with luxurious luxurious luxurious terpene infused cartridges the top-shelf cartridges pecs powerful punch with our highest levels of activated medical THC which I do in fact believe because I feel well medicated yes well medic um I feel weird saying that but yeah secondly what's going on I'm gonna go ahead and end it on that one guys I don't think there's much left to say I'm pretty damn stone here I really like this car green apple buy select go ahead and cop one if you've seen it in the stores if you get a deal whatever it may be give it a try it's definitely on the top ten but that other way make sure you guys like subscribe do whatever you got to do give a comment anything's appreciated I'll get back to you as soon as I can but yeah it's about it I love you guys appreciate this before I'll see you guys in the next one deuces", "m22zj9_3Mho": "hey guys we're talking about top airflow cartridges and why they're so popular hey guys we got the top airflow cartridges right here the first one to come out on the market top airflow was the flow Pro and this one right here came in a point 5 mil the one nice thing about the the top airflow is you see those little holes on the top that's where the air goes in and so when the air goes in it goes down the center tube let me show you guys goes down the center tube see how there's a tube within a tube when you go when it goes in because one side of the tube the air goes down and then the other tube in the center the air goes back up so that's what they mean when they say top air flow cartridge is that the air comes from the top here where this little hole is it goes down into the center mixes with the with the vape juice and then it comes up the center and comes up the center and then you inhale that through so the one thing great about the the flow Pro and all of these top air flow cartridges air flow and the air goes in through the holes up top and then it goes through the to the center and then comes back up through the top here that's why what makes these top air flow cartridges never leak now after the flow Pro came out they came out with the this might look familiar this one is actually a v10 and you see the air holes up here and if you think it looks familiar it is because it's a chrome version of the smart cart so the smartcard is the same cartridge just this in a different color so if it looks familiar that's why so you got the center pole and you got the center hole right there you fill it to this line right here the oil it's a 1 mil cartridge so you fill up two there and then you just go ahead and put this in its just screws in like that it's a two piece and then the air goes through the top here and through the holes up here goes down through the center and then comes back up through the center and then out the mouthpiece this is the v10 so it's a real popular one if you like smart cards the v10 is super popular I just don't like the green so that's why we went with the one and then the newest one on the market also is the Android gold which is the v15 this one is like one of our favorites in here not only does it like look really really nice almost looks like a robot but the action on this you see how large the holes are in the in the center there it gives really good action too so you screw that on right there and this one is the airtight seal and you see the hole in the top here this is the airflow going in goes down the center tube and then it comes back out through the top there you know besides being at the top airflow cartridge it just really looks really cool - this is the v15 the Android gold and so those are the three top airflow cartridges that we have and this is one of the reasons the no leaking is one of the reasons these cartridges are so popular because no matter what type of oil you have it's not going to leak because of the fact I mean it could leak to the top if you turn it upside down and then you you know force it but in general these are no leak so that way if you're not ready to do your testing and don't want to go through the testing and finding yourself the perfect cartridge this is also one of the good starter cartridges - so if you guys making your own oil or if you guys are trying something out for the first time you know these are really great to start off with because you can have different consistencies and it's not going to leak because it's top air flow okay if you guys have any other questions don't forget to subscribe hit the bell to get notified of the new episodes and CHC vapor view when it comes out if you have any questions let us know it's elegant oh we're calm thanks guys [Music] think about it [Music] you", "-gdysmn5LEE": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel it's your man Kimo back to do another review for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there this time I've got a 5-10 thread of a cartridge coming to you from Palmetto cannabis that's sundial cannabis company it's agent orange it's a sativa hybrid stream it's coming in at 800 milligrams THC and one point two six milligrams of CBD so that's about 80% THC and less than a percent CBD so it's gonna be a high THC heavy-hitting cartridge really excited when I bought this I'm gonna admit I cheated a little bit I did buy it a few days ago and I was excited to try to open it up I've been faking it the last few days stuck it back in the cart in the container here to show you the package I'm gonna hate this packaging it's awful I'll show you on the front it shows to open the package you push it on the sides and you push open the top it's easier said than done like I was pushing pushing pushing I'm glad I didn't record the initial truck time I opened this package because it was real futile effort took me a while but after a while I just find out that usually if you play enough pressure on the sides and push in and pop you can open this packaging is horrible I can't stand the packaging and then when you do open it up you got your car to gene there it's nestled nice and safe away in this foam little cutout but it's straight through for me because you want the orientation of your cartridge to be upright and by having it designed in here you know this is probably gonna sit on the shelf like this or like this and your oils gonna be you know on the side it's gonna potentially clog or plummet your device not a cool design choice Palmetto I don't like that at all you know and strike three for me is this packaging big hard plastic and flung away what do you need all this packaging for this little device I don't like it you know it's it's horrible to me so packaging no good Paul metal so once you open it up though you do get this lovely little cartridge hopefully that's coming in nice and clear you see it says Agent Orange on the bottom and what I think is a really cool retro font I'd it the big bold letters you see the oil in there it is pretty dark doesn't move around a lot as you can see I've aped a lot of this the last few days it's a little dark almost kind of orange I'm wondering if the glass is actually tinted orange to go with the whole Agent Orange vibe I don't know let's get these rubber nubs off here with a mouthpiece condom get the battery put it on we're gonna vape a little bit here I've been vaping a lot of this I got some opinions on it but let's just take a rip right now as you can see is not a lot of vapor production it's not like a lot but it's enough gets the job done it is a little harsh so you can tell you're taking a drag that's one of the downsides to it after about four or five drags it gets a little harsh on the throat and I have coughed a little bit using this over the last few days but the taste you do get you're expecting orange oh you're expecting well Agent Orange gonna be citrusy orange II yeah not so much there's a little bit of a citrusy orange on the inhale and on the exhale it's a little tiny bit is there but it's mostly a kind of spicy peppery flavor cannabis flavor mixed in with the orange so it's a little bit sick you see with kind of spicy on the inhale on the exhale you lose a little of citrus and it's mostly just kind of a spicy peppery flavor it's not bad it's just not orange or really citrusy it's alright but like I said it's a little harsh so if you're going if you're really reefing on it you could COFF a little bit and you might feel a little irritation in your throat that's kind of the negatives the positives are the effects this this hits really good I find it to be a bit of a creeper strain don't really notice the effects for about 10-15 minutes and then all of a sudden you feel a Deadhead band effect come on and it comes down over and your smile comes up and I travels down your body and you feel energized and focused though like it's a really clear high you feel really focused and clear but you feel kind of happy and just like an overall general mood you're not really hi you got a bit of a headband effect but you're really focused and clear and just happy and conversational sociable it's a good get things done strains 50 times training good wakey bait string good any time stream however I will say that if you really refine it it kind of overdo it a bit start getting into you know quite a number of drags when the effects do kind of start to take over they're pretty intense at first and you know they wear off after a few minutes and they they develop into that sort of really focused clear high but you can make this pretty intense high it's kind of fun if you really want a refund get a little stone this is a great anytime babe because like I said it does dissipate into sort of a clear head in it you know certified so you're not all stony all day this this is great anytime Cape I would recommend it it's a good value it's forty five bucks I paid for it and you know it's point five grams it's gonna go about as far as any other 510 0.5 gram cartridge out there it depends on the use depends on your mileage mileage berries with you know how much you use it in your experience so thumbs up I recommend it I really like a good job Palmetto cannabis changing down packaging I can't stand your packaging I really like your cartridge I really like your oil I really like the Agent Orange pick it up if you see it it's a good deal that's the end of the review hope you all liked it leave me a comment let me know what you think that he tried it do you like it do you not like it

of each other and until next time brothers and sisters keep smoking", "Sitq2um1_7s": "toriel on how to use a cannabis vaporizer alright so with these products it's really nice you don't put a lot of soot or anything like that into your lungs it's much lighter feeling than if you're smoking it all the time and a lot of people don't know how to use these they're very simple so when you go to the store you're looking to spend about you know thirty to fifty eighty dollars always what we call a base of your vaporizer unit they're going to come packaged like this alright so depending on what brand you buy they all look a little different but from the same function you get your base and a charger in the box you're going to screw your charger into the base just like that and these Chargers just slide into simple USB ports you could charge them on your computer you can charge them to where you would plug your you know your phone cable right in there and then this this adapter will just go right into the wall then your vapor ends charging or you plug this right into your computer and now the base is charging okay so very very simple and the charges will last you you know weeks or more so once you get a cartridge once you get a base you're also going to need a vape cartridge which is a extract of cannabis oil and you can again get these in sativa indica hybrid or all CBD oils for example this is all CBD and this is a sativa product so again very simple simply screw the vape cartridge right into your base alright just like that and you're literally ready to go alright so then to use this product you simply depress the button hold it there inhale on the device take one puff see how you feel about five or ten minutes later and then repeat until you are at the level of Medicaid you've reached the level of medication that you wanted to consume and are feeling comfortable just don't use it before you drive besides that that's really how the vaporizers work it couldn't be simpler again if you want to detach this you can detach it be careful to not let the oil leak out if you're going to just rely on this allow around I usually try and set it upright or put the kite of the cap back on and that's really truly it with the vaporizers we that they're incredibly efficient and convenient way to medicate", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "DMdIS3YSdwY": "hi my name is Peter I'm with transferring USA and today I am proud to present to you the transferring bait cartridge autofilter this machine is designed to fill small disposable vape cartridges such as this quickly accurately consistently for long periods of time if you're currently filling these vape partridges by hand and looking for a better way I invite you to keep watching as I break down this durable and affordable piece of machinery first let's start off with a discussion of exactly what this machine will not come with that you're going to need to make it work number one is an air compressor you're going to need to buy an air compressor separately and make sure that it is at max 125 psi with at least a 10 gallon reservoir tank a good rule of thumb is the longer that you intend on running your machine the larger a reservoir tank you're going to need so that your air compressor doesn't work so hard to keep up with your machine now the second thing that you're going to need that we don't provide which likely you're going to need for both the machine and the air compressor is electricity so pay your electric bill and you'll have a happy machine and a working machine which means a happy business the first piece of equipment there we're going to focus on here that you will receive with your order is this pressure pot now this pressure pot is very important because this is where your material your liquid or oil will go in order to become pressurized and ultimately feed into the machine now this pressure pot is comprised of three individual pieces that all fit together number one you have this hood and through this hood it goes the feeding tube as well as this air pressure regulator valve the air pressure line which is feeding from your air compressor is going to feed pressure into this valve become regulated to a hundred psi fill up this machine and inside of this there's actually two other pieces number one you'll see an inner container here this inner container ultimately can hold your source material or hold a bottle that has your source material in it if you don't want to cover the inner container with your my source material and have increased loss then it's fine to just keep it in the bottle that you have it in the second part is of course this lower holding container once you have put the inner container with your material inside you have placed your cover on top you're going to then make the whole unit airtight by placing these four very heavy-duty wing nuts into place tightening them down in order to secure your top to the pressure pot and then you'll release the valve on your air compressor and begin to pressurize the tank in preparation for running your machine the next important piece of equipment that we're going to focus on is the pressure gun this will actually take a supply line coming from your pressure pot feed directly into the pressure gun which controls the flow of your liquid or oil into each cartridge as it moves along by the machine assisting the pressure gun in doing its job is this third piece of equipment here which is the temperature control unit which controls by degree the temperature of the entire head unit helping and assisting you to process thicker viscosity oils and liquids without encountering any sort of clogs in the needle or head unit as its processing through the machine now the fourth piece of equipment that we're going to focus on here is probably the most impressive as well and that is the filling robot itself it has two control panels that a user should become very familiar with one of them is this handheld controller right here it allows you to program all parameters for this machine as well as containing all pre-mapped programs that will become preset from the factory to work with the cartridges that you want to process through this machine now once all the parameters have been set in this handheld control unit there is a very simple front terminal interface that a new user can step up and start using immediately with a minimal learning curve it only consists of five buttons one is the on/off button number two is the start pause button number three is this stop reset button for use in an emergency number four is this program reset button for whenever the machine becomes out of calibration for any reason and number five is this line purge button this button is used to hold the air pressure gun in place and purge the line of any air bubbles or clogs before you start the machine the final piece of equipment we're going to focus on is arguably the most important and that is this custom cartridge holder we call it a jig it's designed to hold 100 cartridges in rows of 10 by 10 now you may be wondering how do I get one made for the cartridges I use and how do I fill it well these come pre map from the factory to fit transferring cartridges and one of the advantages of ordering transferring cartridges is that they will come in these wonderful foam inserts these foam inserts are designed to match the machining of your jig exactly so that you can simply lay them on top press them down into place vastly reducing your loading times and saving you time and money throughout the life of your machine now as I stated before the front panel has a dead simple user interface so that a new user can immediately step to this machine and get it working to begin the action here I'm simply going to press this lighted start button in order to start our filling now as we zoom in for a closer look at this machine as it begins its filling program you're going to notice how quickly it fills each cartridge it's currently programmed to fill each 1 ml cartridge in under one second meaning this entire 100 cart jig can be filled in under two minutes now as we move in for an even closer look the second thing you'll notice is the incredible accuracy of this machine no cartridge is under-filled no cartridges overfilled and there are no drips between cartridges this helps eliminate human error reduce waste and ultimately increase your profits and yield over the lifetime of this machine now I spoke before about the dead simple operation of this machine let's say you're a new user and you'd like to pause the action well all you need to do is come over here and press the start pause button pausing the machine allowing you to restart the action from where it left off at your leisure by simply repressing the start pause button much like the start or the play pause button on your DVR or DVD player now let's say that you would like to stop the filling completely and reset the machine back to its original starting position all you need to do is press this start button and with a simple twist the machine resets back to its original position releasing the jig and allowing you to address any issues so now that we've seen this machine in action I'm sure that you have a lot of questions including how to order one well I can answer all those questions and more if you contact me directly by emailing me at USA at transferring comm or by giving me a call at 925 four zero five five five eight to offer the only us-based sales and service for this filling machine and I have warranty service that is back directly by the factory so I can answer all your questions about ordering customization installation and ongoing maintenance for this machine also in the meantime be sure to subscribe to our channel

I've been really craving and so I've known as that plug and play has like a really good flavor like I've tried the Apple slushy before that she was by it's just like actual like gummy like green apple

Shawn Mira VG here and it's time for another cannabis product review today I'm reviewing good Supply Blue Dream and this is a vape cartridge using the 510 system it's got a lot of good information even just on the box it says our oil what's inside cannabis distill a plant-based terpenes and the terpenes are quite nice in this one no additives which is what I like and premium ceramic core that sounds good anti leaked technology perfect don't want that leaking in direct airflow system alright so already I'm liking this product it's really kind of cool funky green color there's some good easy to read information on the box so this retails for $43 ninety five cents on the Ontario cannabis store it's got 75 to 83 percent THC meaning it's a quite a potent cannabis cartridge there's really no CBD in here it's a sativa dominant hybrid so a little bit about blue dream so blue dream is a really classic strain that originated in California it was made using two strains blueberry which is known for its sort of blueberry flavor owing to a sort of fruity terpene profile and a really classic sativa strain called haze it's so blue dream has been pretty much known for its sort of full body relaxing effects without being sedating now the licensed producer behind good supply is \u00e1free\u00e1 they're basically a giant here in Canada a huge licensed producer with a lot of brands under its name but good quality products I know a froyo well they're out of Leamington Ontario if anyone wanted to know and they pride themselves with this 509 step process which is basically just means there's they take five hundred and nine steps in they're sort of quality assurance program so everything's held up to a really big standard I guess 5:09 really doesn't mean much to the average person but I'm guessing if you went to their plant and they went through the whole system you'd be pretty impressed anyway so that's a little bit of the backstory about this so let's open it up I really like this box it's really cool so you open it up using these tabs so there's two tabs here so if you push them both in and then you can push the inside of the box out so really kind of sleek and cool and good child protective mechanism there and so your cartridge is inside here and you can just sort of bring it out and that's what it looks like it's got a nice heavy metal heavy metal alright a metal tip which you know it's got a good mouthfeel to it and of course just like all the other 5-10 oops 510 cartridges it fits into your battery just by turning it like this so there you go and then you're ready to go so about blue dream what really stands out about this particular product is the flavor so the flavor is very fruity notes forward it's very true to the blueberry ancestors of blue dream yeah probably one of the most fruity besides maybe the tangerine dream from San Rafael this would be the second most fruity vape I've tried now the effects pretty typical to a blue dream there's this sort of wave of kind of like hazy it just says the name suggests relaxation so I didn't feel particularly what should I say focused during the effects of this one it kind of makes your thinking a bit hazy and sloppy but at the same time it's very relaxing and other point to mention which I notice with this one is it's not sedating at all so I wouldn't recommend this for nighttime use cuz it might keep you up a bit unless you can augment it with something that's a little bit more sedating so yeah so that's pretty much it in a nutshell I'm gonna give this one hmm this is gonna be a tough one because I do like the flavour a lot I like the effects but I'm not crazy about the effects I'm gonna have to give this a seven and a half out of ten yeah a little bit shy of an eight just because the effects aren't my favorite and you know what it is is if I'm going to be taking a sativa that's not going to be sedating that you know is probably better for daytime use I want like I want to have a lot of focus a lot of energy I want to be able to get things done which is not really what this one brings to the table and maybe it's not what this one's designed for this one's really more about chilling and relaxing like during the daytime because it's not sedating but very relaxing so I think a seven and a half for me is fair some other people who want like a more chilled out experience will probably rate it a bit higher but that's what I'm going to give it all around a great product are really happy with the purchase oh yeah and I bought this from a new dispensary in my area of town called Miss Jones I want to just give them a shout out because the the store looks beautiful first of all and the staff was really friendly and I enjoyed talking with them so shout out to you guys at Miss Jones alright that's it for me I'll be back with another cannabis product review for you guys shortly", "Sgs9cbojCTI": "[Music] yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __ ] down below and subscribe today we do got a review it's a cartridge review it's coming to you by runts this is the obama runs i have i haven't never tried obama runs before not even the flower i seen this at burners in merced california it's a licensed cookies dispensary and i thought i would try out the runts uh cartridge this is only a half a gram it comes in the package like this let's pop it open it does got a little bit of headroom that you can see there i really don't like that uh it's got the seal on the top and the bottom let's get those off i got a fully charged battery here and on this it's weird the thc and everything the thc a is 10 and a half percent and then the d9 thc is 55 and a half percent and the cbd is at a point two percent so i don't it doesn't tell you the total on here it's kind of all over the place so we're just gonna try it out and see out see what it's like and i did do some research the obama runs is a indica dominant and this half a gram is gonna run you like like 45 bucks i think at uh burners in merced so cheers everybody let's get a hidden see what this shit's all about gotta turn it on oh and how they make uh obama runs is it's afghani crossed with og kush cheers yeah this is not live resin i want to say this is distillate as well it says on here to hit this one at uh low heat which is recommended 2 volts but this battery is the voltage is like you can change it and the lowest it goes is 3.3 so we have it at 3.3 off the first hit it's got a a good taste it's not fruity like they're adding [ __ ] to it it tastes like flour so i really like the taste and it was smooth we just got to see what the high is like because it feels a little light for me but you know we got to take a couple [Music] hits i do got a beer here i don't feel like doing the whole shoddy thing right now it's only uh [ __ ] 10 30 in the morning when i'm recording this so this is early beer and early filming for me i got things to do today 49ers play it one uh later on the lakers play so i got [ __ ] to do i gotta film early today okay off the first couple hits uh it's not bad at all this is all legit [ __ ] though it's got all the you know the seals and all the [ __ ] on it like it's all it's the real deal people i don't buy no fake [ __ ] okay so far i don't know i like an la cushion stuff this is okay but for the money that you're paying for it i don't know i might stick with the uh with the other ones that i've been smoking on this is probably more of like a cbd heavy or something cheers well it's not it's only a 0.2 but i don't know it's not like super strong on the on the thc this is one of those ones if you're a family function or maybe even at work and you still want to [ __ ] go throughout your day without being all [ __ ] up this one's probably perfect for you i think this is the first time i've ever bought a half gram too i usually go with the full grams but honestly it's not that bad it is it is pretty good i am starting to fill it now the more hits i'm taking but when you pay you know top dollar you want to feel that effect quick well i do anyway i've been smoking for a very long time my tolerance is extremely high so you guys need to remember that when you're watching my reviews my tolerance is [ __ ] high so if i'm giving some things like small like lower numbers on my reviews for some people that haven't been smoking that long it might hit you guys a lot [ __ ] harder you know so keep that in mind and the hot chip i am eating this uh i think i'm gonna eat it tomorrow i'm gonna film this tomorrow so you guys will be getting it in the next two or three days you guys will be getting that video somebody uh told me to do it live i thought about it but i think i'm just gonna go ahead and do it the same way i'll have the timer out and everything you know i've never done a live video before i don't feel like it's gonna pull in a lot of audience on my first one so i'll just stick to the video format let's get another hit in cheers hope you guys are smoking on something good having a great day this is sunday when i'm filming this you guys won't see it until [Music] monday morning yeah this one's on the lighter side i would like to try the weed the actual flower of obama runs and see if that's more of a you know if it's stronger if it has a hard punch to it or if it's mellow like the cart is so far and what i just did was i poked a hole in the back of this beer so it'll go down a little faster not like super fast but just gives it a little uh you know air ah okay let's get another hit in start calculating up the results here [Music] okay price this one this brand is pricey runs aren't cheap in any dispenser you go to it's a pricey brand you know it's well known it's one of your top of the lines it's up there with cookies and everything else so price it is pricey it's not your budget cart the the look of it uh it was a little low but it is only a half gram and it looks typical normal like every other cart that i've smoked on the uh the taste it tastes more like weed than it does anything else they like they didn't add any flavors to this or anything i can just taste more like weed like how the raw gardens uh ones taste the uh the smoothness is really good it doesn't you don't even feel the smoke going in or out at all and the high the high is mid mid range this isn't something that's going to put you on your ass at all it's more for someone that wants to function during the day still and and that's good for a lot of people a lot of people will like that you know me i just like to be stoned so um the functionable ones are always a little iffy for me that's why my reviews are a little lower on them you know so overall for the obama runs by runts vape cartridge i'm gonna have to give it the 7.8 because uh it's not it just don't get me high enough to get into the eights but the 7.8 it is real clean and it tastes really good and it's really smooth and i do feel the effects of it but i just want to be more higher when i smoke sorry so i'm giving it the 7.9 i mean 7.8 sorry not 7.9 7.8 some good stuff about it and some negative stuff about it i would say you have to try it out for yourself because not everybody's preferences are the same so i'm giving it the seven eight ah all right that was my review for the obama runs by runs hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town [Music] ah [Music]", "iIwabDKM61o": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at another vape cartridge traditional 510 threaded uh this is our second look at a company and our first look at their premium line we are taking a look at carvana again uh we reviewed kirana a couple of years ago with they're very very popular here in southern california um k-pen originals i believe is what they call them the uh karana excuse me kirvana originals line a much cheaper more affordable line that i don't see as often anymore as their new ish uh much more recent premium line although this has been around for a couple of years now uh and this routinely ranks among the most expensive weed cartridges that i find uh in southern california the carvana ascend brand that's right uh a s c n d uh this is the ascend line the high fashion strain from carmana ooh la la how fancy uh it's a sativa with uh let's see in terms of thc it's got 87 thc so super high thc percentage uh and then with the whole cannabinoid package uh rocking 92 and a quarter percent really nice lab testing results really nice break down there i still don't like the trend of putting the number of total cannabinoids as a bigger more noticeable thing than thc but you know uh everybody's doing it uh gives you the primary terpenes if you are really into that um and then uh we know that from kirvana's website and the packaging here this is a full spectrum product uh which leads us into a little bit of semantic trickery in terms of what do any of these things mean so this is a full spectrum um a full spectrum vape cartridge uh from kirbana meaning that it is uses all of the spec all of the cannabinoid profile theoretically from the high fashion strain but it does not mean that it is necessarily like live resin or extracted in some different fancy way or some different fancy kind of oil it simply means that it uses the entire cannabinoid profile of the strain um so uh carbon claims on their website they use their proprietary 50-point different extraction uh method that secret whatever yada yada yada i appreciate they're not lying and saying they're you know live resin or whatever when they're not uh this is just good old-fashioned cannabis oil and then added cannabis-derived terpenes so old-school style now as i said this is the most expensive uh these are routinely the most expensive cartridges i see in southern california uh i know this isn't gonna sound like much to a lot of you but believe me uh for where my area or my dispensary this is this half gram cart costs uh 46 bucks which puts it well well well above many of its competitors uh i routinely see you can find one gram cartridges in my area for forty dollars fairly easily uh and this is a half gram cart for more than ten percent more than that so uh not cheap but let's hope it's the premium experience let's go ahead and shut up and get into it uh the most important part of these reviews the actual testing uh let's try to figure out how to open this in the least destructive way possible which i fear may not happen i think i'm gonna just cut this sticker which you know oh i do have my scissors excuse me i did come prepared all right easy desert girl don't and by easy desert girl i guess i mean me don't stab and kill yourself i've got half the sticker oh damn it let's just go for the whole thing so uh take this into account anybody who is uh planning on doing this somewhere at location you've got a pretty gnarly sticker here to contend with before opening this rather uh elaborate packaging uh you are definitely paying for some fancy ass packaging here which to me is a not uh something that i'm very happy to do even though i own a house full of apple products uh okay so there we go there is that oh look at this a little pool tab oh ah so oh a an acrylic tip which is not what i was expecting to see i was thought for sure something nicer material wise there but whatever uh as long as it still works great and the mouth feel is fine so you've got a plastic acrylic tip um otherwise the oil looks nice a little lighter than i am used to um seeing but uh that doesn't necessarily that's no indication of any kind of quality all right well there is what our what is this called again uh this high fashion looks like i've never actually had flour high fashion before anyways uh i've been told that it should have a uh sweet berry like taste let's give it a try whoa wowzer holy [ __ ] [ __ ] what a crazy crazy flavor profile wow uh it immediately comes out tasting like peppermint like a but not a burning awful too much peppermint a very um i don't know uh s gentle subtle pepperminty taste um not overpowering any way shape or form that very quickly turns into something much sort of fruitier and more almost more floral it's delightful wow yeah um in terms of taste uh this is after three or four hits here this is like a top five uh flavor terpene profile for me in terms of just pure taste it is it's it's trippy almost um how how much it changes on you let's get another big one here before we talk about how high it's gonna get us whoa that is amazing tasting wow i rarely find ones that like the taste alone is something that would make me want to um sort of uh try something again exclusively for the way it tastes but this is this is different this is something special and it's not just the taste uh this is strong as [ __ ] holy [ __ ] um that last hit really really did it um 87 thc for sure plus all those other various delightful and tasty cannabinoids for that what was it 92 and a quarter percent uh various cannabinoid profile and what a delicious 92 and a quarter percent it is um holy [ __ ] is it expensive but holy [ __ ] are the initial impressions equally i mean this is uh wow yeah uh i am i did not expect to uh review this this quickly and have such conflicting feelings i i thought for sure i was gonna come here and say like oh you know it's good but it's not worth it but uh with this taste and with this potency man this is really good stuff let's get one more in uh real quick here excuse me holy [ __ ] yes wow um i would put this as oh my god i am quite high um this is the only and this is early in our review because all of our wheats reviews is not we're not just going to review the first little bit we're going to review all of this half gram and boy am i excited to do it but this is the closest i have ever come to finding anything that um competes i'm not gonna say it's better than plug play but this is in conversation with plug play uh and it is not something i was expecting wow this is good stuff um let me get one more before we say goodbye for now uh and i'll see you guys again in a couple of days when i sadly have to say goodbye to our cravana ascend high fashion until then guys stay high stay healthy and i'll see you back here in just a few days goodbye welcome back to wheat skies it has been four whole days uh with the carvana ascend lines high fashion and that 87 thc and here i was pretty effusive in our first half of our review and i am happy to say i am just as pleased here four days later as i was at the beginning this is truly high quality stuff here from carvana this is probably a top five favorite cartridge for me um now it is a premium product again it comes in at 46 bucks for that half gram but this half grim did last me about a day longer than average mostly because it's just that strong and i was able to hit it less more infrequently and it lasted longer as a result but it is more expensive by a decent margin than a lot of products out there um so you should factor that into your buying decisions especially if you are value conscious uh but if you're looking for something a little special a little different um the kurvana ascend line at least the high fashion is going to get a huge huge thumbs up for me um really really enjoyed it uh take a look at your dispensary if you're looking for something a little bit more premium a little bit more [ __ ] i forgot to do and i can't ever think of one while i'm doing it what was my cherry on top why did i do this oh my god i had one in my head and then i just premium premium what's premium [ __ ] welcome back to which guys cherry on top real quick i wanted to uh drop with you guys before we go here a little something extra when we like review this much we like to give a little extra something that isn't weed related but you might want the carvana ascend for this one because it'll be nice and trippy that's an uh year old or so show on amazon prime called undone from the creator of bojack horseman uh it is an animated show starring a couple of different folks including everybody's favorite um uh saul goodman um bob odenkirk himself uh great animated show rotoscope style like a scanner darkly so it looks vaguely real but with this bizarro trippy animation style over top of it and it's a pretty interesting story i think it's like 10 episodes each about 20 minutes it's really worth checking out uh both of these things are the karana ascend high fashion and that is also undone on amazon prime but things i highly highly recommend and that guys is going to do it for our cherry on top and that's going to do it for our review of the cravana ascend until we see you guys on our next review live stream whatever stay high more importantly stay healthy", "JFpLUTbWBw8": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive what's up guys back here for another [ __ ] video and today you guys already know you can tell from the title today i'm gonna do another informative informative video um if you guys clicked on this video it's probably because you guys have bought a select card and you guys are wondering is that thing real or is it fake because select had a lot of fake cards going on back in the day but that's back when that's back before they had live resin guys back in those days they only had distillate but now guys man they faking they faking the live resin now guys so today your boy is about to put them on blast because um i recently got a select from flower co and um my friend he recently got a select off the streets and he came up to me with it and it was pretty much the same box but totally different and you could just tell it was fake and i felt so bad for him so he let me borrow the he let me borrow it i got the cards and i'm going to show you guys the difference between the real and the fake you probably could kind of tell already from the box which one's real and which one's fake but um before we get into this guys hopefully you guys can hear me it's kind of windy today actually but um let's take a freaking bong ring boys all right guys so to start off off the back we're going to do a little close-up you feel me so you won't see my face for a little bit we're going to do a little close-up talking right quick so check it out all right off the back this is the real one and this is the fake one and let me tell you guys why this is real and this is fake off the bat you can tell it's fake by the colors all hybrids are in the orange box and it's a dark orange it's not this light orange you see the lettering the lettering it's in light orange um the name of the strain the thc content and the amount in there is a lighter orange as you can see also let me get a little closer this color scheme thing right here the yellow orange red pink purple the color scheme is lighter than the one on the rail box those are off jump ways that i knew as well as you could tell by the print they're using different fonts as you can see it's more bold up here is more popping on the real one more plain it's more pop it gives it more of a pop like it's coming out at you you'll see the difference okay and then another way you could tell guys is the real one off jump a real one's gonna have a bar code there you go barcode fake no barcode no nothing sealed up nicely it almost looks almost looks real another way you can figure out that this is fake guys is when you push it out to open see at the bottom you could see that it just pushes straight out when you push this button in on the side guys that i have my finger on right here that i'm tapping you can just push it down and then push the cart straight out you can see from the bottom the box comes straight out on a fake cart it's just a flat bottom you just pop that off this is a flat bottom this has no use maybe after you pop it off you can slide it but it has pretty much no use as you can see the difference the actual box pops out from the bottom when you rip this tape off another way i could tell guys is also from the bottom it's a hybrid and it says indica on the bottom it could obviously be an indica hybrid but it just says hybrid on there and if it doesn't end like a hybrid it will say indica hybrid like this one says sativa hybrid it's a dominant sativa because most you know strains you get these days they're hybrids so um usually they're either sativa dominant or indica dominant this one's a sativa dominant as you can see but this one it just says indica on the bottom and just lemon hash diesel so that kind of threw me off that new that that's what made me know that it was fake basically a lot of things did but also you could tell by the font the font is different as you can see it's a light orange color just the real one's dark orange feel me and the font is way different guys this is a fake just look at the font you know give it a couple seconds make sure it's hd now look at this font you could see that it's much different font but it's very similar they did a good job on it but some of the font stuff is different like the warning sign should be yellow there's no yellow and you can see that the font is different boom boom all right guys those are the ways you can see just by looking at the box this is the real one the tropicana and this is the fake one it's too light like you can tell it's fake guys come on now um another way you could tell is um by the actual oil you see the lemon hash diesel it's a little too light you feel me you can see how light it is i'll take it out the package later but your oil is going to want to be dark like this like the tropicana cookies you see that dark consistency you don't want that you don't or no you want that sorry guys you want that dark consistent you don't want the light consistency you see that it's too light you want that dark because live resin is usually darker but yeah let's pop this open but yeah guys you know there's a lot of you know fake carts out there that are easy for you to you know realize that they're fake because they're mario karts they they got fruity pebbles on it they're named after some kind of cereal brand you know different brands that are trying to entice younger people to buy it basically but you know select it's a little harder to um just drop the box it's a little harder to tell because you know they try to make it look as legit as possible and select is actually a real brand mario karts and those luigi's and all those other carts that are out there the skittles and stuff like that those aren't real brands nintendo is not gonna let you put theirs name on a car guys let's be real so we're gonna open up these boxes real quick there we go so it pops right out guys the real ones you can actually use the button and it pops right out there's no cardboard on top it's just like a plastic thing you have to cut off and then boom you got a cart the fake one as you can see you have to actually peel back a box you feel me you have to peel that back and actually open up the box [Music] then you can slide it out after you already open the box [Applause] the real one it's already out you can already push it out the fake one you have to rip open the actual box bam so like i said guys look at the oil the real one is going to be much darker than the fake one as you can see the fake ones are super light it looks like fake wax usually fake wax looks like this looks like this or clear this is real it's a live resin this looks like a distillate this looks like this joy with this live resin baby so make sure you know what you're getting guys the last test honestly the last test to know if your cart is real or fake is to taste it but i know for a fact that this one's fake as hell so i'm not gonna be hitting it let's inspect the cart see the fake one the fake one sorry guys i'm not even done yet the fake one as you can see has no stickers or nothing a real one is going to have a ca sticker on it my guys as you can see let's see what kind of cartridges they use the c cells look a little different too hopefully i can zoom it in good enough the c cells look different [Music] way different but they're both cell i guess but the writing on this c cell looks more bolder as you can see the writing on the real season looks way smaller but either way we know we know that yellow stuff is fake in that dark stuff this is the real this is the real deal guys fake real you can just look at it and see the difference ca dark color no ca light color looks like a disc joy all right so thank you guys for watching the video though guys more content to come i had to get you guys another fake card review and i felt like select one of the biggest like companies out there other than raw gardeners dizzy so i had to do one of them and my

today I have a classic strain in vape cartridge form for you today pineapple express baby coming at you from the good people a good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy pineapple Express from good supply good job I liked it so hope

been so hard for me to make videos I think I've just been too lazy to be honest guys I have no other excuse but today today guys I'm about to bring to you one of the craziest [ __ ] stories ever that well for me personally and one of my own personal experiences we're gonna be talking about this right here boys this right here you see that [ __ ] right there or say you see a little treat logo right there yo if you if you know what that is your your your real one but basically guys what this is it's tree bass one of the most potent [ __ ] cartridges in the damn world one of the best I've ever tried ever and I'm gonna tell you guys a story of how I came up on four tree bases bow for look at that [ __ ] Barry White you got the Mendo breath and got the Wi-Fi Oh gene you got the agent orange [ __ ] fire guys so let's get to the quick story guys quick story before actually before I get into start we're gonna take a quick hit I'm not gonna tell you guys which one this is but just know it's one of the four I'm smoking on it and I haven't actually been hitting this one I probably hit it one spots just to test that I hope but let's try it right now guys I forgot to mention if you're eighteen over twenty-one over whatever it is in your state make sure you're smoking along let me know what you guys are smoking on make sure leave it in the comment below Oh fire mmm he's [ __ ] delicious so guys into the story um right here I'm gonna tell you guys how I got the [ __ ] tree base so I was looking I was gonna pick up right I just ran out of my [ __ ] cartridges and I was like [ __ ] dude I need to pick up so it's time to pick up so I started looking on weed maps you know we usually what I do guys before I purchase anything I don't go in and just [ __ ] go my same old dispensary you pick up whatever the [ __ ] is they have you know I go on weed map see what the deals are if they have if there are good deals I'll get a [ __ ] deal if not then I'll just stick with like a regular basic cartridge fifty dollar cartridge you know whatever the deal is and then um so I was looking on here and then one of the dispensaries that I go to they always have a deal so I'm like [ __ ] it let me check this [ __ ] out so I check on their page and then I'm scrolling through their deals and then she says to grams - [ __ ] grams of tree base right tree base clear for $70 yeah I'm like I look at it I'm like what the [ __ ] that like this can be real this can be because if you guys don't know try to guess how much one have it this is a half game guys I've never seen one full gram of these I know they make them but I've never seen one like every dispensary that I go to they only have half grams so alright so guess how much one half gram costs of this [ __ ] like look at this clear as water guys one half gram of this cost forty [ __ ] dollars forty dollars yup that you could literally grab a full hat a full gram cartridge for that amount and it's [ __ ] insane but but but if like let's say this isn't this isn't your everyday smoke guys UI no-one's gonna go out and buy one of these for fun no one like I don't like unless you're [ __ ] rich you're not gonna go out and buy you like not even I I even I you [ __ ] debate it if I wanted to go like this [ __ ] so I only got it because it was a good deal so yeah guys so they had two grounds for 7d and that was I couldn't believe it so I had to go hit up the dispensary and go check it out and then let me tell you guys so that bats a morning I called him early in the morning outside out like Maine ten o'clock in the morning and now I was like just to confirm if it was that if they still had it in stock cuz I didn't know you know this is [ __ ] good as deal what if it already ran out so I call them they don't pick up I call them apart like three times just to make sure and then they don't pick up you go straight to voicemail and I'm like [ __ ] dude whatever so later on that day I end up going to dispensary and then so I go inside the dispensary walk in there sure I look on to the other menu on the inside they have a menu so I'm looking on there I'm like hey like my deal is and on there the deal that I want so I tell I pull out my phone real quick and then [ __ ] god damn [ __ ] turn your [ __ ] head lights more hoe it's only 7 o'clock so [ __ ] [ __ ] made me lose my train of thought sorry guys so I told how my hey like I want this do and I pull out my phone and then she's like she's that no it's cuz I had a question about the prices for so I go ahead and ask her about the prices right and then when she confirms that the price is right so she I tell her all right give me this deal she starts getting me she's like I said what tree base do you want to get the for and then she's like hold on let me confirm the deal so she got my phone takes it to her manager she's like hey this is the deal he's game and she's like she said what the [ __ ] [ __ ] no that's not the deal that is not the deal so they had to confirm with like another person and they were like if they come back to me like all like [ __ ] like Timman and [ __ ] and they're like hey like like that deal was like a [ __ ] but we're gonna honor it cuz you know I mean I don't know I've never I've never been to dispensary the word they honored what they say is you know like [ __ ] it whatever you like we don't have it you're out you got a lot of guy so it was pretty cool that say that they honored it so I got 2 grams which comes out to 160 dollars a guy's for $70 $70 that's like literally the best the best deal I've ever came across in my whole entire like two years of smoking weed so yeah guys like let me know what you guys think about that story like isn't that one of the best come like come ups ever

show you guys the packaging real quick for the tree base so this is a pretty neat [ __ ] packaging like one of the most like legit Wi-Fi og little it comes with a little card just fell out and what the card basically is it tells you it gives you a description of like what the what the [ __ ] strain is what it has like what it's supposed to taste like or we're supposed to make you feel and all that [ __ ] so and then inside they have their little things you are holding purity quality and consistency tree base they're pretty professional when it comes to their packaging guys and then the cartridge comes in this tube right here and then in the back they have the same thing and they have warning labels all over and then boom in here is the [ __ ] cartridge let me show you guys real

comments below which one you guys want to [ __ ] see me review - you guys can choose to remember I'm Loki leaning more on doing right now if I don't have like that many suggestions I'm probably gonna end up doing Agent Orange and [ __ ] probably Barry White because those two are like the most popular ones out of the [ __ ] tree based brand so and they're the most flavorful ones I mean not the most popular as in like oh like be pretty like propaganda that [ __ ] you know so let's take a quick hit guys I'm gonna show you guys how [ __ ] delicious this is mmm one thing I would say man the [ __ ]

everybody it's Jay again with a brand new video on how to fix a broken vape pen cartridge this is an extension of my previous video which I'll put the link right there for you that I made last year on how to do this exact same thing but in that amount of time I have learned a couple of new things which is going to be number four and number five and in this video I'm gonna go through everything that I explained in the last video but I'm going to do a little faster so hopefully that'll make some of you happy that don't like sitting through very long videos but it is important that I cover all these details so that we know what is going on so without further ado if you like these videos please consider subscribing I'm a stay-at-home dad and if you in these videos helped you out please consider donating to my venmo @j Andres or to my cash app j1 two to zero so without further ado let's start off with number one is the air flow disrupted let's check all four areas so number one is the mouthpiece right so our cartridge our mouthpiece on these particular cartridges these are the kingpin brand the mouthpiece actually comes unscrewed so if we do unscrew the mouthpiece we can see real easily it's not clogged so there's no reason to go any further with that one if you had a severe oil leakage your oil might be clogged up inside of there and then in that case just use a pipe cleaner to get that out of there or a little rolled-up piece of paper towel or something one thing I notice is I just knocked off this little rubber washer so I'm just gonna put that back into place there you go nice and sticky there's also a rubber washer right in there to go up flush against that glass to keep that that oil from leaking out so let's put that back together so area number one is the mouthpiece we just check that it's good area number two is the bottom air hole so the bottom air holes right there is it clogged obviously if it's not obviously clogged then we're just gonna skip that what we don't want to do before I go any further I know we have some different tools up here I got my little paperclip and I got pipe cleaner and all that what we don't want to do is please do not stick anything through the entirety of your cartridge because we have these little wicks that are inside of these two little holes right there and right there which are the same as these two little holes right there and there this cartridge the glass does not screw off I had to break it off for the demo purposes of this display here okay so is your mouthpiece clogged is the bottom air hole clogged number three of this section is the side holes near the bottom of the threading this is the bottom threading there are air holes right there so when we screw on our cartridge to our battery those air holes receive air from the fourth section the air flow slots at the top of the pen which are right there they look like little castle teeth air will flow in through here and then it will enter the side holes near the top of the threading and then also - it will enter through the bottom this is the contact pin that makes contact with this little plate of your battery that sends electricity to this and then this transfers electricity to your wick coils there are two four one two three four this coil is missing the wick because I took it out the wick absorbs the oil from your middle cylinder so all of your oil will be in here and then the oil will go into those holes right there into the wick the wick receives electricity and heat from the coils and it turns your liquid into vapor which you then inhale so hopefully that is a quick understanding of how that works where are those coils you might ask those coils are inside of the rubber gasket so the anatomy here is this center contact pin slides into this rubber gasket and then inside of the rubber gasket there should be two little fine wires which wrap around a wick on the outside of this rubber gasket there will be another set of two so there's two outside the rubber washer there's two wires inside the rubber washer what I believe is happening to a lot of people is that when you purchase these the cartridges unfortunately I think when the robots are putting these together at the factory the robots are putting the center contact pin back in for the final step of assembly and when they put this pin back in what I very firmly believe is this pen when they push it in there it is displacing the coil wires so that's point number two is the enter wick coil displaced and then not touching the contact pin that is the contact then this is the coil wire the coil wire wraps around a wick there should be two wicks which you won't see he should never see because if you see those then they're out of place those wicks again go through these holes they're right in the middle of these holes and this goes straight through you see that and there are two holes one two there should be two wicks inside of there nothing else if those wicks get displaced then you have problem number three so going back to problem number two is the center wick coil displaced and not touching the contact and what you would have to do is you would have to take your contact pin out like I did with my fingernails and then you would check no I don't know if you could see right there there are two little wires let me see if I could bring this closer in focus there are two little wires in there if you don't see your two wires and you only see one that means that one of them got pushed up out of place and now you only have one or maybe you like this better got pushed up out of place and there's only one wire because of the robots the evil robots now if they got displaced you can use a special tool which is use a special tool to recenter one or both of the coil wires what we don't want to do is when we're fishing in there for that wire we don't want to pull it completely out because it is not infinite length it is only this long and that long if you pull that out you're gonna pull the wick with it and then all of your fluid is going to go where into the middle air cylinder and you're gonna get a hard gurgling and you're gonna start losing a bunch of your fluid and there's no recovering that right so this is a tool from a sewing kit if you say we're threading a needle and you put this through the needle you could put your string in through that hole and then you would pull this through and it pulls the thread through the needle that's what this is from a sewing kit also - from my soldering kit I got these very very fine tweezers which are definitely going to be able to get that coil if you can get your tweezers onto them right if your coils are out of place then you're probably going to get a blinking error code when you go to hit this thing when you go to light it instead of it just lighting nice and smooth it might blink three or four times a weird color different colors and that is an error code letting you know that there's something wrong from the inner workings of your cartridge the electricity is not flowing properly do not pull the wires completely out or your oil will leak you might be missing a wire due to a manufacturer defect and if that's the case maybe go back to your local store and then say hey I think that there's a problem here I'm missing my center coil my manye for my bat my cartridge isn't working so hopefully if you live in a legal state you can go back to your store and you can get that replaced otherwise you might be out of luck and if you are out of luck in that instance then you might have to transfer your oil to a working cartridge like an empty one and empty working or non leaking cartridge so I always suggest keep these around when you're done with them when they're empty because if it was where if you had one that was working and you have say a brand new one that isn't working you could transfer the oil from this one to this one by simply unscrewing the cap and then you can actually stack these on top of each other if you have a steady hand and my previous video I did that so you could check that out you could put this part on top of the similar part and they will stack and all the oils transfer down the middle and go into the cylinder of your working cartridge so let's put that back on there before any more oil leaks out so that was number two is the center with coil displaced number three are your wicks out of place and now your oils leaking so you might say well what's the wick again that is the wick right there there should be two of them a wick that is wrapped with a coil and there would be another wick inside of this coil and those are inside of there those wires travel down the bottom of this cartridge and make contact with the center cylinder and with the bottom contact pin which will make contact with your battery contact plate all right so if your Center wick is out of place you're gonna know because you're not going to be able to draw a clean fresh smooth vapor out of your cartridge it's gonna seem to be stuck and you the tell-tale sign the very real sign is you're gonna hear a gurgling a slurping gurgling and that means that inside of the middle cylinder instead of this air and vapor going through you have oil leaking into these holes because your wicks are not in the hole they've been displaced so if they've been displaced oil is gonna go in the hole and you're gonna get a gurgling so if that happens that's number three while your wicks out of place transfer your oil your liquid to a working cartridge you can go to your local smoke shop and get a little ceramic tip we can get one of these not brand specific but you can get a generic one you can transfer your oil there it might take you some time but it might be your only option if you live in a non legal state number four these are the new additions did you try and screen your pen to increase the air flow well what what happens is over time the for air flow areas become clogged and it will disrupt your air flow so all we're gonna do is instead of screwing it on all the way nice and tight I found that sometimes all you got to do is just unscrew it a little bit and that will help increase the air flow into the side holes near the bottom of threading or it may increase the possibility of the airflow is going to go through the bottom air hole right there well minus the pen or a minus the contact pen so try unscrewing and to increase your air flow number five is your cartridge just getting old and clogged this is vapor it's sticky liquid and as you continue to use your product to the point of completion residue is just going to build up in there we all know that from smoking our tobacco pipes screens need to be replaced different cleaning solutions need to be used whatever we need to do to make sure that we can get air flow and these aren't any difference so as your a cartridge getting old and clogs so what I do is I actually inhale some fire lightly through the tip and blow out the melted wax so what do I mean by that is in my with my tip here I will just inhale put my mouth on the mouthpiece there and I will very lightly very lightly just a little mouth drag like you're hitting a cigar like a little give a little kiss and get kissed that the sticky oil in there with some fire and then blow it out below that sticky oil out right let me see if I could demonstrate this so not so much came out but maybe I could do it with already took these off anyway it works just try it out if you're not hearing if you just try it if you have this off and you try to take a mouth drag off it and you don't hear clean air going through it's clogged in there and that is very easily going to be your problem if it's if it's just getting old and clogged it might be new and clogged we don't know but just inhale a little bit of fire through that tip and then below that sticky wax out it will be hard sticky wax also turn to melted sticky wax and then you can blow it out let's see also - we can use the lighter to gently melt the thread wax on the cartridge so this is the thread the threading here that might get some sticky residue so we could just melt that and then just wipe it off and you'll get something same thing - with the inside of your pen just give a little just a little quick melt and then get inside of there and clean it out there's gonna be something and that something the threading if that threading gets all gunked up here and here then you're not going to get any airflow through the bottom hole which I should probably put that back so again one if we since I'm doing this let's talk real quick about is the center quit the Senator wick quill displaced when the robots are putting these back together when they push these in there I believe that this contact pin is pushing the wire is out of place and/or just snapping them on like snapping a heart sorry about the focusing on this camera let me see if I can fix it tada all right so when this is getting pushed in at the factory I think it's snapping these off or just moving them out of place so hopefully this video helps you out I've been I've been noticing when I've been using mine as they get older simply unscrewing them a little bit helps out a lot so just unscrew it a little bit and that should increase crease your air flow and then also to use the lighter trick to get them from being clogged all right so that's that hopefully this video helped you if the previous one didn't again sorry about the focusing issues I was unaware of whatever focusing issues were happening again if you like this video just subscribe they'll help me to get paid so you don't have to donate to me but if you do want to donate that would be super dope because you know I'm a stay-at-home dad so thanks again my name is Jay have an awesome rest of your day", "3Y-JU0l7RiQ": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand video today yeah again we got actually a brand new brand that I've actually came across on ease before and I've actually you know I've wanted to review it for actually some time now again everybody this is an 18mm educational purpose podcast it's a review I don't condone the usage of these products nor I do not try to boost to sell these products and also we do not sell anything on this channel and again everything here is legal offer 18 and up at cannabis patients you guys are enormous good so today ladies and gentlemen we got a brand new brand to a review it's the old pal brand so I'm not promoting this product or anything like that this is just literally just a review I actually got this full gram $35 crazy huh we got some sativa check this out right here look there's actually some old pal this is actually from 510 which I believe is Oakland I think this is actually a local you know I think this company is actually in the bay keep that out and this is actually the cosmic sativa flavor it's a full sativa you know it has about eighty percent THC which is actually pretty [ __ ] good again everybody this is a $35 gram believe it or not I actually bought this and freaking off off ease and you guys already know man ease sometimes we kind of tax it check the [ __ ] out quick little test want to show you guys that this [ __ ] is look at that stuck for sure no hot water first hit now you lie you guys every time I take the first hit of this cartridge whoa I get laid man I feel this [ __ ] it's a sativa so usually before my morning my morning job you know I wake up take a couple puffs and I go go over to my morning driving [ __ ] you know and 9:00 I'll have one or two puffs literally just leaves me faint like I can already feel it right now I haven't even smoked today today I literally just skipped earlier today I don't really smoke just because I want to make sure I do these reviews with starting with sober but yeah look one thing I really do like about this product again I bought this off ease actually I got to 2 grams for the total price of $70 that includes taxes and delivery so I'm just like dude if this was a $35 full gram imagine if you actually go to like the legit old pal warehouse or whatever they're actually selling these and you buy you buy some stuff so I don't think I've ever seen these you know in the club but sometimes I'm like hmm that's very interesting it's a classic shareable cannabis oil cartridge this is shareable and it definitely is shareable because for the price and again a lot of people are gonna say oh it's fake it's just not no this is not fake this is I legit got this from the east service and they're for sure they're approved they're completely legal and it's not no neighborhood plug this ain't no neighborhood plug [ __ ] so it's crazy if a neighborhood plug [ __ ] is trying to sell you a [ __ ] for gram for like dirty dirty like $30 do that shit's fake as [ __ ] I smoked them before we actually reviewed up a car to do the super Lemon Haze one of my boys got with cool little fake cartridge or whatever and you got it for like pretty expensive but usually if you guys get this from like a a delivery service but it has to be legit though cuz I feel like some there are a couple like delivery services that are just not legit thought a homemade [ __ ] that could might not be healthy for you but please look I don't know if this is true or not I've heard this from a friend that's like a late punch tastes really good too um but I've heard that smoking like I guess fake cartridges or I don't even know if I even talked about but I'm pretty sure it's fake cartridges I guess there was like a youtuber like a weed youtuber some guy that made videos dude I'm pretty sure I don't know where the hell here is this drummer I don't know where it came from or I just don't I don't know but I believe in the obviously you know because it could have been fake cards but I guess like someone passed away from like smoking cartridges and I'm like dude I'm pretty sure it's not gonna be no [ __ ] cannabis you know like legal cartridges had to be some like fake [ __ ] you know I do know someone that bought like four cartridges for like the [ __ ] low and then with fake as [ __ ] dude like there was straight-up hot dog water personally me I know a lot of people that actually do like the old pal they like it because one so I don't think [ __ ] you know proof let's prove it right here look at that that should go it even has a little little sticker we are in California completely illegal dude and this [ __ ] gets you [ __ ] blasted i've only took like what like three four ribs and i'm ready list [ __ ] man but i really do i honestly everybody I appreciate everybody that our clinic everyone that's clicking on these videos man I appreciate you guys so much man because if you guys don't know I do have a main channel and I used to blog and like do pranks and all that [ __ ] back days ago days ago I used to do I gave me videos but that channel is just so mixed up with so much [ __ ] content random content that I got to the point where like I took a break and it just like dinah fell off I'm gonna try to revive it I've been trying for a while now you know but I was like you know what I'm gonna move on to something a little bit more different something a little bit you know like an educational type video if that makes sense so yeah but if you guys want to go check that [ __ ] out go down on my description it's my main channel 120 k subs you know and I actually reached 120 case subs like back like three oh [ __ ] it's gonna be almost four years ago back in like 2016 could've been I got a million right now [ __ ] up but hey [ __ ] have this for a reason right [Music] [Music] like I do appreciate everybody that's clicking on this cuz I know YouTube doesn't like cannabis videos and educational kind of this videos and [ __ ] but I do see that there's a [ __ ] large community there's a lot of people a lot of of age people that want to just watch you know like smoking videos educational cannabis videos type [ __ ] you know and I'm just like doing YouTube should just have its own little like section for that [ __ ] bro you know it's like I don't even wanna tie these videos if you guys see ads okay I'm telling guys this right now if you guys see ads on these videos it's literally [ __ ] YouTube putting videos and [ __ ] cuz first of all I'm not even [ __ ] partnered to me by the time you guys are watching this I don't think I'm ever gonna get this channel partnered honestly I'm definitely gonna be giving away a lot to like I can't really do like [ __ ] weed giveaway since I can't be like pack you know a shitty [ __ ] you know it's a places where like it might not even be like 100 it's legal but it's like you can't like [ __ ] receive it through the mail type [ __ ] you know like on some Canada [ __ ] it's like that legal [ __ ] hear in Caly it's not legal legal like it's get to the point where you just do it you could [ __ ] just smoke a blunt and a smoking area in some places you know people got bitched cuz let me smoke your cigarettes a bunch of tobacco products that [ __ ] [ __ ] kills you dude straight up it literally has a fat ID label that says this shit's gonna give you cancer and it [ __ ] stinks cuz you're [ __ ] smoking like cardboard a [ __ ] you know no offense to everybody that smokes cigarettes if you guys do your thing do what you got to do but I'm telling you right now that is a bad hat bad [ __ ] habit you know and if you guys switch over to vaping and all that vaping [ __ ] quit that [ __ ] brush it's also bad for you too bro and this cartridge probably bad for this too so I do not recommend any type of smoking but again this is for an educational purpose you know my personal review on this [ __ ] but a real [ __ ] though everybody that's watching this man you guys are first James 2nd Janet no matter man everybody like check this out we all got to go to a [ __ ] struggle like it doesn't matter if it's like the struggle is red if the struggle is blue of distress I don't even know I'm saying if the struggle is a triangle a square [ __ ] lid that made no sense that's the path you know that's for your life and [ __ ] but see if you're trying to grind you guys trying to come up be successful in all that [ __ ] I was gonna be a shitload of obstacles so when something's happening in your life that's part of it you know that's an obstacle you gotta face this [ __ ] to get to where you want to be in [ __ ] but damn it have like these crazy eyes like [ __ ] ideas and everything that I want to say on camera every time I say it I'm just look by the way follow me on Instagram I'm crunchy or go down in my description and go I don't check out all my social media I got Twitter snapchat all that stuff I'm gonna try to convince you guys to just chase your [ __ ] dreams take a jade tastes like it takes your passions like it chase your passion you know because in reality if you guys have a talent either if it's [ __ ] drawing you know [ __ ] writing us you're good at writing stories you're gonna like painting you could you're good at something Here I am not knowing how to [ __ ] explain myself but it's like if you guys have a passion or a talent or a hobby you guys are really [ __ ] good I meant pursue that [ __ ] right because I'm telling you guys right now bro you nowadays bro it's the new this is wearing mm about it be 2020 anything is [ __ ] possible that you could monetize absolutely everything bro [ __ ] what's that kid's name [ __ ] Ryan something to bear such the little kid that reviews [ __ ] toys for YouTube dude if he could do that and earn like [ __ ] close to 100 mice where he got like over 50 million dollars a year bro and income or more maybe like 40 to 50 million after taxes because if you got close to a hundred thousand then probably take like half that [ __ ] or even more um holy [ __ ] dude just from revealing choices so if this kid could review toys and become makers it's [ __ ] more more time like millions of dollars then you guys could [ __ ] monetize everything bro it's like you too bro YouTube is like the perfect way to just show off your personality show off you know your talents and [ __ ] there's a lot of people that could take pictures of cars they go they like you know fix cars or all that shade there's car channels shoes - actually I know David got kicks on in person and he has like he's like a sneaker head you know he [ __ ] he reviews sneakers he paints sneakers he customizes sneakers and [ __ ] like that and he's pretty funny he's a funny guy this dude [ __ ] made YouTube videos and then he [ __ ] all of a sudden from just showing off shoes at him making shoes and all this [ __ ] like customizing shoes and [ __ ] painting them all that [ __ ] he got into an eBay commercial true started by the way and I mean that [ __ ] just sounds like what the [ __ ] oven broke YouTube is like a [ __ ] stepping-stone to like this [ __ ] bro crazy like I'm trying to do that bro cuz I know everybody does not want to live that nine-to-five like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you know but if you guys do I'd beid obviously if you guys make like a couple you know small like six figures and [ __ ] and you guys have like a good job with like the benefits and all of the [ __ ] then I understand you know 9 to 5 is for you but exist you know you worked hard you got to where you wanted to be and [ __ ] and that's what's up you know respect honestly but then there's other people like me bro just [ __ ] hate I just don't like that nine-to-five [ __ ] and it's not that I'm lazy you know it's just that I really don't like I just find it so trying to upgrade myself trying to upgrade this this this brand you feel me so [ __ ] y'all shut the crazy-ass video don't even know how blood coughing oh [ __ ] we're reviewing this [ __ ] [ __ ] takes you great to give you guys a good taste it's kind of like piney honestly little piney walk yeah this should taste good taste like like the weed cosmic sativa

"GlxbV8OprWU": "hey you too Alex here back again with another quick video this time I got some rhythm it is Gorilla Glue number four by rhythm check out the stats let's get this bad boy open I'll let you know what I think this is a hybrid it is coming in I don't know if you see that at 70 the THC is seventy nine point four one eight and the THC a is one point two two for one or one to one for really small but it's like eighty percent THC Gorilla Glue is one of my favorite hybrids you guys probably already know that is one of my favorites all around nice little tube it comes in this is a clear tube some reason the king was having a lot of trouble focusing up close nice little rubber pieces off rhythm gorilla glue hybrid see a chart ridge very nice cartridge nice-looking co2 oil gorilla glue number four you guys know it's the real deal no we don't smoke Street carts around here gorilla glue number four by rhythm this one's got the little peach I noticed that the sativas have a little yellow swiftly line right there these does hybrid has a little peach color sweetly lime can you see the little squiggly line you can see it right there it's very nice on the pen let's give it a rip Gorilla Glue the number for co2 oil very nice nice flavor real earthy kind of tastes almost like the flower would taste if you smoked it with sweetness to it very nice I like that a lot that taste see so cartridge a little plastic mouthpiece though I don't like to really care for the plastic I do like the ceramic ones that Prime has in vero has a ceramic piece by than that $55 I paid for the half gram of the Gorilla Glue as a mouthpiece there's a little swig Li line and cartridge it says the C cell its co2 oil cheers let's get another rip mm-hmm I like that a lot nice tasting hybrid let's hope that pit does the trick I think it will I'll let me know a little bit more about what I thought down in the descriptions but yeah so far it's pretty good gorilla glue by rhythm co2 oil cartridge half gram yo peace now let me know what you guys are smoking on of course down in the comments section have a great weekend happy Saturday here in Erie peace", "f-DP35X6LaY": "so I'm curious how long does the oil within your cartridge actually last well for our 500 milligram cartridges we'd like to think of it as around 4 to 5 grams of cannabis okay for me it'll last a little less than a week but for my wife it can go a couple weeks okay and for some others it might last a month or two correct right right and - what's the shelf-life of an oil cartridge if I if I happen not to use it right away how long will it last work well with the oil there's not really a shelf-life but sometimes the cannabinoids will degrade over time whether it's with light or heat THC can turn to CBN a CBC can turn to CDL through too much light and that's not harmful but that's not exactly what people might want to have happen correct right so if you have a sativa oil that is high in CBN the CBN is going to make you sleepy which kind of goes against the sativa right and how long would that degradation take to occur it takes a good while at least a year okay so you've got you've got some time yeah it's gonna be gone before that happens and so tell me if I have a oil cartridge and/or it's on the pan or in the package how should I store it storage is probably best at room temperature and you don't want to leave it in your car you don't want to put it in the freezer or the refrigerator just a normal room temperature would be fine and if you live in a hot climate about that if you live in a hot climate it's good to be in air-conditioning if I wouldn't leave it in a car sometimes if if it's too hot in a car the oil will get so thin you're risking possibilities of it leaking got it okay well thank you so much for that answer", "OyDk3o2pDSA": "how's it going YouTube this is Alex from T vape TV in this studio with a look at the best five oil pens of 2019 of course a lot of your experience is going to depend on the oil you choose but we will be discussing the devices we're gonna take a look into why you should choose a pen and what the differences are of course the better the pen the better your experience with your cartridge and oil so without further ado let's make sure you spend your hard-earned cash the right way let's get into it the vessel adds a touch of class and

you don't want to pick one up from an unreliable company and throw your nice oil in there it's like buying a Ferrari and then putting a Ford engine in it and that's it for this one guys thank you so much for watching if you like this video be sure to tap that like button hit subscribe if you really enjoyed it if you think I missed anything or have another video you'd like to see please throw it down in the comments below until next time my name is Alex forty babe TV and for all you connoisseurs out there keep vaping [Music] you", "lZ-vfMIuGco": "[Music] welcome to truebuds tv it's your buddy jack talking distillate vapes versus live resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live resin and the distillate vapes like i said the tons of people were asking like yo bro like what's the difference man and i'm like i'm gonna make a video so here it is thank you for hanging out i'm gonna go enjoy this and if you're liking this pack or you want to grab any of the

hobby it's a lifestyle and a culture yeah this is yeah this is", "C1ocH2KMqfY": "hey everyone this is concen and today we're going to talk about a question that we get quite a bit here at vaporizer review and that is how do I clean my pen vape and there's quite a few pen vaporizers out there but we're going to stick with the three general styles we have a dry herb we have a waxy concentrate and then we have an e juice style pen vaporizer here so we're going to go over how to best clean and maintain these vaporizers we're going to start off with the dry herb style I happen to have an at most Rx here I personally not a huge fan of drier pen style vaporizers they generally don't work too great often burn a lot so what we have here is a nameless rx with a glass screen down in there covering the herbs so we're gonna take a cleaning brush I find works best for the dry herb units and just kind of go down into the chamber and do the best that you can just simply take and clean the herb right back I they're just tapping it out onto a table into an ashtray whatever you have to just kind of get the herb out of the unit and with these pen units because they have the screep of the spring that pushes down on there it can be packed a little tight in there and when it all falls out if your pen unit happens to have one of the little glass screens in it I just take that and I put it into a little bit of isopropyl alcohol just a little bit of rubbing alcohol that I have here it's glass you can drop it in there and let it soak for a little while and while that's going on I like to just continue brushing any of the loose herb out of the drier chamber what you want to be weary of with these is there's a little coil right down inside if you accidentally snag and pull on that coil becomes loose in any way you're going to end up damaging the chamber and then this thing just ain't going to work right so you want to avoid pulling on the coil down in there just gently brush mostly aim for cleaning out the sides of the sir chamber there and when that's cleaned out some people like to take just a little bit of isopropyl and q-tip very small amount because you don't want to damage it holding it upside down take it and run it along the inside around the threading area this will keep it clean and maintain it without damaging the coil in any way and that's how we suggest cleaning up the dryer type of a pen style vaporizer very simple easy to maintain you know not the best it might end up burning but that's how we would handle the dryer now we're going to take a look at the wack style vaporizer and right here I have a micro vape nano unit very discreet very portable designed for use with waxy concentrates to go ahead and clean this one basically what we're aiming to clean here is the threading on it I like the pen style vaporizers for wax that are like a threaded connection and screw on as opposed to the ellipse style that pop off I think those atomizers they come free in your pocket easily I like when it's threaded on you know you have a secure connection to both the chamber and the battery will stay together well but one of the things you face when using that is you get some pretty gunked-up threading and when it comes to cleaning a wack style vaporizer you're not really looking to clean the coil you don't want to damage that because it's no longer going to heat up the whole idea what this really is to take in a q-tip with a little bit of the isopropyl alcohol and this is more about cleaning the threading on the wax tile vaporizer cleaning the threading is going to help keep it operating smoothly because you're going to be able to easily disconnect and then reconnect the top of the chamber to where the wax goes and with these style of cartridges where they thread off right where the wax goes it can be kind of a hassle if it's stuck together you're trying to open it so frequent cleaning of the threading on the wax tile vaporizers is really all you need that's kind of the whole goal you don't want to damage the coil in any way shape or form if you damage the coil it's just not going to heat up any more so when using your tool to load the wax onto there it's my suggest and all of our suggestions here at vaporizer review that you don't scrape it across there if you end up scraping it there's a very good chance you're going to damage it so that's something you're looking to avoid when it comes to loading just try and gently get it onto there do not be scraping across the coil and when it comes to cleaning all you're aiming for is the threading just want to get all the wax off the threading so you can unthread it and rethread it very easily we're going to take a look at now would be the less the pen style units we have here and this is the one mostly for like a juice I personally don't vape a lot of ejuice myself but I like a buck-naked style when it comes to these more often than not you're just going to change out the heating cartridge here the oil tank after a few uses if you're using different flavors it's not going to be that great but if you only have one tank handy and you do want to clean it out what I suggest doing is getting another one of the oil loaders and just fill it with some warm water the style I hear has a little bit of a wick so it's going to possibly retain some of the flavor but if you take a little bit of warm water and just kind of flush it through out there that's going to help clean it up a little bit and remove some of the flavor from it without having to buy a new tank every time you want to change the flavors that you're using in there a little warm water is all it takes you don't need to really soak it too much you want to avoid getting it down the hole in the middle as well as otherwise it might leak through there so avoid getting it down the hole in the middle otherwise there's might leak through on you and that's really all you need when it comes to the pen style close it up with that on there like this with a little bit of warm water in there keep it read and just give it a little bit of a shake this will help loosen up any of the e-juice that's in there and remove some of the flavor from it and that's all you really need to do when it comes to the EG style so that's our suggestions when it comes to cleaning pen style vaporizers if you have any further questions or just want to leave any comments go ahead and leave them down at the bottom of the video and we're here to assist you alright guys Cheers", "_GXrNZZnloI": "what is up YouTube family boy vaska's here gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my videos if you got someone watch the video I posted before this one go ahead and check it out we'd really appreciate that but other than that it's Sunday more Sunday morning actually you know I'm just chillin kicking back bout it hit my dispensary maybe a cup and eight this something you know it's it's about that time you know I really want to smoke it it's kind of different when you have a when you smoke out of a cartridge and you smoke a bloody nut I mean it's way different so but before I go ahead head out you know I want to get this out of the way so here we have this lemon haze from bloom farms you know I've never had a blue farm before actually I have but it was more uh it was one of these darts I'm know if you guys had seen these before these are pretty good so I don't know if they taste exactly like the card just because at the time I didn't see no cartridges I just seen these so I don't know whether they just like I said they just came out with cartridges or whatnot but you guys let me know on that this was like it was like 38 bucks you know I couldn't pass these up they had a lot they had all kinds of flavors you know what I mean so there's those people say there's a lot of fakes and there's real [ __ ] but you know this one's definitely real I got it from the dispensary but I don't know what would be the difference between a fake or real so I cannot tell you like you know on the packaging is [ __ ] so let me know in a comment section what are you guys smoking on I'm about to pop this [ __ ] open you know I have a smoked all day so it's about that time we get the wake-and-bake going so let's go ahead and pop this [ __ ] open so the THC on this is 83 no 88 actually total cannabinoids I got to see on the back and it's pretty cool pretty cool simple packaging so we're just gonna go and take this little alright guys so we finally got the sticker open and I kind of [ __ ] it up you know kind of [ __ ] the box up a little tab ripped out so here it goes hey they got the here you got the the packaging and it looks pretty dope you not never had a bloom cartridge before and here it says today was a good day it's pretty dope packaging I'm starting to really like this we're gonna get that and all you get is like this little I'm hotter burnin like what what not to do you know what your cartridge which I'm pretty sure are you cartridge smokers know what and what not to do what your cartridge is right keep it out of the keep out of the Sun you know what that should amount and [ __ ] so here you have it cool little cab a little oh [ __ ] alright guys so we finally you have to push this and you turn it at the same time so it's kind of where you know you you gotta know what the [ __ ] you're doing with these things because it's not gonna have a hard time trying to open this [ __ ] so BAM guys this looks pretty nice you know the oil looks really really clear nice yellow gold and first of all we're just gonna go ahead and do the bubble test on it this one's a super Lemon Haze I were really big the team fan and the super Lemon Haze is like a really old school strain so I really caught my attention so that's why I kind of wanted to get it the oil is really really thick guys she does not move at all so it's it's not life resin it says triple distillate so it must be some pretty you know clean clean distillate some people say dis list not to move now you know a lot of resins a new wave well it kind of is you know there's a lot of companies coming out with live resin so I don't know I mean this still is still good you know don't get me wrong it's still good just depends what kind of distillate you guys get from so we're gonna try hit this and we're gonna see what it tastes like all right off the bat you can taste those lemons man it is really good wow that's just fire I didn't just let me give you guys a little close-up again before I smoked a [ __ ] out of this cartridge it says bloom on there and this is the SL H for super Lemon Haze on the side and you got your California sticker there which is pretty dub so we headed up connected the little magnet right here for the yoke and battery you guys need to get one of these joke cows and other monsters had it for like almost two years already you know it's still hits like if I just pull it out the Box you know so we're just gonna throw it in there and cheers guys if you got smoke along with me go ahead and do so man we're about a good fake right now Wow I'm gonna be honest with you guys this cartridge does not taste like distillate it tastes more like a it tastes like really cleaned lemons no fresh like it's just fire its [ __ ] guys I didn't really expect it to be that good you know for some distillate bloom bloom Farms are pretty far man I'm going to hit her again I'm see if I can get a bigger bigger cloud oh yeah definitely you get lemons you know Wow so if you guys you guys let me know like what's the price on these bloom cartridges some people told me to have fakes you know so I don't know whether what to tell the difference like I said but you guys have these around where you guys from what's the price on these I got him prepared for like $38 with tax so it's not as bad so you guys don't pass this up man I'm at the [ __ ] again she's pretty good you know it tastes like actual lemons like it'll taste fake or nothing like that tastes like some actual terpene and definitely one of my favorite cartridges so far from bloom farm I haven't tried I haven't tried any other ones besides this one and the GDP one the GDP one was really good as well you know it tastes like actual granddaddy but but this was pretty far guys and if you guys ever see this super Lemon Haze you guys gotta try them out you know for the price $38 well it depends on where you guys from but here where I'm from it's pretty cheating but this is California but yeah guys I'm uh gonna head out good like I said I'm go to my dispensary and picked up some weed and tied to a hot box video or something let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges and what kind of videos you guys like to see that I mean cuz I do what you guys want to see but you guys just gotta let me know in the comment section and really

let's try this again and then you can just respond in the comments what up cut up welcome to smoking legal or welcome back to smoking legal if you've been here before if you're one of my subscribers um salute to you i really really appreciate you if you are in the notification gang gang gang gang you got that notification build it up then i salute you um with both hands get it i appreciate you now what we do here is oh i'm sorry how rude am i not to introduce myself i go by the name taz and i review [ __ ] mainly hemp um and today we have a product coming from one of my favorite companies i saw this little team i saw this little team it's really a two-part review i saw this little team uh and i've used it in one of my lives and i had to crack it open for you guys in this review it's coming from one of my favorite companies which is called black tie cbd uh you may have heard of them oh oh something that doesn't mean a lot to you can mean a lot to someone else like one right there and hitting that subscribe button so what we have here today is the jupiter c cell palm power supply that was a lot and that is my rosary hitting my whiskey decanter that little ting ting bell you heard um this is the palm uh power supply it's like let's just open it up let's slide it open it doesn't make a magnify magnificent noise when you slide it open and here is what you have they put their logo on it black tie now what this is let me show you what all you get in here i'll turn it around so you can see the back side see that see that now what you have here is uh this is something that you can use for your cartridges um what i've learned about this thing is also that the battery on this when you charge it up last a lot longer than the uh your average pin you know how you usually just put it on top of your little pin uh but the battery on these last a lot longer in fact let me show you how to use it i'm gonna put that right there and i'm gonna try to open up this right here what we have here now what we have here is a little something special a little something this also comes from black tie this is the cbd delta eight vape cartridge so this is not just straight delta eight by itself it has cbd mixed with it which is my favorite way to consume my delta eight uh some people say that delta a kind of gives them a little bit of anxiety you know similar to delta nine uh but i've noticed that when it's mixed with the cbd it's tends to be a little bit smoother and less anxiety causing so this is one milligram and this is not the kid so it's just going to be the cartridge by itself and black tie again they gonna they gonna put a logo on there i do like that um it's child proof so you gotta push this little button and pull now i will say this i've never hold on oh this is the first time this is the first time that i was actually able to push that button down which makes it child proof and slide this out now this is the pineapple say it with me pineapple did that pineapple this is that pineapple this is what your cartridge looks like when you take it out see that voila good and thick good and thick lightly golden lightly golden now what you do is first you take off this little part down here at the bottom wow voila and see this right here oh [ __ ] okay so your palm power cell comes with these two little screw devices so let's get one of those out they give you two in case you lose one so what you're going to want to do is you take that put that down you screw that onto the bottom of your cartridge like so screw that onto the bottom of your cartridge like that now now you're ready to insert it into your palm which it'll just go like this see that little slot made perfect for it you put that down in there like that and it has a little bit of magnetization to it i don't even know if that's a word but it's magnetized so you put that down in there look watch this again and now it's in there will not come out or anything the next thing you got to do is just simply pull on it you just pull on it so um before i take my first pull let me say this salute to health wealth and self self love is the best love if you haven't heard the words i love you today then please please get to the closest man tell yourself self i love yourself because you can't love anyone else or expect anyone else to love you if you don't love yourself that's some serious [ __ ] my brother would say that deep little bro and i like it when they do that salute okay and this little thing is tight it's tiny and comfortable i don't know why i like this more than the pen i don't know if it's because i can grip it like that and it's wrong it's gone you know i can be you know at work stepping out on breakfast like huh what today no no no i'm listening nothing rather what's in my hand nothing i have nothing in my hand nothing at all i let the smoke out on the side like so the pineapple flavor is amazing i feel like spongebob squarepants oh my god the pineapple i thought i loved the banana excuse me yeah i thought i love the banana and i do i do love the banana don't get it twisted i do love the banana but the pineapple oh my god it tastes beautiful this is beautiful this is gorgeous i like this a lot i promise i don't know why i like this so much better than the pen but i really do and i feel like it gets more airflow excuse me what i really like about is just this little square design it's easy to just slide down in the pocket i'm good to go and like i said the battery lasts longer in these than in your average pen now when you pull on it there's a little light let me see if you can see that no you can't but anyway oh i'll show it did you see that little light that lit up when you pull that's how you know you're good to go oh my god oh huh okay now to me the effects of the delta eight for me oh if i get my breath from coffin it is a focus type feel um you i feel focused when i'm using delta a creative um i don't have that frontal lobe like blurry feeling like delta nine gives me it just gives me that focus feel and then i get the from the cbd i get the relaxation the drop in the shoulders i get the i can feel the anxiety begin to leave and then i just i it just genuinely makes me happy one million trillion percent gives me the money though i can tell you that right now uh but genuinely just a relaxed feel relaxed and focused feel and in the little palm palette i said the palm palette they used to be a phone i'm showing my age uh but in the palm power supply i really really like it now the pen gives me that feel you know it goes between the fingers so i can but it's a little heavy i don't know why because this forces you to grab it like this or like this it's just like second nature and it's just easy right i'm i've been literally going back and forth in my mind trying to decide if i like the banana or if i like the pineapple better i was so so so impressed with that banana the first time i had it i'm still impressed with it but this pineapple is so on point like i don't know how they're getting these flavors to be so on point the way they are but this pineapple it really does not taste like some artificial fake pineapple type candy type thing it literally tastes like a fresh slice of pineapple it tastes boozy like pineapple not pineapple pineapple that's what it tastes like listen uh black time i gotta give you two thumbs up again man i gotta give you two thumbs up i've tried the banana delta eight i've tried the delta eight card that just had um it was not flavored at all it was just mixed with cbd and it was not flavored and now i'm trying the pineapple and you guys have not let me down yet man and i'm just i i'm sold on the on the palm power supply it's a must so far black tie is my favorite place to get my delta eight and i'm gonna tell you why it's the only place i've gotten delta eight and i trust them as a company that's why i go to them i know it's not gonna be no bs product and sometimes things can you know you get let down so when i want certain things i go to specific companies because i know i'm not going to be let down and this is one of man shout out to aka mr copius i appreciate you and shout out to you guys the pineapple is definitely worth checking out this little contraption this pawn power supply it's definitely definitely a win for me um thank you guys for stopping through as i like to say on smoking legal keep it positive we'll keep it pushing get it keep it positive or keep it pushing if you have any questions for me uh ask them down in the comments if you know anything about the channel then you know i try to take time out every single day it's actually part of my morning routine i drink my coffee and i go through the comments when i get in the bed i go through the comments and answer questions and just respond to people because yeah my people it is so salute to health wealth and self i like you", "BOUWQvtjvTs": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to weights the marijuana review show where we help you find folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a cartridge here on wheats a good old-fashioned 510 cartridge i've got my trusty battery here nice and plain and then the product we're actually reviewing which is napalm we are reviewing uh our first cartridge anything from the folks at napalm uh and this happens to be their napalm o g um strain so both the company is napalm and the strain is napalm og that we are taking a look at uh so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach it is 43 dollars for a gram uh which is um about average maybe a little bit cheaper than average uh at this dispensary that i um pick up from um so uh you know keep that in mind with the review 43 bucks uh for a lot of people i know is very cheap for a one gram cartridge but not so much here in long beach um as i said standard 510 so this is no special pod nothing different or weird your normal twisty battery is going to work here uh so i don't know a lot about napalm i know this dispensaries had them for a while i couldn't really find a whole lot of online presence for them outside of listings didn't see a lot but let's go ahead and get this open um and on the back before we really get started here let's go ahead and take a look at the lab testing results if it'll focus up there um there we go uh looks like it's coming in at about 75 thc or so uh which is about average for a cartridge maybe on the slightly lower end but um which is you know maybe commiserate with the price so uh now we know our laptop results we got about our 75 thc let's figure out how we open this somewhat elaborate looking packaging here there are a lot of flaps on it that's glued pretty tight oh we've got a little um authentic holographic sticker here i'm not really sure what they think that putting a sticker that just says authentic on it is going to try to solve but you know i assume anybody can buy that sticker but maybe some psychological assurance uh let's rip that effing sticker off there we go pull it out voila here we are here is our one gram napalm cartridge ooh that is a very different design uh this is not uh this is totally unique never seen anything quite like this i'm not even sure what material this is maybe aluminum some kind of metal here on the tip the oil actually looks pretty good there gold rich um yeah it looks way better than i thought and i'm curious about this cartridge design it's just got the one big intake hole there better than that pretty standard looking heating element all that stuff so let's go ahead and plug it into our 510 thread here and give our napalm og from napalm a try here we go oh wow okay um that is a very different tasting uh strain than i am used to uh it is very extremely piney piney a little slightly bitter earthy um not bad just um a lot more uh aromatic than i guess i was expecting it's quite tasteful uh there's there's a lot going on there um and even pretty robust like bittery aftertaste i'm not usually a huge fan of bitter uh it's not terrible here it's that very earthy kind of bitter taste not sure i love the cartridge design kind of hard to get your like mouth around it it's very short little mouthpiece here uh you know most cartridges have a much longer sorry for the juvenile humor or uh images uh you know much larger place to put your lips and all that uh this is very small it's it's can make it tough to draw from it is unique wow yeah that is just extremely um terpeney there is just a lot of piney earthy bittery taste to it uh i usually like a lot of flavor this one uh i'm not gonna necessarily say it's bad i don't i actually don't think that it is it's just not the kind of strains that i normally go for um and this one is just heavy on the terpenes wow um the cartridge design again a little weird uh the draws are fine i'm getting draws okay but it's hard to sort of get a good seal but in terms of potency no problem saying this is 75 i've taken quite a few draws here feeling the effects quite strong um in terms of the that being the most important aspect is it really going to get you high uh that seems to definitely be true i think this is pretty good oil it's just um you're gonna if you're gonna go for this napalm og you better like the piney earthy tastes of the strains um because this one has it in spades yeah i'm just uh uh so far i would say i have mixed feelings about my napalm og experience let's get another one in here nice hit smooth um you saw i drew for a while excelled for a while and i'm not hacking a lung up which is a good sign um but again that taste is very strong wow uh so uh right now i'm kind of um up in the air about our napalm og experience uh i would say if you really like the napalm as a strain maybe give this a consideration me i'm gonna uh finish off this gram i'm uh looking forward to it actually it's it's a bit of a different strain for me but a bit of a different experience can lead to some fun new uh experiences let's hope maybe who knows um it is different napalm og um let's give it a little bit of a wait and see i'm gonna finish off this gram and then like all our wheat's reviews i'll come back to you guys in the i don't know five days or so it'll take to get through this and i'll let you know exactly what i think of this whole experience i am a little worried about this cartridge design it seems like it might get clogged really easily with this very shallow hole um and there's not like a lot of plastic or anything sort of protecting stuff going in so uh i could imagine this novel cart design having some issues but we shall see it'll take me a couple days to get through it i'll be right back here to let you guys know exactly what i think when we finish this napalm og in just a few days until then stay high stay healthy see you right back here bye guys [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about four days a little over four days since we started our journey with napalm and their strain napalm og uh just a little bit left there so i could have one or two more hits to share with you guys like this one here and well i gotta tell you my thoughts experiences really haven't changed much in four days um i didn't hate it there's nothing fundamentally wrong with it it's just not my favorite cartridge not what i'm gonna go back to um primarily what i found distasteful was the taste um that sort of acrid vaguely burnty piney earthy taste of the napalm uh it just wore on me i never sort of grew accustomed to it as a matter of fact the more i did it the more i kind of didn't want to do it um kind of even had to make myself get to this point to finish this one off i would have moved on to something else um it's not that the oil is bad it feels like the 75 percent as listed it's just not the highest quality the cart design is also so top-heavy i mean most cards are top-heavy by design but this one with this like heavy aluminum tip it's just so hard to keep it balanced um and also if you keep it in your pocket it's guaranteed it's going to turn upside down on itself and it's got that shallow intake hole which got clogged on me more than once had to clean it out it's just not the best experience it's certainly not the worst experience uh you know it's somewhere in that middle of the road and at 43 dollars it's cheap but it isn't the cheapest um and i have had even cheaper cartridges that i have had that i've enjoyed more so i can't give this one a big thumbs up i'm not even sure i can give this one a tepid recommendation uh i do think that there is better stuff out there for you um i may in the future try to review one of napalm's other strains they're not napalm og itself and see if maybe i have better luck uh but that's only if you guys are really curious otherwise there's plenty out there to review we'll take a look at those and we'll take a look at those on our next review whenever that is sometime in our near future i hope you guys will join us for that one until then stay high stay healthy and we'll see you then docs", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's

recreational cannabis market we got this from City cannabis Cove in Vancouver they're legal recreational dispensary this vapour cartridge cost about $80 $70 and about $10 and taxes but after January 1st taxes on vaporizer products are going up to 20% these are new products and they were just introduced but the price point on them right now is just not making any sense this is a point three gram cartridge it cost $80 I could get a full spectrum extract saw scar on the black market for 25 bucks these are brand new they were just released as a part of the next wave of legalization known as legalization 2.0 the introduction of extracts and edibles these are the first offerings they came out around Christmas box has a strained name on their says one 510 indica cartridge net weight point three zero gravel THC is seven hundred and thirty three point eight milligrams so seventy three point 38 percent THC point seven milligrams CVD got the government required warning label on there says frequent and prolonged use of cannabis containing THC can contribute to mental health problems over time daily or near daily use increases the risk of dependence and may bring on or worsen disorders related to anxiety and depression back it says cannabis extract intended for inhalation contact information do not freeze or in a dry place or stored to keep upright no expiry date has been determined key vote of reach of children contains the equivalent of 1.2 grams of dried cannabis and has a packaging date on your tenth month of 2019 on the 21st day as you can see four point three cartridge it comes in quite a big package childproof to open it you're gonna break the tax stamp on the side you're gonna open the top flap of the box you're gonna press the two buttons in on the side pull it oh and there's your cartridge right out of the box it's a small cartridge 0.3 car it's got stickers on it this isn't a custom car it looks like a cheap car nazi so no particular brand i can see these being mimicked on the black market nothing to indicate that this actually came from a licensed producer lastik mouthpiece cut a glass body which is good ceramic coils 510 threading so it will fit on most standard vaporizer batteries the oil looks pretty clear which is good kind of hard to [ __ ] up cannabis oil about the oil is nice and clear golden which is a good sign seen some darker oils on the website but a smooth vapor very bland taste there's a bit of flavor but it's very bland time to get the hint of Kush smooth on the throw pretty underwhelming but I buy these for my personal use no I absolutely prefer my full-spectrum extract cards from the black market over these and really no comparison $80 for 0.3 gram cartridge $25 for 0.5 full-spectrum soft card for these legal products and dispensaries were brought in to try to eliminate the black market prices like $80 per point 3 gram cartridge I don't think that's gonna work to eliminate the black market I don't know if the recreational market will ever be able to catch up to the black market with prices and products like these the products are 100% inferior to what's available on the black market prior to legalization a product like this would cost you about 35 the pros of this product its legal the oil tastes clean it's a co2 oil so there's no additives or dilute and it's not a ceramic coil blast body which is good oils nice and clear and golden pecans it's expensive I'll go through one of these bow every 2 or 3 days I would never be able to afford to use these it's a cheap generic car super easy to mimic they only have stickers on there nobody wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and a cart from the black market it's a point three milligram very small I didn't see any one gram cartridges available yet only 1/2 milligrams of 0.3 milligram the only way I would be able to recommend this product to somebody is if they absolutely refuse to purchase off the black mark like an old granny or something like that if they were looking for a vaporizer pen die I could recommend this product to them it's not great but it's not horrible it's not dirty it's actually probably the best product I have tried on the legal market I've tried the pre-rolls I've tried some of the buds and they were horrible this product is actually tolerable I was to give it a rating out of 10 I would give it a 4.5 absolutely underwhelming it's not amazing by any means better than I expected me personally I'll be sticking to what I know but for you guys I'll be continuing to do some reviews on legal cannabis products so stay tuned like share subscribe my name's be green thanks for watching peace", "_Zl3JFrkz2Q": "[Music] hi my name is Peter I'm with air vapor systems and we help businesses select source fill and ultimately find packaging for plant-based essential oil vaporizer pans so today we're gonna address a question that has been coming up for one of our new product lines what is C cell C cell very simply put is probably one of the most disruptive technologies to hit the vaporizer pen space in quite a while what C cell is is actually ceramic coil technology it is based around a ceramic coil that has been specially designed to absorb and vaporize plant-based essential oils at a high rate producing large clouds of vapor a lot of flavor and a really intensified user experience now how does C cell do this how does what makes C cells so special makes it so important and how exactly does it accomplish this kind of disruptive performance well C cell has a ceramic corn rather than a fabric wick based core what that means is that it's able to vaporize much higher viscosity essential oils without any problems and what it does is it pairs this coil with a high performance battery this is a high discharge lithium-ion battery that allows the coil to heat up quicker then most other coils do thus producing much bigger clouds of vapor upon exhale what this does is this provides two huge benefits for businesses who are looking to engage the C cell platform for their own use number one it provides a very standout user experience meaning that when you place your essential oils into a C cell your users are gonna notice they're gonna notice that the vapor clouds that they're producing are much bigger the hits they're taking is much bigger and to follow on the heels of that the second huge benefit for businesses looking to engage the C cell platform is the rate of consumption of the oil meaning that once you put your oil into a C cell cartridge it's gonna get consumed by the user at one point five to two times quicker than in a normal vaporizer pen this is because C cell has designed their entire pen for optimum performance I really like to compare C cell to a Ferrari and most other normal vaporizer pens to a Honda there's nothing wrong with a Honda I have a Honda love Honda but Honda is meant to be efficient and it's meant to be friendly to the normal everyday consumer but if you're looking for performance if you're looking for really high performance you're not gonna buy a Honda you're more than likely gonna buy a Ferrari right if you have the money for it Wow what makes a Ferrari special well a Ferrari is built from the ground up to be for for performance right everything from the tires to the suspension to the chassis to even the seat that the driver sits in is all made for performance that is what makes C self special everything on the C cell platform is designed for performance it basically allows you to vaporize your oils evenly without burning them while also pairing that with a high discharged battery that delivers more power thus allowing you to have larger hits so C cell from the ground up is designed for performance in a way that normal vaporizer pens cannot match so let's begin by taking a look at the entire C cell lineup before we drill down into the individual components of this lineup so that you as a user or as a brand are familiar with the C cell platform as you engage in it now it's worth noting that C cell likes to keep its lineup very sleek and minimalist there's only about five different C sell products however with a combination of different material finishes as well as branding options there's really a lot of ways that you can begin to express your brand through C cell now to start here on the cartridge side of things Cecil offers two different cartridges their first cartridge is called the th2 cartridge it is we refer to it internally as the c2 cartridge so when you call us and ask for this cartridge you can refer to it as either the th 2 or the C 2 cartridge however it is a glass cartridge with a ceramic tip onto it and this is really CISOs flagship cartridge when the user puts their lip on the their lips on the ceramic tip they instantly notice the quality and how this is a much heavier as well as better built cartridge than they may have be used to engaging with and what it does is it really makes any plant-based essential oil that's placed into this cartridge stand out from the pack now if you want to have that same sort of performance in a more cost effective packaging Cecil offer also offers the m60 which we refer to internally as the c6 but also available in a half gram as well as a 1 gram size but the entire body is made of plastic so that is a plastic body as well as a plastic mouthpiece even though this provides a slower price you still get a hundred percent of the performance because it has the patented C sell coil technology on the inside so there is no difference in performance between the glass cartridge or the plastic cartridge just a difference in material finish as well as cost now let's move on to the batteries very quickly you have two types of batteries for C so both of which are Auto and Hale batteries it means that they are not button activated see cell likes to have a user interface again very Apple like that is very easy to use and easy for a customer to learn to you so with both of these batteries once you put your cartridge on it you simply inhale in it that battery will automatically activate now first is the m3 battery which we refer to as just the C cell battery internally when you take this battery and you connect it to AC cell cartridge you end up with a very ecig like appearance that allows for a lot of description of discretion without any loss in performance this is a 350 mAh battery which means that it will last the typical user about a week before they have to recharge it now the newest battery to the C cell lineup is actually the palm battery here and this is a very interesting battery this actually has a drop-in design with a magnetic connector which means that you can drop in your cartridge and it won't fall out even though you don't have to screw anything in it allows the user to then also place it in the palm of their hand for maximum discretion while they're using it so that no one can see really what they're inhaling and this is a great option if you are really trying to express maximum discretion through your brand or for your users now lastly here we have the C cell disposable pen this is really the penultimate in terms of ease of use there's nothing to recharge there's nothing to refill you simply place your oil inside this disposable pen use it until it doesn't work anymore and then you throw it away and buy another so if either you as a user or as a brand you're choosing to engage this platform just know that if you really want to be able to convert users or provide an experience that it's extremely easy the disposal pen is the way to go because there's just no it's it's basically a proof there's no way to mess this up there's no way to not recharge it correctly or not fill it correctly so that is the entire C cell lineup let's drill down into each of these products individually so that you can learn a little bit more about the finishing and custom branding options available [Music] you", "uv2qrTaKd3o": "hi it's mattad Rafal studios and welcome to our review of the heavy hitters prefilled cannabis concentrate vaporizer pens [Music] we're going to be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you

saga talking about bakes and carts today Dan in particular wants to be on this show we're about to bring Nick on the show dan was like I got a lot to say here so we got a bunch of options we want to show you some creative options Dan anything before we kick this off let's jump right into it I love it alright and good so take it away okay original a sliding box kit you've seen that at the trade shows some people go up to make the traitors like I would never use that that is so different from my branding yes we customized things it's not for you it's all about what you're about this is another one that is very popular it's our that was one of our first products that people really fell in love with they're like wow I see how this is different I see how this is better that's out there it's a nice texture paper on the bottom and a soft touch paper with a black hot stamp on the top all right they're board insert in this one let's keep it let's keep it rolling rapid fire because we get a lot to go through this is a less expensive option it's our blister fold or I don't have one that's open but this is one long piece and the blister pops in and you fold it tapes together and you can customize it any way you want we can use all of our foils spot UV any kind of coloration you want or a nice textured paper if you want to go that route less expensive way that you could still make very customizable and look great so it's going to say is you have adhesive on that so you don't need any heat sealing equipment and that's something that a lot of people have liked about that concept all right customizable blisters is another two piece box it just has a nice angle to it so it has the colorful feel there and inside we have an Eevee a foam insert which is a dense foam it's a soft touch of varnish on it as well that's just a wood pattern that we printed it still has that you know luxe natural look folding box but it's on a foil printed on foil board so it has a nice shimmer to it a little more bling a lot of people they're looking at the cosmetic market as what their cannabis brands are about and I think it's good but I want to make a point that I think people should still because a lot of people are thinking that way make sure you still maintain your unique angle so don't go cookie cutter try to think of how you're going to be separate from other people who are thinking in this cosmetic mindset a lot of people are using the vault box for their cartridges this one doesn't have an insert the vault box exclusive to contempo specialty packaging yes patent pending patent pending child resistant certified trademark trademark the two began which we shown in our pre-roll show pr\u00e9val show but also another option so the dates this is a non contempo product but we want to show it because it looks great we have a pattern on the outside which matches the products on the inside I think that would be awesome with the disposable pen where you match the pattern on the pen custom pen match the pattern to the box like the Kate Spade pen so sometimes you can get inspired from other industries and do the same thing and get the same advantages that those people did but this is another paper product through peaceful signing box the feedback has been and I quote outstanding on that box and the texture in the field this is not a contempo product but we think it looks really nice it's a textured paper on the bottom on the top and it's a very simple on folding box good job it's not super sturdy but it still looks really nice and they have a folding board insert inside really cool of that contrasting look so you can have you know one look where everything's really uniform everything's really clean or you can have really nice contrasting you can see the color contrast the craft versus the board and then you can see the embossing contrast that they've done here really really cool look and again they've done it well so you can go with either of those and I think they've done a nice job on that and the reveal of this icon as you open it is also a really nice touch yeah so bloom farms has outstanding branding outstanding packaging this is a good example of how you can make something as simple as a folding box and still be able to charge a premium price for it and compete in that premium market so this is a $70 product here so this is a reusable vape pen along with the charger so again really good job here and using some nice craft board materials dressing it up a bit with your branding the branding does in fact match the pen that was included in the Box done a good job I think of also matching this story that they're telling like we talked about the Instagram feeds the social media campaign that the provide they live and really having that match up with the packaging of the story they're telling in the stores good company good things and just a couple of different options that you can use to put the actual product in this is a vac form in here which is molded plastic that we would mold specifically around your product for a perfect fit and this is a board insert much like that Bloomfield box the board just folds in to create the cavity and then of course we have the EBA foam these are not see our boxes nor was the bloom farmer one so it states that demand CR on the primary packaging that's not going to work in many states the exit bag is still sufficient until a certain point in time that's been marked so just keep that in mind that we're well aware of all the CR laws and we're showing you options because it's currently available and once the primary packaging is required to be CR probably won't be seeing these things from us but the wallbox is still a perfect option solves all the problems all the world's problems are next looking sharp in that suit you're coming on the next episode of hope you know that oh yeah of course all right good all right anything else you guys want to add live studio audience Manny you gotta need to say guys thanks for watching see on the next episode", "vbaXWabINVE": "you too what is your boys here and we have the gelato one gram cartridge from Alera

the right side of his body's not", "Iv_gPNVA4Os": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is my top five cartridges but not of 2020 to start off 2021 because [ __ ] 2020 i don't even want to care about that [ __ ] anymore you know so i titled this the top five cartridges to start 2021 with before i start this video any further let's take a [ __ ] hit i got this bougie on a budget cart i i was just fresh off doing that video so i may look pretty [ __ ] high because i am but let's take a [ __ ] another hit here cheers and i might i say that this is a sleeper cartridge i just found out about this not too long ago i just bought it a few days ago and tried it today uh it's not going to be on the list but definitely an honorable mention like this is the only strain i've tried that's why i like i don't really want to like put it in the top five because i had my top five already set uh before making this video but this cartridge man this is this should definitely get some praise for what the price is and for what the quality is bougie on a budget um but i digress let's get started so uh let's just get done with the honorable mentions first uh we got raw garden i know a lot of people don't consider it live resin but i still do because it has the live resin terps which is what makes live resin live resin right the terps the initial terpenes from actually freezing the plants and all that stuff but they give the higher percentage of thc that comes with distillate as well so it's kind of like the best of both worlds but that is an honorable mention also i would say maybe select i've tried a few of them i've tried one personally myself that i bought and it was pretty good uh just it was all right uh you know nothing to really that blew my mind but i've tried another one from flynn it was pretty good you know um but let's get on to it we got number five we got buddies and i wouldn't be like mad if it was a little bit higher on the list because buddies has just been the brand of the year for me but in terms of cartridges i have to put it there because they do seem to like okay well first before i start getting into the list i should mention the things that i consider when it comes to cartridges is the hardware itself the oil the vapor production uh the price not so much because that's all based on location and you know buddies for me is cheap and sometimes it's cheap for other people too but it's more expensive for other people too so price even though i consider that one of the most important factors i won't consider it for the sake of this video um and also i'd like to mention that this is my [ __ ] list right so it's just me you know i'm not the cartridge god or some [ __ ] you know it's just some guy on the internet okay so like if i don't have a certain brand or whatever cartridge in your in the list like there's no reason to get upset put your opinions down below your top five and let's get started buddies brand of the year for me but uh unfortunately they just seem to really run out quick you know but they're priced so good but like i said price in this list doesn't really uh for the sake of this this video isn't really uh as important but yes buddies is there it has that cdt cartridges it has the live resin cartridges and they have a lot of strains to this day they have a lot of strains you know and to this day peach flambe upside down cake and orange eight are [ __ ] just phenomenal the green box ones just great uh and then we got coming in at four and uh three and four can be switched i mean actually no okay no it's a clear cut so four would be nug just enjoyable it's everything you would get from a green box buddies uh just last a lot longer than buddies buddy seems for me it just lasts like two or three days you know and uh i don't know it's just i don't know but nug just enjoyable i've tried a few of their stuff i think i've tried like three i don't have these cartridges on me but i will put videos on the screen as i'm talking about them because i've tried them and uh yeah nug was uh enjoyable cartridge lasted really really long compared to buddies and just the taste was phenomenal the live resin was true to the train uh but yes that will be number four number three uh like i said uh initially that i wouldn't be mad if you switched three and four is the jetties extracts their unrefined live resin just hit you can take a look at the classiest way to smoke a cartridge video or use a cartridge video money and me were just surprised at the wedding cake that i got from them it was just fat hits tasty phenomenal hits and this [ __ ] got me faded so uh yes coming in at three will be jenny's extracts and uh number two and number one can also be switched but based on just you know people being in the game longer than the other one you know i'll just i'll leave number one as it is and but for number two is alpine and uh i mean uh say what you want about it being a new live resident into the market they initially did you know this lit and other stuff it's fire like they have a ceramic car as well it's [ __ ] phenomenal the phenomenal taste it's true to the strain as well and it's just an all-around tasty experience the ceramic heart really makes it a difference when it comes to the taste and uh obviously you know the variety of whatever voltage used to uh changes the taste as well but they recommend it maybe 2 to 2.6 i would say but yes alpine live resin second in my book let's just take a hit before i reveal number one but i'm sure you guys still know what number one is i mean it's on my old list right so cheers good stuff number one is urza to this day urza has been established as the number one you know they're the first ones to really just come through with that ceramic i could be wrong but to my knowledge they had the ceramic cards uh i know walks has it now i haven't tried walks but i've heard walks and urza are like kind of the same company so um but yeah urzah to this day had just the most dab like experience from a cartridge the taste was there the smoothness of the hit was there you know a low temp dab obviously and it was just all around a great experience you know got me high um and yeah it was just it was just good they did have a few hiccups you know they had to switch back to the non-ceramic hearts but uh i think they're uh using dental grade ceramic now so all everything is good but yes there you have it for my list i know you guys have been waiting for this and it's been a long time overdue you know so i will take one lasting hit before i end this video let me know your opinions down below on my list and give me your list as well you know you know if you want to put mario karts in there and all that stuff for jokes as well because i know that's going to happen as well so cheers so oh okay all right there you go peace out guys [Music] you", "ZIPLMpaH-JI": "want to do like some I've not just I don't know if you guys I'm pretty sure you guys have had select cartridges before I've no they were just me if I'm just tripping but honestly like to meet all of these cartridges they kind of taste us safe so yeah they kind of have like a strong hashey taste to it some of them's up so I have I got this one for like around $35 here to attack so it's a citrus SAP you know I grabbed the citrus top because it sound like I had it you know it was like fruity so we're gonna see we're gonna see how what it tastes like you know if it's like really fruity or is it just hashey you know like the rest of them so let me know if you guys know too you know like I'm talking about if you guys have select cartridges before if they have that strong agitation or let me know so the total carnival noises 87% you know it's been a while since I don't select you know these I used to [ __ ] with select heavy I used to get one of these a lot no every week Gracie [ __ ] would select so and I don't know where I just you know like I expanded I started trying new things you don't [ __ ] it when your cartridges so I mean don't get me wrong these are pretty far you know they're still good the quality of all it was pretty good so I had done this for like 35 bucks you guys want to see the back full grams so so yeah let me know what you guys doing on this Sunday afternoon I'm just kicking back you know I'm trying to get this Vito before it gets darker so you go ahead and put the button push the pushing the button but let me know if you guys [ __ ] with these stuff you guys you know these stone you guys this list some people say no some people say yeah but I don't really care you know these cartridges are still pretty good so you gonna pop it open you're gonna get a nice little seesaw cartridge I like these right here these [ __ ] rip you know out of all the cartridges they have you know there's some different kinds and [ __ ] these are one of the ones that hit the most you know you get big clouds so you go ahead and take it out so we're gonna go try hit it I'm gonna let you guys know if it's like if it's like really fruity so this is a citrus up you know I'm gonna be doing a dad in video if you guys you guys stay tuned for that you know I already done I still need an editor and [ __ ] so I probably have like two videos uploaded at once so yes stay tuned for that so here we have the whole ever know and flip it over it's pretty nice to go you know garance looks pretty good but they could do better like in the flavor why isn't she I don't know if they Todd what's the process they do it but most of these cartridges they kind of taste the same to me so yeah guys pack on this flight 35 attacks she's not bad you know so not here in Cali do the bubble test I really appreciate my new subscribers if it wasn't for you guys you guys I wouldn't be where I'm at right now you know you guys are [ __ ] awesome I'm just trying my

gonna let hit a hitter out this battery it's just a simple you know battery to church buddy icon from the other cartridges it's pretty good you know it's a big big [ __ ] paddy and they [ __ ] rip so we're gonna enjoy hit this and we're gonna see if there's some flavors of it yeah I'm not lying to you I can't read it tastes like that strong catchy tasting this one and that's why I kind of like stop [ __ ] with select because they just have that strong hash taste to I mean it's not bad like I said but it's like I want to taste some mouths besides I want to try some fruity that's what I grabbed the citrus tabs or they don't taste like citrusy I probably I don't know probably want to stop I'll stop buying select so we're gonna hit this cheese if you got a smoke along with me go ahead and do so bring out your bongs pies whatever the [ __ ] you guys got to KI this one along with me cheers guys yeah guys it tastes it tastes clean it tastes good but it tastes like exactly like the other cartridge I had a gun like two weeks ago exactly like yeah I hope you guys got to fill me on this one I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm talking about if you guys [ __ ] with select most of them they just taste the same like this one it tastes good I'll get it wrong you got some nice clean taste to it can't want to describe it but it's just like the profile that the terpene profile is not there I don't know man but don't get me wrong these are pretty good I really like them a lot so but I probably will not be getting so many more this probably gonna be the last gram I get in a while so so yeah I probably just stick to like rock gardens and I'm know if you guys heard of bear labs I probably get like a half gram with some bear labs or I don't know this just I'm not grabbing the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things but sometimes it's just I run out of options you know but that likes Dizzy's they have plug plays I have a whole bunch of [ __ ] you know so you guys just let me know like on the comment section what kind of cartridges you guys would like to see in the future and yeah if you guys like hot box of videos you know I haven't done one yet but I will soon I'm I just haven't got the time yet so I'll probably do that tomorrow you know get out of work something and yeah guys I'm going to hit this again for you guys well yeah these cartridges right here they [ __ ] rip these see Stiles right here with the c-23 these are like one of the best cartoons you guys can have oil in because they [ __ ] [ __ ] but oil goes too quick so the high on these cartridges they're pretty good don't get me wrong you get I'm like you know you feel like the quick buzz like after like two big hits you feel like a good buzz off him this was a hybrid this one's a hybrid so you know you get the boat effects you get the indica sativa so it's a pretty good it's a pretty good cartridge guys and I'm gonna have to shut again one more time before I cut the video short oh my god flip it over after ripping the [ __ ] out of it it's to hold its thickness there so it's pretty good quality but just the taste it has that strong hash to taste to it it tastes like some of the cartridges that were made when the cartridges were first [ __ ] you know came out like the oil like just straight hash you know with no [ __ ] terpenes in there but it's still clean and still good and I really like to select so I don't know guys it's probably like the last car I don't know yet let me know what you guys think in the comments section if you guys [ __ ] with select I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm talking about so you guys let me know in a comment section if you guys like these or not so or which or which ones you guys have favorite flavor and let me know in the comments section I would I'm just curious mind guys hope you guys having a really good day and stay blessed cheers guys peace", "3nzBKv2rkIY": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] I'd stay

"5i3k1qBtUZ4": "[Music] hey everyone dr. Shawn here I hope everyone is well and staying safe amid this whole Cove at nineteen pandemic hope everyone's doing their part practicing social distancing we're trying to flatten this curve and anyone who's using cannabis to just get them through these unsettling times or medicinally I hope you've got plenty of stock today I'm reviewing the Aurora drift vape cartridge and that's for the 510 thread system so this is a THC indica blend it retails for thirty four ninety five on the ontario canada store so a good price that's a lower on the lower end of price points for vape cartridges it has seventy six point nine two seventy s sorry let me correct that sixty seven point nine two seventy six point five percent THC so this is a strong two very strong THC level and there's zero to one percent CVD so negligible CBD in this one it's an indica dominant strain and the terpene profile includes Mersin pining and this one I have trouble pronouncing it's spelled GU a IOL GU al if anyone knows how to properly pronounce that please leave that in the comment section so my experience with this vape cartridge is first of all I like the price because it's relatively cheap the vape itself like the vape quality is smooth it's not harsh and flavor-wise you know nothing outstanding about the flavor it kind of just tastes like most of the other oils that you would find out there there's nothing you know specific I could pinpoint about the flavor of this one the effects come pretty soon after vaping and the effects are very one-dimensional like definitely doesn't have the full-body effect that I have experienced with the Zen Berry cartridge that I reviewed previously it's more just kind of a it's a little it's relaxing but it's very sort of stays in one place like it's really just in the head I don't really feel this throughout my body and it doesn't have like a very it doesn't pack a big punch it's kind of just in the background if that makes any sense so you know you're gonna get a little bit of a relaxing comma feck from this one but in terms of like a multi-dimensional type of effect you're really not going to get it from this this oil so that being said you know taking into consideration the price the experience the flavor I'm going to give this one a 5 out of 10 price is right you will get you know a bit of a relaxing response to this but it's in no way close to some of the other more encompassing oils that I've tried so that's the Aurora drift vape cartridge if you like these reviews please subscribe leave comments and I'll be back with another review shortly", "uWELXO1__xI": "what's good guys um good to see you again sorry to take a little break i was going pretty hard need a week to just chill but anyways i got a special review today we're going to be going over a 10 cartridge versus a 50 cartridge i know a lot of people they just want to they just want to get high they just want to get high really quick discreetly um and for cheap which is understandable that's why these 10 cards used to be really popular back in the day i was even hooked on these 10 cards for a while just because it's it's it's cheap it's cheap cheap to get high but that has changed now i don't cheaply intoxicate myself i smoke the very [ __ ] best best that i can find so first off let's give it a look it has this um kind of like iron type titanium look to it some ridges um looks cool distal it's flat not moving let's get a little puffer nothing to really complain about i mean ooh this is something to complain about cannabis extracted with butane so i don't know how many uh ppms is in here i don't know how many parts per million uh is left over of butane in this in this cartridge but that would turn me away and that's probably one of the reasons i don't buy these i didn't actually know it was extracted with butane but now i do but yeah now we got uh some dab logic um that tasted okay there wasn't really too many complaints about it it's not like i full on tasted butane dab logic nice little uh laser laser print around this um it looks like it's natives or aztecs or something has dab logic written across the bottom take this off and snap this on now right off the bat i can it can automatically taste a more it's a more natural taste uh you're not gonna be really be able to tell maybe if you're like you know not used to knowing what quality tastes like if i were just a noob coming in here these would both taste very very similar it's not like you can taste heavy butane in that or anything it's just me knowing that this was processed with butane what turns me away but that's you know it's ten dollars worth of butane now what makes these so different why is this ten dollars why is this fifty dollars a big part of this is gonna be extraction these guys oil they're in the market for wholesale they make most of their money off distributing large quantities to dispensaries they're targeting the market that you know is wanting to and toxic intoxicate themselves for a lot cheaper now these guys these guys are marketing more towards the connoisseurs uh this extraction this was not extracted with butane uh there's a process i'm not too sure how it goes down or how they get it into cartridges but i know there's lots of ways to uh extract and get solventless you can do a fresh chop wash that in a bucket of ice water extract those tricoms in a ice hash then press that and then here comes your rosin i don't know how they liquefy it or what consistency and uh temperatures they do to get it to this consistency in this cartridge but they do and it works so what you're mainly paying for right here and why this is so so much more expensive is that is that when people are washing this and uh when they're extracting uh from this method you yield also a lot less from just blasting a can of butane through a whole bunch of weed this process you actually your yield is a lot smaller um but you have a higher quality so that's where the 50 dollar price mark come from but you know a lot of people really don't care but a lot of people do care and this is this is the main differences sorry you can't see the table the camera's up a little too high uh but yeah anyways uh i hope you like this video i hope i covered everything um and there's like a lot more there's like a lot more there's a lot more labeled on this solvent-less solvent-less vape and for those of you that don't know solventless i had a friend ask me i've explained rosin to them but sometimes people don't remember solventless is processed without solvents like butane co2 what else do they use um that's all i can think of out of my head those are the main ways that people use to extract those are solvents this is solvent less solvent less is the way to go your lungs are going to be a lot happier your high is going to be a lot better and you might say well [ __ ] i don't want to spend 50 on a cart i'm going to stick to 10 that's ok but also you have to keep in mind this is going to pack a harder punch because it's way more purity in this than that other cartridge i didn't mean to be a dick i shouldn't do that i'll [ __ ] it uh but anyways i don't even know where it went it wasn't too far anyways it doesn't matter but yeah those are the main differences a 50 card versus a 10 card i know a lot of people see it in dispensaries and they're like why the [ __ ] is that cart fifty dollars well now you know uh glad i got to do this video a lot about to see you guys uh subscribe uh i'm gonna be doing some merch drop soon so you know stay tuned turn on those notifications uh and i'll see you guys soon uh probably my next video i'm gonna be comparing some of the weed i grew and some of the weed my friend grew and we're gonna put it up against some dispensary weed and show you why potentially home growing could be better than commercial growing that's not always the case but for 99 of industry it is um peace out guys take care let me know in the comments what other videos you want i love uh i love getting suggested new ideas because sometimes i don't know what are good ideas and i just go off top but thanks guys for watching peace out", "p-p6t4rN_og": "Hey career threaded leaf and today is Thursday so that means we've got a vape cartridge that we're gonna be tapping into this week we've got the figure citrus

first and then we're gonna tap into this vape so see you guys on the other side of the intro when we got a little bit more information and we actually start being able to try this babe you'll see on the other side [Music] welcome back you guys so start things off we've got the citrus craft vape cartridge from figure I only picked up the 0.25 grammar because that's all they have in stock at the store I definitely would have preferred half gram cartridge but the quarter gram is all we've got for today so this little sucker came in at 70 percent THC with 0.1 percent CBD and the one cool thing on here that I know it's right at the bottom it gives you the option to trace like to track your packaging with a lot number so I did do that I went into the figure website and pulled it up you can actually enter the number in there and it'll pull up all of the information and the certificate of analysis on the but it'll give you the pesticides amount like it figure gives you a huge amount of transparent information that I have not seen from any other company so huge shadow to figure for that I got a couple of packs of their pre girls that are in my golf bag as well thinking about doing a little bit of a review on those with this I definitely think I might be pulling those payrolls up and out set you guys can see what what the the tracer products looks like with those cuz I think it'd be better to do a separate video there cuz today we're gonna be reviewing this vape cartridge gel so let's go back and read off a little bit of information that they do have about the cartridges so they're in a glass chamber with a ceramic heating element to deliver a high quality vape every time the best of figure made flexible our craft cartridges are compatible with any standard 510 thread vape battery figure quality without vitamin E acetate it's available in three all-natural flavors so that being the citrus natural terpene and then the mixed berry so overall they don't have anything else for the for the citrus faith yeah and actually so we're gonna crack open this container and see what these point to five cartridges look like so let's break that seal pull this open and take our first looks of this cartridge II guess so squeezy oh that bottom ones giving me trouble today there we go just like that this is a container you have a little bit excessive but it is better than some of the other ones so first it'll look at this I really do like that mouthpiece on there that that color as well it alternates you guys can take a little bit of a better look let's see if this ooh the t-shi sticker comes off nice and easy it looks like you guys might to get you really there we go do something we'll pull a THC sticker off and give you guys a better look at the actual concentrate in the cartridge later it's got a really nice sharp orange color to it I'm really interested in trying this out so figure does use 1/2 gram cartridges but when you got a quarter of a gram in there that sucker looks half-full already huh we're gonna start off with the fire side battery I'm pretty sure yep we've got our set on the white marker so we're gonna pull this little plastic stopper off slide this on and we'll take our first looks and taste that actually looks pretty nice with that gold battery on there the gold and silver match up really well but enough talking let's actually take this skirt for it first rip see how it tastes you guys we start out on the light temp we're gonna move up to medium temperature and then the high before you slide over and do the same thing through a G pen and then I got a couple of rigs here and the hemp ER adapter we're gonna be taking a couple of rips through the rig's as well and I'll be able to give you guys an overall and just an honest opinion what I think of how this bud did their concentrate their vape whatever you want to call it but we've done enough talking you guys let's actually get into this and try it out Cheers really easy to draw through okay guys so I guess said it was really surprisingly easy to draw through this is honestly one of the best drawing cartridges that I've experienced yet Wow I was not expecting that through the first one but I'm getting a almost kind of fruit loop flavor with this with this tip and it's surprisingly it's catching me a little off-guard but all in all I'm really enjoying it you guys so we're gonna go ahead and take another taste of this at the blue temperature that medium voltage and see if it changes it at all but if it's that fruit loop flavor all the way through you guys this one's gonna do quite well I suspect Cheers so I'm not medium you get less of the citrus more of the type of cereal flavor that you get almost more of like a honey kind of flavor it's not bad by any means it's not turning me away but the lower temperatures definitely had the more citrus flavor that I was enjoying and expecting but we got the sucker cranked all the way up to the red the high temp we're gonna try it out there and see how it does at that temperature you guys Cheers does have a really nice flavor on that high temp but it definitely leans more towards that honey flavor it's got a little bit more citrus in the medium but not by much at all actually it's um definitely the low temp is the more enjoyable temp on that fire side battery but I've got the cookie G pen here we're gonna take it through there see how it tastes on this cuz I have a feeling that this G pen they're gonna push her a little bit better flavor you guys but only way to know is if we actually try it out and let's go ahead and do that Cheers definitely different flavor less of that kind of weedy cereal experience with the G pen I'm finding a lot more like gummy kind of flavor and it's it's enjoyable it's nice and light but still very enjoyable so we've bumped it up to the second temperature I want to see if it keep pushes through that way or if it ends up going more that honey route like it did through the fireside pan you guys see on the other side so it doesn't go more honey but it does subtle the citrus flavor down quite a bit it's definitely one of those baits that you want to keep tapping through on the lower temperature I'm thinking these higher temps I find you're just burning through the terpenes a lot quicker than you'd actually be able to enjoy them and that's that's a big disappointment you guys so we've got a bumped up to the highest side we're gonna take one last rip through just the Pens and see how it does on here but honestly I'm not I'm not expecting much at the higher temp you guys the lower seem to be the better flavor saver but let's go ahead and take it through its last trip from the pen Cheers yeah it definitely just goes relatively bland and it's very disappointing that way so next step is to take this sucker through some rips from the bomb so let's hope that this adapter is gonna want to work with us today get it into the rig so it stays there but well uh we'll have to see I got a bump down to the lowest temperature we're gonna start out through this little mini rig here very little water and then we'll pick it through our 420 cata box rig because that one just allows a little bit more of the perk the percolation with the showerhead perk in there or this one's just a straight down stem right into the water so let's see how this vape does on the lowest tap through here th ow okay so it had not really much flavor there I found it was really mild and a little bit disappointing but we've got the second level on the battery just taken through a rip through here and see see if it improves the taste at all you guys Cheers hmm it does get more of that wheat you taste wheat he tastes not weedy tastes but wheat he tastes and it's not bad it's still enjoyable but it's it's missing something I think but we've got to bumped up to the highest level it's taken taste through there and see see the extra temperature helps at all I don't know I guess let's uh let's try it out Cheers no nobody more we'ii taste wheat taste hey guys so we've got the other rig we're gonna go ahead and preheat the G pen this time and give it a little chance so we can really take a fat rip let's try it out y'all Cheers back at the lowest tab definitely more citrus I I'm gonna recommend this lowest temperature you guys definitely the best okay so we bump this up to the second temperature we're gonna try it out through there you guys and see see how it does but honestly I'm not expecting very much Cheers okay yes so it did have that weedy taste again that wheat II taste but we got this pen pre-charge with the hottest temp to take for a rip and see how it does you're here cheers y'all honestly my biggest fan of this cartridge you guys that was actually disappointing it it really is only one of those ones that you can set bond once or twice doesn't really hit that hard kind of lead you in a citrus direction but by no means takes a strong flavour and like hit you with it it is very disappointing that way I definitely wish it had more flavor you guys that's just gonna be honest review them I wish this had more flavor but going into the high it does have a nice light mental drift to it where lay the the back your mind is kind of loosely swinging in the wind where you can be focused on something but you've got that little voice in the back your head kind of thing and that's really what I'm finding with this where it's I'm like oh I need to get this done but [ __ ] like that right like just don't enjoy yourself kind of a kind of a high and it's it's nice I definitely do like that it's something that would be very helpful if I am golfing or am doing something that has that that focus but if something that the frustration because of the focus is there that's the better way to describe it the frustration because of the focus on the game such as golf because if you make a mistake it is frustrating especially when I'm at the point where I'm kind of that verge of a beginner intermediate I'm right on that bubble once I can roll over into the intermediate I've got more consistency that's and that's where the biggest thing now is consistency and the frustration that comes with that being inconsistent that is and that's the thing with this cartridge kind of circles back the flavor was very inconsistent it's frustrating I'm wholly gonna give it a 6 out of a 10 you guys just because the high has that enjoyment but it's not strong enough to really blow me away and give make me want to smoke that over some of the other sativa strains that I have that have that mental drift in effect and I'd rather just smoke a lighter amount of that because I enjoyed the flavor more and that's really gonna be the difference between this this cartridge getting a six or anything higher that six marker is you've got some good qualities but I've got lots of [ __ ] that I'd smoke above you and I've got lots of cartridges actually that I would smoke above this one to get this type of effects you guys but we're gonna wrap this one up I I wish it did better I really did I thought it would have citrus strains usually hit home with me I'm a big citrus that uplift I really do like that kind of flavor I just thought it would do better but it didn't end up doing that I'm a little bit disappointed we're are gonna do one more riff through this little rig because I feel like we should give it another big rip to give it a chance to try and bump it up but I really don't think I will YouTube stick around cuz after this last trip it'll be your guy's end card but for everyone else I really do hope you guys enjoyed I'll be back tomorrow with some orange cookies review from gage cannabis we got the last BC bud of the week from

later smoke on dad [Music]", "ikgVjiLBMHo": "dabbe connection here with the Cresco Dreamwalker cartridge is a sativa cartridge as you can tell live resin not co2 oil see the test batch information here inside the box it comes packaged in this little plastic tube works pretty well simple but effective packaging the cartridge itself is a pretty standard C cell cartridge with a clear plastic mouthpiece the color banding on the cartridge itself does not denote the specific strain though the strains themselves are color coded so you can tell at least whether it is sativa hybrid or indica depending on the color the color band of course it's got their little logo printed on here and I'll show you guys how it hits it's a pretty good cartridge it has a pretty decent long-lasting high however it's almost entirely flavorless to be entirely honest there's a little subtle hint of flavor but it's so little you hardly even notice it I also picked up another of their carts of a different strain and the flare was honestly indistinguishable anyways here's a hit as you can tell it it's pretty heavy as one expects from the Cecil tarts anyways they all tend to hit pretty heavy there's definitely no off flavors with it or anything like that so it's not like it has any kind of chemical aftertaste it really just doesn't taste like much of anything but the high is great and it's on the pricier end but you get a pretty large number it pops out of each cartridge so I would say overall it evens out on the price side of things this cartridge itself put me back about 50 bucks but which does put it on the pricier side of the spectrum but I've had other pricier cartridges that honestly didn't hit this well and didn't have as long-lasting a high and it was just generally one is good so overall I'd say it's a pretty well above average current so long as you're willing to spend money to get it maybe gonna find a good deal for it then I'd say jump on it and I think that about does it there in show you guys what it looks like in the big battery before we go see yeah pretty good stuff it's some pretty light distillate it's not super dark which in my experience tends to mean a cleaner hit as far as like the flavor and whether or not it really gets to your lungs but that's all I've got to say here hopefully that helps inform your decision hope you all have a great day out there", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the description make sure to share

Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "7ffGkryYVMM": "before this video starts i want to say shout out to the reddit family and if you came here from that make sure you guys leave a comment down below let's get into this [Music] yo yo what's good youtube this is two stone for you and today we're back with another 510 cartridge today we're going to be smoking on some fire og so yeah let's get into this review so this fire og 510 cartridge is by the brand hex go i picked this up on the ocs website for 3150 for a half gram of this shatter dislike whatever you want to call it and that's honestly not a bad price at all for this strain it's clocking in at 75 to 85 percent thc as you can see here our batch is 81 percent so that is actually relatively high the plant type is a hybrid you can pause the screen right here and read all the information you like this product is a co2 extraction but enough of that and let's actually get into the review when i did buy this actually i took off the duty stamp because i did intend on smoking it but then i was like wait wait wait let's make a video on this because uh you know i'm sure everyone wants to know what this cartridge is like so on the back here we have some really weird instructions on how to open it you have to put your two fingers in here like this apparently and slide this one up like that and then apparently you get your vape cartridge to come out and uh yeah holy they can even come out so there's our vape cartridge and this cardboard piece let's uh pop this out here i don't even know what i was saying there but we have those two rubber pieces here to protect the mouthpiece and the thread piece i kind of have it nice and zoomed up here right now but as you can see we have our thc logo and that nice blue hexo logo unfortunately there is nowhere on this cartridge that is saying there's fire og which is not a bad thing but i tend to mix up my cartridges a little bit when they're not labeled as you can see we have that nice golden distillate inside of this and i honestly can't wait to smoke on this and try it oh so i will say the stuff i was smoking on before was super sour diesel by daily special if you haven't seen that review i'll leave it in the description below and you can also check the video right here let's take this empty cartridge off let's put on this new bad boy all right so now we got our new cartridge on the pen you can see this one looks pretty cool compared to this one because we have a black tip and this one's like all clear and i've never seen one like this yet i'll bring it up a little closer so you guys can get a better look hopefully with a little close-up you're able to see what i was talking about and get a better look at everything inside the pen not that there's much to look at but you know what i'm talking about i guess the main part everyone wants to know is how does this smoke so make sure you go grab your pen you have your pipe your bong whatever you're smoking and let's try this today because we're about to give this a whip fire og by hexo let's go [Music] the smell from this fire og gives off that nice i don't even know how to describe it spicy

at the structure of this - it's like black it's just nice it's just it's different you know and like always everybody we're using the regular select universal battery but yeah that's the logo right here we got some Eden Oh one thing about this - that I do like about this brand is that they have this brand hold on Cheers hmm tastes just like it bro tastes just like jacker and his/her area shout out man shout outs of eating bro this is my first time ever trying this brand whoa that cough came kind of late whoo my first hit Tom wants his brand-new Club this cannabis club and they have freaking like sauce diamond cards dude oh dude let me [ __ ] I want to search that [ __ ] up but I want to see a thing is instead of searching it up I'm gonna just have to reveal it but some guy was like the bud center I was like oh so out of all these brands are here man which shouldn't like do you recommend what should you like he's like this is a new one you know he's like a lot of people like that raw garden cart so I'll select cards sneezies they got the pax pax is a little bit different I think that's that's a little bit different they got some one will caught a battery or something they calm darts the darts or something like that something like that and he told me that this is like the necks of up-and-coming brand and I'm like okay you know what I gotta test this [ __ ] out you know first of all let's do that quick little test yup stuck no one oh [ __ ] so you know we're not smoking a hot dog water cuz we smoke that [ __ ] once the one like oh oh the state just like decorate honestly it really just tastes just exactly like the [ __ ] like distrain to be honest with you guys like so little piney some five sativa 81.4 six percent THC so we're getting to the low where the low 80s right here so it's just cool you know it's a nice little wake and bake I did actually smoke a little bit earlier this new dish with the foot I did actually wake them back using this and I got a man the high is not too strong you know it's not like crazy you're not crazy lit you're feeling it but you know you're definitely so it's cool you know especially like for like morning jobs and sure you don't want to get too baked but you want to kind of get baked just to kind of like you know go on with the morning you know does that make sense it doesn't matter because I don't I don't make sense you know but you know cuz like against like rock garden real raw garden is a cartridge that you're gonna get [ __ ] baked but like I'll take like two three roots of that [ __ ] and I'm at all cloud ten there's some [ __ ] cloud 22 have you guys ever known as I hit this is it like a blast I'll grab the shell be that she kind of packs a punch the taste tillow piney little bit you know little piney come out with like a lot of new cartridges and stuff like that and I to be honest with you guys and I'm gonna be real with you guys man I don't think cartridges are healthy for you whatsoever I mean if you think about it hers has you know some flour that shit's been around for a minute and wax and all that shit's been around for like would they see like 3040 years or some [ __ ] you know like 40 years I think so it's like with all this new [ __ ] coming out and all these like chemicals are sick of man I you know what this is 100% cannabis you know it's 100% but sometimes when you guys buy certain brands I mean these are cool these are cool these are all like you know I think they're they're they're FDA approved you know they're like they're legal you know 100% legal it's been tested all that [ __ ] so I can't do like no crazy arm obviously smoking wax can cause like can cause harm over time you know I can [ __ ] damage your lungs all that smoke no matter if it's bait cigarettes whatever smoke [ __ ] I suppose being your life mashup fuk so but as I was saying like I feel like a lot of there's probably a lot of companies [ __ ] [ __ ] there's a lot of companies out there a lot of wax cartridge companies right we're gonna sell you some fire [ __ ] you're gonna be smoking that [ __ ] but little do we know man that has some type of chemical that could cause cancer like 30 40 years down the line yo and that's what a lot of people are saying to like when you guys are smoking try not to like over smoke trying to get all crazy with them because again these cards bro we're smoking them these cards came out I was even [ __ ] high school Bravo's out of high school these [ __ ] came out I first came I first got my first card back in like 2016 honestly like in 2016 and I'm just like damn it's only been out for like five under like six who knows how many years let me know in the comments down below like what year was the first year you guys got your first cartridge but I was like oh it was 2016 I got my first brass knuckles you know I got it off a plug - so a little did I know spice smoking some fake-ass [ __ ] you know who [ __ ] knows I've never seen a cartridge none of mine but besides the one that I reviewed on this channel - super Lemon Haze that fake art besides that one other than that you know I've never had a cart that it was like watery inside all the carts I've ever had in my entire life always had you know it was always thing but again you never know so it's just like I think about it somebody that smokes cards I can tell you guys a story right now man the time I apply some fake cards I don't even know it one time I bought six cards right cuz it was like a deal was like a hundred and something for like six like six cards right so I'm like [ __ ] it right let's put my plug again this was like two or three years ago for my playground like lucky I bought six cards dude's albums [ __ ] it was the first time to where I was like walking in my house and [ __ ] and I was just puffing on the shamino was all my [ __ ] but you know and you know when when I had the family [ __ ] I'd be in my room just puffing on that [ __ ] you know gaming watching the movie getting [ __ ] baked in my room and I was like bruh it's just sick I don't stink I don't go I don't lose I don't gotta go out of my way shit's a row sum up you know and [ __ ] go song something stink you know era like [ __ ] this shagging I could just get kicked back slap charge my charge my battery put this [ __ ] on take it [ __ ] bag Jesus whoo anyways I suppose six cards and under like like a week and a half or likes imagine that six cards for us like a [ __ ] full last gram for like two days smoking but I would wake up in the middle of the night coughing I would cough cough all the time especially when I would I would wake up in the middle of the night in my throat would be so itchy I had to take off medicine and I would always cough all the time bro all the time and I was like look bud and I stopped smoking Carson are like you know that bro mm-hmm to be honest with each other I think I was smoking them fake cards all right but uh bless my health right bless my lungs and I was like [ __ ] dude but anyways like stuff like that right I'm thinking about that there's still [ __ ] little fake cards being sold out to like a bunch of like high schoolers and [ __ ] like that like people who shouldn't even be smoking in the first place it has like it's batch number and all the shit's like it's manufactured the company their license you know it's just snatched and it's just all natural you know it's like natural cannabis you know and it even talks about here so what's the company has a license and all that [ __ ] then you should be pretty [ __ ] good you know you got a as our license you know but a [ __ ] man has a lot of warnings out here man I would just say my advice is try not to smoke a [ __ ] load of cards you know limit your self to like two three quarts [ __ ] a month you know what I try to do is I try to limit myself to like I would say maybe like a half gram cart this is me halftime cart like every like 12 to 14 days so like a week we can have two like two weeks you know around there you know that's what I would say I'd give it maybe like two weeks sometimes if I if I another notice when I caught carts I caught maybe like three a month to be honest with you guys and they're not even four grams you know this month I would say let's see what did I review I've reviewed probably one 1/2 gram of select 1/2 gram of bra garden and then a full gram of all pounding this thoughts about like teen Rams and a half you know I'm not bad I guess [ __ ] I'm telling you guys man I know hello people that bro no [ __ ] kill a [ __ ] half Grammy today and I'm like although [ __ ] me eyes imagine you know so that I'll be here bro and I'm puffing a [ __ ] Sasuke I just can't take big hits bro my the way my body to my lungs whatever the [ __ ] the way something going on whatever is inside my body man like I don't know if you guys know this about I washes when you guys watch these videos I do not take the fattest drags ever like I take little tiny kick back drags um cuz if I'll take fat drags man I'm [ __ ] dying like I'll take a couple minutes for me to like recovery shake you know song like look you know but honestly how I you know how I see it is I do I'm taking just normal-sized hits bro my tolerance will not go super high cuz again I got other friends man and they take fat ribs and they're like bro my tolerance is so high they gotta take like [ __ ] point for size dad's and I'm like damn bro you you literally could [ __ ] kill the whole Grammy like four or five dads you know for them it's just like whatever and I'm like but anyways everybody again I hope you guys are enjoying these videos man these are all just reviews you know there's literally just educational videos like I'm not not convincing anybody to go smoke or anything like that this is just for people that already smoke cannabis users you know cannabis patients just for the knowledge you know just a relaxing perfect high you know I mean I hit this [ __ ] by like seven eight nine times already and I'm [ __ ] bait you know but one thing I do gotta give it to you guys man is I like your guys as a design man this even design is dope I like it like it doesn't even feel cheap it doesn't at all like the car is a little the carts pretty heavy now Cano I mean all carts are heavy but this car just feels like I just like the material of it you know and I feel like you could screw this off you could refill it you know I think you can do all that [ __ ] and eat and I think Eden's new to let's see if it has three that it's next to the company name no it doesn't show it apply online but I'm Way too [ __ ] lazy to get my phone you know so Eden so far you guys is regular cards okay I enjoy them especially this one and right now I feel like I feel creative you know I feel like I could go on my computer in shock I start getting down I start writing down ideas I start editing videos cuz again I do have a main channel go down to my description it's called I'm crunchy one we're at 120 one case ups or 120 cases around there you know um but the next step is gonna be your guys as you guys is diamonds cartridge second it's a soft diamond there's something like that but I saw up close and I was like oh [ __ ] this looks like some sauce divers it filled with diamonds little tiny diamonds and just like sauce no Mike I think this is some sauce to this is something I was just like [ __ ] here we have it everybody eatin fire I'll show you guys I'll for sure get the Diamonds cartridge because that's gonna be like the first honestly that's like the only cartridge I've ever seen that has diamonds inside I'm like oh [ __ ] are you gonna be able to smoke this but you do need to buy a eating battery that comes with it you can't be using I guess the ordinary you got to use the battery that they give you see that means you gotta buy that [ __ ] so I'm like okay I'm down I'm down you know depending on like this one and I like this one this one's far you know it doesn't get you like extremely [ __ ] like oh my god I can't function high but it gives you like the [ __ ] right high like it's just as cool as to this fire I like it looking everybody we do not condone the usage of these products I'm Marti warning you guys and shit's not healthy for you even though you know it is it is approved you know it is government approved and all that [ __ ] but I do not condone the usage and I'm not promoting any sales or I don't even sell anything on this channel it's literally just a personal review and a review that could be used just for an educational purpose you know this for someone else you know for like a cannabis patient a patient a new let's you can see like a new cannabis patient they don't really know much about cannabis and they don't really like smoking smoking but they do like baby you know there's like you know what it's [ __ ] crazy man it blows my mind how there's so many people there's another like a good there's another group of people that are older they're like you know London late thirties in [ __ ] and one time like it's like kind of I got a family party right family friends all that [ __ ] right and one time I was just like we're just drinking whatever again everybody this is all an educational you know we're [ __ ] we're inside we're in the backyard you know cousin's backyard I take out a pen and I'm puffing on actually I'm like and I started coughing like I'm like I had a heavy hitter I think yeah I was like a heavy hitter right and I was like dude I'm like oh I'm [ __ ] I'm like damn so lately my cousin hit it again he's older than me he was like at the time he was like 26 and I was like 21 or some [ __ ] yes I said he starts coughing and one of our uncles like he's hella cool whatever you know he's cause dude he comes through he's like smoking his cigarette and he's like he's like what is that and I'm like oh this is a he's like he's like is that babe and we're like nice it's teach it's pretty much teach THC vape 16 C babe what the [ __ ] Hey they have [ __ ] like that and he's old school you know so I'm just like am I like Dan you never had this sheen there he does you know that he's like yeah and that we're like ganna try this [ __ ] out and he takes some red Bull he takes a rip oh [ __ ] [ __ ] man but think about it this was a Stoke head this guy loves stones anyway he's like this will [ __ ] um he rips that [ __ ] right he [ __ ] starts coughing all that she's like - his spies I would you get that she's I just go to the club you know go to the campus club he's like oh she's like I just and they're like oh we just like looked out of mass and [ __ ] were telling the Machine run and what's the crazy part about it is that now when he has like little get-togethers or some [ __ ] you see this fool with the [ __ ] battery like he doesn't really suck cigarettes anymore I'm like oh my head I'm like down we could have potentially like saved his [ __ ] life that day literally for him like this would like see his [ __ ] body because he says that you could smoke these anywhere and you get like a head high and my head I'm like oh my and I had were like no that's you're literally just high you know he said well it feels like it feels like you know I've smoked a cigarette but it's like the beginning the beginning feeling of the cigarette which is the head high he's got but I feel like that for like two hours and in my head when I tell you know he's sick he's like fallings an animal you know we're like we're like down but technically shoes go from smoking cigarettes every day to smoking this [ __ ] and he doesn't in any sense doesn't really buy a lot he says he only smokes maybe like like three or four of the big ones at a month big ones so it's like a gram you know he smokes like three four grams I'm like you know what back there needs to smoke like two three cigarettes a day so I'm like you know what that's cool I mean [ __ ] it's still unhealthy as [ __ ] this [ __ ] but hey you know what better than smoking tobacco right it sounds like damn dude we could probably we just [ __ ] expanded his life his [ __ ] life right there dude like who could've who knows [ __ ] crazy man 20 30 years from now bro he could have had lungs all [ __ ] up brooch and but then again you know 20 40 years from now bro [ __ ] knows what kind of what what what the what the wax would do to us I say you know I'm just I'm just trying to speak the truth you know it's like who knows you know in reality like getting it go good or could go bad you know hopefully it goes good you know cuz this is all tested and all that [ __ ] but hey sometimes man some companies bro the labels you just can't but then again if you buy it at a club bro then it's you should be fine you know just don't abuse it that's it it's gonna be zit because I used two views that [ __ ] and I would wake up like three four in the morning cough my lungs out it was everybody I hope you guys enjoyed this review makes you guys drop a like a comment subscribe click that Bell so you guys get notified every time we upload let me know the comments I'm blowed done when you guys click the Bell I give you guys a shout out anyway I mean Hayden and here we have this [ __ ] ro it's kind of dope huh yeah I'm not to take the pic like this oh nice and I approve this is far tastes good too", "6cmI6BwLog8": "hey guys Logan here from o2 V gonna show you today how to fix a connection plate we get a lot of calls coming in with customers who think that their battery is broken when they go to draw on the cartridge it appears the battery's working but they're not getting a vapor from the cartridge generally when this happens it tends to be the connection plate so what I have here is one of our push-button 510 thread batteries if you look down in between the threads with the cartridge off in the middle you see the circular connection plate so what happens is that generally gets pushed down when either a you screw the cartridge on too tight or be when you go to screw the battery on to the charger and screw that on too tight so a very simple fix what we often tell people to use is just a paper clip and if you stick the paper clip in between the connection plate and the threads and you just pry towards the middle it starts to raise that connection plate up be very careful because it comes up extremely easy you don't think of it a lot of pressure what you're gonna do is you're just gonna walk around the battery and bring that whole plate up to about the middle of the threads once you go to put the cartridge back on after this you should have a good connection and your bad we should be working in it thank you guys for choosing o to vape and have a vape filled day", "qhSRUwzR3Ko": "[Music] smoking what's good guys stony rob here back for another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day in today's video i have a reddit can ready cartridge this is uh a cannabis extract this goes on my good supply vape and we're gonna be trying this out [Music] it's a og kush cannabis train today i've tried out the og kush i've reviewed it on this channel you can check it out i'll put a link in the description down below but today we're going to be checking out the ready cartridge by the company ready can og kush so without further ado let's get started so like i said here we have the ready can and the ready cartridge 510 uh thread it's it has a net weight of 0.5 kilograms the net volume of the contents inside of it is .45 milliliters it has 790 milligrams of thc and has a total of 79 percent thc 0.03 cbd ingredients cannabis extract terpenes this is what i guess gives it the og kush flavor and yeah here we have the og kush and i can give you the back specifications here we have the warning symbol uh it says warning the smoke from cannabis is harmful toxic and carcinogenic chemicals found in tobacco smoke such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons aromatic ammons and an air tube and n heterocyclics are also found in cannabis smoke i don't know what the hell that means but yeah this is the warning sign there you have it uh so without further ado let's open it up um like this bang and here we have the cartridge the og kush cartridge and yeah let's pop it out yeah here it is with the cartridge let's pop out the seal bang wow and let's whip on cartridge and here we have it oh yeah perfect great success here we are thc logo the r logo i'm gonna be trying it out i'm not gonna be doing a blinker that's obvious ha ha [ __ ] a blinker and i'm turning this on and yeah cheers guys i'm gonna take a nice fat rip off this dab pan and yeah i'm gonna see if it tastes good doesn't taste good i don't know does it taste like og kush i'm gonna find out in like a few seconds so let's get it cheers i'ma let it preheat first my bad let's get it not bad not bad at all hold up yep get a little sip of my timmy here i'm not even gonna lie this actually tastes good i can kind of feel the taste of the og cushion it that og kush taste but yeah cheers let's take another hit yeah this is hitting pretty well i'm enjoying it as for now i'ma let the the high settle in oh no it's making me feel good good og kush i honestly i'm just curious to see if it's gonna give me that nice ogeekush mellow high yeah it's settling in what i like about wax the distillate that goes in this is that it's almost the insta buzz it doesn't take some time for it to settle in so yeah do you guys enjoy dab pens i don't know i'm smoking this right now because i just did my wisdom teeth and i'm trying to find the alternative as to like smoking harsh tobacco backwood smoke and yeah i'm trying out distillate for now well i guess wax dabs that pen and yeah it's doing the job right it's not hurting me too much i have a little bit of pain right now but yeah whatever i'm uh medicating myself with this you know what i mean yeah but it it tastes pretty good it's not too harsh um i mean i guess it has that og kush taste but like it's not as strong or prominent as smoking the bud itself like obviously there's some sort of difference in the taste of the distillate like i'm pretty sure if you'd give me like og kush distill it and like i don't know another strain and i'd be like yeah i mix them up right yeah but like if you give me og kush bud and you'd give me like rock star bud and compare the two i'd be like this one's oj kush this one's rockstar kush you know like i'd be able to taste it smell it and feel that this one's oj kush this one's a rock star you know i mean and this nah i can't really taste the difference mostly it tastes like distillate wax you know it tastes like concentrate um i'm gonna take another hit yeah i want to give you guys a close-up yeah so i'd recommend this pretty good i give it like a seven out of ten i'm no way shape or form also encouraging buying this product i'm not encouraging the consumption just saying it is a good distillate good taste in it's by itself is very good you know i mean the product itself is good um not gonna hate it too much i'll probably finish this like fairly quickly because my other 0.5 pod like finish in like a day or a day or two right i'm not complaining too much it tastes good it's just fun to puff it's smooth it goes in quickly it gets the job done it gets me high has thick smoke thick enough smoke for me right now because i can barely puff i'm not supposed to like suck in air you know but it's getting the job done that wax high you know i'm out here i'm elevated i'm stoned feeling good i hope you guys are feeling good too so yeah this was the og kush by reddit can here's the box oj kush recommend it if you have the time to go get a car or whatever try it out oj kush 18 plus never go wrong with og kush the high's mellow it's kicking in right and i kind of feel the same way kind of sedated that nice indica uh sensation but anyways this was oj kush if you guys enjoyed this video then drop a like and hit that subscribe button this is tony robb you guys know the drill um out", "Y9c1e221R0I": "[Music] hi guys welcome back today we are gonna discuss the 1937 brand cartridges these are a really good brand than I discovered a few months ago this is the second cartridge that I have bought the first one was a King Louie absolutely loved the flavor on it got every single last bit out of it there was no waste with this one it tasted so good this one that I recently purchased is the purple blue dream equally tasty equally tasty supposed to be a hybrid I kind of feel like it's more of a like an indica based hybrid I don't know if that's just me or if that's really the way it is but that's kind of I I like this for the afternoons for the evenings before bed anyways there the packaging is pretty interesting it's got a little bit of a mission statement on the inside a little bit of history the packaging is pretty cool I don't know you can't see much on the back because they put the THC info sticker on the back but it does give you the basic information it is manufactured by us CP which is also the manufacturer of the Oklahoma tonic which I absolutely adore this dust really good it's good for trying to relax it helps me relax it it actually affects you a little different than it edible does I don't know if it's because this is a liquid and the way your body processes that I don't know I just know it's good I have bought three of these now really good stuff but let's get back to the 1937 brand cartridges the cartridges are always completely full when I buy them there is no little gap like there is in some brands I've been smoking on this for a week and that is how much it's gone down I like the I'm sorry I like the packaging the mouthpiece is around only thing I don't like is there's never a mouthpiece guard I kind of want a garden like a little rubber thing that goes over the top of it but still a good a good a good design I guess this is magnetic this is the excess snap I really like it it fits in the palm of my hand it's kind of just straight if you ever you know just just discreet nobody can really see it except for maybe the mouthpiece and still yet it can be very discreet I love this thing because you can look in through there it protects I really like this because it protects but yet you can look through there and see exactly how much juice you know is left and there is nothing that makes me happier than looking in there and seeing it completely yellow I mean completely full one of the best feelings in the world so anyway skies it's about 4:20 in the afternoon so cheers cheers Cheers hmm he's taste really good they have a different taste to them something unique I'm not I'm not sure how to describe it other than it's a lovely flavor I have tried the helix brand I have tried the Arcadia brand and I have tried the Oklahoma pure brand so far 19:37 has them beat pretty good I mean the helix was good but they're not readily available in this area these are available they're affordable and I really like them the oil in them is clearly I mean it just it does not move and that's something I like I have seen them like the Arcadia brand and was I mean it was terrible it do this and it just instantly air bubbles and it was moving I don't like that I want it to be really thick it lets me know that it's not being cut of course you know the packaging kind of tells you a little bit about it it says the product is derived from THC distillate and cannabinoids or cannabis derived terpenes THC content is 85% terpene content is 5% it also says the product has been tested for can't a minute keep out of reach of children contains THC now say for kids or pet manufactured by us CP LLC and then on the back of course you've just got like I said the THC sticker that they put on everything here in Obama so yeah cheers guys so what's everybody doing for the 4th of July comment down below I love the fourth of July if you're still watching I would love I would love to see who's still watching at this point you

fret here alright guys bye", "ZzuxwwTKk5c": "oh this is not a plush toy to make me change I become like a castaway you know your page that you bought the color today game is goodie to get your voice mpg back at it with another fire waiting for you guys man so for today's review man I got a Corolla right here man yeah you heard it right kirova the comfy that makes I think they started off making edibles and then just the transition into making marijuana you know actual bud and then cartridges and things like that so they're branching out into the cartridge game I got myself right here it is a mimosa it is a Clement Lucie if I can go ahead and get that a little focused in for you guys one time so this right here is the momo mimosa it is a clement i'm / purple punch and men you know but most is is obviously one of the better sativas out there that i that i feel like you know they just the sativa that just gets you extremely baked but also lets you do your thing without making you feel like super super like your mind is running if you get what i mean which is something that a lot of sativas do so you got to be careful what you choose so yeah I got the memo so right here this one's sitting actually at a 78 point 81 percent THC so that's not too bad actually I was expecting a little bit a little bit more but honestly what can we can do right so open this up right away men it comes in this nifty ISO container I haven't seen any cartridges come in containers like these as of late so I uh yeah all you do is just unscrew this unscrew it all the way throw that to the side cuz you're only gonna need this cartridge so right here boys I got the mimosa from Corolla this is a full gram I think they do have it in half grams also I'm not too sure about that but I have seen full grams all over the place men on the bottom it says Korova unrivaled alright so we're gonna go ahead and test it out man see if it actually isn't rebel because I feel like with a lot of a let me mind you this is a distillate cartridge this isn't a librarian cartridge this isn't anything too special man so I'm not my hopes aren't too high I'm kind of hoping it tastes good I like my mosula it's one of the few teams that I like but you know when it comes to distillate not a lot of distillate companies can do good the only distillate companies I personally feel like I've been doing a great job with their product is dizzy and plug play those two distillate company - probably the only ones and wrong garden - just remember they're additionally company not a lot rather company so I want to take a ghost hit but I got the fan point I mean go ahead and turn off real quick boys here we go we got the Korova mimosa sitting on the raw garden battery I currently don't have any variable wattage batteries man I lost my favorite battery which was whose if you guys in a little slim twist one I'm trying to look for it I'm hoping I can find it soon but as soon as I find it you guys are getting Ben your video out of it man so before we take a hit demands go ahead and try to hit 500 likes on this video I appreciate everyone who's been tuning in lately man during this whole quarantine I've been getting a lot more subscribers and I just want to welcome you all to the GFN man so if you guys are over the age of 18 to 21 let's let's get to smoking boys chewed so right off the bat that first initial hit man I'm not gonna lie it wasn't to like like tasty I don't know if it's just the first hit that was like that let's go ahead and try to get the other wing quipped up and then because that's one thing that I wanna let you guys know to win and whenever tasting out a new code don't ever base off the first hit just for the simple fact that you know the coil takes a while to get whipped up and things like that you gotta burn through the oil and you gotta just absolutely taste the flavor so we're gonna be taking a couple hits and I'm gonna take a couple hits until we get into the flavor until we had super big so cheers guys mmm it doesn't all right after that second dish okay I did get a little bit more flavor I'm gonna go ahead and switch it to the dr. zodiac battery because I think that this one is a little bit stronger because for distillate cartridges the other ones for live resin so for that second hit though I did get a better flavor profile I tasted a little bit of a like a Clementine like a little sweetness sourness so not too bad not too shabby not too shadows go ahead and just keep going though [Music] the taste that I'm getting though is it is it isn't like a oh wow do you like you know just astonishing taste that you would like to get from a cartridge Billie like I feel like I'm getting more of like a dis elyda taste then I'm getting of terpenes like I I think this is lacking a lot intervenes as of now man after the first initial hits a man you should at least taste something you know you should at least provide a consumer with something that the first hit the first two to three hits man and you should just smack you in your face and want to keep want you to keep hitting it more and more right with this one I don't even feel like hitting it anymore just because off of those two three hits like I kind of don't even feel like I don't get that taste that I like you know I don't get that oh gee earthy goodness or I don't get that that fruity berry nasur I don't get anything it's just very very dissolute eat like if you know how desolate cartridges they just taste like like THC oil like just straight-up oil like and I mean that's that's one of my big issues with distillate companies you know you feel like for the most part you know desolate companies just don't get the the mixtures right when it comes to their disel is slash terpene mixtures it is just disgusting because you could either end up with a really really good dissolute like cartridge or pod like plug and play and dizzy where they kind of balance it out with the perfect amount of THC and the perfect amount of terpene and it also depends on what what you know dis lit you're using in the first place how refined it is how well process it is and what buddy used to produce that desolate and there's just so many steps and I feel like with this like they're not there yet they're definitely not there I'm sorry Korova but you're definitely not there yet I would probably just stick to edibles as of now man but I'm gonna go ahead and keep hitting it maybe it'll get better as we get along then so cheers guys like I am getting a little bit more of the mimosa now a little bit more yeah you like kind of more of the Clementine than the purple punch but like I said man just the ratio of dis Allah to Turkey mixture it's just like you want something and that's gonna be in your face you know you want to be able to taste it right here I feel like I'm just smoking straight of disel it like yeah I do get the little hints of Clementine in the back but it's just very very subtle like at this point I might as well just be smoking oil I just straight up this little oil with no terpenes because the terpenes then dilute it to making it less cheap see and then um damn a mother will just give us that you straight-up hardcore og dissolute man but I have nothing good to say about this I'm not gonna lie I have nothing good at all like these all right let's just break it down let me break it down for you guys so right off the bat I would say though I would say here's the upside of it they're packaging their presentation skills are phenomenal they post on weed maps they pose the pictures that they post the things that they post is just like oh [ __ ] that's the main reason why I got it in the first place this is the main reason why I got interested service because the presentation was outstanding just likes dizzy just like politically just like any other company that's doing big right now you know the packaging is on point that's something that I say is key in every single product because when you're looking at something you want to buy something that's visually it's visually appealing first then it is anything else you know because you're not gonna be able to taste the based off of a look so I'll based off of that that is another reason why I got it but opening it up like when I first saw this I liked I looked at the tip and it seems to be like not even a normal tip like some plastic [ __ ] so I touched it not even not a ceramic just a very very low grade and it's very very light though very very light compared to other cartridges not like I can I can barely feel like it's in my hand and then other than that man they that the oil quality it's thick it's thick I'm not gonna lie it's thick I've been hitting it this whole entire time and it's been it's been hitting it's been think it hasn't been moving at all definitely some good distillate but at the end of the day it all matters on how it tastes on how it gets you high it hasn't even gotten me high dude where are you going to take some fat-ass head see if it gets me home we go ahead and take a blinker for you guys if that boy here doesn't get me high I don't know what to say man so cheers guys go ahead and take a blinker with me [Music] he no longer expand me I got a little bit of lung stretch and just B's due to all this smoke go ahead but it wasn't like like crazy do you like with the plug play like I know I bring up other brands but it because it's comparisons you know you want to compare distillate brands with the distillate brands you want to because other other people who have tried who want to try kirova for example the chances are they already tried still Z plug play you know all the big names on marquee right now and this this is my job man this is what I'm here it's to tell you you guys you know what's good what's not that way yes don't go out wasting your money like I [ __ ] did pretty by the way that or cheat cart that I bought they didn't work at all guys so that's it down yeah nothing at all for that blinker I I feel a slight head change just off of that blinker but it's nothing like hot [ __ ] like I'm faded off my ass it's nothing like that at all and I'm kind of disappointed man like I feel like like people are just taking advantage of like the [ __ ] that they have you know the money that they have in trying to produce stuff that isn't good quality at all like I'm sorry but this these cartridge companies have to be stopped like these cartridge companies have to be stopped now because I'm tired of wasting my damn money on cartridges that look good look like they're gonna taste good but they're ass I'm [ __ ] tired of they do it alright so I'm from now on man I think I'm starting people I'm sorry calling companies out on the [ __ ] that they make because it's so disturbing man the amounts of money that I spend on cartridges and [ __ ] and still I am not satisfied with what people produce it's kind of like I thought that's just how it's gonna be man you know especially now with the inflation in the cannabis community if you were gonna be taking advantage of it but like it just sucks man so Korova you go F yourself I don't want anything to do ever with your product again you're trash get out of mind getting out of the stores anything don't ever caught this company and yeah I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here guys if you guys enjoyed today's review go ahead and leave a like go ahead and leave a comment so I could talk to you guys like calm me back to everybody by the way and most importantly though leave a subscribe it helps your boy out more than you know so gfm we'll catch you guys in the next one then we practice fifty shades of gray function on the ground buddy no goes obviously good money I'm some to the runaround are you sending me are you coming now cuz I'm post on I mean", "jSJPxDOiEtY": "hey everybody fat here from humanity health we want to give a quick little tutorial on how to use our batteries and our cartridges all of our cartridges that we carry have a 510 threading so that's the part where it goes into the battery they're all 510 so say if you don't have one of our batteries or you have your own battery or you want to use a different battery as long as it's a 510 it will work the voltage is I believe a certain voltage you have to have it in order for it to work so if you have a very low voltage battery it may not burn the cartridges hot enough to get the vape out of but I wanted to give you a quick little tutorial on our COI max batteries they look like this this is the battery part of it this is the cart if you unscrew it it's really easy the 510 threading like I was talking about when you want to charge it if it's out of battery you actually get one of these in the packaging and that also is a 5-10 threading so it goes into the same spot where the cartridge goes so you will have to take the cartridge off and order to charge it and then it's the USB Drive so you can plug it straight into your laptop or if you have an adapter to plug into the adapter plug it into the wall very easy doesn't take super long to charge and the battery lasts for a pretty long time so that was just a simple little breakdown of how our batteries work if you wanted to actually use it the way you turn it on is the button right there you click it five times so one two three four five and it will blink on if you saw that or not I believe right now it's on the red setting so if you want set the red setting is the highest setting first-time users will probably want to start off on the white setting because it's just for some people it can hit a little harsh in the lungs if you're not used to vaping so the way you change the voltage is three clicks so one two three you'll see it blinks and now it is on green actually as the green is the lowest voltage not why our old batteries used to be white so if you have an old battery why it's the lowest new battery in Green's the lowest so green if you want to hit it you hold it down and you hit it a little bit of eight nothing much because the lower voltage won't burn as much so if you want more vape you change it to the higher voltages so one two three now it's blue so blue is the second highest voltage one two three now it's red so you hit down red a little bit more you can't really tell at the camera but it was a little bit more for sure yeah so that's a quick little break down on our koi max batteries with our different cartridges that we carry let us know if you like the video comments below if you have any questions banks have a good day", "ksHS7CEN8dE": "yes okay hello people of the Internet welcome to 218 a.m. where we are a 219 actual my bad my bad

"ySpyC6mDLAg": "yo what's good everybody jay ping here checking in live respect my region.com here today with a west coast we tour review featuring the kurvana earth og indica high potency distillate baked car cannabis derived terpenes i'm very excited about this carvana one of the best uh vape companies in california one of the most most respected uh our overall always good flavor always consistent so whether or not you like distillate this is a quality product on the back they have the carvana scope here you guys can see some of the uh the the the testing results there and then they also have some of the terpenes over here so we are looking at beta cariophylline beta mercing and humaline uh should be earthy kind of piney and a little bit woody so we'll kind of see if those flavors uh pan out here when we hit it um total cannabinoids 91.77 917.7 milligrams this is potent total thc 86.34 so there's gotta be somewhere around like two to five percent terpenes in this um pesticide residue pass microbiological past residual solvents past vitamin e acetate pass heavy metals past foreign matter pass myosotoxins past so super cool instructions open your package press button slide out the tray for a single dose inhale for three seconds excuse me wait 15 minutes before dosing again all right so learn more at carvana.com at karvana underscore official on instagram so the earth og you guys i'm excited i cannot wait here we go button and slide there we go all right all right look at that check this out you guys beautiful distillate in here we're just gonna pull out the little thing and when we talk about what are we looking at there we go nice beautiful color gold gold gold you can see the brown branded little band right there no mouthpiece plug just on the bottom i kind of interesting we will be using the uh carvana battery today i've honestly given up on using the kirvana's little uh the the cover i personally like seeing the branded nature of either the cartridges that i'm using or even just being able to see the bottom it would cover it up pretty good amount so one two three four five to turn it on all right here we go three seconds it says to hit it so let's go not that much vapor on that particular rip we will do another first hit to give it a better experience and chance a little bit more so right there i did turn the temperature on this from the bottom power to the second uh second lowest um delicious first hit definitely sweet and woody almost like a cinnamon flavor if i'm being 100 honest um not exactly a a cannabis flavor i've tried before earth og it's almost like a fireball cinnamon like a sweet cinnamon piney woody weed flavor it says what does it say on the box here earthy herbal spicy baking spices kiss with a tinge of soil and an ogee rich undertone finished with a full body relaxation so what to check and see about the full full relaxation uh full body relaxation aspect of the high read the full review on respectmyregion.com i'll let you all know about the results for that but when it comes to baking spices definitely got this woody cinnamon uh spices there's this definitely this like earthy soil flavor let me see if i get here real quick yeah and then you get like an earthy earthy oh genius so i guess that's pretty accurate um nice work carvana definitely high potency is burning the nostrils 91.77 percent total cannabinoids their ascend line from cravana is very good y'all i reviewed the dutch tree very piney very sweet uh potent and this is right up there as well earthy sweet rich cinnamon kind of uh what they describe with baking spices wonderful when i think of a when i think of a score out of 10 um the only thing that's really missing for me is maybe the genetics uh otherwise it's got a perfect score on the terpenes and the more information on the back um packaging is cool the brown for the earth og makes a lot of sense it's very potent you know anything that's higher than 85 on the thc for a distillate is considered high potency generally speaking um especially with the total cannabinoids up there in that 91 to 92 range that's a high potency product you know i'm gonna give this a nine point um 9.5 for me that the baking cinnamon spiciness tastes a little bit fake i don't know if that's a true cannabis like from a true cannabis strain it just doesn't taste like it is but you know if it is i'm still up there uh very high score i think um 9.5 9.75 for me i mean it is a really good distillate product there is no yeah there's no inconsistencies on this very very very solid um i'll let you all know how the high is we'll let the high as it kind of gradually hits here uh over the next like hour we'll let that kind of dictate read the full review

oil between cartridges and this is the easiest way I figured out how to do it based on a combination of other things I've read and someone on reddit had the idea of actually putting it into the syringe and then putting it through here so kind of modified that by taping it up so I tape it up and here's a upside down cartridge that I've taken the thing off and I'm transferring it into a real C cell and some people do this when the cartridge breaks I also do it if I find the cartridge that has particularly great oil but the hardware is not so good so this hardware is not so hot on this remedy cartridge but the oil is awesome and it's still a pretty good card but I'd rather hit in the C cell so it drains through here then once it gets in there I'm gonna put back in the little tip and I'm gonna push it push it down in there and then I'll end up there you want to let that seesaw soak for about 20 minutes and then it goes and then it should be fine to work a couple things on the note so I did take this piece off and before I took this piece off I had this right side up and I used a hairdryer to get the oil off the top of the mouthpiece didn't want to waste anything and then it's actually so you can actually have to sit for a while but sometimes always just a little too sticky Oh see that's nothing it cannot fall over something to speed it up a little bit by blowing on it but I'm going to hold that while I blow it and then you'll see the oil going down into there and then I'll do the final part well pump it into that final cartridge oil down I taped up this top one to make it easier you have to tape that you can also hold it on the end of the battery but he just blow on it make a little they also get my pillows too much them a little bit laughs in there and you know it's inevitable you might lose a little bit of oil doing this process and this Karcher is not a program anyway mid full half gram anyway partially used now get the rest of that in there today I got most of it as now that in there now when I take this apart and be careful to just just get those little last drops dripping down into there a sort kind of on the tail end here and you'll see that a lot of Italy just naturally went through the syringe already and that's why I have it already ready to go like that and I'll do a final pump to pump it all through but you see it's already kind of about halfway there also be careful not to melt your tape and into the thing either so what did I do when I when I finally I'm going to take this on the little head around my little top right there I'm gonna then do the push down to the center and then put it in there but you guys get the concept cartridge to serve and to cartridge that is what I have found the easiest way to transfer all between cartridges whether it's broken or whether you get some really fire oil and the cartridge just kind of sucks I personally would rather take a little bit of loss in the oil and not use this crappier cartridge and use the better cartridge because overall I'm gonna have overall better efficiency so if I lost 10% but it's 20% more efficient its overall it's a winner so after that I'm just gonna seal it up you guys really don't need to see that part but I'm just ribbing that apart pumping the back in and then capping it off there's dab connection thanks for watching guys have a great week", "HQc9FXLOkiM": "what is up YouTube family boy baths is here I'm gonna be doing another cartridge of you today for you guys now today I had 10 ran into some new cartridges so nothing for like a little that like a catalogue that had gaming at the dispensary so about these new cartridges just explaining about like you know the new flavors that they had and like what they were about and [ __ ] picked up with this I was gonna get like a rock garden or like maybe like a plug and play some but I just didn't want to have the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things you know it's not bad to try anything so you know that way you guys can like see what's good and what's not you know but these cartridges really grabs my attention there's a church Church cartridges I had never had it before the thing that really caught my attention was they have like this adjustable airflow you know which is pretty pretty dope you know I've never seen adjustable airflow on these cartridges I only seen them on like got 2020 vapor now if you guys had seen those where you could like that just like on the bottom yeah you can they're pretty dope you know you can hit them hard in it would be really smooth it which is pretty cool you know and there were like 40 bucks no $40 a car which is you know they they're pretty neon the marquee I've never seen them before and on the bots on the back that says their Instagram and whatever so it says super premium cannabis distillate you know so it's um it must be some pretty hard dis Allah you know it's a sour it's [ __ ] a super premium distillate you know it's pretty far cartridge guys for the price you guys can't complain so let me know how you guys been let me know how my new subscribers been I've been pretty good as well let me know how life's been treating you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my youtube video you know my videos as [ __ ] you guys are [ __ ] awesome for that you know for taking the time out yesterday and watching my videos I really appreciate that and [ __ ] trying to fix the camera a little bit but you guys are awesome for that and you guys just keep it up you know like an income that on my vetoes and you guys are my snapshot you know you guys always cool you know really appreciate you guys adding my snapchat and [ __ ] but yeah guys let's get straight into this cartridge this cartridge like 40 like $40 you know so also about the barrier that goes along with it Hey look is this for the thumb now so it's Asif so here we have the battery so we're just gonna go in the shimmery drop in the cartridge and ship but but yeah guys it's Sunday afternoon tell him not he has been um it's gonna gotten a little tab on it so it has a little sticker on the bottom so the THC on this is 81% it's a strawberry cough so it's gonna be good guys that I mean we finally we so we finally got the [ __ ] cartridge open after a while struggling you know they gotta like I might work on the [ __ ] cases or something but here we have the church or I don't know if it's just me but I have trouble helping this [ __ ] ship but yeah guys so the thing that really caught my attention was a the design of the cartridge and it kind of looks like a heavy hitter but it's like a really really different different company so we're gonna open it it's a nice really faculty and also really caught my attention so as you guys can see it's also so the coil itself compare this the size of the cartridge this is really really big guys compared to like you know that it's really really a big cartridge and like no joke guys right when I pulled out the cartridge you can smell the the terpene something smells really really fruity and the really thing that's really cool about these cartridges that not a lot of cars you just have to have this adjustable airflow so you guys can take big big clouds or you know you guys can get it really really smooth hit so so there's the cartridge itself right do the bullet test and this thing does not have a bubble in it this thing is like literally filled to the [ __ ] top so it has a really really thick oil in it big coil I mean so this thing should have some good airflow in it and I have this battery along to there you know it's the same battery for the cartridge so I had a copy you know had to it's a adjustable 900 battery the ma battery so it's it gots to be a good Betty so we're gonna pop it open just like that this battery was like twenty dollars so and also you know it's a surge protected so I don't know what I think it sounds like if it blows up on you or some [ __ ] but the max on this is like a four point one voltage so we don't we don't need that much so we're just gonna use the lowest setting on this it's pretty dope these guys packaging is pretty DUP you know everything comes the nice hard plastic packaging so it's pretty dope so it's a battery I really needed a new battery I mean that yoke and it works pretty good but to be honest with you guys I don't know if you guys are the same way but do you guys get tired of using the same [ __ ] battery for this cartridges like this time we're like I'm like [ __ ] I want any battery but I mean even though I don't need one I still want one so I don't know if things just mean I like using these stuffs all the time but here's pretty ears battery and here's the charger simple plug and play for the thing you know it says search on the over and here's the battery it's a nice thick like a brass knuckles really really thick so this battery right here should [ __ ] last you guys for a while the quality on it feels really good it's nice and heavy it has this little rubber tips on there we're gonna take that out and has a California warning sticker logo whatever so you guys know you guys smoking a good cartridge so the the quality on this is really really amazing I had this Cadillac that explained everything about it the oil and it looks really really thick it doesn't move at all and I'm recording uh as yes can see it has this little adjustable air flow net where you guys twisted so that's really really dope you know I had a cartridge before they had that it's the 2020 vapes the feature is something like that and they were [ __ ] fire so imma go ahead and try hit this and I'm gonna go and let you guys know what it tastes like oh wow I'm not gonna [ __ ] what you got your nama straight up guy up on sugar Coast [ __ ] you know if something's bad I'm saying it's bad you know but the tip the terpene profile this is [ __ ] amazing you know the flavor on this it's a strawberry coffee and it tastes like really really fruity you know that's really crazy I don't really think there was gonna taste that good but it tastes so fruity so you know we got this nice big thick battery the same same church on it and like the logo as I said as a cartridge as well so we're not going to see if it's charged hopefully it's charged man I don't know pause the video and alright so turns on so it's on yellow and I'm see that's on the middle one alright so we're gonna put on the 3.2 volt which is the blue light it's already going to screw the cartridge on it sure looks [ __ ] dope guys I'm not gonna lie to you it's really the quality on the quality on the battery and all the cartridges it's amazing just the way it feels in your hand it feels like if you're holding like like a nice gadget you know what I mean so it's pretty dumb guys so we're gonna close up as you guys see these these are really neat to the cartridges so we're gonna quote go ahead and close this little this airway we have here see you ask him alright guys my bad so how to delete some footage up my phone and you know get the video start again because I ran out of footage of storage so we have the cartridge here we're going to just take the sticker off you know just to get that [ __ ] out the way so we're gonna go ahead and hit this and if you got a smoke let me go ahead and do so I'm gonna get back to real quick I'm gonna be heading to follow me on snapchat go ahead and follow me you know yeah that's where I keep up posting updates you know about my lifestyle [ __ ] cheers guys we got this church here so we're gonna go and see this is really good I had to close this airflow so I'm gonna compare it whether it's open and closed I'm gonna tell you guys the difference so Cheers Wow you get this nice really really fruity strawberry taste you know that's [ __ ] awesome it's like and you get some actual terpenes in there I don't really taste like distantly to be honest it tastes like some really top-notch distally really really fruity guys so I'm going um you didn't really get a big cloud as you guys see I don't really get a big cloud with a little airflow closer so I'm going to twist it I'm gonna go ahead and open it and I'm gonna see if I can get a bigger cloud with that as you guys see I took a blinker really really thick oil you know you don't really get big clouds so we're gonna ahead and bump the [ __ ] voltage level on this siren garden one two three ICS conceived so I got in close the thing again and we're gonna hit it cheers guys smoke along with me take a blinker now you really do get this little bigger cloud yeah that's what you needed to do is pull up the voltage on that so you really get the same flavor but it tastes a lot way way better you get this nice fruity Strawberry Cough taste it tastes amazing for the price the cartridge was like thirty six dollars guys now you guys can't beat that to be honest it kind of reminds me of a what's a call you know it's kind of hard to burn so we're gonna go ahead and I'm going to open this airflow let me see what's the difference with the higher voltage oh wow tastes pretty good but to be honest you get a big you get a bigger hit whenever the thing is closed I don't know that's just up to me and it tastes a lot better but I think it's just a preference just depends on anybody but we're gonna flip the thing go over it just to make sure you know there's no [ __ ] bubble in there it's really really really really thick guys all honest it's like amazing if you guys haven't had these Trish partridges I guess you

I you get to play in I don't know how weird this game's gonna get but if it's by the same people who made Twilight Sparkle pregnant I probably question this game for the majority of the park so anyway let's play Oh Applejack ooh Oh white shirt into a tree oh man she got cuts and bruises by running into a tree all right poor Applejack she's my favorite Pony maybe we could uh what what really really what did all the doctors Oh what uh well why why I to get the splendors out wait I don't get it how'd she get splinter from running headfirst into a tree she I mean I see like splinters all over here and like stuff like that okay I gotta put it to her bumps ice pack ice pack ice crack ice pack where is the bomb we're okay apparently I'm guessing this is uh what do you call it what's that stuff you put in a I don't know man it does hurt doesn't it well don't worry it's that uh what do you call it forgot what you call it oxygen peroxide truck oxygen oxide or whatever I don't know it's something like that oxygen oxidant oxide all right band-aid okay I'll putting a bit low all right Applejack and I put those weird facial expressions I get I'm probably gonna be wiping her down she's gonna be like yeah well she has to get someone who knows all right look into the mirror oh my gosh is what the skeleton of a pony looks like what what she went headfirst into a tree and you're not telling me she has no brain or skull injuries but she broke both of her legs somehow and she's standing on all fours how does that make sense how I gotta click that because obviously you know I like to put a cast around a little actually I yeah same facial expression yeah time time time I think the badge is all because you know you know it you know whenever I break my leg I put bandages on in like an hour later or however long that was it's a it's apparently done I mean I me it's full health I mean you know next I have to give her a shower alright whatever this is totally not weird yeah I like scrubbing my I like watching other people scrub himself in the show I mean that's totally that's totally not abnormal yeah I do this all the time yeah ya scrub 'dear uppity scrubbley bubbly hair dryer look at the hair dryer looking at oh yeah this ya can't aj do this ourselves I mean I know she's an independent pony but all right you're gonna have your hats what no she isn't getting a dress all right let's see what else you eat perfect I'm not giving her a dress forget that oh wait we keep do different hats it's cool look relate and the powerful I don't like that i like the sets and more i will see our other hair options uh you you gothic Applejack near mean inbound you know about ducks gonna be the same I don't need to her to be different cuz you're amazing just the way hey she's a Pikachu the Pikachu tale pika p Applejack hi I'm ki I that the pika to tail bake a pie whoo-hoo hi i'ma save I guess somehow what no no well guys I guess that's the end of the game so and that's all the time I have for today now on another weird game by the same people who made this I don't know why oh wait hold on there's a description here hold up hold up wouldn't it were not done let's read this aloud shall we because the last game didn't have a description so let's read this very very carefully hold up hmm today's applejack's birthday so she can invite so she so she can invite her friends to her home and have a big party she is waiting for her friends in the park and guiding them to the party when she looks her friends coming she is very happy and runs quickly to give them a big hug but she crashes into a tree somehow and the trees hurts her feet yeah cuz when she went into a tree headfirst her feet her it's just like it's just like me Naruto running into a tree headfirst but I break my would i break my my feet because you know my feet somehow break alright so but we're worried let's crash into a tree the tree hurts her feet she can't stand up but cries loudly beside the tree her friends are very worried they take her take to the animals hospital really we animal hospital yeah you don't get to go to the pony hospital you get to go to the Animal Hospital so yeah that's totally fine and hope the doctor can make her calm down Applejack thought she can't walk or run in the future which doesn't make any sense I'm surprised she has no skull damage she went headfirst into a tree you guys saw it I saw it she has no skull damage our brain damage or a concussion but she hurts her feet because she runs headfirst into the tree for reasons I do not know why I was like thought she could not walk around in the future she is very saddening ignore everybody I love that grammar girls girls can have you help her doctor and wounded feet encourage her to stand up even though she was standing in the game help coming what come on help her clean the moon and apply the magic cream the magical crane you mean the hydrogen peroxide yeah that's what it's called thank you reminding me oh that just get it okay hydrogen peroxide and said the magic cream okay where was i ah magic cream be affected areas and strap up strap up and up the road wait a minute wait a minute or a moment before cleaning the wound her feet will be soon well again take her back to home and help her take a shower I'm pretty sure she could take a shower on her own even though like it mean her bare feet kids like healed an hour or 30 minutes or 30 seconds I don't know but but she's like oh don't worry guys need to help me take a shower yeah I don't get this game guys I'm so confused it's not as weird as twilight pregnant but it's more like Obama defense before continue if he'll soon be well again even though they were healed in like two seconds take her back home and help her take a shower then choose the best dress skirt and making her more cute and beautiful in the party so this game it's it's not as weird as twice mocha pregnant it just doesn't make sense so I don't know where some of the stuff applies in plus the grammar and this is kind of sucky so I'm gonna give this a I'm gonna give it like to know I don't know how much love them gonna give the game but really I'm look at the other games on here and there's okay you know what back to the main point this game is weird it's in not as weird as Twilight Sparkle pregnant but it's still like WTF and that's all the time I

discount vape pen today we're going to be taking a look at the card is in black box this is going to be a vape for your cartridge 510 cartridges we're going to go up close and show you what you get in the box [Music] alright guys up close we're gonna open up the Cardassian black box show you what comes inside up top you're gonna have a little card which is pretty much going to give you all of the functions of it and talk a little bit about it very intuitive it's going to show you exactly what you need to get started using it also gonna have the black box itself really nice really nicely made this box here I'm going to show you a little bit around it got your charge port on the bottom there you're also gonna have your three lights for your battery life your button up here three clips is gonna shoot your due to different voltages and then like I said just using it cartridge in here just to show you guys see there your battery indicator on the bottom which is nice for a concealed unit like this because most of them don't have that as you can see this is a 1 mil cartridge with a small magnet that's perfectly in there and as you can see that opening is huge so it's gonna fit some of the bigger 510 cartridges out on the market show you everything else you get get a nice little goodie bag here it's gonna have your basic USB charger you're gonna have a small magnet for 1 mil cartridges and you're gonna have a bigger magnet for your point 5 cartridges which would just allow the cartridge itself to sit a little bit higher so as I said this is the smaller magnet and the bigger one is gonna be for your shorter cartridges that way when you drop it in this part right here will stick out enough to where it's actually functional nice little juice window there on the side so you could see what's in the cartridge and overall just a nice little solid construction of the device this does have a 900 mAh battery so one of the biggest batteries for a concealed unit like this the 3 settings it's gonna start at 3 point 4 volts go to 3.7 and then it's gonna go to 4.0 on the highest setting and then as I said before probably one of the bigger batteries and it does have that indicator which is nice on the bottom and that's our first look at the car tusen black box alright guys so that was our first look at the carson black box as you can see the features just make it overall a really good device to use for your 5-10 cartridges right now I just have a cartridge in here I'm gonna show you how it functions right now it's on the blue setting which is the medium so as you can see it functions just like a regular 510 cartridge battery but it does have its benefits the adjustable settings on there the battery life on this thing is amazing as I said before it's gonna take any cartridge on the market as you can see that huge opening in there and you're gonna be able to fit some of the wider longer cartridges in there and then the fact that it does come with the two magnets doesn't matter if it's a 0.5 or a 1 mil it's gonna fit in there no problem nice button the settings are easy to navigate and overall just a really nice solid 510 cartridge battery then take another little vape on it here so as you can see it does exactly what it's supposed to just gives you a little bit more option if you guys are using some of the bigger 510 cartridges they're gonna slide in there no problem and this is gonna work for you and again this is probably one of the bigger per concealed unit this is gonna be one of the bigger batteries to get on the market sir less charging you're gonna be able to go most of the day with it without having to charge it overall just a really nice box guys if you like we just saw in the video is give us a thumbs up it's a subscribe button if you're interested in a Carter's and black box they're available for purchase at discountjuicers.com [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "O-oShgS1Xy4": "hey what's going on guys welcome to deaf connection in this review I got the vessel batteries so the vessel battery is intended to use four cartridges only and primarily only four cartridges and honestly I love this battery beckham this is out of all the pens i've ever tried an experience this is honestly my favorite one this one is the smoothest the cleanest and um i can't find any con about it other than its price it is pricey compared to a lot of other batteries like cecil or like she saw Siler she saw palm and all that but and some of them even cost ten bucks but this one's really worth it you really do get what you're worth when you buy the vessel battery so there you let me tell you all the features this pen really is a is a really sleek pen and it really is that smooth and simple to use it's just three different modes um the lowest one being like being 2.8 volts right here and that's another thing too it's pretty cool do you need it's unique in the colors that it has I thought that was pretty nice but the last mode is a 3 point 6 volts I believe yeah pretty sure that's right at 3.6 so it's not as powerful as other pens as well but another thing is the batteries really efficient it lasted me a couple of days and it charges fairly fast charges it wasn't like one two three hours that will last me anywhere he's pursuing like I smoked consistently so I do it does last meeting between 2 to 2 to 4 maybe even 5 6 days so I think that was pretty awesome now with the battery with the battery itself like what I said honestly there really isn't a whole lot to it other than it's a sleekness how the feel of it this one this one's really nice actually I love this one will op up the only thing to the battery is um right here oh and there's another feature that I love about it it's the air flow this is what makes it amazing you see all this right here this thing you can actually take off but the purpose of that is for airflow is for to optimize and enhance their flow the taste and all that and it really does difference there are some carts so you could see in the post off if you read further below but there are actually some quests that don't even fit this but that's what the person is for so you could just take it off if the car is too why you're just too big to fit that's another cool thing you know something other this very has that you could take off is the bottom part but first I had no idea where to what to do with it but it was a little confused at first um but I didn't realize didn't tell you about more about it that the bottom part is actually for the purpose if you were to drop it because I've dropped my vessel battery a couple of times and it's actually I know what nothing came off no paint came off not really like major scratches anything at all but this pen can withstand like impact if you drop it or something like that so that's pretty cool it's this thing but this battery falls and like bends or something like that right here this will be the first of that just to take it off this is where you charge it really simply just connect it's a magnetic charge port but yeah that is a that's a that's pretty much all there is to it yep I forgot to mention so I what I said this is um this pen is really for carts only and um it fits any sort of 510 thread and another cool thing is these are actually meant for it it's enhanced Cecil cartridge it's so see so these Cecil cartridges are better cause supposedly for Cecil silo and Cecil palm battery but we personally believe it the vessel better hits a lot better than the Cecil batteries itself so that's another really cool feature and it looks just like if it's really smoothly guys it's like that thing too is pretty much as convenience and it's sleekness its discreteness and how it hits uh how it just enhances every hit it really you really get the taste of every single hit with the vessel battery I know I'm hated I'm gonna smoking right guys just see how you can see how its Cheers all right smoke isn't fairly thick it's kind of thin but it's still it's still kind of rip so doesn't rip as much as I'd like it to but it's pretty much it's pretty much all deficient semen so it does less like what I said it just lasts a long time in every hit you really do it it really just tastes a lot better like actually with this cartridge itself to some of the carts I tried it with my other batteries um I tried it with the G pen and stuff like that and it was the only actually really harsh this actually gives this really smooth hit so that's another really cool thing so that's the that is a vessel better you guys if um another thing is I forgot to tell you the price yet it is worth a hundred bucks so I mean it honestly like what I said you usually do get what you what you pay for this thing is really worth it if you've got smoke cartridges a lot and consistently if you're more of a wax kind of person or just like prefer smoking and smoking weed or anything like that then yet I wouldn't recommend this pen but I do recommend is battery for everyone who small carts on a consistent basis so that's the vessel battery um if you guys have any questions or comments and experience with it posted them post them down below and I'll see you guys soon peace out guys", "kX_Q94myqoQ": "what is up YouTube fabric boy baskets you're gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys and then a Saturday morning today it's time to wake and bake so I really hope you guys are really having a good day hopefully you guys staying blessed the world's kind of [ __ ] up right now but it'll it'll be over soon guys so everything will be back to normal so I really hope you guys are doing good and yeah guys last week got posted like two videos I usually post like on a Friday or Saturday so you know my bad had kind of been a little busy you know with all this [ __ ] going on but today actually last week I have picked up this moxie these are actually new you know I've never seen them before I had gotten one before it was super super fire you know they taste like an Ursa cartridge like actual actual like resident and I had a like a question you know if you guys ever know like don't you guys think like why is raw Gardens live resin so lighter than other live resins like like this one right here for example this was like a dark amber color compared to this one like I'll show you guys right now like live resin for the raw gardens are really really like you know which there's a lot there's some people I'm a comment section that say like regarding this fake like fake life resin so I don't know I just want to get your guy's opinion on that and that's a couple people already telling me you know but we're going to take a hit others before we get in the cartridge just waking big guys Cheers but I want to appreciate my new subscribers and those who are new here you guys are awesome for watching my videos you know I really appreciate you guys but let's get into this Moxie cartridge these are called MX brand but I had gone in there um on their Instagram page and it says they have to do something with Moxie so I'm guessing it is Moxie cuz it's like the same letterings everything this one's a yellow og this one's of life as full spectrum life resin so THC on this is 80% so it's a pretty good cartridge for some live resin there's some licenses that don't really get that high THC you know but this one's around 80 so it's pretty good cartridge I paid like maybe like 40 bucks for this so it wasn't too bad you know so we're just gonna go ahead and pop it open guys I had had one before it was like the it was like watermelon OG it was really really good you know it had tasted like an actual dab you know it tasted like really weed and it is like no discipline and intake and I like a really really different flavor than like what a raw garden would have like that clean like rock gardens to me that kind of tastes all the same you know they have all that fresh clean taste to it which is I don't know it's pretty good I'm getting wrong but they all kind of do taste the same here you have a cartridge it's a seesaw I really love these seesaw cartridges right here you know they're like the dank dank vapes how the tips are I really really love these tips now this is what I mean you know raw Gardens this one's life resin and this is my resident as well so and this one's a Moxie and this was a raw garden as you guys can see this one's way lighter than this one this one's the darker amber color so a lot of people been saying raw Gardens fake live resin so let me know what you guys think about that and that's just coming from couple people not just one you know so let me know what you guys think about that oh I thought about it as well like it is kind of lighter than what this one is and on this is real dead live resin so guys let me know on that so this one's it's really really thick yellow oh jesus was the indica hybrid I'm guessing so I'm good and dry hedges let me see what it tastes like you know flavors off it so the best way to try to just to [ __ ] hit it so we're not going to take this off I didn't do a cartridge you'd be on this raw garden I was just too lazy and I got a like on a Wednesday or something Wednesday night so I just started puffing the [ __ ] out of it so we're gonna gonna screw this on the cartridge battery hopefully I was smoking well wouldn't you guys plot you guys vape pens whatever you guys got to get [ __ ] high mass waking day just around 7:00 in the morning before I hit this let me get up Oh Red Bull sponsors we may get sugar-free Red Bull but besides that guys oh hopefully got a smoke along with me work on ahead and try this [ __ ] this one's the yellow og moxie I guess MX brand whatever you want to call it so cheers guys oh wow right off the bat if you guys ever had a if you guys ever had a Ursa cartridge these cartridges taste exactly exactly like them they taste exactly like weed you don't get like that raw garden like taste to it you know it tastes actually like dad and that's one of the things that I was wondering like why does this taste more like dab you know and like the raw gardens taste like a little chemically you know I don't get me wrong they're pretty good but I don't know that's kind of weird to me but these cartons are pretty far guys are like 40 bucks for some actual life resin I said these taste like an oyster cartridge the taste on it it's like a strong dad taste you know really really good you definitely get that OG taste like a strong cushy taste at the end but it's mostly like a clean fresh oh gee tation well it tastes really really good like when I tried these cartridges like last week it was a watermelon og cross was something and I was really amazed by the turf shamash it was crazy I little smoked the coke cartridge like in two three days you go back-to-back that's how good it was but this one it tastes kind of the same but it's just had like a more strong cush taste to it now I'm feeling like a little good high right now I know like a really good buzz you know there's my waking bag I'm gonna take a bigger hit to see if you know I [ __ ] get a big cloud for you guys I hope you guys are smoking along with me and I'm also having a vaporizer I'm going to give away I don't know if you guys had seen my review I had done on these

guys", "-DLv-IvXmsU": "okay what's up youtube so if you're here today you're probably wondering how to transfer thc oil from one cartridge to another so you probably have like one broken cartridge and you're trying to get it into a cartridge you know works so you don't waste your money so i know a lot of you found me in the first place because of this video right here so here's the thing youtube took it down because all they said was that i violated their policy they didn't even explain why i didn't save this video unfortunately but on the page that youtube shows me my deleted video it lets me play through it i'm cartridge i have dispensary the other day and i'm re-uploading it now and so the quality is a little shitty because i have my phone recording my laptop screen basically so the quality is a little shitty but you'll get the gist um and i basically just tried to cut out the reason why i think youtube deleted the video so hopefully there are no problems this time because this video helped a lot of people so i'm gonna try to re-upload it now and hopefully we don't run into any issues all right you guys so i bought this [ __ ] brand new graham cartridge at a dispensary the other day and it doesn't work like i connected it to a brand new battery that i just bought and it didn't work so i tried it on my friend's battery it didn't work and i was like cool so i've been looking up tutorials on how the [ __ ] to fix this and nothing that i'm trying is working and i guess you can transfer the oil over i didn't know that so um i didn't spend money for no reason so i'm little miss [ __ ] i'm trying to not waste 50 [ __ ] dollars is makeshifting so what we're gonna do is because i already had like two of these a few things to mention step one um untwisting the cartridge doesn't work with every single cartridge uh the ones that i had in the video were happy stick and for the most part i got a lot of questions on how you actually remove the cartridge cap you just twist it that's it like it might be a little sticky because the oil but that's it you just twist it um and then make sure that you're wearing gloves so that you're not like so you don't burn your ham with the hairdryer i honestly think that youtube took my video down for a safety violation because there was some things i mentioned in the video that i didn't clarify and i think it got flagged for safety reasons and when i said wear gloves i mean rubber gloves like the kind i'm wearing in the video not like latex plastic gloves i mean like actually protect your hands gloves the kind i was wearing in the video are actually dishwashing gloves but that protects your hands so basically i heat up the oil and this one with the [ __ ] hair dryer and then i pour it into the one that actually works i haven't tried smoking it yet so we don't know if it's gonna work or not so stay tuned okay so you take the one that doesn't work heat it up once it gets to a consistency that it'll start moving easily and you grab your cartridge that does work kind of let this stuff start to fall and i just take it and let it fall into there okay so once i get it to like that point take the hair dryer again because that [ __ ] metal thing is in the way i guess one bright side to having to redo this video is that i had some copyrighted music right here even though it was hella [ __ ] funny but it's fine um now at least i won't have a copyright strike you specify this but your hairdryer needs to be on heat not cool obviously i thought that was a given but you never know um so now you can see the oil is transferring into the empty cartridge so it'll take you a couple tries to do this because you need to keep reheating up the oil but i'll be back after i like transfer it all over um and we'll see if it works all right y'all let's put the cap back on unfortunately i couldn't transfer all of it over but see i still got a good amount there which i got like half a gram which is [ __ ] annoying because i had a full gram but since i tried this twice already i lost some of my weed but it's okay all right and then i didn't actually feel like going outside to smoke to show you guys the after result because i can't smoke in my apartment complex so i would have to like go all the way like outside outside like far away from the apartments so not doing all that but it does work i swear by it i promise um this method is 100 solid so yeah so yeah thanks for watching i'm really sorry the video got deleted and i know this quality is probably shitty but at least i was able to get it back up

i love you guys so much peace out", "fSq1_D4kzvk": "hey what's going on guys welcome to that connection here i got hometown hero delta a so check this out man check this out halfway with it i [ __ ] love it i'm not gonna lie so it doesn't say the strain but when i looked into the website this strawberry cough i [ __ ] love that strand it tastes so smooth so sweet so tasteful it's one of the smoothest delta i've ever tried to be honest with you and you could um personally i love sweet tasting uh cartridges either that or likes ones that taste like strict flour you know like a [ __ ] um what's a good brand that's a good strain [Music] anyways uh this tastes a lot like strawberry coffee if you tried it it doesn't taste exactly like strawberries but it'll give a nice sweet like you can still taste a little bit but i taste more just sweet overall sweet taste smooth like i said and it's only 600 milligrams of delta eight so i'll be assuming the rest would be terpenes so if you like terpene tasting cartridges you're going to love this cartridge because i'm telling you man it's smooth it's clean it's tasteful doesn't potency is delta so if you guys ever tried delta 8 then you know what i'm talking about if you don't don't be expecting to get high as a [ __ ] dispensary grade thc cartridge dabs weed bud nug anything anything at all like thc full thc spectrum even if it's from the street or from your homie even unless it's like a sketchy uh you know one of those sketchy sus cards then that's how i compare the height to this too not the high but like you know the experience so to say but hi it's uh i view this as like a [ __ ] i don't know overall delta eight i never get baked off i never get too stoned off it i just get a nice close a nice slight high not strong enough to last hours not strong enough to make you feel like couch potato kind of vibe but just like a mellow and it doesn't give you a fog like high you know when you're just like i'm telling you like slouched and like oh i don't want to [ __ ] kind of high nah it'll give you a nice buzz just for a little bit but the potency for this it's a pretty good just like every most delta eights i've tried oil quality good nice dense slight yellow color some are either light yellow slight yellow like the gold color like this or like straight water clear like color you know they're sometimes i don't know which ones are better i thought the water clear ones were good but i like this one a lot but you know what let me just hit you guys for you guys all right i got the yolk and armor the biggest down uh before i hit this i just want to say the biggest down i found about this cartridge is because i put it on the vessel battery that's always my go-to when i go to battery when i have a cartridge and it didn't hit that well you know i like that the the vessel that everything goes to four volts or four point two this still yo this is what you can do this still goes to four four point two but i don't know this one hit a lot better with the vessel battery it just hit life for me but anyways cheers give me a second this shit's [ __ ] it's another thing hold on because i don't know this thing it doesn't get clogged frequently but you'll have that problem now just hit set [ __ ] it it's nice smooth smooth smooth deltoid i've tried to be honest i'm telling you this right now and i've tried to shut down the deltoids i'm the one doing all these reviews too so i'm getting used to the taste but you know in general delta eight it will always always always be harsh if you take consistent or long hits it doesn't matter how much of a pothead you are it doesn't matter how many times you smoke cards a day trust me it's uh it gets you you'll he'll you'll definitely feel it in your throat if you take consistent and long hits but take short hits like this like don't be cheaping on it don't just like take smooth hits you won't be coughing that much with with hometown hero especially i like that that's what i love about this car and it's so tasteful man nice smooth slight sweet taste good terpene mixture i'm telling you if this is a gram this 600 milligram for delta there has got to be terpenes right because it just terpenes and they'll take this lit so this shit's good this is good i've seen the there i've seen other cards the one i'm about to review right now i forgot the name of it but i'm in the process of reading another delta a few other actually some of them are only like 200 or like 800 milligram delta so they have less terpenes in it but they're probably stronger well in general they'll take i don't really feel much strength right i see it as a good supplement or maybe you want to get off vaping or cbd something different other than that maybe you haven't smoked it all you just want to test it if you're like that take small hits please trust me you don't want to take big ass hits trust me trust me you're going to learn the hard way video but with this one if you're like that you want something smooth for and you're looking for something smooth they'll take highly recommend hometown hero and i'm telling you supporting the veterans bro the full gram cartridge does go for like 40 grand 40 grams 40 dollars for 30 40 i think some [ __ ] like that but honestly if you've tried i like the three shy a lot that one's really good i like the dimension a dash it was fire but this out i don't know they both are unique in their own way with the taste of their strings but this shit's good this is the only string they have right now hopefully they make more because i mean no man i would like the other ones see what else they would got i don't know but strawberry cough they'll say let me take one more here for you guys i mean other than that this shit's good yeah but that is hometown hero delta eight is that connection thank you thank you for watching guys peace", "BMSzf_bzJ14": "and how's everyone doing today we're gonna be doing a cart

fired I have really big dread medicated the Abbas's uriga high potency this thing is really hitting me right now and it's it's more of like um it's like it's like when you're smoking your Jordan or something it's not like an instant high like how you get with these fake cards out here that just have other stuff in it unknown stuff by the way I would just like to mention that just makes the effect of the hike um so much quicker than when it's actually supposed to you know but this one feels like I'm smoking like a blunt and it just comes steady and steady and steady and then it just hits

true berry it's amazing if I was to give it a rating out of 10 well let's go through the high first true berry it's a hybrid but me it doesn't really put me in the couch it was more of an upper I'm more of ready to do stuff when I smoke this one compared to like Mandarin dream it's more of like a downer I'd be going into couch for that mothertrucker if you're looking for a good daytime hybrid I would definitely choose true berry over a lot of the other ones and if I was to give it a rating out of 10 I'd probably go for like a 88.2 just because I have tasted better but I have tasted a lot worse so I mean it's pretty good remember guys it's King Luke 4:20 if you like the channel man just please consider subscribing if you made it this far check out another video share it to your friends I mean whatever check it out y'all thanks for tuning in I'll see you on the next one", "0V9NRRk0FQA": "hi I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're going to be talking about the fastest booming trend which is concealer vaporizers for cartridges so let's say you're on the market for a new concealer first of all I hope you stop by vape honey stay calm to check out our selection because this is something we've really been working on and making sure that we innovate but you're on the market you want to know what the differences are what the categories are and certain things that you can go through or buy to make sure that you made the right decision for the cartridges that you like to purchase so today we're going to take an in-depth tour and talk about the differences between our concealers to make sure that when you buy you buy the perfect concealer okay so there's two general categories to these concealers you have ones that have the cartridge exposed and ones that have the cartridge is completely hidden okay these are kind of a way that we like to separate the vaporizers and then there's differences in between them as well so let's start off with the ones that keep the cartridges concealed so you cannot see them now most of them that on the mark and all of ours are powered by magnet adapters so you can simply pull the cartridge out and you have a magnet adapter now why would somebody want a concealer like this well first of all it looks cool second of all it keeps your cartridge completely hidden for discretion and it also protects it from anything hitting it or possibly breaking it and they fit and sit up right in the pockets they're very very sleek in size so that they will easily fit into you know the small pockets for women's purses and the small pockets you know the upper pockets on your jeans like so it stays completely head so first thing for people is size I want to show you guys this is our beekeeper model this is our latest elf model and this is our phantom model so everybody knows what a sip we're not promoting combustion here guys we are vape company but just to show you how size pairs up everybody knows what a standard sized Bic lighter with the size is so to take our beekeeper for example they're actually very close in terms of width as well as height for the body now we move on to our elf and then last our phantom so let's start off with our first model the beekeeper the beekeeper is a very good unit it was actually our first model that we launched in this concealer category and it has been our historical best seller it comes with a magnet adapter simply drop in the cartridges and it actually has a push button operation so you would push and hold this button throughout the time that you inhale and you also click it five times on five times off this unit produces about 20 watts of power and it also has a a 300 milli amp hour battery so it's gonna last longer than the standard batteries and it's also give you more consistent power it has a micro USB charge also that you can just plug right into the side port right there and then when you get a new cartridge you can just take the Magna DAP tur which if you lose it try not to lose it you can purchase more online you just screw it onto your cartridge and you drop it in so then once you hear a click and your unit is on your rate of vape so well we get from a lot of people is that there's a variety of cartridges that are on the market and some of them are wider than others so some people are concerned to order a concealer unit before you know when they have their cartridge to make sure it's gonna fit so what we're gonna do here is we're going to measure the openings so that you know how wide our concealers are before you make the order so let's start off with the opening of beaky so in millimeters this is exactly a 10 millimeter opening so if your cartridges are wider than 10 millimeters in diameter they will be too wide to use for the beekeeper now let's move on to the elf we just launched this unit a couple weeks ago it's something that we're really excited about it's available in five colors give you a brief little look the only one missing from our display is the white one which we do have available what makes itself unique is that it's not only a little bit smaller than the beekeeper it has a little bit more capacity so it has 350 milliamp hours so the battery's gonna last a hair longer it has a really nice texture to it I would compare it to if anybody has ever had a like an iPod Nano it has this very um the this this kind of grippy thick metal you just feel the quality when it's in your hand you know completely solid unit what makes it unique is that it is completely buttonless so it's Auto draw so people who really you know have been holding on to those pull through batteries this is the evolution the next step and the way that the technology is is you are just gonna get effortless draws on this vaporizer it is gonna be much smoother much more powerful and it's gonna fit a larger variety of cartridges that those auto draw batteries cannot fire now the kick comes already with a glass really high performance ceramic cartridge with a ceramic mouthpiece so if you are not buying prefilled tanks and actually filling them then this is like an awesome tank to get started with and all you do to get this thing fired up is its there's no clicking anything you just put your Magna adapter onto your cartridge drop it in and inhale and you will see it light up very smooth very good unit charge with a microUSB and again it's a little bit smaller which brings us to our ultra premium unit which is the Phantom the Phantom is not only for cartridges it actually comes with a wax concentrates adapter which is dual quartz it is our largest unit in terms of size comparison but it also has a thousand milliamp hour batteries so it's gonna laugh last about two and a half times what all the other concealers do now one unique function that this unit has is when you flip it open it has a squeeze action trigger so you just squeeze it to inhale and it also has four different temperatures that allows you to dial in to what intensity and flavor you really prefer and it ranges from 3.4 all the way to 4 volts it has a advanced preheat function and the unit also comes with two magnets a longer one as well as a shorter one so all different sizes of cartridges you can have the perfect magnet for it so your mouthpiece collar will sit flush and you will keep your cartridge completely concealed now what the beekeeper and elf do have in common is they both have windows so you don't have to excavate your cartridge to see what level it's at but they do do a good job of keeping it concealed so that is really a rundown of these cartridges now let's get into the width testing for these two these we've made slightly bigger as the cartridges have gotten bigger it is a hair under 11 millimeters we're getting 10.9 so most cartridges are labeled 11 millimeters are actually a hair under 10 point 9 so this will fit a standard 11 millimeter cartridges which actually does fit into the wider category now let's check out the phantom the Phantom has a slightly skinnier opening than the elf and it comes in at ten point eight five millimeters so that will give you a good idea if you already have a cartridge that you are buying prescribed to to make sure that the unit that you get will fit so to recap the beekeeper has a ten millimeter opening the elf has an 11 millimeter opening and the phantom has a ten point eight millimeter opening that will drop cartridges in but let's say you have an extremely wide cartridge what do you do well that brings us to our second category of concealers which is found in our mini max line you can check out a really cool in depth review done by a high-rise on our mini max to show you just how powerful it is which is our smart tip key fob vaporizer it's very light and with this line what we want to do is make them very light concealable and make sure that these units fit onto your keychain this these units both have 500 milliamp powered batteries the difference is this one has a variable voltage which is our minimax Pro and this one is a single voltage but it automatically adjusts to whatever cartridge you put on it it has a smart chip in it this unit the minimax Pro has three different voltage settings with a maximum output of four volts the minimax what you would do is when you purchase your cartridge it could be as wide as you want all you do is you take it and you screw it into the 510 threaded opening and it's similar to a standard battery but it is a little bit smaller much lighter and you have a charging port right here so the cartridge is exposed when you have a cartridge on it however it is a device that is designed to look like a key fob or a clicker which does make it discrete when you don't have the cartridge attached to it then we have our minimax Pro which looks a lot like a key fob and it even has a deluxe keyring holder there and a micro USB but what's cool about is you don't see the cartridge because it's actually folded in there and then you push this button at the top to flip it open and what we did is just to show this flip open as we use one of the widest cartridges on the market which is a Liberty variable air flow model and it actually does fit in here so this will fit cartridges and we'll check the size of this opening right here this will fit 11.6 millimeter cartridges so the mini max pro and the mini max if you're buying extremely wide cartridges are your best bets to making sure that your vape pen is gonna deliver power concealability and stealth-like options if they're very wide if you buy skinnier cartridges or are filling your own cartridges we went through these features and on our channel at vapor store direct on youtube we have in-depth

my prescriptions are working it's really weird um i'm still trying to get my penelope and i can't get that cartridge yet um because i'm still waiting for my um thing to be renewed because last time when i was able to order they didn't have any in at that time so it's just this huge big huffle so i've been using the balanced um or harmonized cartridge by soleil um it's also by afria i did an unboxing about that um a little while ago but um so yeah i managed to do this somehow i woke up i didn't i don't remember dropping it i didn't use it in the night i don't know how i managed to get it like that but that is what i managed to do to this poor little cartridge um so and um chum is now out of the balance cartridges of soleil so um i'm going to try this in the meantime it's we'll see how it goes i don't know i'm going to open it and find out i just opened up the marley cartridge balanced it's the marley balanced cbd um cartridge i don't know if you can kind of read that but it just says cbd on it no marley is um a product or under ownership of canika uh cannabis this is a canica based product but it's owned by it's a marley product i guess so this is what it looks like so we're going to try this balance cartridge out and hopefully it gives me similar relief um to the sole balance cartridge i'll give it a shot marley natural red 510 thread cartridge this is what it looks like in my 510 battery pack that's what it looks like and this has just kind of been a we'll see what happens because i'm struggling with getting things on my prescriptions right now so i've mostly only been using the vape cartridges um just because we're at home and are it's it's just easier for me to use them i find them really accessible i find them less messy i can i can use them when i need them and carry them with me i don't have to carry around a grinder and all sorts of other things they're just more accessible and easier for me so basically i use these out of convenience a lot of the time and um i also find that they're a little bit better on my throat i don't find them as harsh or as burning which is why i use cartridges more than i have been using dried lately now the whole struggle with this um is because of my spectrum prescription um i didn't i was not able to get the penelope on it which was what i was hoping to get because it's new and i really wanted it but because my prescription kind of ends like in the middle of the month when it renewed and then when i was actually able to get it they no longer had any in stock so i've been trying to find cbd based or like half and half's to use um in the meantime while i'm waiting to be able to get stuff off my prescription that are actually available when i have a room on my prescription to get them hence the issues with the cartridge and trying to um get something that works now i did find one that really worked it was the solei cartridge uh the balanced or harmonized i did do an unboxing of it but i didn't do an actual review of it yet um but they are awesome i really really like them um they are also an afria product now marley is a canika so this is a canika branded marley natural product um now i haven't had a lot of um canika's products before because mostly it's been the afria products that i've been using um with the good supply and the just my aphro cartridges on my prescriptions but most of the cartridges i find if they're not by tweed or um they're produced by aphria whereas this is a canika product now i was um reading and it says that it's it says it's all natural um and so our marley uh red cbd rich vape cartridge is filled with five grams of natural cannabis oil a custom blend formulated with both cbd distillate and winterized co2 thc oils i'm not sure what a co2 thc oil is but apparently it delivers approximately a one-to-one ratio cbd to thc now i've never heard that before and i've never seen that in the product descriptions before so i'm kind of interested to know how that works so if you know how winterized co2 thc um works i'd be really fascinated to know i'm gonna actually have to uh read up on that because i don't know i do like it though it's been working really great um so far so good it has um i think if i had to pick between the balance cartridge by soleil and this one i probably picked the balance just because i find it gives just a little bit more pain relief than this one does this one does give pain relief um i do help it find find that this one helps with nausea whereas the balance because it doesn't i don't find it helps with nausea or with my appetite this one i do find does increase my appetite and it does but not as much pain relief as i would like so it's an okay one would i get it again and as for a cbd yeah i'll get this one again because i think this is pretty close to a um similar effects that i get from my um aspen cartridges um as far as as feeling goes that's kind of similar on a prescription based as far as a wreck-based um similarity i can kind of go on um as far as the cbd um not as high of pain relief but it still is working it helps i am enjoying it and it's um doing what it needs to do so i would recommend it again although i think i like the balanced bisolate better but still a good product and i'm really interested to know what co2 um winterized thc is so uh i might do a video on that in the future who knows if i can find someone that can tell me something more about it that'd be really interesting and if you really like this video you find it these informational or informative and they help you or you just like watching me make a fool of myself or give recommendations as far as what i'm finding helpful now what i find helpful may not be helpful for someone else but it may be so that's why i'm sharing this information and so if you like it click subscribe follow along and i'll bring you more informational things i also want to just um say one more quick thing about this i didn't put it in and it's i know it's at the end of the video it's absolutely terrible with me but one thing i did find with this one that i'm not super happy about is it does give you fairly dry mouth i want to add that in just because i normally don't find it too big in a too big of an issue but whereas this one i find i'm like constantly drinking stuff just to keep moist just something [Music] [Applause]

to see how to take apart a sealed cartridge now normally as countries they're either sealed or the screwed on and the round ones like these are usually sealed supposed to be sealed compressed into there and the they have other ones that have the fluted or the flat tip that are also compressed in there but this cart is still reusable so if you can get it open you can fill it back up we use it quite a few times before you have to get rid of it so you can't untwist it this is that doesn't have a school screw on her screw thread on there when you take it apart I'm gonna show you right now you don't want to try to turn it what you want to do is try and twist it and pull it twist it and pull it but you want to be careful you don't damage it because you don't want to grab it with the pliers and mess up the anything around it to make it sharp or this form so you've got to grab a towel then with pliers you grab this end make sure you got enough of a towel there okay okay and then you're gonna wiggle slowly wiggle slowly wiggle take your time just keep wiggling and bam you got yourself a open card now you can refill it reuse it you wanna be take your time be gentle cuz you can break this whole part often it's no good okay but if you keep wiggling you will get it out I've tried twisting it before and I've never had success that way but if you wiggle wiggle wiggle it'll come out mmm it smells like piney but oh you're on the mouthpiece there and they're still all your in there so this is still reusable there's no reason to toss it out if you can still fill it back up point I just refill it when you want to and to put it back together you're just gonna have to obviously put it back where it was in the slot there and push it down hard and you will be able to seal it back up there once it's filled up you fill it up like a normal cartridge screw on cartridge and then you can go ahead and compress it and it will go back into place okay it's a little bit far out there very little so once it's in place and you're not gonna spill your oil you can flip it probably down push it okay so I've had this problem before too so it's not sealing right now so what we're gonna have to do it's clean around the edges because it has oil so the oil is not letting it sit back down it's acting as like a grease so you want to clean around here okay and clean around here and then press it back together so that's what I'm gonna do right now I'll come back and you'll see it'll go back together okay so I've cleaned up both sides around here and around the inside of here okay you want to be careful when you're filling it up you don't want to get nothing in this area here because it won't let it sit back down so when you fill it up you want to use a syringe or clean it up after you fill it up - down here now that we got both parts cleaned you can go ahead and push it down you can leave it like that since you don't want anything to spill and push it down hard okay you see it even grab the towel there and then when uh you got it sealed a bit you can turn it back around see the back tight and there you go back to normal sealed and will not come out you don't want to do like I did don't even fix a towel there you see that so I'll take that off later but this is just to show you you can pull it out if that happens to you pull it out a little bit and pull it push it back in you can see it's right back in its place and it's not coming out okay usually when you twist these do not come out when they twist you can twist all day long and you're not gonna get them out okay you can only do it the way I explained there and that's how to use your shield cart a lot of dispensaries have this style as well as the threaded style so if you get this style running you use it there you go", "O32fAM537jU": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic 510 cartridge review today everybody's favorite kind of cartridge your traditional screw thread uh and a cartridge brand that's been around for a very long time if i remember correctly i think it's actually the first cartridge i ever consumed here in uh california upon moving here nearly five years ago and that is jetty extracts jetty extracts gold uh today we're gonna be taking a look at their grand daddy purp strain with a whopping 86 percent thc in there it's a pretty high thc percent and i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach for uh 47 which puts it right about in the middle uh for price the price spectrum uh for this area so 47.1 gram 86 thc cart pretty good deal um jetty uh we've got all our stuff we want to see on here as well we've got our manufactured dates our lab testing results so all the good stuff there as well um as i said granddaddy perp is our strain to try today uh in terms of packaging looks pretty basic nothing too ostentatious got a little sticker to remove first which we shall do sticker gone i guess we just pull maybe i hope ah there we go they still have the little bags i remember these there was a little bag that i had when i first ordered it nearly five years ago these strange little extra pieces of cloth don't know why you need them oh it's a big old woody tip my favorite way for tips to be are woodies um and this one does not disappoint you don't see the you don't see the hardwood tip very often um even as much as you might look to see a nice wooden tip it doesn't happen as frequently as any of us should hope for all right so we've got our 510 cart screwed on here i'll figure out what to do with this bag at some point nice little dime bag maybe uh and here is our oil nice looking rich uh yellow oil no problems on that part um standard looking cartridge design nothing special there standard intake holes although i like the little yellow jetty uh band there that's pretty tasteful all right but let's get to the most important part where's this 47 dollar 86 percent jetty golden thc cartridge gonna feel like [Music] oh yum [Music] very smooth um not a heavy tasting strain um granddaddy perp isn't one of my the strings i'm too familiar with in terms of what i'm tasting here is like there's a little bit of spice to it almost um uh earthy and spicy not bad not bad at all but subtle uh it is not one of the strongest most terpene enriched strains i've ever tasted that's not a bad thing but the oil itself is really nice very smooth it's really nice not burning at all doesn't leave a nasty aftertaste really pretty smooth good stuff here first impressions from jetty and their granddaddy perps [Music] a slightly fruity taste just slightly [Music] but i enjoy it earthy tastes aren't traditionally my favorites but this one's nice and smooth subtle this is a good package so far from jetty uh it's a shame it took us so long to review them uh initial impressions very good very positive but like all our wheats reviews guys we're gonna review the whole cartridge not just these first couple of hits here i'm gonna do these whole experience uh it's gonna take us about you know four five six days to get through the whole thing and then after we do that we'll come back to you guys at the very end and give you all our final wrap-up thoughts all that good stuff uh let you know if this thing make sure it doesn't start to burn hot or uh doesn't leak or doesn't go dead any of those things that you know can definitely happen with these things we'll test the whole thing but for right now big thumbs up for jetty extracts and their granddaddy perps well i look forward to finishing this off and i will see you guys back here in just a bit until then stay high stay healthy see ya welcome back to weeks guys it has been five days as predicted since we first checked in with jetty extracts his gold line with their grand daddy perps that's that 47 cartridge picked up here in long beach and this one guys is thankfully going to be short and sweet because i have nothing but great things to say about it have just a little bit of oil left in there to share with you guys as we talk our wrap up thoughts which are pretty similar to our initial thoughts so these last couple of hits here it tastes just as good hit just as hard uh that 87 thc i believe um as they did at the very beginning which is always a good sign the wooden tip not my favorite but it's not bad work never got clogged um as i said cart design works fine oil always totally great quality top to bottom this is a big old thumbs up for jetty extracts um not a lot extra to say about it other than it's good if you see it and it's at a fair price i don't think you need to uh hesitate this one big old thumbs up for me no hesitations no qualifications jenny makes a solid solid product so guys before i bounce though i'm going to share with you a little cherry on top anytime we get one of these reviews that we like this much that we have something we like so much we want to share with you a little something extra a little cherry on top that you can have that's you know some not not necessarily weed related and something you don't necessarily have to use weed to enjoy but um this time you know maybe you want to get a little bit high put on the youtube and check out one of my favorite channels introduced to me by a friend a couple years ago uh this channel is called game makers toolkit with mark brown british guy who talks about game development game design a very competent very academic way it's great um i suggest a little granddaddy purpose from jetty extracts sit back if you like games you like thinking about games in a more um abstract way check out game maker's toolkit i think you're gonna like both of these two big thumbs up for me guys jetty xrx with their granddaddy per game makers tool kit here on youtube that's going to do it for everything guys that's going to do it for this review it's going to do it for the cherry on top thank you so much for watching and we'll see you guys on a future review peace", "A3ZFodq2bIY": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video today I got yet again another select wax cartridge I got you guys man you guys been doing these like wax cartridges I went for the hybrid I went for the cherry pie and so a little bit about this it's a hybrid I believe it's more than a sativa science I'm pretty sure because sometimes when it's yellow it's kind of like a sativa hybrid you know so it is cherry pie and I've tried this only like once or twice just because I throw this and I I bought this and all we're having at me and some of the guys were having a sesh so we just kind of threw this some rode oh and man like this man I only have it just a little bit enough just to kind of show you guys look at that all right right there so like always everybody we got to select you guys see that right there we like it that I just like that 83% zero six eighty three point zero six percent THC and it's some cherry pie you guys know was good I'm completely sober right now so we're gonna see how many hits it takes for us to get lit so cherry pie everybody again welcome to another podcast I hope you guys are enjoying these also everybody makes you guys drop a like the comment subscribe 18 another educational purposes like always everybody make sure you guys once again actually let's take let's take the first shrimp so on there's if we got a brand new pen this pen is actually a little bit different the red is actually the lowest setting the blue is like the medium and the green is like the highest so I'm just like wait what cheers everybody see if I could get like a taste okay so it does kind of become like a bit like a little cherry like a little cherry aftertaste like a little punch like a little cherry punch hmm see the cool thing that I like about select cartridges and regarding cartridges is they don't really be adding a lot of flavor sometimes when they be adding flavor that shit's kind of like a bad chemical you know I mean I'm pretty sure it's a pretty bad chemical you know if they were to add some flavor on it might be not too harmful but I mean if you guys are damn [ __ ] you guys are heinous [ __ ] all day you know it's just definitely bad for you but these happens man these are coming these be coming and going like crazy so look at that we got the little select logo um I think there is a couple pink ones bro like that strip tap fake select I feel like nowadays man they could probably make anything bro literally anything for example like again you guys know this I already tried on fake brass not though I seen fake King pens I've seen what other fake it's mainly brass knuckle I've seen a couple fake heavy hitters and it's just like damn people are thinking like man I'm getting the jug but in reality you guys are just can that custom that home that custom made oil could be a little bit cheap who knows some plugs can potentially make some good fire stuff so who knows but let's take another first hit select does not disappoint I mean out of all of them out of all of them I feel like select is top 3 I gotta admit top 3 when it comes to like actually getting lit again select does have like a little meaning like a point 3 cartridge which is like an ax it's in high 90 percent THC and oh my god roll you take a rip of that 1 or 2 a deer man but it's not around like 40 50 bucks just for that little piece of like super concentrated THC it's crazy but a cheers OH I think now I feel like I can probably tell the difference from a lot of wax cartridges like this definitely has select I'll written all over like all of them have like different tastes if it's crazy the raw garden one you can tell right away like bro if I were to close my and I woulda hit a wrong garden and if I were to know if I were to hit a rock garden I'd be able to tell it's like you know chewing out a piece of leaf you know piece of tree piece of bush and that's the leg type I got that it's so weird I'm not I'm horrible at explaining especially explaining a taste but it has like this let me see if let me see if I can explain to you guys definitely I think select cartridge is a lot better than a Moxie but the Moxie does have a really great flavor but again you know that's what a lot of people say you know when it has a good it has like a good candy type flavor and yeah it's definitely not good for you you know because they'd be adding stuff for the flavors because in reality it's like okay if they were to press a certain tree huh you know what there's just so much to it man I there's so much learning to this to this industry you know like I just I just keep thinking about it like it doesn't make sense because sometimes when you don't taste something I'm just like okay cool it's legitly the concentration you know it's literally the oil from the flower you know it's nothing else added to it which makes it just taste like like literally just one single taste which is kind of dough same with raw garden that's what I figured you know Rob garden it always has like the same flavor that same strong flavor with like maybe a little hint of something and you can tell but it depends on the flower like the natural flower you know but sometimes we have like for example I'm not saying heavy hitters brass knuckles and all that stuff sucks or anything like that I'm still gonna cop some here and there but I'm saying like the flavor is too artificial like it's not artificial but it definitely for me I feel like they could potentially add some something to it just so I could get that flavor you know but I could be wrong you know I could be wrong that's just my thought but again everybody I'm not saying to not buy those brands you know because in reality they are you know proved as long as you guys are like like legitly getting them from like the club or the you know the dispensary and stuff you guys aren't really getting them from your local drug dealer cuz your local drug dealer listen to this you guys I talk about this in all pretty much all my wax cartridge videos because sometimes you know these guys they could probably make the wax you know the oil pretty good and you know what hey you got yourself a good cartridge homemade wax you know but at least it's like nothing crazy you know but then there's also other cartridges you know for example like in my experience what I had is like you know I poked out in a couple times and they just turned brown and I'm just like yo this does not look normal yeah it was like a thirty dollar brass knuckle you know like it was definitely fake it was not it was not the real brass knuckles of faith it was a fake brass knuckle but that's one way you guys could see and sometimes let's chop the other sensitivities 1 2 3 I think it's just good 3 oh wait a minute green as the middle one look at that that green is definitely the better wood yeah green is definitely the middle one tastes a lot more made-up fatter cloud and I do see a couple people sometimes like there was this um I had a friend that they came to visit me during my lunch yeah my old job right and they were like eh like you smug and I was just like well I mean sometimes you know not all crazy she's like they're like oh I got a I got a wax pen right I'm not gonna call them out or anything but like yeah I got a wax Maran I was like yeah that's good so they took it out right and I looked at it don't like have a halfway smoke and I was like what is this it was like some off-brand you know wax cartridge right and I was like I like bro you're selling your smug on some fake ass [ __ ] didn't it was just like so black the oil will you see this right here the oil it's like halfway through maybe like they smoked it like right here no no maybe like right there like literally get halfway and I guess what they said was that it just started turning black and I was like dude you know that's like when that's when it's fake and I was like what kind of car is it was like some designer brand not a designer brand I come it was some type of brand where I'm just like - right off the bed I'm just like yeah man you got to turn me little your local drug dealer huh you know my head I'm like why you know 1 2 3 all right let's try it off in the in the max um setting well I have your cloud the taste it's not too gay Don the highest win oh not too good this pen is to spit it's $50 pen don't get me wrong it's a nice pen but definitely not for Lake we tried a couple well we tried a couple um we tried a couple of these select cartridges already I liked select so it was literally like the first one to go to like this is the one that I wouldn't always like gay you know it's really good brand you know but right now the brand that I've kind of uh have been buying lately there's a lot of regarding rocker and is really nice rock garden is a good one but don't get me wrong rock garden and select are way different and they're both good so you know you could either go this router this round or you know cop one of each but definitely switch off you know mine I'm definitely gonna cop another Moxie cart I really like the flavor I mean it's some light resident in a wax cartridge you know and it's it's only $25 1/2 gram this one was about $35 1/2 gram I believe or 25 no no no I think this was 20 bucks I think $20 a minute there look at the thing dude half gram was like 25 I believe 25 um so it's not that bad whatsoever you know I like it it's a hybrid it doesn't have me all slump or like super awake I mean I like that super awake feeling you know the sativa that way I could be very productive but right now it's almost gonna be 9 p.m. so might as well you know just hit some in because and stuff like they're you know such it's pretty good oh one thing that a lot of people do not know and then my dumb ass just remembered especially here right here let's check this out so the directions or suggested serving a suggested serving which is one serving is three seconds so this is one serving I think I went a little overboard at three four seconds but three to four seconds is one serving and there is a hundred and twenty five servings so it's so let's see so let's start off it says right here look one three second draw and close cartridge contains 125 servings so what one three second draw is a so three times 125 so if we were to drag this it would take 375 seconds and if we were to do that and be around six or seven minutes so wait a minute so six or seven minutes of you pump that makes sense because if you're just gonna go sir like four minutes you'll smoke the whole thing hmm six eight minutes of hitting and that's why I love having baby hits - oh okay now that - that was just like a little fact that I just like read from the back a lot of people don't really know but yeah usually it's like a three to four second scene and I'm different once I'm pretty sure it's for all of them it's for the 510 thread the the pens or whatever but um um so three to four three to four seconds is one hit yeah but you have around 125 settings so if you were to take at least one serving a day that's literally a 125 1/2 gram of this but that means you have to be like super lightweight you never had any type of th in your blood whatsoever you know oh and another thing too that I'm just spacing out at this point what at this point pretty much what you want to do is I guess one of my boys put me on actually shot up oil yeah shout out chicken but pretty much when you hate when you have a pen you want to hit it right you hit it and then you have to wait I think maybe like 30 second I believe I freaking forgot but he said 30 seconds or more you have to you want to wait like 30 seconds in between that way it kind of cools down you know because if it's too hot the coils it might not burn right you know you might not get the best like the full potential of the hit you know so you want to make sure that you wait at least 30 seconds let it kind of cool down is that way so you can get like the best you know now I'm gonna try to tell everybody that because he told me that I'm just like dude I see people just rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out past I see a little person rip it blow it out and I'm just like damn maybe that's all the wax is being over burnt and it's not even like I mean at the same time it's it's gonna get burned you know it's gonna file but if you want to have like a perfect hit that's when you have to wait at least like over 30 seconds that's what he told me you know and in my head I'm just like yeah it makes kind of sense but let me know in the comments down below what do you guys think crazy stuff man but I just said bad but man but if you say man isn't but right out it just sounds like Pampa that's crazy so there we have it everybody we have some elite select cherry pie hybrid wax cartridge I hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you guys drop a

oh it was collected on december 16 2020. it's got the qr code on the back and everything the batch that this was made from was only 14 grams so you literally got one of 14 grams that was made for this

this oh it's the sticker i've heard nothing about good things everybody keeps saying how good it is and they had two different boxes for some reason one box was solid and then it was this yes and it was like the box like this is what a box like these was all like a cake line yeah and then the red box was like the other flavors and [ __ ] yeah but so far i kind of like the packaging though it's it's winning you over so we got [ __ ] this this trash now and i want to go ahead and say kate does not know we're doing a review on them no we just [ __ ] we gotta keep up with our subscribers [ __ ] is talking about it so we got to get it regardless if they [ __ ] with us i kind of like how it looks no lie it's got the clear windows on the side of it it's pretty cool i like that okay it's got a charging port so if you do find yourself low you'll be able to charge that [ __ ] up a little seal like the top is rubber right now it ain't yeah it's plastic it's a little look a little bit more a little rubber fits it better other ones you see and i got three little mouth holes i like that that's cool like a harmonica at the top now the texas pound cake i've never tried texas pound cake anything but you know it's crazy hold on though they cake starts with a c but the disposables got a k on it see okay let me see the box that's a little weird maybe they got the disposables made by somebody else just didn't have their logo on it well when you look up cake we tried to find that actual like company and get in contact with them to see if they wanted to work with us it was hard to even find anything about them everybody that sell these are like third-party sellers they're not coming from a direct site so when we look down there that was a thing you can see on the metal of gas stations yeah a lot of gas stations that's mainly we're already off back okay disposables i have some other disposables you pull it out it's literally just a plastic container like a little plastic square and some wires connected to it that's it this [ __ ] is like a real cart if you look on the inside you see the same filter and [ __ ] as a cart yeah you do so this is like i don't know if y'all gonna be able to see that [ __ ] yeah you're not gonna be able to see that that's the window but the window it's got an actual [ __ ] little piece of the metal [ __ ] stem like on the carts yeah all right so see what this tastes like he'll be [ __ ] me up when [ __ ] ain't got buttons oh what's that to look uh action was that satisfaction have you that's what you ain't answering me have you

guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "0EW65sp5ePg": "hey what's good everybody jpegming here checking in live respectmyregion.com here today with a west coast suite tour review featuring the cure companies diablo og one gram high potency thc distillate cartridge so we're looking at 98.22 total cannabinoids on this product 94 thc uh specifically 94.7 percent thc delta 9 at 94.66 so high potency high potency high potency that's what this product is all about superior quality cannabis goods i'll show you guys some of the packaging here it's cool black white logo got the extracts added in there to stand out diablo og is a classic og strain you can get some of the testing information there on the back we've got this pretty cool reflective superior quality cannabis goods thing there and a bunch of information on the back i'd like to see the genetics i'd like to see the terpenes but they're not listed it does say that the ingredients have 100 premium cannabis distillate extract so i do like that um are the terpenes botanical or the terpenes cannabis who knows how to use attached cartridge to 510 thread battery take three second draw exhale repeat as needed so today we're going to use the vessel battery i've got um it's set on the lowest temperature we're going to see if that's enough to get the distillate to fire up um child proof packaging is currently working on me though let me try to get this open ah there we go all right so check this out you guys beautiful got this white uh ceramic tip the glass window here to see the actual oil that we got clear rubber coverings and stoppers on the mouthpiece and on the coil down at the bottom where the connector meets the battery so i'll kind of show you guys this a little closer check that out it's a beautiful product i can't really smell anything through the tip it does have a little bit of red ringage going on the top so looks like the terpenes have definitely been doing a little bit of reacting but we shall see how this tastes you guys can see that color a little bit there at the top a little bit concerning so here we go one two three four five oh one two three four five turn the vessel back on beautiful there we go all right one two three here we go one hit review talk about it i'll do a second hit give you guys a score out of ten we're supposed to do baby let's go it rips it's smooth it tastes good i do love the branding of the car i love how the cure company put their logo on the actual glass of it i think that's super dope but taste wise it's pretty decent earthy sweet spicy not a little not too much pine there's some lavenderiness with some linalool in there for sure i enjoy it i enjoy it i'll need to do a second hit to see if it's really going to be at this 98 you know total cannabinoids i'm not super duper high right now um run it here we go again i'm tasting that little there's a nice soft lavenderiness to this got a little bit of pine on tiny bit on that last one but the most part just getting that earthiness just getting this spice tiny tiny tiny bit of floral pine and a lot a lot of lineal in there this lavender-ness and so i really enjoy it i am concerned about this ring at the top when you think about the packaging date it was back in it was manufactured in january 21 2020 the date of the packaging of this product so when they stuck the card into the packaging um what was it july 16 2020 so there's a clear difference that's that six months difference i don't know what happened here with this but definitely concerning [Music] you know cartridges are tricky um but i definitely feel like merchandising and making sure that you know the product quality stays consistent i feel like that's totally achievable but as you guys can see there is some really strong discoloration let me pull the sticker off here for you guys there is very much a strong discoloration um at the very top of all that distillate and so because of that i'm definitely gonna have to give them a score in the low you know uh between a five and a six to be honest i think the product quality when it comes to the flavor the high the way that it's branded and packaged and the high thc nature i think all that adds up to an experience that should be very good um but we definitely want to make sure that we're keeping people safe and or making sure that their questions are uneasiness uh those kinds of things are not you know taken care of and or these kind of problems are just non-existent so because of that and this specifically five to six out of ten super rough score but you know like i said uh just make sure you guys talk to the bartender always ask to see the packaging day always ask to see the harvest date for a lot of things that'll help you guys avoid getting product that might be bad expired or going bad or whatever it is so jfing here coming at you guys live man west coast week 2 review we keep it real we keep it honest it's not always great but it's good feedback so i love you guys i'll see y'all down the road 5.6 five to six five point six whatever y'all want to do out of ten care company i'll see y'all down the road love you guys peace", "scGAVkRL_18": "hey everyone I'm Kristin and today i'm going to be reviewing Applejack from VZ USA vaping zone com um it's there Applejack it's 18 milligrams of nicotine 10 milliliter bottle um I think it was 899 um one hundred percent VG so gives off tons of liquid it's amazing um so it's kind of like a UH no let's see it's kind of like if you're into like a mild to medium tobacco with like hints of Apple then this is exactly what you're looking for it's I don't know the apple case it's crisp it's flavorful and the tobacco it's not a lot of tobacco so it's not overpowering like I'm into I'm not really into normal cigarettes I hated when I used to smoke I hated normal cigarettes I hated them if they just taste like tobacco I didn't like them I was a menthol smoker I never smoked flavorful cigarettes there was just not my not my thing but this is amazing like I could vape all day long with this um let's get started the babe is there as you can see there's a lot but I like it I like being able to see the bait I like being able to you know have the sense that I'm still smoking just because I've only been vaping for about I don't know about four months and so I still have I still like to see the bait I still like to see the smoke I said I but this smell and the taste in this is so much better than a regular cigarette so the smell is outstanding it smells like a crisp apple it smells like your grandma just took out an apple pie and the out of the oven it's warm and yummy and it gives you that yummy feeling inside your tummy and so it's definitely something that I could see myself vaping all day every day but if you're not into do this type of tobacco or flavored tobacco or anything like that it's definitely something that you could try at night you know when you need that nice little sweet kick when your sweet tooth starts yelling at you're saying it needs something this is definitely something that you could try vaping at night and it would be wonderful to go to sleep after just vaping a hot apple pie so um yeah I don't know I really like this it's awesome it is awesome and I give them props for coming up to something like this um vaping zone it's um this is actually my boyfriend's liquid and um he ordered it and I've just been stealing it vaping all of it so whatever but um he ordered it about 13 14 days ago and we just got it today so um they had some issues with the post office I guess and so I mean things happen but there was just they didn't um compensate by anything that I'd say I'm sorry I apologize nothing we just found an email saying oh I'm sorry something happen with the post office is now that we can do about it we're opening a case about it so and then the next day they emailed saying that they had that they're rafar resending out another package so it didn't really make sense and i got the sake of compensate you know free is awesome but I mean something we were expecting anything it's just that when we opened it and there was really like no apology not even a 5 million tunnels I think it was kind of disappointing and not getting like a personal email saying you know I'm sorry we had some issues but other than that um they're like words good so um if you would like to try this it's called apple jack it's a hundred percent VG and it is from vaping zone com thank you and I appreciate you guys watching my videos I know I'm new so I don't really know what I'm talking about or what I'm doing but I plan to get better and I love doing these I love informing people on on new things so they bond lovers", "oRA0I_MagQI": "what's up YouTube this is I start images back with another review this is another church cart so church cannabis company super premium cannabis distill it adjustable airflow cartridge advanced ceramic coil 510 thread eight watts max ultimate damping experience this one is melon aid it's a sativa has seventy one point four THC and their stickers are so like blurry sorry for the steering wheel part here I didn't realize it was in the video but as I said before these don't fit on my palm battery on my claw or anything like that so I've got a normal stick battery that uses iPhone and Cecil iPhone C cell and Android I believe so church cart melon aid I'm just going to get right into this hopefully everyone had a great Monday everyone enjoyed the day four before all the rain hit it's raining again now come on so slides got locking mechanisms on it but yeah we uh pretty much finished our work day before the rain kicked in so and then came home and hung out with my son and my girl for a little bit and now now we're gonna do review I know that doesn't really because I not have a white background um as I said before on the last one I did these carts seem pretty solid reusable the top looks like it just twists off the airflow piece as I said there's like three little dots inside but uh we're just gonna get right into it see what this one's about the other church is pretty good I I don't even remember the flavor of that one I haven't touched it since I did the review so it's just sitting in a box because I've always got my palm battery like even right now let me reach in my pocket I've got my Platinum vape galactic Jack on my palm battery so break out the stick battery so that I can use this because as I said it doesn't fit on the palm it's probably not going to fit on the curve pretty sure it's not going to fit some of the hives and the Hades battery that I had this one looks like it's got a scrape on it or it's cracked one of the two possibly a small little crack you probably can't see it because my phone's not gonna focus but it doesn't seem like any liquids leaking out doesn't seem like there's a lot of residue or anything on the side of the cart so definitely get the melon tastes kind of sweet say like uh almost like the watermelon hubba bubba kind of tastes like that I'm not getting a lemonade as much I don't know if this batteries dying no [ __ ] every time I breathe out my nose I sneeze from these things tasty I'm picking these off her I think 45 apiece I'm not exactly sure what they're being sold for it a lot of the other places the guys telling me 50 60 bucks I didn't do any research on it yet but I will but until I can you know make the drive down to it to a dispensary or one of my friends houses so that they can run for me pretty much I'm just at the mercy of you know the dude I go through but he's been getting pretty damn good [ __ ] so I can't really complain yeah pretty good pretty good pretty good very tasty this one's actually a pretty good taste probably got to charge the battery so I can get big big hits but yeah if any of you like Church comment below with what flavors that you want to see me try to review pretty much any of that stuff any other car brands like I still got to get my hands on the Select do a couple reviews on that I still want to try those Rove ones but I still think they're only out in California at the moment I'm not really gonna do any reviews on dang tapes right now just I've had three good and three bed so I'm 50/50 at the moment but you know the only thing I ever really hear about this company now is it there isn't really a company it's just people buying the [ __ ] online and making their own stuff and selling it whether that's true or not I don't know that's just [ __ ] I heard I haven't really heard anything bad about any of these church carts yet other than maybe price but as I said you're paying for this big monstrous cart like I mean it's rugged it's heavy compared to it's heavier than this whole entire battery this little thing is heavier than this these are this is a little bit heavier than just the car other than that the next one will be a review on another north extracts a guy told me about them you know basically told me to go check out some other stuff cleaner products all that kind of stuff so I appreciate his comment and I mentioned it in one of my last videos I don't know if I posted it yet but this one is uh max 69 one gram but I'll get into all of that in the actual video but as I said hopefully you guys all had a great day today at a fun relaxing weekend with family girlfriend whoever hopefully you smoked down on some good [ __ ] and just enjoying life pretty much seems all work no play these days you know I'm sure a lot of you can relate to that it seems I could just work in work to pay bills and you don't really get to go out and do much just on the money cuz bills just eat eat that [ __ ] especially if you got kids but uh yeah if you guys don't line smash that subscribe button hit the like button comment below if you've had these Church or any of you have tried this one let's talk about it if there's some other flavors in this specific brains you would like me to try I'm open to try pretty much any one of them but yeah I'm probably going to end up be selling these most likely to my brother nothing nothing against them I just I enjoy what I have so when I have a family member or a friend or someone said that they want some the ones that are just sitting in a box doing nothing are the ones I'm gonna sell it's not that this is a bad flavor it's not like the other one was a bad flavor I just overall prefer a lot of the newer plant invades some of the Midnight Express flavors but that's just personal opinion at the moment there's just so much out there to try for me to me you know just general statement the ones that I like at the moment but yeah I also really like flavor XO eventually I'm gonna get my hands on some more of those and review some of those for you guys especially since they got the new packaging the new flavors that kind of stuff but as I said you guys have a great night take it easy I appreciate you guys watching

it's gonna be dope so see you guys soon and stay loaded", "MeVzVvDGnOI": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to take a look at the number one most common problem that you'll have with your vape pen and cartridge and how to quickly fix it so what you want to do to start is unscrew your cartridge from your pen and take a look at the two connectors there sometimes they can become too recessed of whether its packaging or being screwed down too tight and it's really easy to fix to bring it out so you'll want to grab a paper clip and just gently catch underneath the edge of the connector and tug on it very gently to make sure you don't pull it up too hard you can damage the cartridge that way so be careful and once you catch an edge you can work around the entire lip there so that it's in a nice proper position for it to emotion correctly with the battery next we're going to move on to the battery and repeat the same process we're gonna work underneath the connector here and ring it up nice and gently you don't need to apply much pressure again and once you catch that same edge just work around nice and slow so that you don't have an uneven space for the connectors that you're touching [Music] so it should be all ready to go here and we're gonna grab our cartridge and screw it back in the cartridges don't need to be screwed down too tightly for it to work once it's there you should have a green light ready to go all right guys thanks for watching [Music]", "C6-FVBebXdo": "guys my name is Joey I'm here at discount vape pen and today we gonna be talking about the new cloak [Music] alright guys so like I told you earlier in the video there's a new cloak by Hamilton devices is gonna be a new discreet cartridge battery device I mean the screen I mean very very discreet so inside the package you're gonna have your little note right here it's gonna tell you a little bit about the extractions and how to use this device but after this video you should definitely have a good understanding so we have a small little device that looks like a pod vape and it's basically just posed to act like a pod fate and it'll show you that in a second so right there you don't have a USB port you have your little uh helmets in the device shark right there this is a little design logo top of is gonna be the mouthpiece and then that's it now you're asking yourself how you gonna put the cartridge in easy you gonna slide this right over so it's a two-piece alright guys so like I said this is a two-piece device so there's gonna be the mouthpiece and a little place where the Karcher is gonna go in there's the magnet that holds the top and then right here you don't see this is where the connection is that's your 510 it is the auto auto draw the device because there's no burning so you want to take this cartridge there's gonna screw it right on it's a lot of threads guys now once is on all you got to do is take another piece right there slide it down push and we're done so right here you won't have two different size cartridge you have the point 5 mil in the hole 1 mil this does the fit both size and it fits a magnitude of different size cartridges as well so just like I showed you earlier you won't screw it on stays in place pop the cover over and we're done so this device is a 500 milliamp battery so it does have enough power that'll last you all day without having any issues or run into a charger and the way it works is there's no just ability to it it just goes by the battery power so it's fully charged he's gonna hit at 4.2 volts once the decrease in charge it lowers the power of voltage so like I said guys fully charged which this it does gonna hit at 4.2 volts so all you got to do is press your lips against that little mouthpiece inhale and they'll activate and I'll show you that right there and it hits pretty freakin hard at 4.2 volts definitely recommend this oh guys like I said earlier this device is pretty awesome small and discreet and I've been reading the comments it was cvd car just calm down guys so uh you know where to pick this up right discount Bay pen comm same day free shipping it's gonna be $29.99 pick it up while supplies last [Music] [Applause] you", "eC4XsUNW2_I": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome back to a TC spot Here I am bringing you a half gram cartridge Himalaya life resin sauce cart yeah

very tasty very very tasty it has a very pleasant gelato flavor doesn't seems like candy I love that the fact that it doesn't taste all artificial instead you know [ __ ] that [Music] so yeah this cart definitely tastes like some sauce I feel like if I'm hitting a puff coal or a rig on very low temp settings I can taste the gelato very good flavor no breath inhale very smooth I'm not sure what I caught I think that was just mean but very tasty pretty pretty pretty good head high pretty click that change sorry yep I can see the cloud because of the way the cameras position I'm getting some crazy clouds imma turn it up to the highest setting and we're gonna wrap it up real soon right it's getting up in here all crazy oh that's all bad there we go I said he was definitely stronger on that higher setting tastes like straight sauce I like it live resin solace cars check them out in Malaya good head high this is a hybrid gelato 33 doesn't taste like frickin candy straight taste like flour oh yeah for sure job can't see the cloud I like the fact that tastes like I'm Annie no [ __ ] bad so it's getting pretty hot I'm gonna get up out of here yo this is just embarrassing reading over here starting his [ __ ] sweat I just wanted to give you guys a quick little review on the Himalaya get yourself up there high in the mountains all right that's core beats to see spot thank you for watching peace", "21X3JqB2EBM": "welcome to the basement [Music] yes what's up new to guess what man we back today and today we're gonna do a review on something a little different got this little package today of course I got the little sticker and everything like that that always comes with to the phone's product but today we're gonna do the Twitter phone's be calm and not only we're going to do the favicon but it came in this nice case so then if you're gonna go and it says it's a travel case so I don't know if you could take you on the plane I'm not going trying to do that so this is the travel case this is the car this is the gelato number 33 to see what this bottle looks like is it thick okay thanks see my house is kind of cool right now got my a/c on it's 90 degrees outside and gorge yourself when I got this out the mailbox the box was actually hot so maybe I'll all use a little thicker but it still looks pretty good so I'm gonna start here of course we got the tweeter phone's battery that comes with it charge it that has the little tweeter phones logo on it which is cool this really looks cool it's rad so let's put this together and see we working here I know this thing should have some charge on it we're gonna test it out so it does have charge it has three voltage settings and the way you change the voltage you press the button here three times now let's see with a song okay that's green I think Green is the medium that's blue that's a lower setting and that's red so actually it's the other way around I think but whatever it is and you press it two times to preheat so now is preheating we're gonna stop that way I wanted to get to and not a bad taste not a bad taste tastes almost like it has mint in it and let's look at the it also comes with the letter to law enforcement of course I love having that this is how to here tells you how to operate that animals and this product has 65 point 93% cannaboids and the total CBD percentage is 65 point 87 percent Wow that's a lot okay so this is not the full special product or a broad spectrum so right now we're dealing with discipline so that's what this is all about right here so this product here is good to calm you down you know if you have anxiety or if you just want to relax this is what this is good for it doesn't taste bad I also want to try a few different flavors so I kind of like it me as far as the effects I'm really not getting too much of an effect in it that was my second time pulling on it so give me a minute I'll let you guys know how I felt but it doesn't taste bad that's the most important part I know I heard a lot of people complaining about I hate the way it paints and this one doesn't taste bad the Delano 33 pretty good good job three two forms I'm just waiting to see how that this affects me right now I've had anything today I didn't smoke any flower no CBD babe juice because I do they I'm starting to feel a little calm now all that CBB inside here it's not a work already yeah absolutely so it was definitely doing what it's supposed to do I'm feeling a little calm or a little better than what I did when I first started shooting this video so you know I got a weap calling this over meanness all we really do with this thing here man I like it so I'm definitely gonna be ordering some more cards from Twitter forms few other companies I'm gonna try them all out you know I'll let you guys know exactly how this thing goes be back with you in a few feet", "JDeOMn_ZpuQ": "yo guys what's going on I don't know if y'all notice but it's been a minute since I

that video so this is gonna be a fun one this is gonna be a great one um the reason I was gone is I had a lot of school I had to do some I was working I'm still working now but I was I was getting a lot of support on the last videos I didn't think I was planning on smoking anymore or doing any more videos but like I said there was a ton of support I'm at like 47 subscribers you guys are killing

so y'all know it's gonna be fire already and since I haven't smoked in two weeks I'm about to get dumb blasted so I'm pretty excited uh the THC is running in at ninety point four five percent here which is pretty dang insane right there lets you look at the blocks for a second and I won't focus so you can't read it but there you go it says here it's supposed to tape tastes like grape sweet and earthy so that's cool and it's supposed to give you a relaxed happy euphoric feeling so that's cool they say it right there on the box I don't have planned videos for the next few we got two of them right here if you know their colors you know whether they're in because the TVs are hybrids its blah blah blah those will be coming here pretty soon um yeah so like I said it's been a minute so might seem like a little weird of a review I'm kind of trying to get back into it trying to think of how how I did it so let's just uh let's go ahead and pop this bad boy open here ah [ __ ] so actually let me tell you because I always see hey seam reviews on whatever it is and not knowing the price so the dispensary I went to was Metro meds I here in Phoenix Arizona let's see this select God gift cart right here I paid $80 for this but it was a buy one get one basically so to 480 it wasn't a biome but they always do two for 80 deals so yeah so I got this and then I got another full gram for 80 bucks so 40 bucks each basically and then I got a eighty sativa yeah well I'll tell you guys now I got a higher no that's anyway I got a hybrid half gram here which I don't think I I might have reviewed a hybrid I don't quite remember I'll have to go back and look at those um I just was charging this pen a little bit it wasn't getting full charge and I charged it for like 10 20 minutes so I don't know that's alright though uh well let's go ahead and pop this bad boy open oh no I remember you guys you kind of got to open it from the bottom these parts because if there's some long ass fingers to get to the top for some reason and poke it out stupid ass blocks and [ __ ] blah blah yeah maybe not you know this box isn't even childproof and I can't even get through it Jesus okay there we go there we go wow it's been a minute since I have touched a cart let alone a full gram cart that is one big [ __ ] that's good okay just real quick I wanted to say this cuz I was thinking about it if I don't have a video in the next few days it's because it's gonna be hard for me to it's gonna take a minute for me to get adjusted and smoke a full gram pretty fast so I'm not gonna quit again it's just gonna take a minute for me to get this done and then put out a new one so [ __ ] I'm very excited because I mean I know it's have to give me like the craziest high in the world but hopefully it should smack me pretty goddamn well um let's go ahead and screw it on the dr. zodiacs chew Moonrock clear battery there hi you already know I like that little fine point tip better than those round

cards for for taste that's for those nicotine vapor guys sucks to beat them and they're getting [ __ ] end of the stick people are dying from these poisonings and these black-market cards and these

all right guys back here for another freaking video you already know what it is and if you don't know my name my name is shakka zulu um thanks for freaking watching the video clicking on the video but um today is going to be another freaking review but today i'm going to review um a strain that the people from my freaking live stream wanted me to freaking try out and it is runs guys finally got me one of those rent carts because um a lot of people in my live stream said do the runs over the lemonade and then also like i bought this mainly because a lot of people um saw me do the geo pin and i showed that they had runs for geopin and they want me to do the runs for geopin but i don't want to use the geopin so i just got the 510 thread one so i got the oh obama runs guys let's go but before i get into it you know your boy has to take a rip smoking on the roach right now [Music] and if you haven't seen the video on this i made a video on this it's a disposable um cartridge it's called a roach if you want to check that out it's up there on the screen in the corner but um let's get into it guys so i decided to do runs and runs is actually powered by cookies guys there are um a couple brands that are powered by cookies maybe more but the three main brands are runs lemonade and mints if you guys are cookies fans you kind of know those are the main strains that are the main companies that are powered by cookies but um today we just got the runs and whoo and the runts is also let me sit down for a second let me let me walk over here and sit down so the runts is a lot it's a live sauce i'm pretty sure that's what you call it or it's just a sauce car period as you can see it's kind of golden it's not as dark as a live resin but it's pretty dark and that's because of the added terps if you guys don't know the difference between a disc jillet and a sauce cart it's not much of a difference but distillate when you make distillate usually all the original terpenes are taken out when you make that distillate so what they do to make a sauce cart is they add terpenes back into it to make it a sauce so it's distillate basically with terpenes in it let me get you guys a close-up real quick so you can see the golden goodness today i got the runts and i also have another lemonade but that'll be in another vlog i'll let you guys know when that drops soon before i go into that hit actually let me freaking tell you guys the content in it so it says thca 10 53 milligrams it says delta 9 thc 55 278 milligrams and then it says cbd two milligrams so we got delta tac and then taca they don't even have just you know usually they just have thc on it but they're actually telling you the type of thc that is in this pack so i'm gonna just take this first rib you know just to get the taste and everything and then i'll take a blinker head for you guys because you know i gotta take a blinker head every time i get a new car i gotta take a blinker head at least one on the new cart so let's go okay so off top this is definitely very terpe very sweet and if i didn't say so before it's obama runs it's actually not that bad guys [Music] [Music] so yeah guys man this [ __ ] is like definitely very terpy you can definitely taste the terps but it's also earthy at the same time so maybe it's actually freaking terps that are derived from the actual strain that they made the cart with but it's freaking fire guys oh my goodness this is way better than definitely way better than the last strain that i got i think it was called like metal in or something like that i'll put it on the screen the strain but fire shout out to runs i make some good ass [ __ ] powerball cookies but yeah guys it's just a chill day um today i'm just relaxing i just got off of work got back home you feel me i might live stream i don't know but if you guys want me to live stream like i said man i say this in every vlog comment live stream flood the freaking um comment section with live streams

another video with your boy sebby g man ding literally before i turned on my camera i was sitting on my desk and i looked at the date and i was like yo literally the year is going to come to an end already bro and i feel like this year i i feel like i could speak for everybody but this year has been super super super crazy i feel like me personally i had a lot of ups i had a lot of downs but you guys know man this year 2020 was definitely a crazy turn for i feel like of the majority of us all right guys so without further ado guys we're hopping into today's topic which is i'm gonna be i'm going to be presenting to you what i believe to be the best cartridge battery out in 2020 okay so as a cartridge viewer you really do end up trying so many different products in terms of batteries and stuff like that and me personally in the year 2020 i feel like i've tried literally over 50 batteries and in my videos i don't choose to show every single one of those products i like to minimalize it and really show you guys the only ones that i feel are worth it so the one that i felt like was more worth it this year the one that really caught my attention the most that really saved me when it came to cartridges was this battery right here all right guys so this one right here is called the toki 510 thread cartridge battery and it's one of my favorite batteries man it has so many features from wireless charging all that good stuff but the main feature that i like the most is the fact that it saves your oil so much more than any other batteries guys just because of the fact that it has a five to six um second draw limit i believe and i don't know what they do in that drop but literally you still get those super fat milky clouds so you're really not missing out on anything right so i'm gonna go ahead and take a hit for you guys i got myself a little live resin cartridge sitting nice and pretty on here so without further ado cheers guys like i said you still get those super fat clouds that you need in order to get super super big this battery right here literally has saved me from having to buy so many cartridges guys like literally i did the math and let me show you guys for an example right so this one right here is the alpine live resin cartridge the last time that you guys saw this on a video was i believe two to three weeks ago maybe a little bit more and guys i've only been using it on this battery after that video so every single time that i take a hit it's off of this toki battery and i must say that after three to four weeks of having this cartridge look at the oil look at the oil literally one of the things that they pride themselves in is being able to conserve the consumer's oil and i think that's super amazing because they actually did it man they actually found a way to adjust the battery so it's not overheating your oil and it still gives you the perfect hit but with that being said man i think literally they probably saved me at least a couple hundred to a thousand dollars this year just off of their battery alone and the fact that i could literally just still be using these cartridges on the daily without having to waste them within a day or two using that on the blue setting now we're gonna go ahead and hit it on the purple setting me personally i feel like the purple setting on this battery is the best setting to get the perfect super nice milky clouds and it brings out the terpene profiles out the most because it's a higher voltage but for me i like the hotter hits that way i could get baked a little bit more easier alright so without a doubt cheers [Music] oh my gosh dude one of the best things this year has to be the fact that a lot of companies came out with live resin cartridges and i must say man live resin really is a game changer from going to disney to live resident is super super phenomenal man just because i feel like live resin has such a better taste than dislike does and aside from the battery itself guys they also provide you with literally just about everything that you can possibly need when having a cartridge session all right so first off i'm gonna i'm gonna show you guys what the first products were when they launched the battery but they have the portable charger right here usually you could use this with your phone but i think the better way to use it is whenever your cartridge is dead on the go you can always keep this portable charger in your car and literally just use it and never have to worry about a dead battery again the next product is going to be something that literally no one no one has done and turkey was the first one in this game from what i've seen to be the first to introduce this right here this right here is a wireless portable charger all right guys so pretty much all you have to do with this is you just have to line it up with the toki symbol and then it's going to start charging for you which is phenomenal man because i don't know how many times i have i i personally hate having to plug in chargers sometimes i can't even find my charger so being able to just leave this as at your desk with the convenience of just boom plopping it on top and it instantly starts to charge that's super super super satisfying for me super minimalistic not having to carry around a charging cable with me everywhere i go and um yeah man i love this this probably has to be one of my favorite things that they've released all right guys and last up on the list guys we have the most newest addition to the toki family which is this bad boy right here this is the toki 510 wax cartridge and you're thinking like whoa they sell wax cartridges too yes they sell wax cartridges but it's not your normal wax cartridge this one right here is a super high grade material wax cartridge it doesn't have any distillate or wax already in it basically you attach it to your toki battery and then inside it has its own little coils right there i think i still have some wax in there from the last video i made on it has some coils right there on the bottom and literally you could just be taking dabs or you could be hitting your cartridge right guys so the fact that they came out with this attachment in the year 2020 was super super phenomenal man because i feel like the year 2020 was the year that a lot a lot a lot of tech for the cannabis community came out and i was super super happy to get my hands on this one right here because i feel like like i said this is the best battery of the year 2020. it saved so many cartridges for me they

had like a little bit more of a a greenish kind of color almost like a almost like a greenish hint to the way it looks that is not what I've seen in most the other select cards they seem to have the more orangish color seems pretty consistent across the carts this is la con this came in LA Confidential came in at 85% and it is an indica and I haven't hit it yet and as always with the select elite carts they come with the plastic tops e-cell leave its the m60 and I like these only thing I don't like about them is you cannot refill them and if something goes wrong which is rare but if it does they're very difficult to open but take some hits and see how the effects are painted on vessel battery yeah and the taste is whatever not really the best tasting cart not terrible though either it's a decent taste it does taste a little bit different than the other select cards I would say the other ones do taste a little better than this one I gotta say though in the effects yeah it's it's strong it's a strong cart and it doesn't really feel super energetic but you can feel the effects and it doesn't make you too tired but yeah yeah it's potent definitely potent so overall on this select elite LA Confidential review I would give it two thumbs up I'd say it's a good cart if you're really looking for taste though I would say this one doesn't taste that great and select in general doesn't taste that great I like because it's strong but this doesn't even taste as good as most the other select carts that are out there but overall on the strength it's great so I'd still give it two thumbs up thanks for watching guys is DAP connection and have a great week", "lhn0Og7STns": "what's up YouTube this is I start images back with another review I'm reshooting this one because my girlfriend came in and started talking to me right when I was about to end it I don't have any of the edit [ __ ] or any of that pretty sure I could do it on my phone I just haven't learned how to use the app yet but this one's gonna be a product review on Mary's medicinals this one is a hybrid sugar cookies it says that it's eighty four point zero three percent THC zero CBD production date was seven twenty six nineteen it's got a batch number used by seven twenty six twenty psi psi labs tested eight eight nineteen it's got a test batch number and a national poison Control Number all on the side of the box you know a lot of people are saying if it doesn't have stickers like this in this day and age chances are you might be buying something fake even if you're not they say that the chance is greatly increased we'll see how the future of all of the [ __ ] goes but on the back ingredients2 still cannabis oil and natural Terps national poison control number instructions inhale exhale repeat as needed well that's self-explanatory but that's kind of cool he put it on the box act says made in a marijuana facility activation zero to five minutes the sticker blocks the rest of this but it says clean and potent no filters fillers or whatever the [ __ ] that says there's a phone number and then where it's located manufactured by Joyce labs for $4.99 Phelps Drive Jackson Michigan that is also the same place that platinum vapes gets their stuff manufactured also I know that because it says it right right here on the back of the box reason I was kind of gonna cover that is because I'm trying not to show other products in other product videos so if I'm doing a review on this I shouldn't be showing their competitors you know it's big market but obviously they want you know these people would want me to show only their product so I'm promoting what I like and what I dislike about their stuff says contrary to popular belief we're just gonna jump right into this because as I've said I already did a video and record in pretty much and then the interruption so on the bottom he's got like a little pull to him slide it out and it just falls out of here let's put this on take a few more ribs and talk about it it's a little darker than some of the other liquids I've been getting the bubble doesn't move fast at all maybe a little bit quicker than some of the other ones but pretty much right on par I prefer the other tips that the MKX and the Platts have at the moment but these aren't bad I prefer these over like the wood tips but as I said once again that's just personal opinion at the end of the day I've had people tell me m'kay our cards are better with the black tip and it's like it's [ __ ] oil inside of a card doesn't matter what the [ __ ] cart is unless it's some new technology and he's gonna answer me on that so obviously the answer is no it's still a C cell card for C cell battery but how I would describe the flavor on this one was like eating some fresh-baked cookies like almost like why it's still gooey like you know it's not quite hardened it's real gooey you almost have to eat it with a spoon like cuz you took it off way too early it's like eating somebody cooked cookie dough because that's exactly what it is but it's like almost still got that uh that dough taste to it but yeah marries medicinals I definitely recommend them I'm sure somebody's going to come out of the woodwork and tell me some bad stuff about them but that's the kind of stuff I want to hear at first it's gonna just be rumors gonna go in one ear and out the other I'm gonna enjoy the products as I see fit I'm gonna talk to him to people about them as I as I ingest them as I try them but you know I don't hear a lot of that stuff because you know it's just all this hit the market I'll [ __ ] it let me give it something so I'll grab him and then I come and do a video for you guys about it so if three months ago they had a thing where they had a recall on something I wouldn't know that at the moment because as I said I don't know anybody that smoked these tried them I haven't heard the head reviews I haven't heard heard good reviews but my review so far he's good there's medicinals one out of one hybrid good taste is there the potencies there the product design is good it's kind of it's not quite as high-tech but it reminds me of the Rove packaging with the way the thing slides out I only know that because I've seen him in videos I've never tried those either sugar cookies Mary's medicinals stupid fly just good recommend it if you can get your hands on it try it apparently there's two new flavors applies out there I want those thanks Jim I have a Mary's medicinals Durbin poison sativa I will read the label and everything in the actual video I do it that one but uh yeah so far so good after I try the other one if they're two for two I'll definitely keep trying their products I'll definitely recommend them you know it's worth a try you may not like them like I do you know I know a lot of people that really like big gasps I think I had one of their carts that I liked and I didn't really like the others I still know people that like [Music] dang babes and it's like I there three four three out of the six I've tried I liked three of them and I hated the other three and for me to hate you know Girl Scout cookies Strawberry Cough like these are some strains that I've had back in the day I loved him in the flavor acts and the others it was really good so I know it all comes down to personal preference and choice but uh you can't get your hands on Platts or MKX or any of the others that you prefer to get your hands on and they have these give them a go I do not think you're gonna be disappointed I really don't there's I said I will speak on this one in a different video I may hate this one I don't know I doubt it though my sugar cookies two thumbs up go try it get it if I feel like I'm looking a bit antsy like to go it's cuz I gotta run out to my boys house as soon as I'm done with this video hook him up with probably the sugar cookies and I'm care crazy train is gonna have to remember they're not flash [ __ ] like that in other videos um but that seems to be the choice at the moment and then I may get my hands on some other waxes in a little while to do some reviews on those so peace all guys have a fantastic weekend hit the subscribe button smash the like button comment below let's chitchat a talk about anything you want anything I may not know much about whatever you want to talk about but as I could say I could learn something new so if you're in I don't [ __ ] know certain video games comic books like an anime are [ __ ] just weed in general different weed brands like might raise token tall clothes we did whatever I don't [ __ ] care well then have to hood peace out guys I am very pleasantly high right now so the only thing I've hidden really all day is the sugar cookies and it's probably that was probably my six hit of it because I did I heard it three times in the first video I don't remember if I hit it two or three times in this one but whatever peace out enjoy the rest of your weekend guys", "rJMjnifYgts": "hey guys what's up my name is Mary I look like [ __ ] right now so I'm not really going to show myself but hello I'm here anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "ZCkNfKLYP0Y": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films and I am back at you with another legal cartridge review here today in Illinois I have my hands on a phenol 51 250 milligrams high supply vape pen by Cresco this is a disposable I thought I would review the Cresco high supply line of products check one out to see if it's worthwhile again this is a quarter of a gram and it's gonna come out to like 35 to 40 bucks after-tax still which should be like full Grande prices as far as I'm concerned but prices are not good in terms of quality this one really smacked though it got me very high with just one hit at a time it was like a one-hit wonder very potent good medicine packaging says it's like 75 point 8 percent THC so does pack a good punch if that is an accurate measuring I don't know if it's a Fino 51 specific strain thing it doesn't say that name on the packaging so I'm not entirely sure how that works but overall this has got a really skunky cannabis smell - it smells like flower got a nice taste to it kind of citrus and skunk overall very much so like chirpy flower doesn't really taste artificial at all but the high is very good so this is good medicine it's a little cheaper than the regular liquid live resin so if you're looking for trying the Cresco experience but don't want to spend this might be a good option for you that's all I got a safe today yeah let me know what you think and if you've tried these in the comments stay safe", "mZYhjVY_v4M": "celina how do W babes cartridges and batteries work well we have two different types of batteries so I'm gonna start with the direct inhale and what you do is you take our cartridge which actually have an indica hybrid or sativa marking on them so IH RS which is great because you don't want to confuse your sativas with your and indica is correct yeah you don't want to grab your sativa when you're trying to go to sleep so you know that was a big request that we got so we just added that and it really helps people be able to differentiate so you want to be sure you know remove this little silicone cap on the end and the direct inhale batteries they come to in a package and they have a handy little USB charger and they are there goes right into your computer correct any USB charger will do or your computer yeah any USB plug so the direct inhale you just take it and it's got a 5-10 universal thread on it so you just screw it right on and then you take a drag so and it just works right from inhaling it just works right from inhaling exactly so you don't have to do anything and so when you're done with it or the battery runs out you go over and since there's two you have this you have your backup charging you just take that one off then you put the other one on the charger and you're ready to go that's great and how long does it take to charge about 30 minutes okay that's not too long yeah and then we have the push button battery which some people tend to prefer because it's a little bit of a bigger stronger battery and you get a little bit of a bigger hit from it okay and so what you do is same thing you just screw it on and you'll want to hit the button five times some people they'll just take it and screw it on and forget to hit the button and they'll think it's not working yeah so you want to make sure you hit the button five times and it'll link three times to let you know it's on and then you take a drag and the other cool thing about our cartridge our cartridges is that we have a central pole that we designed in order to help heat up the oil because the cannabis oil is much thicker than you know regular oils that you know these cartridges were originally designed for so interesting and so it doesn't heat it more thoroughly as you guys eat it more thoroughly and quickly okay so you get a nice big hit you don't have to keep warming it up and so when you're done with the push-button version do you have to turn it off you do you have to push up five times again to turn it off because you don't want it rolling around in your pocket each time you hit the button it'll make the battery you know have a little bit less of a charge yeah and to is the is the charging time exactly the same for push-button model as the direct inhale they're both about thirty minutes yeah it's pretty quick that's great well all good information thanks so much you", "IxckcK20ET8": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're gonna be doing some OpenCart surgery I'm just kidding we launched we've all been there a kit that is gonna take care of a problem that I know everybody who's in oil vaporizers has encountered which is your vaping your favorite cartridge and all of a sudden it stops working or you're vaping it down to where oil is no longer going into the orifice holes and you have a bunch of your valuable oil stuck at the bottom of the cartridge or your heater gives out or your disposable runs out of battery life but you have a cartridges no longer functioning which still has some of your precious oil CBD e-juice terpenes whatever and you want to try to excavate them so what honey stick did it was we made it really easy for you by launching our oil recovery kit which is everything that you need to help get a non-functioning cartridge that still has valuable oil in it out of the kit in today's episode we're gonna briefly run through the contents of this kit and how to use it to excavate oil out of your cartridge now just to backtrack a little bit the way that that we got this idea is actually one of our authorized distributors and my buddy Darrell over a rich mountain distribution he sent me a picture which I'm gonna make the video guy find and put up here on the YouTube screen as it said modern-day roaches and it showed a bunch of vape cartridges that are you know like quarter full or half full and not working laying around like you know people would have these Roach jars of these little collections of people have these little graveyards of non-working cartridges and vape accessories with oil left and so I was like man I showed that a couple of our employees just to get a laugh out of it and they were like oh I have one of those I have one of those I was like wow you know everybody must have one of those so let's make something to try to bring those non-working vape devices or the valuable contents in them back to life hence our oil recovery kit and let's make it affordable and easy to use so oil recovery kit available on WWE stay calm is gonna be selling for under ten bucks if you use the promo code that I'll give you guys at the end of the video you get an extra couple bucks off so let's jump right into what the kids contents are and how we generally use it so just to come this real simple plastic container which a lot of stores that because we whole sale and distribute a lot can have them just hanging in the stores so they have a little hanger here you're gonna get your kit you're gonna have your contents of the kit on the back let's get a little close-up so two filling syringes four blunt tips two syringe caps and some VG PG solution so let's go ahead and jump right in you just gonna open your kit and it's gonna slide right out you're gonna have a nice tray to keep all your stuff organized in and you're gonna have a really nice large instruction card here that basically explains very simply how to use this kit but we're gonna go through all this in the video so let's even though I briefly ran off the contents let's go through what we have here so you have two syringes these are two medical grade plastic syringes that you can use and this is used for excavating or rejecting your oils now these syringes they have a thread on them right in here which you will screw your your syringe blunt tip the into nice and firmly to pull pull the oil out or to re-inject the oil and when you're not using it if you have any oils in them you're gonna have these syringe caps right here which you're going to be able to use to seal up your syringe to make sure that you have no leaking all right so let's go through what type of blunt tips we have and what really they're used for on this side over here you have different you have different lengths of syringe needles because you're gonna have different cartridges and different devices where you might have to get down either deeper into the device or you might need a skinnier device to work with because certain cartridges for example they have a center post which doesn't give you that much space along the edges so you might need a skinnier needle to fit down in there or with certain cartridges you might have a thicker oil that you need a wider gauge needle just so that you can draw it out so here we have our thinnest gage oil and I'm going to use this just to kind of pry out here you have a very thin gauge needle let's get a close-up of that this is like a teal green color in our kit very thin it's about a about an inch in length the the shaft here is about an inch and a half and then no it's about an inch and it has a very thin opening you're not going to want to use this for any oils that are really thick you would mainly want to use this for thinner terpenes or for very thin oils or for CBDs or even for a liquid if you have it trapped in a cartridge don't use this for thicker oils and you might also be forced to use this if you have a very thin area between a cartridge and a center post to excavate your oils so this is a needle used for those devices now if we come down here to the gray needle blunt needle tip you'll notice it is slightly wider but the shaft here is only about half an inch now what you would use this for is you'd use this for slightly thicker oils or CBDs cartridges that aren't very deep because when you get down inside the cartridge the oil is more than likely to be trapped around the bottom so this would be more for larger tanks that have very open areas Torrey you can actually put the whole needle down in there to excavate your oil and this is also a good needle tip that is used for dispensing oil so once you've recovered your oil from being able to shoot it back into your cartridge because it's a very small it's a very agile you know you can you can point it down into places you don't have to worry about using something that is much longer that might be a little bit clumsy or when you're dispensing your oil so that's what you would use this needle for here it's a blunt needle tip so here we have four even thicker oils you have your kind of a kind of a Shrek green colored cartridge here or you know like a little Oscar the Grouch shade you have a thicker needle with a longer base this is gonna be for also for excavating out much thicker oils so the thickness and the needle you're gonna use for what type of thickness of material you're trying to draw out of your cartridge so make sure that you use the right and you know because if you have too thick of contents you use too thick of a needle it is just not going to draw out or it's gonna be very difficult so you have this needle is slightly thicker then if you come over here to the very far end you have a needle that's slightly thinner but longer so this is probably gonna be one your go-to stand that's why we showcase it because it's nice and long so you can get down inside cartridges it's not overly thick but the ring gauge of this needle is thick enough so it's gonna be all draw up a lot of the the thicker oils or sludgy oils now the other thing that we have that we explained here earlier is your needle covers they're gonna cover your syringes these don't cover the actual blunt needle tips but they will screw in once you've drawn oil out and you you're gonna store a syringe for later use you simply screw it in to the syringe and then it's sealed it makes a nice airtight you don't have to worry about leakage or anything like that you can put it up for storage now here we have some pg/vg solution now before my purists jumped into the comments section of this this video and start saying you don't want to mix out with your oils this is really only to be used in circumstances that you cannot draw the oil out that is too thick you cannot heat up the oils it's not it's not going to come out or there's just too little oil in there so what you would do is you would take some of this pg/vg which is available and you take it you put some into your cartridges close the cartridge up mix it around it'll give you something to draw out because if you're saving oil saving some oil and being able to vape it is better than being able to save no oil and vaping it so this is only really to be used in very difficult circumstances where you're not able to draw your oil or there's not as much oil in there to draw out it's really just you you add it in there you mix it around let it sit for a little bit and then you would go on with your excavation process so there's really for emergency situations where you would have something difficult to draw now let's go into what the procedure would be we're gonna do some much more specific videos of some of the customers if you guys can drop into the comments section below what cartridges you guys have had difficulty with so we can get the type of cartridge and make specific videos for how to excavate oil out of those cartridges that would be really helpful to us and we can make some really specific videos for other people who are having problems with and getting oil out of a specific cartridge how myself or James would go in there and go about maximizing the amount of oils you can salvage out of your cartridge that fail but I'm just gonna run through a real general kind of basic procedure of what you want to go through when you're looking at any cartridge to save some oil and as you guys comment we'll make some more specific videos and get them up here on the channel for you so first thing you want to do is you want to have your cartridge now I have these little styrofoam blocks in our shop because when we're buying a lot of cartridges that are made of glass it's really safe to ship them in these but what you want to do is you want to have a cartridge and you want to have it standing upright on a surface where you can get at it and perform a little bit of perform your excavation process without worrying about the cartridge falling over there falling out of your hand and breaking so these things are just really useful to have you can really easily just cut out a piece of foam or whatever use a small vise or something but you want to have your cartridge standing upright in on a stable area to where you can use both of your hands and not really worry about what you're gonna do this was actually a child lock cartridge so it's locked but you want to have it to where you can access it you can see it and you can use both hands to jump in and perform what you have to perform in there second of all most these oils especially colder temperatures a thicker before you start any excavation process you want to get your oil as viscous as possible you want you want that liquid to flow okay and be as thin as possible so you can pull it out easier so what I recommend is once you have it sitting there get a hairdryer and heat up the cartridge if you're in a warm climate state we're in Florida a lot of you guys are in sunny you know Southern California you can simply just walk outside and leave the cartridge outside for a few minutes and it'll it'll get really nice and thinned out take a hairdryer if you're gonna use a lighter make sure you don't put the lighter directly on the glass or plastic or whatever you're drawing it out of because you could compromise the cartridge you could you know burn it you can have it react with your oils you can melt a plastic one so if you're using a lighter or something be extremely cautious to hold it at a safe distance so you're only using the outside of the heat cone to get your cartridge warm you don't need to get hot you just need to get it warm and then once you're your contents in there they're about as thin as they can be then you're gonna go through and you're gonna select the appropriate tool that is gonna fit down in there but still be thick enough to draw out your liquids if I have a thicker oil that I'm using then I want to make sure that I'm using a nice as we mentioned before a nice wider gage syringe tip blunt needle tip which we're going with Shrek green and you want to make sure that it's gonna fit between the center post this one does fit however because this has an edge here I might want to use something a little bit thinner just so I can really get down into there this one is gonna work a little bit better now the thing is is because this come this specific cartridge comes in so close here I'm never gonna fully get everything that is around the orifice holes I'm if I kind of heat and then I tilt it and I come in at an angle so you're gonna have to play around with each specific cartridge certain other cartridges you're gonna be able to just jump right in there but it really depends on where the where where the base where how the base is how the center post is and how big of an opening you have to work with not each cartridge is gonna be the same you're gonna have to tinker and tamper around with them a little bit which is why I'm really encouraging you guys to drop into the video section brand names of cartridges you guys seem to be having problems with so we can do really cartridge specific videos but I've taken our performer tank for example which has a really open surface that you can get into so it's really not going to be picky as to which blunt needle tip you're gonna work down and get in there with okay and I've even had our sub-ohm which for example if you had a heat or go out and you're trying to pull your oils out I have it open here it's not gonna be picky you could basically fit the whole syringe in there so what you're gonna do is you're gonna select your proper cartridge make sure there's the needle plunger here that's what they call this a plunger it's completely pushed in okay then you could take this and you can make sure that's firmly screwed in there so it's locked in there then once you've made it down heat it up the cartridge you go down in there and you very slowly place the needle down to the bottom but you don't push it down to the bottom to where the needle cannot draw up the oils or get off air this works on air suction from you guys who aren't familiar with it and then you're gonna very slowly just draw up the oils don't reject them and draw them up so that when you're drawing it the oil doesn't get stuck here in the in the the syringe valve and the so as you draw it up the oil is gonna travel up here even if you see that you've pulled all the oils out give this an extra pull so you don't have any oils that are stuck inside the blunt needle tip because if you just take it out of the cartridge and you stop you stop withdrawing and you take this off you can have a significant amount of oil stuck in any portion of here so you want to make sure to keep drawing so the oil makes its way past the blunt needle tip as well as the base and makes its way into the syringe and once you've drawn it out take one of your syringe caps here with the kit take off your blunt needle tip you can drop this in the isopropyl alcohol right away to clean it if you do have some stuck in there then take whatever new cartridge you would be filling it in to use your other syringe [ __ ] it back a little bit screw it on and then push down and it will shoot the oil the air pressure will shoot the oil into whatever the little remaining oils into whatever cartridge you are placing it into so that's just a little tip there once you have this sealed you can store these syringes even though it says discard after use that is for safeties you don't want to be constantly you know mixing stuff but these are cleanable you do have to clean them after every use if you're gonna reuse them we will be selling extra bulk syringes on the website so you guys don't have to buy the whole kit at one shot we will be putting those up a little bit later but this should serve as a very useful kit for those of you who have experimented with cartridges or just any type of oils or CBD mixing or injecting you definitely want to have one of these definitely come in handy I mean we've already had half of our employees have already taken them to go work on their graveyard of cartridges so definitely get a lot of use out of this get it will be available on WWE stay calm make sure to LIKE this video if it

any cartridges you know of any sort for smoking like a some sort of liquid of or oil you know so basically this is showing you how to get this part in clogged because what happens is I'm just one on a little trip to the desert basically and uh it's really too hot to even take these things out there the temperature is like war about you know ranging from a hundred degrees like 110 and riding in the car they see worked okay and even then you can still feel the heat in the car so what happened was the liquid started just heating up too much and it just got filled here like it would get liquefied and I guess I got blocked so if you take a flashlight to your cartridge look in here you'll see it at the block right now mine isn't because well I I kind of just found out my way how to fix it this is um and this may not work with all cartridges as a disclaimer because this is a heavy hitters I'm not sure throw the same like that inside where it's a little bucket and then a narrow hole for where the vacant escape anyway let's just get to tutorial so what you need is a cartridge you gotta need a lighter not preferably a lighter because you don't want to use a tortured you're way too hot and are a liar would be safer so not everybody has torso lighter I recommend having these these are alcohol swabs relying on so I recommend getting a couple of these you can find those at Walmart Walgreens I can't guarantee you will find them out get the which called 99-cent store but if you don't have those you could use like a q-tip or maybe a q-tip what some alcohol higher grade would be better like ninety percent or something anyway first step you want to get your vape and get your vape you're gonna hold at one side I'll show it while recording is call me crazy I'll hold it one side and you get the other you light the lighter you basically have to hold it till this gets hot now you wanna be careful how you're holding it because the liquid will start dripping out so you want to make sure your hands will not be touching the liquid because when it falls out its gonna be like hot cuz it's melting scumbag lava high if it gets on you it's gonna burn so this is just example just to show you but be careful how you are aiming the lighter you don't have to buy it like this to use your hand like that just make sure you're getting the metal part and this will take like maybe about a cool minute you'll know it's gonna be hot enough when you start seeing the the chrome tip starts to look like blackened will start to singe the actual chrome tip doesn't actually burn our mounts because it's metal if it's plastic you know melt and that's not good so don't worry about melting we'll be fine you wanna do this for a minute and then after a while should be hot enough to where the liquid should just see I think I'm pretty good already because you could see the gunk previously that was in it there's all that and it was just uh not good and there is a little bit still there I guess you can see how it blackened around there please do not don't don't touch the chrome tape because that's just gonna be hot so just be careful guys cuz may be doing this you know when you uh that's a little bit mess and your system so just be careful with that and once you're done you're gonna want to get the alcohol wipes and I don't have another one right now I could just reuse this one real quick is still kind of moist last week check this out all right so all you gotta do is I just get that thing oh [ __ ] is still hot you just you might want to wait give it like five minutes let it cool off I not still hot but just for the sake of the video lightly touching it with just the cloth it wasn't super hot but it was still hot enough for her gotta be careful and like I said this one's not as dense but once you use the alcohol swab or this in this case I'm using an alcohol pad just make sure you wipe off any excess side from the lighter and make sure you also another thing is to outside the mouthpiece kind of clean inside just in case so you're not you know getting any of the fumes that you're using the lighter from you know and after that well check the inside make sure it's clear if it is go ahead and give it a test suck you know take a test hit basically and like I said be careful cuz this this is real metal so it's gonna conduct heat it's gonna stay warm basically and I will get another one but I'm recording on my iPhone so I can't like pause and restart the video kind of sucks but I'll give it a test suck real quick just to make sure just kind of want to cool it off because it is really still kind of warm I'm not trying to burn my lips it feels ok to get like a quick heat off of me okay making sure all this is off and it may take a little longer there's not really much of a long process just making sure that you get you empty out all that burnt hardened wax that was in the mouthpiece little hole I kind of just still trying to I'll just put in my fridge real quick you know all right I'm just over here in the freezer just not put it on there but just kind of keep it in here so my hands it's gonna be too hot to still get like a test test it over I may see only just cooling it with the ice now basically by now you will you would have been done already and giving your test to it but yeah basically at this point or just moment I'm you you're your vape should be cleared and you should be able to get a test hit half of it and I show you right now I'll do a quick test in oh one other thing to other thing if you have a second alcohol swab or tab I recommend using it on the bottom of here because sometimes there can be a leakage for some reason because the air I live I've had it where this part will get sticky and you also want to clean the inside or nothing of what you have inside and also make sure make sure you clean that content because of that contact I can't hit this part of the vape it's not going to get any it's not even like conduct any electricity to you know melt the vape and for you to take you know the vape it so make sure you clean the bottom of your cartridge as well as the inside of your vaping ping once you do that make sure there's no leakage or no blockage excuse me do this again I would say started off slow you know right now my pan I could go up to a 4.3 volts which isn't much but honestly it's the perfect amount when I'm using it for right now I'll play like a 3.3 now but I'm glad I got 3.5 so I get some juice going take the hit I'll try one more time but it was a pretty good hit it's cuz there's not much in the cartridge to begin with it's kind of like most of it got stuck up here but here we go yeah it still needs it very clean it's like I said make sure you clean inside real good because I feel like some of that suck get in there too you know yeah so make sure you give it a good clean other than that guys that's pretty much how you get your your vape unclogged this is the Alpine one you want to be careful cuz like I said this is heavy hitters you can see how these Alpine ones really it conducts electricity and then they not my bad electricity conducts heat and this rubber band that kind of like a seal for this could maybe break or get worked so you wanna be careful depending on what kind of vape in your head you queue and see here how it looks like there's a coil in there and it's more like a direct passage compared to how the heavy hitters is just like it starts off flourish and then it goes in thin and so I hope this video kind of help you guys out look a little tutorial just kind of found it out yeah so next time guys deuces", "7LKPupuh4cQ": "Oh yours Carter if you can take this bull by the horns you better be ready for a ride can you ever forgive me can't hear you I'm asleep shoo shoo cockadoodledoo don't you use your fancy mathematics to muddy the issue just wanna morrow yeah I like helping the pony folks and good stuff I am hey aunt aunt hmm yeah hello there lover boy I hate to say I told you so I'm Applejack no can do sugar cube whoa oops sorry soup-bone everypony that's what all the fuss is about we don't normally wear clothes what in tarnation what in the hey is that supposed to mean are you calling a baby yeah yeah you're welcome", "UmT0yiIcFZs": "how's that bike that's easy connoisseurs and they got a good one for you today so today we are going to take this C cell 1/2 gram refillable cartridge we picked up at vape part smart comm and we're going to be putting some oil in it and showing you just how easy it is to make your own cartridges well here we go what we're going to be putting in it today is some dab ex gelato this is 92.9% total THC for a grand total of ninety four point three total cannabinoids as you can see the color on this is absolutely beautiful let's open this up and get to work okay there you go opens it up every time very nice very nice look at that color it's about as clear as it can get right there loving it now all of this is extracted using ethanol alcohol so it is definitely the way to go this is a good company they make really nice distillate it is quite thick so I do recommend a cartridge with large holes like this see cell first things first you need to try to acquire an applicator tip this is very simply a very large syringe tip to administer the distillate into the cartridge now there will be a link to where you can get some of these in the description a lot of people ask about them and I did the work find it one now first things first we take our distillate we assemble it not too hard now as you can see when I pull off this cap [Applause] the tip is slightly frosted that is to ensure that this when you apply it has a good mating surface and does not slide off now would they recommend first and foremost is that you heat this syringe up just a little bit using whatever method you prefer to get it nice and viscous you take your oil that you want to load into the cartridge have it ready you take the cartridge simply unscrew the lid from the cartridge very easily take your syringe full of the fluid that you would like to dispense into your cartridge insert it into the cartridge as far as it can go and begin to diminish pinch the fluid you can see it pushes down simply go around the cartridge filling it up as you go okay I knew at that point just top it off a little bit remove the syringe take your lid replace your lid on the top [Applause] and there you have your cartridge simply allow the oil to run down to this spot and test it for function as you can see the oil as has gone all the way down to the bottom is filled to this level at that point in time so if we remove the mouthpiece and a small silicone seal on the bottom get a standard 510 thread battery this is a VAT mod very nice battery 510 thread screw it on to the bottom [Applause] and let's try this thing out shall we [Music] all right well there you have it that's how you refill a C cell cartridge you guys have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in and if you want some cartridges to refill yourself make sure you check this website out Bait part smart vpm comm very great place you guys have a good one that thanks for tuning in peace", "Y3vRyew74g4": "[Music] what's up Isaac Lucic here back with another new Intel entitled this is going to be another cartridge review and this is a pretty new company I've never heard of but this smell free cannabis company and they were kind enough to give me a voucher to purchase one of these for $2 and they actually let me try some of their stuff to they have live resin cartridges and they also have cured resin cartridges and her cured live resin cartridges mind you man from what I remember when they let me sample both of them I definitely remember that the cured lie breath and tasted so so good I believe this one's going to be there their live resin one another thing that they mentioned to me which was surprising was that that they're live resin cartridges also has distillate in here so I'm not too sure I mean I'm pretty sure they said that about that but I could be wrong so correct me if I'm wrong the free canvas company but we're gonna be using the pocket you guys already know I will have the link and the one description below if you guys are going to check that out this is a pretty expensive batteries so please check your other alternatives or other options before you finally decide on this because what I like does not mean you like it you know I'm saying I like it because it's a very I it's just a smooth sleek design and build it has a nice feel to it but it is pretty pricey so like I said please just uh know what you're getting into know what you're buying I'm checking all other alternatives because this channel is cool about cannabis content and all and stuff but it's also you know save you a few bucks let you know about the products and always trying to save you some money guys always at the end of the day money is how you gave [ __ ] so I'm trying to hit you I'm trying to help you guys get the best [ __ ] that you can possibly get but not to talking this is going to be strawberry [ __ ] guys very very good stuff [Music] yes I do in a car cut and yes this is the new bandana I'm actually washing the other one so like I got sick of the skull the skull is actually better than polka-dots only have this one because it's black and a black bandana is less is non-threatening at least the gang members you know if I wear a red bandana I could get a shot blue shot black maybe not so much you know so I'm going to open this by the percentage of THC is 86 percent guys you can see right here I'm going too fast and I am sorry right off the back they use the same as select you can see very similar to the select plastic kit from iceless leg and right that kind of smell strawberries so this could definitely be mixed distillate [Music] good yeah [Music] before I get into the review or talk about that hit you might be noticing a faint man noises because I got a fan outside the window so it mentally it's better my room has been getting hot lately it's just because there's probably a lot of electronics there's a lot of people in my room constantly so a fan that attaches to the window is pretty good and it's actually going outward so it's sucking all the hot air out and uh yeah getting into the cart it taste like strawberries not too much I can say about the flavor other than if it tastes like strawberries not too overly powerful you know I do it does fade away quickly just like this lid does you know you but this Li exhales you get that full flavor boat it goes away pretty quick I'm not sure if it's just this lip [Music] so free cannabis fun so like I said earlier there live present and then have cured live resin and their live resin is mixed look a little bit of distillate is what I remember them saying and let's be real like come on this is the way and it tastes like strawberry I mean like live resident tastes like strawberry there's got to be some sort of like terpenes or strawberry terpenes in there that they put in there you know that's definitely not from the plant that I feel like you know some people like the discreteness of oh this guy's just smoking strawberry vape or whatever you know but yes it is good but yes guys this is a legit company okay I actually went to come all the flowers and picked it up I will post their information right here also in the description below and I'd like to mention you know guys just be careful with the cartridges that you were smoking I've been smoking cartridges for a while and nothing has ever happened yeah I always buy cartridges from the dispensary never have I I mean I've tried a few but I don't really buy them like I've tried my homies he usually goes to the sessions and I'm not gonna like I've tried you didn't really like it but I've tried you know yes free cannabis company guys I really really am enjoying this cartridge I'm not gonna lie but you guys already know me I like that I like the cartridges that taste like so but like I said they're cured light resin has that taste so if you do see this company try their cured live recipe try both it does matter try them next to each other and you can actually tell the difference because that's what I did at the booth and yes hopefully you guys enjoyed this video this brand is not bad I don't know the pricing of this I actually have not seen this at my local dispensaries or on weed maps and malls are selling it pretty cheap at the Hall of flowers by a walrus it won't reflect what you're going to be seeing at the dispensary so I can tell you the price $20 for a program $15 $15 I believe it was $15 for the regular live resin cartridges this year and then $20 or the cured live resin but like I said these prices won't reflect what you will see at the dispensary but I am liking this definitely like the cured resin better but I'm not gonna clean about this one if you guys like strawberry taste water looting stuff I really really would recommend this we'll take one more and then [Music] [Music] and there's cloud Stephanie cloud but yeah other than that I'll see you guys [Music]", "Yi3i4F-DBlo": "[Music] what's a bad simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is the interesting video this is obviously a cartridge video but this is surprising I've never seen like a cartridge come in this measurement before and that measurement is 0.75 this was only like 25 or something like 25 to 28 dollars I'm not too sure I forgot but you can see right here it says 0.75 milliliters or grams or whatever we want to call it and it is white Walker ology by cruise I've never tried cruise cartridge but I've tried they're there but and it was good you know very very decent flour for decent prices but I believe this is also this is going to be distantly I believe so you know which is still pretty good you know I'm not I like distillate but as you like I really prefer like sauce cards or live raising card some more you know but this split is it bad it's just sometimes it's just like a artificial flavor so we're gonna see what this is and this is white Walker og you see all the specifications right there everything on the back you can pause if I'm going too fast hopefully it's focusing so just like in the other previous videos I like to mention that my merch is available right now I'll post the link in the bond description below this is just one of the sweaters and they have various colors I think I have like twelve twelve designs on there so like if you don't like one maybe you'll like on another one you know so there's one things to choose from and there's a lot of colors on all of them so I got you there and if you guys are interested I'll post a link people been telling me to make merch for a while and these are all designs I've made myself and I feel like it's more genuine that way because I wouldn't want to paste to design something for me I feel like it should come from the content creator you know and not to knock on any of like other content creators but some of their stuff is a little bit lacking I really wanted to like make it known that I made these and also you know I I understand that most people don't really want cannabis on their shirts so that's why I have some shirts that's just it's more about my life you know like how I was actually born in San Francisco I have a San Francisco shirt the bridge is a conic bridge I think we all know even people that don't live in California fall you know about the Bay Bridge and there's a story behind that because like I named that shirt the bridge to the Spencer eeeh and it's because back when Modesto didn't have too much we had to go to the bay and get all their [ __ ] you know and we had to cross that bridge and it's a play on to that one movie I didn't even see that movie Bridge to Terabithia there's some [ __ ] so I thought it was pretty cool but yes you were not inclined to buy any of these things if you want to support me and buy one of these you're more than welcome to but you're also more than welcome to just not buy it and just chilled me still so let's get on with this [ __ ] review what are you doing but link will be in the book down below so this is white Walker og syndicate as you can see right here really really good stuff it looks pretty nice no no way cartridge so far it's a [ __ ] plastic radiator Calvin your sticker our caution sticker whatever you want to call it I'm not gonna lie this looks pretty [ __ ] nice this thing the oil test or whatever this is dumb as hell I mean I've seen some that's very liquidy and you know what that's just it but very thick I mean this just proves how thick the oil is I mean other than it's [ __ ] legit cuz it's not moving no it could still be sure you know trash off the bed notice that there's some like weird like thing on here that I definitely gotta wash off be using it in my as a beauty which reminds me I still need to do that giveaway for this I'm waiting on light so I can do a live on YouTube in choose a winner but guys [Music] Cheers [Music] very small - not too tasty at all of you is that some sort of taste but I'm not really sure how to describe it I mean it's definitely alright I definitely wouldn't prefer other cartridges I mean what enticed me though was that it was 0.75 for twenty-something dollars which is pretty weird for a cartridge like they usually never come in 2075 so I had to get it never tried cruise cartridges soul paper production is there though it's a very like the sensation to cough afterwards is minimal the taste can't really describe the taste but it's minimal as well other than that pretty decent cartridge if you don't really care about taste you're trying to forget about value out of what you buy because it is 80 percent THC cartridge and I believe it as some sort of amount of CBD in it other than that very good cartridge for what it is not a very tasty one in my opinion but that's just me maybe it's just because I brush my teeth no but woman playing an end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it [Music] [Music] [Music]", "qPPSe6zEzEU": "let's go everybody Cuban chronic here another cannabis video / review here we got the bubbleman trinity pin by Marcus from bubbleman Richardson a big fan of his everything from his bubble bags to his dry sifting methods are definitely beyond any you can find anywhere else so you can always take bald man's word when it comes to concentrates in my opinion he came out with this fine bait pin unit see here oh this way it says bubbleman right on it nice silver always been my favorite tone was this nice metallic silver on the bait pin batteries he's got bubbleman B and bubbleman on his cart really slick little unit not gonna go through all that right now but this is mainly just to show how to fill a vape tank in this case of the bubbleman Trinity tank so in this case both man's got this really nice glass borosilicate glass or something like that outer and it's uh it's definitely it's able to take a lot of heat compared to most baked in so I go ahead and what I do take the cap off and you got this little opening here like most vape pens even the disposables look like this from brands like select other brands like that in recreational states I like to just heat the outside and you have these little glass syringes either come with select dabble bowls you get distillate and stuff from this from the dispensaries and outlets in little syringes like this also the blue river terpenes I believe come with a little syringe like this and you just mix your tips and your concentrates in the little glass syringe sometimes you gotta heat it I use my email and just kind of wipe the vial around on it just lightly heat it to get the oil to go where I need it to go and to use these that's all in my how to mix a sauce video you might want to check out but I'm gonna make this video as quick as I can here's the bubbleman Trinity tank I'm just gonna put my Enel coil around the edge and just heat this glass to a deist in temperature to where when the oil hits it's gonna run to the bottom I'm gonna show you guys how to load this without having the needle like they show in the bubble man Trinity videos this is for people that just don't have this is called a luer lock needle that would go here on the end and that's just for the dabbling hater and actually the terpenes come with the needle I have an eel but I'm gonna show you guys today how to load it with fountain one so you had this little tip here it's all glass these little dab of wool syringe containers for oil and I just heat this up on my email as well so I'm gonna heat both of them up and heat up the outside of the Trinity tank and I'm gonna heat up kind of the outside of my little syringe here full of turps and OG shatter his og chirps and Oregon Diesel OG shatter so so you can see when you have these syringes the oil starts coming out gonna suck them back so you don't lose any oil anyway I'm gonna show you the procedure around this little edge you see that hollow you just stick the dab locator end just right there against it and I just slowly press a nice bead around the edge of it and just keep it there against the seal and the edge of the container and since it's warm it's gonna just melt right into that space and I mean this is just for people that don't have the little luer lock needle that the Terps and things like that come with so you can see that oil is just dripping around there I'm just gonna heat it a little bit yeah I'll be really careful just little dabs of oil around the edge you really don't want to get ahead of yourself there we go hopefully show you guys a little view of this you can see the oils dripping down into the tank already it's looking pretty good so we're gonna go ahead add a little bit more around the edge here it's too crazy literally just wipe it off on there you know you learn to manipulate the oil a little bit doing this you'd see it's just draining down right into the right into it so let me see if I can get this a little bit closer for you see that oil is dripping down straight into the chamber see it slows down so you just kind of wipe it on the email again you can use a lighter on the outside and and just gently melt the oil down so anyway that's that's one way and some people be against it cuz you got to heat the oil a lot you can see it's just draining right down where it needs to go a little bit of oil left on the edge here and we just wipe into the pin here okay so well that's dreaming I'll show you guys one other method and that's with a luer lock needle and that's what these little dab locators have on the ends of them show you a sec this little needle off real quick so yeah you got these little luer lock tab locator your needles and so this this little lock that goes on the end of it so they just kind of slide on and off they twist on and off depending on where you get these from but that's what this locks into so these little needles come with my terpenes I ordered and usually get a little dab locator like this it really has to be heated to go through these needles and lock securely or all the oil kind of blow in between here but they work really well for Philly debate cartridges I'll show you now I'm gonna heat the oil good though and also heat the needle just a bit so that I know I'm gonna get a good run of oil through the end of it so I just heat the needle on the outside just a bit on my email lightly I don't want it too hot these are terpenes here and you can see it'll fit right in between that little space in the vial and as you've seen in probably other videos you can just just squeezes right in just see it there squeeze it all in there I fill the whole thing up use all the church sauce in there squeezed in there real nicely filled it up nice yes very nicely filled bubbleman Trinity pin and uh some little instructions in the Trinity says right here stand tank upright for 30 minutes to let after filling before use so anyway that's a little warning for you just kind of tells you what's gonna happen and if you're getting a boil around the edge like I said just heat it up a little bit make sure all your oil drains to the bottom I like to leave it open for a while with the cap off no matter what unit you're using if your units plastic definitely do not heat it it's not gonna work for you I recommend getting a glass one that's refillable admit to be refilled like bubbleman spins here I don't know if you buy those cheap ones I don't know if they're glass or not honestly people but bubble man's is definitely completely non-toxic materials all that stuff and I will say this is from a company that's called a w-9 tech or up tech and they are a great company any troubleshooting they're definitely there to help you they know a lot about their products so their customer service is on point and their shippings fast all that stuff man there's not a problem that I can understand why bubbleman chose that company and anyway there's the pin go ahead and just put the cap back on very nice I know I might as well just show you how to use the bubbleman pin click the button five times clicks on and now the greatest thing about the bubbleman pin is you can hold that button for up to 10 12 seconds but just take a rip and you hold it for 10 seconds don't even take her up and then hold it under 10 seconds and then start ripping and you'll get a huge rip but the the main process of using these from what they've told me is puff press and then pop so you let off the button afterward and clear the thing to suck more oil into the chamber to be burned for your next hit and it's a really good unit I've had it leak a little bit they sent me another cartridge and said hey man maybe it's a seal they just sent me another cartridge no questions asked they're great company so check them out a little demo for you so I'm going to puff press pump takes a minute to prime the oil but you want to let it just stand for 30 minutes so that it all that air bubbles and stuff come out but I like to heat the oil and it'll all just kind of exhaust the cap here and there and watch the bubbles come out of there and I mentally get all the air out and you can just hold that button literally watch it it's blue it'll turn off when it needs to do you get all that oil tar in it that's how you take a hotter DAP you see the size the hits you get me Trinity always cool it off afterward just by general inhale sorry about that coffin that's just how big it hits you get off this thing so anyway Cuban chronic this is the bubble man Trinity check it out at a w-9 tech or fresh head ease calm I gave it a 10 star review myself I mean I'm sure it'll be it'll be improved in the future who knows but it is definitely one of the best bait pens I've used as far as ripping first us stoners that's what we like nice good hits whatever hits we want light hits strong hits fill your own vapes there we go Cuban chronic dads ahoy everybody peace out", "tpRjCsSQ0Do": "by the title the video as you guys can see man I'm be telling you guys how to bring in either your pen how I got it in I'm gonna tell you guys what I went through why I brought it I'm pretty much like this is gonna be a little story time because I wanted to make a video and while I'm out here so when I get back I could just upload and you guys could see something while I'm out here so yeah today guys we're gonna be ripping on the West Coast curd I'll take up close a close-up after this yeah very very nice man I'm like I'm a little bit more than half no a little bit less than halfway he's done with it but I've been trying to use this so scarcely but we're gonna take a quick rip before we get into the storytelling stuff like that oh so cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you guys know the deal [Music] man it's nice to being able to smoke outside dude my tolerance has gone down a significant amount surprisingly cuz since I haven't really really been able to smoke all day how like I usually do or at least every couple of hours like literally the past week that I've been here has only been like maybe two times double so if you guys are coming in from any legal state flying out you know it's an illegal state I'm gonna show you guys what I'm not gonna show you guys I'm gonna tell you guys what to do cuz I'm already over here there's no way I can do to him so the way I did it first first and foremost let me show you guys the way I did it so if you guys are have a girlfriend a wife girl that you're going with on a trip this will just make things a hundred times easier so what you can do is just obviously attach your cartridge to your stick and then just all you do is it'll just pop drop it in her makeup bag and then that's it dude you're good to go you could probably do up to two or three cartridges I don't recommend doing a lot of them and I don't recommend compact inch if you're gonna take we do not compact it because I learned a few tricks over here my uncle he works for the airlines and he knows a bunch of tricks up his sleeve and stuff like that he was telling me like what they live for so I mean let me just boss you guys up in a little game right now so we're usually in airports what they're looking for is in drugs that's not what they're looking for like you guys making like oh they're looking for toys and looking for my wood and my weed you know things like that but that's not the case even though it's not gonna be hard for them to know who has it like just don't don't overdo it don't be stupid don't just go in there thinking like oh they're not looking for drugs so I can go in there and go ahead and walk in with an ounce that's definitely not the case so all right they're looking for obviously explosives guns anything that can pretty much cause any damage or danger to anyone inside the airport like if you guys don't know lax is one of the biggest or not well this isn't only lax but I'm referring to LAX abuse out to the airport that I flew out of so yeah and LX are looking for explosive guns et Cie things like that so drugs is it's not one of their top priorities so as long as you're not overdoing it man there should be no issue to be honest like he was telling me as long as like one thing that you have to do if you're like I'm not advising this I'm not telling you guys go do this and go like try it out but if he has you know I have medical issues if he has I have anxiety like me personally I have so much anxiety dude like that day that I was flying out I had so much anxiety that I literally [ __ ] was crying bro like once I landed it was horrible I mean I'm not ashamed to say that I cried cause it's just anxiety man it's where humans everyone feels it specifically you know and cheers to them here I remember take up a trip for you guys so yeah like I was saying oh yeah this car is so amazing by the way by West Coast cure if you guys can see it hopefully you guys can very very amazing and yeah let me just get back to my story so one thing he told me if you're gonna bring weed um weed in general cartridges don't really matter because it's a liquid usually everything scans through liquids you can tell very very hard to detect and yeah so I'm not saying this isn't me saying like oh you can take as many cartridges you want I'm the same be smart and take one or two three hemos you know you don't really need to have more than that unless you're a fiend bro so now on to the weed if you don't like cartridges and you guys are more about weed them he said he went from what I know he told me that all you have to do is just you can carry in there just make sure it doesn't smell and make sure you just like wrap it up stash it you know but don't compress it too much because usually what comes up on the RFID readers it comes when they're passing it through the little readers what they're looking for is compact compressed items so basically because if you guys don't know that's usually how bombs are made you you compact what it is whatever the material is and then that's what makes a bomb you can't have a bomb with a little super piece of [ __ ] you know material it has to be very very mass amount compact until like it doesn't have to be a ball but you guys know when I'm referencing to so that's a little trick and then honestly you guys there's another one that I've done it at like shows and stuff like this I've never tried this at an airport I mean I don't recommend this type if you guys really are trying to get through when you can do is just hide the cartridge on the bottom of your plastic piece of your shoe and when you're passing through the metal detector just slide your foot like walk put left foot over whichever isn't carrying the cartridge and then on your right just slide slide it down you know just fairly you can barely lift it I think it's like an inch from what I've done before so yeah no more than an inch so you should be good after that and yeah I'm just sorry if I keep you looking away there's just so much scenery around me and it's just catching my attention so we're gonna take another hit and just keep talking keep ranting seeing what what this day is about man so yeah I brought this on here I left on Monday it's currently already Thursday it's Friday tomorrow man I go back on Sunday so which means I have two more days out here and this pen has been coming in clutch because like I said my anxiety dude my anxiety was kicking my ass since the morning I had a good on the plane like it's not that I'm scared to fly or anything I've flown before I've flown to Mexico I've flown to other places but just the anxiety of being away from home it's just something that I've had you know there on my whole life so wait to whatever this is this is something that has helped me a lot throughout my last couple years I'm dealing with anxiety and stuff like that so and I'm gonna show you guys this one I know I already made a video on this with a West Coast cure cartridge I'll go ahead and post that in the link in the description below if you guys want to check out that video but I've made a video on this um battery before and it's called the X tube so basically what it is it looks ugly right it looks ugly like this and okay whatever you're not supposed to have a beautiful battery but that's just a [ __ ] thing in your head for if you if you're one of those people that likes things that are aesthetically pleasing I don't blame you man I'm some sometimes I'm like that too so but this battery isn't for you so this value what it does this little detachable piece right here so as you guys can see I have a little a little oil bubble right there right little air bubble I mean so what this does I'll screw it on there click it twice and then what it does it'll start preheating right you'll see it oh it's already dead because I've been using all week so I can't use a preheat function but what it does it'll heat up the outside of the cartridge and then it'll make the oil warm enough for it to move up and so how good that is is because most a car batteries that pre-heat your [ __ ] they preheat from the coil within so basically what that is it's burning the oil that's why when you take hits you can still puff like with this if I were if it was charged and I were to do that you wouldn't know smoke would be coming out at all like sometimes the only downside is the tip does get hot sometimes because it does get heated up a lot so if you guys are looking for a cartridge that I mean for a battery that does it all now this is my favorite one for sure the only bad thing about it is I don't think you could fit like a tank of apes and [ __ ] like that it's more of that just the regular - really really slim cartridges so yeah man I'm gonna take another hit hopefully this battery still yeah so we're just gonna oh no it's still it's still going you just can't preheat it because the preheat function does I think that's what takes up most of the battery life because it preheats it for like a good 20 to 30 seconds because it wants to get all the oil out obviously man this West Coast cure is amazing yeah I'm gone man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video here enjoy the rest of my time here I hope you guys are enjoying the rest of your week you guys are gonna see this on Monday so enjoy your week from now on you know and for all the new people here thank you for conforting me and for the people who have been here for a while thank you for the continuous support you guys are gonna be seeing some big things coming within the next couple of weeks so look forward to that and yeah if you guys enjoyed today's video go leave a like comment sub and we're out you can", "JLvw59l_hZ8": "hi everybody unhealthy and I'm the director of operations at one release today I'm going to talk to you a bit about our baked article to have oil of course so our big cartridges are all glass and stainless steel they are 510 threads so they should connect to any 510 thread push-button battery now the push button is important because the way that our cartridge is designed they will not work on a pull-through battery so all of our cards come with a silicon cap here on the top I recommend twisting clockwise to remove this Jack now that is 2 times if you twist counterclockwise you can potentially loosen your mouthpiece if you do that you run the risk of leaking some of the oil out on the side if it gets warm and run to the top so just twist make sure these guys are clamped on nice and tight we connect these guys to any push-button battery again ah I just screwing them into the top here on the base plate now Arbus push button batteries take 5 click to turn off and 5 flicks to turn on then you know that the battery has a good connection with the cartridge if when you push the button you get a solid steady life on these batteries we change the voltage by clicking three times and for each different voltage you'll get a different light to indicate where you're at for our batteries we right usually recommend vaporizing around 3.3 volts to 4.0 volts depending on which matter you have and what all you have I personally prefer to vaporize about 3.3 volts no higher than 3.6 now our cartridges we do not usually recommend for refills however if you are going to refill our cartridge you unscrew the mouthpiece let that guys side and with your syringe you're going to want to fill around suppose into the area that you see between the the metal post and the glass tank do not fill directly into that post and it's because if you do you'll actually clog your mouthpiece and will be able to draw if your cartridge is leaking chances are that it's leaking from either the bottom gasket or the top gasket we've actually replicated 14,000 feet at 100 reads Fahrenheit without any leakage out of the bottom so we're pretty confident that one and if that is happening then chances are you've accidentally unscrewed your mouthpiece a little bit so all that you do screw that back down nice and snug and make sure that your cartridge remains upright as opposed to buying it on slide or upside down if the oil flows into the post and it plugs your mouthpiece all you need to do your unscrew your mouthpiece okay take something long and in like a paper clip and just run it down through the mouthpiece now you should be able to clear this guy right up if the oil is a little too thin you can actually refrigerate your mouthpiece for a few minutes taking that all up and it should push out nice and smooth but you can see now you're getting a lot of that oil out you're just going to drop that back down into your change if there is an air bubble that builds up around the hole all you need to do is you need to keep the oil in order to get it to settle again you can use your body heat just hold it in your hand for a while put it in a pocket that's close to your body or run it under warm water either I personally for your life all you do one the lighter over the black part of the tank and then hold it upright to allow the oil to settle again now this is perfectly safe because our cartridges again are made of glass and stainless steel and the gaskets inside our high temp resistant silicone so you're not going to be putting any bad chemicals into your oil", "I4uHx1zD2Xo": "hey guys what's up in today's video i got a review on a push disposable so let's just get right into this let's check out the packaging this is a live resin uh this is premium live resin this is the alien og it's an indica uh it says organic it's got a picture of the actual live resin bar it's one gram it's rechargeable you got the california medical stamp on it uh the side says push and then push stands for puff until something happens that's the branding like i said i i've not seen any of these i've not seen any video reviews on these i've seen reddit posts on them but i've not actually seen any actual videos on these i've seen the push carts i haven't seen the i haven't looked up the pods so i don't know if there may be some pod videos of the push pods but um yeah i haven't seen any videos so i figured i'd put out a video let you guys know so if you see these you know what to expect uh here's the back it's got the lab test and stuff like pretty much every other cart that's on the black market you got all those this qr takes you to their instagram which i'll give you their instagram in a second don't worry about that and this is to authenticate if it's an actual push um product so disclaimer before anybody comments something bro you're you're smoking dog water bro it's hot dog water broom save yourself time don't come in it you don't know you're talking about okay no disrespect you're not smoking what i am so you don't know what i'm smoking you don't know my plug you don't know my source so i'm gonna leave it at that i'm a little high i already tried to record this uh like twice and every time i just i don't like the way i do it so here we are i'm gonna do it real good this time hopefully but without further ado let's open this alien og it is gonna have uh a sill that goes over this i obviously already opened it so when i slid it in i accidentally slid it in so mine's not going to be sold but here open it up you have your um disposable then it says made in the usa los angeles california um yeah there's the box um their instagram is right there official push product is their instagram go ahead and check them out if you want and yeah they say you can recharge these which i've tried it just takes a micro usb but yeah on the bottom you'll see that it says usb all you do is take your finger and it's got like a little place so you can pull out and there's the charge port which for a disposable that's pretty nice actually i i think that's a game chart changer because you know you're for sure gonna get all your oil so don't be afraid to pick one of these up and be afraid that like yo i'm gonna take a few tokes then that battery is gonna die and i'm not going to be able to smoke point well no as long as you have a micro usb it does not come with a micro usb you have to add one which usually i don't know who wouldn't have a micro usb now that is but yeah so you can charge this which is dope um let me see if i'm missing anything i don't think i'm missing anything i think i hit everything about it this is the alien og again this is what the box of it looks like and yeah here's the the actual disposable i like that it's got the window over here where you can see your oil level then on this side it's actually pretty cool too it has the push the push uh logo and you can see your oil through that window as well and then it says live resin bar then push got your uh light to let you know that it is activating when you draw on it uh on the back it's got your california stamp again and then on the side just your window and that's it and yeah all right let's get right into this boys i'm gonna take uh i am pretty high off this but we're just gonna take like medium hit there is no dry hitting this for flavor as soon as you draw it does you know hit so cheers dudes hope you guys are smoking along dab it along smoking a joint roll your joint pause the smoke with me but cheers dudes pretty decent little hit for not a blinker really smooth uh the draw is not bad on this pretty easy draw uh this doesn't hit you in the back of the throat and burn your throat when you when you're hitting it or at least me it does not uh yeah the flavor on this i'm not really good at explaining flavors so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna leave a flavor description because i'm not good at it tastes just like um pretty much just like weed in a cart you know i mean that's you know with some flavor that there's not much to it uh it is good though effects i would say pretty high give this a this is an indica i prefer indicas because i like that just calm me down kind of like let me chill so yeah i would say i'm getting that i am being able to kick back i'm feeling myself just kind of my body like my muscles are loosening up and i'm just kind of chilling you know um what else trying to think anything you guys would want to know about uh how long these last i like i said this is my first one so i'm not the best person to ask how long this will last black and sap took some pretty big draws off this i mean it's got some bubble action in there going on at the top that you can kind of see so um yeah i'll just have to update in the comments and let you know about how long this lasts i'm assuming it'll last a week maybe maybe two i'm not really sure just really depends on how much it took i do like like i said i like to roll a couple joints every now and then so uh just kind of just on my go you know take a few tokes while i'm out about but yeah i want to do a review for you guys like i said i keep seeing these pop up my plugs had them for a while and i just they keep selling down i i never get any but uh i like the whole concept that you don't need to buy battery you don't need anything you grab it you're ready to go you there's no extras you know you ain't got to worry about if your battery's charged you ain't got to worry about none of that with this because i mean pretty much you know right out the box you're ready to go i mean i don't know how good the battery life is but i'm assuming it's pretty good considering like i mean look at how big this thing is i don't know this does produce some vape so there is that i hope you guys did enjoy this let me know if uh you have tried these and if you have seen them let me know what you think and uh yeah without further ado spin your boy exotica i'll see you guys in the next one bye", "8gLu6aKZtmE": "[Music] damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel so this is another three chive delta eight vape cartridge review the last one that i did did so well that i just well i had to do another one if i release a video and it gets 800 hits or 800 views in a for like a week oh yeah i'm definitely doing another video so the one that i got is blue dream and it's a one milliliter container brand new sealed and that's how i like it and you can see right there it contains 95 percent eight delta eight th oil and then five percent of [ __ ] which you know whatever i guess you gotta i guess it can't be a hundred percent or it would probably just knock you on your ass and stuff uh the directions remove the silicone cover and screw into the battery do not over tighten take one puff and wait 20 minutes wow wait 20 minutes um usage is between one and two puffs let's see here i'm trying to focus it for you guys i can't focus it whatever uh says do not operate any machinery while using this product do not use if pregnant nursing or under the age of 21 this may cause a positive drug test well no [ __ ] oh my god uh let's see here if you need more typical usage it's one or two puffs do not operate wait a minute where's that one part at wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more oh okay 5 10 battery 100 percent hint driving contains 0.3 is that a 9 thc batch 6 out of 15 2021 batch id three chives fishery blah blah blah blah all right blue dream sweet so i have a couple other ones over here these are the fx these are delta eight fx cartridges um and i designed this little thing to keep them in the upright for me because sometimes i'll run out and these right here will be enough to get you by for a few days especially if you leave them in the upright these are this was like orange crush and like granddaddy purple if i remember correctly i didn't really care um for the granddaddy purple i do want to say one thing though there is a big difference between the ethics cartridge and the delta eight cartridges i feel like the delta eight cartridges these are put together better they just seem to be i don't know i don't have any leakage they hardly ever clog they just seem to be a better cartridge than the fx the fx are also a lot cheaper too these are like 30 something dollars and these are like 60 something dollars okay now the effects of this all right let's say you're sitting on the couch smoking a blunt there you go you're going to get high but this is great because you can be out public you could be in a mall walking around hitting this and people are just going to think that you're vaping and that's the beautiful part about it and it delivers i mean just one one good hit delivers like a serious bond grip i mean it's depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke it can get you really really really really really high um like for instance i got friends that do not smoke like me i consider myself to be a pothead meaning that i i blaze it up every day we smoke it down okay that's just me i've been like that for 20 years um but we're not talking about me this i hit it one time and i'm like whoo all right if i get somebody that doesn't smoke like me and they hit it they gotta sit down and sometimes they're out for the count like uh like i actually had one friend hit it and it ruined her whole night she felt like [ __ ] it just messed her up and then i had another buddy uh i mean it put his ass on the couch so i guess the effects is just different depending on who you are and how much you smoke but let me tell you what it's definitely worth it it's discreet nobody knows that you have it plus there's no smell like you blaze that [ __ ] up man you hit it pow pow pow you get a big old dragon's breath cloud and it don't smell like weed it's awesome you can take it to work that's the best part about it man is that there's no paraphernalia there's no weed nobody knows you have it on you the only way somebody's gonna know you have it is if they physically see it no smells man i i've been pulled over by the police and i had this on me he didn't even ask me not clean as a whistle goodbye give me my ticket leave awesome these things definitely have their benefits definitely and if you're going to have this you got to have a 510 battery okay this is an e-leaf very simple 510 battery plugs into the bottom i don't know an hour charge you're good to go all you do is you hold the button wait for it to get to about there and then you start hitting it hit it slow you're not trying to rip on it you're just trying to take a slow even deep breath and even that might be too much for you three child blue dream now one thing i did like about it was all they had so many selections for these and then they told you about what they did like this is a sativa brand um this is supposed to give you clarity um it's not supposed to make you foggy it's supposed to give you energy and make you awake and whatever whatever whatever like it claims what it is it's a um a sativa synthetic it's a blend of you know indica and this brand i mean like it tells you what they are and what they're mixed with their strands and everything so you really can't go wrong so it's not like you don't know what you're buying you know what i mean sorry if there's a little bit of an echo i'm trying to do this privately this is illegal in my state you know so you really don't want to be advertising what you're doing that's the other thing like a cop a cop knows what this is because this does not look like a typical vape that's the other thing that you need to be aware of this is very identifiable if they're a cop and they deal with this [ __ ] they've seen this before they will know exactly what you have in your hand so be aware of that uh your average person not so much you know i mean you go out for a cigarette break you hit it once or twice nobody's going to even say it or even notice it but be careful because police they they probably will know what the hell that is i mean because all vape cartridges come the same basically the same look you know all right we're actually starting to get to the meat and potatoes oh come on [ __ ] come on out now here's another thing i like is that they come with these uh get out damn it [ __ ] it's pressure treated uh is that they come with these plastic things right to keep them covered now when i transport mine for instance see like these these even have it on them when i transport them because sometimes i'll take this with me and then i'll take another flavor with me it's very important that you keep that cap on there all right because if you don't keep that cap on there lint and trash and garbage and other things that are in your pocket will get into these little holes and ports and you don't want that because that's going to mess everything up for you so it's very important that you keep these little plastic covers and if you want to even keep the mouthpiece because you know see like this mouthpiece see all the stuff that's in there that's from it being in my pocket like lint and trash and other things get up inside of that you know what i mean yeah you don't want that that's bad so definitely keep your plastic covers man you got to keep those and try to store it upright because if you laying it down you can take a good chance of it leaking and it'll this [ __ ] takes forever it's like molasses to go back in the upright um but let's let's plug it in and check it out not only that check out the quality this is the end cap that came off of the uh the new delta eight cartridge see it see how thick it is all right and then this is the end cap that comes now i ain't trying to knock the the fx vapes i'm just trying to justify the 30 something dollars more that they want for the vape you know [Music] all right and then here's theirs see what i'm saying see the difference look at the difference in the caps big difference this one's nice and meaty and this one's real thin and kind of cheesy looking but uh you know i guess that's part of the difference is that you get better coverage with it also when i bought these these just come in like kind of like this thing here uh but it doesn't have anything covering the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is wide open so but with these you get a mouthpiece covered which is nice because like i said i transport these in my pocket and stuff so yeah you know what that um this this right here it kind of it kind of sneaks up on you god damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high yeah one hit y'all one hit damn yeah see i can go in there right now smoke a few bowls that [ __ ] won't get me like how i am right now good god oh [ __ ] all right yes um forgot what i was saying yep don't remember now okay so back to what i don't remember i was talking about y'all need to get this i don't know what else to tell y'all three chive delta eight vapes leave me a comment subscribe to my channel check out my other videos i build computers and do all kinds of custom water cooling and technology stuff so you all need to come and check that out check out my channel i appreciate y'all for watching", "dZ1XrkF5I4c": "a to Alex here back again what another quick video hit apprise today and they were crazy busy it is Friday what is today

way down and around the down the building and it was like that when I left still around the building I grabbed a couple of things I grabbed Blue Dream resin live resident sugar by rhythm I grabbed the gram of that while I was in there by rhythm which I already did a review on that before so I'm not doing but I also grabbed this which I'm doing a review of and that is the bio Jesus liquid live resin cartridge by Cresco bio Jesus the bio Jesus liquid live resin cartridge by oh Jesus indica rest let's get this bad boy open and I'll let you know what I think got my kangertech here charged up ready

for indica it's got the nice little plastic mouthpiece here it's a cartridge you take the little rubber piece off the bottom here yeah yeah screw it on the bottom there Isis look at the cartridge let's get it on my pen zoom me back out boom get it off my pen here got my kangertech you guys know I like my kangertech pen let's get it on here for the bio Jesus liquid live resin like I said I had two co2 that was pretty good this is the liquid live resin let's give it a rip it's a subtle flavor mmm but very pleasant very pleasant yeah very subtle kind of humbling Lendl in the wall lima bean a little bit of mersin and the other one I can't even yeah fresco by oh Jesus cartridge by Cresco by oh Jesus is the strain there's an indica instead I did have looks that I had this before but I figured it was one of the nicer better carts on the menu today and they didn't have a lot because they're getting hit hard like I said that line was all the way down around the block and people were still coming in as I was leaving like you mean the line was still the same place it was one that started it took me I got there at 11 I got inside about 11:40 about a 40-minute wait outside I got inside it was another I want to say 10 or 15-minute wait inside and then till I got to the cashier a budtender or whatever so it was almost an hour probably altogether nuts man this coronavirus [ __ ] has got everybody [ __ ] Cheers that's nice oh yeah pretty tasty this is what I'm having for tonight some buy oh Jesus indica buy Cresco let me know if you guys had some bio Jesus before and I'll let you know a little bit more about what I thought in the comments section or maybe I'll do the two part video and give you the empty cartridge and what I thought at the end case you know something goes bad to taste gets nasty throughout or you know because when these sometimes any smoker cartridges it tastes good at the beginning and then it gets like a burnt taste or it starts messing up or something so we'll see we'll come back with a second video and give you the after a day of smoking it or so and it's almost down to the bottom I'll come back with a and I'll have it stitch the two together through the power of video so it'll be like a second for you guys but yeah so let me get another rip of this it's pretty good I'm starting to feel it mmm by oh Jesus by Cresco nice flavor it's real subtle it's not like an overwhelming like Moxie has a real good you know pungent some of those are like that crest go island sweet skunk is like that it's got a real strong flavor what other one I could think of this got a real pineapple Express it's got a real boom right off the this one's real like a mellow flavor it's not you could taste it a little bit of beach not mercy and you can't taste that really at all I'm glad but yeah there you go that's it I'll bring you the second part of this video and day or so when I'm down put this down maybe tomorrow I'll you know or so no maybe not maybe I'll just upload this video today because I like uploading them the same day the cartridge is probably going to be good I've never had a problem with Cresco cartridges and I think I'm high because I'm rambling so I'm gonna upload this today so you guys can have a video to watch tonight here on YouTube peace I'm out rambling this [ __ ] has hitting me 81 percent THC for this total and yeah I feel it already what I do about 3 or 4 rips yeah I'm feeling it peace I'm out", "MVT2XgW-iec": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up ladies and gents and if you're new to the channel my name is shaka and i'm back here for another video boys what's good how y'all doing i hope everyone's having a good ass week so far man uh i just got off of work you feel me had a change into the x shirt had to go pack a little bowl real quick but today today is not about weed guys today isn't about flour i mean it's not about wheat today is about weed but today it's not about flour guys today is about carts and i haven't tried a new cart in a long time guys something new and today i picked up a cart that i hope is good it's called legion of bloom i'm gonna take a bong rip before i get into it but your boy he has to find a good spot to chill at smoke at get a nice little view you feel me give y'all a view and show you guys if this legend or legion of bloom is actually pretty good so let me sit down for a second yo so we're here so like i said before guys [Music] you guys know i like taking bong ribs we back to that bong grip in the beginning of every video if you guys have been um long subscribers with me you guys know that i used to take a bong rip like before every freaking video so cheers guys [Music] whoo damn it's just some good i got some good outdoor with me right now my outdoor is actually not that harsh the taste isn't that bad i mean it does taste like that outdoor it's not that bad it's not that harsh on my lungs guys but um we're not here about flour guys we're here about balloon [Music] so off jump guys man it says the monarch premium vape cartridge it's a hundred percent derived terpenes it's a distillate cart guys but it's cannabis derived terpenes and these terpenes also are sullivan less terpenes so they're not made with butane or whatnot and then also on the back it says on the ingredients it says triple refined cannabis oil i'm not sure what that means if anyone knows what that means please comment down below i would love to know what that means i'm wondering if it's like alcohol when you distill alcohol over and over so it gets less you know less strong and less like more burn on your throat and like it's more distilled kind of you know more premium so the strain that i got i got one grammar it's mendo breath and i'm gonna be real guys they are good with their packaging i like their packaging it's a nice package you just slide it up and then it also comes with this little card let me give you guys a close-up real quick here we go all right guys so it comes with this card and it says that they won the emerald cups first place in 2019 for their distillate cartridge and then in 2019 they also won third place award for their dislike cartridge so i guess they won two awards during the emerald cup one with the first place and one was a third place so their stuffs are pretty pretty good you should be able to scan them and look it up online maybe i'll do that later i'm not sure but yeah guys the oil looks freaking magnificent it looks closer to like a um to a raw garden the heck yeah guys bro i ain't gonna lie so far this legion of bloom it looks fire as hell i can't even front it looks like it's gonna be a good cartridge for me [Music] comes in a little too and also guys these cartridges are good because they have ceramic coils so it's you're getting less of that metal when you're smoking and you're getting that metal near your lungs from all those other coils that are made out of metal and whatnot these are actually made out of ceramic um made with ceramic coils and um a good brand for ceramic um coils i'm pretty sure is an avd cart but i looked on the bottom of this uh the bottom of this already and i didn't see any brand name but they do say that it's a ceramic coil inside so boom [ __ ] looking nice and gold so let's put it on a cart let's see what it tastes like man let's see what it tastes like but let me look at that see this is the raw garden it's a little bit darker than the raw garden but it's down there similar let me take a hit of the raw gardens real quick nothing beats a raw garden man that beats rawguard we're gonna take the rock garden off we're gonna put the bloom on and they actually have a logo on on the cartridge it's actually pretty nice they put a lot of thought and effort into their cartridge so we're gonna see if they put the same thought and effort into the actual oil to see if it's actually good guys all right all right so usually guys i don't like distillate i don't like distillate cards the only distillate cards that i really like are like sauce carts and stizzy carts those are the only distillate type of carts that i do like and sauce carts they're a little bit different because they add different type of terpenes to it and what not to make it a sauce cart but off a jump this actually reminds me of raw garden this i don't know man this and raw garden are pretty dang similar guys let me hit this one more [Music] time yeah i can definitely taste it tastes like a raw garden earth like you know you got that raw garden that's sweet you know the fruity fruity raw garden but this this one tastes like that earthy that earthy raw garden it's actually pretty damn good i can see why they won the emerald cup now this is actually pretty damn good it's surprising that not a lot of people actually i don't not a lot of people made videos about this i've been looking up seeing if people made videos about it not a lot of people made um videos about legion of bloom shout out to legion of [Music] bloomberg [Music] but yeah guys man i definitely recommend this it's actually a pretty damn good cart i'm actually gonna keep this one on the battery for a little bit you know what i'm saying yo i hope everyone enjoyed this freaking video don't forget to like

sunscreen so I'm not all greasy and [ __ ] so if you guys want to know you know why I'm hella shiny and [ __ ] it's not cuz I'm sweating I mean I am sweaty not gonna lie I got mud butt right now but definitely I'm not one for my face you know it's just if I'm this greasy I'd never be this greasy you know man I hate the [ __ ] shower well welcome back everybody to a brand new video today we're gonna be reviewing yet again another select cartridge this time accidentally you know throw in a row no a couple times where you know I had pretty much whole is gone where it's worth I think there's about like one-third of it left so it is a select once again it's the elite brand the select it's the pineapple express because he see its 85 85 percent THC so there's some good [ __ ] you know was good at the hybrid right here it's a hybrid right there so it kind of gets you a little bit of everything but here we have it everybody and like always check this out y'all check the song there you go you guys see that right there and you turn it around I see you notice that gauge that you know especially if it's clear you know I guess it's the more the clear the better especially man if you guys are smoking on some of that some of that dark [ __ ] man I see like I'm telling you guys one time I got I bought a fake brass knuckle cartridge right I smoked it up and you know after a couple days it was just turn in it was turning brown it was turning like the the oil was like really dark you know so like always everybody we're gonna turn this on we're gonna put him on the the lightest for the low temp he already knows good cheers everybody pineapple express select so if you guys watch the previous video I actually reviewed the ghost the ghost train haze cartridge with my boy Hoss you know so that [ __ ] was pretty good you know this year the Select I'm telling you guys it's the light cards man they get you freakin loaded man they get you they get you pretty lit and again I talked about in the previous if you guys want to go check that one out it's gonna be down a description it's some ghost ghost train Oh ghost train haze something like that yeah I think that's what it's called sativa so it's gonna wake you up but pretty much I was just talking about how like the flavor the flavor it doesn't have a really strong flavor whatsoever but then again it gets you super frequently like you taste it you know you know what you're smoking on you know you're smoking awesome THC you know [Music] as I was saying you know it's like the best part you can smoke this in public I mean like you know if you get the taste of it it does have like the distinct taste you know obviously if you're smoking THC so you're gonna know you know but the thing the thing that I really like about these is that the freakin smell is not strong whatsoever does not stick I'm telling you guys like right now I'm just saying this [ __ ] in my room you know it's not I'm gonna be able to open the door it might smell just a little bit but it's not gonna smell like super strong you know so that's one cool thing that I really like about these cartridges and select is some of the first cartridges is you guys if you guys know you guys were watching this channel select is a cartridge some of the first cartridges that I started smoking you know back when like you know wax pans and all this this and all this stuff was like new you know it's this [ __ ] this three alright we're gonna switch it up to blue to the middle temperature damn blue is just perfect because this again this doesn't really have like a big taste to it it hasn't it's crazy to me also like cartridges for me they all taste the same it really depends on the percentage because I know select has a couple I think it was select pretty sure I'm 100% I'm actually ninety-nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine percent sure that select it used to have some of these or still does but I don't know what you could get them but select has these carts that are like what like a point three in a cartridge and it's like super strong it's like high maybe like in the mid 90s low 90s I think 90 to 95 percent maybe even 96 percent who knows but I do remember there was like they're really small and you would just rip it you take one good rip and damn man you'd get [ __ ] blasted I know a lot of you guys really like these cartridges reviewing videos it's crazy man it's like the new thing right personally me cartridges are I mean I guess you're cool you know especially when you go to like family parties and you're at the house you know you want to step outside and smoke you know smoking this is pretty far you know because you can just do it work you know you're taking a [ __ ] you sit down on the toilet you're taking this [ __ ] you give you a hint in this you know if it was waterproof you giving in into the shower but you know when you're laying down you're watching the movie huge puffing on this [ __ ] but to be completely honest with you guys I get lit but it's like it's just like a head heart you know it's nothing it's nothing too crazy you know like I don't get beg debate so I mean I I'm actually lying there has been a couple times where this is so spire that I guess you made it I guess faked I not believe I like this one you can barely tell it's like a little different taste these like cartridges especially these ones right here they all have like a similar taste but I'm lit man personally let me know the comments down below what you guys like better you know and you guys like either cartridges or flowers especially mean I like the flowers you know a lot of dabs and everything I like flowers I mean dabs are cool you know cuz again you can take them here in the crib you know you get super baked like dad or you just trying to get bang foot you know if it fits up if I'm starting my day with dads man all right be my date man I'm gonna just be slump I'm gonna just be hella tired so that's why I kind of wished it up you know I kind of I'm gonna start to take like then dad's you know at nighttime you know or man especially if you guys are gonna watch a movie you guys are gonna eat but it's like you know later in the day where you just don't really have nothing to do and yeah because sometimes if you died man your soul it I mean it it's honestly depending on you guys you know you're gonna go with the highest it's a bit depends on on your guys its body type like let me know what you guys get productive you guys get lazy cuz there's either one or the other bros tree and either THC all there's others only [ __ ] oh I can tell it was a weekday let's make some nice clothes but personally mean I don't like that height I'm you know I feel like it just burns through all this [ __ ] damn I thought I completely forgot what the [ __ ] I was talking about oh yeah okay so either either it makes you or it breaks you like personally me what it does to me is when I usually smoke or whatever and if it's like a sativa it's gonna pick me up it's gonna pick me up and it gets me really like creative I start thinking about you know different ideas and so for me personally me I feel like it relaxes me and I could definitely be way more creative I mean I'm already creative sober but it's like you know it's like sometimes for example like like earlier today you know have a little short [ __ ] die last night I didn't really have that much to sleep or whatever you know I don't take take a few puffs you know get a little lit and I'm just like damn bro I think about you know I started getting in my head and I started thinking and usually when I get on my head I'm just like dude I got to do this I got to do that like oh [ __ ] let's do it now you know and I take action so sometimes for me tree regardless I mean sober or this you know I'm gonna be [ __ ] creative productive but sometimes this [ __ ] is like there's days where I'm kind of like look I feel like I have like I feel like I can't think of [ __ ] or I'm just kind of like [ __ ] I'm just like chillin there you know and I'll get lady and I'm just like boom [ __ ] this pie it's just a sativa you know it really depends indica it gets me a little tired it'll also be the same but I'll be kind of like slung but there's other people who they're gonna just have a sash that I said and they're not productive at all you know they don't really get nothing done during the day they just throw the whole day around you know and I've had days like that that's why sometimes I'm just like [ __ ] man I gotta start doing that [ __ ] you know I gotta stop [ __ ] you know but again you know people do you know a lot of people look down on Chief and stuff like that but I'm telling you guys sometimes if this [ __ ] could give you literally like just a weird and blue sometimes that happens sometimes it doesn't you know sometimes I'm late I'm still doing [ __ ] but over time you kind of just get to learn how to like what your body likes like for me if I stay I like to smoke sativa all the time it doesn't matter if it's a day nighttime sativa cuz actually picks me up and I'm just [ __ ] like a machine bro you know just [ __ ] do it [ __ ] and I'm just lit out of my mind and I'm just like dude what the [ __ ] I just did all the [ __ ] you know and I'm just late I was really like it was just everything was naturally happening if that makes sense you know I don't know I'm I'm horrible at explaining [ __ ] everyone damn so liked everybody make sure you guys go check them out man if you guys the only thing that I would say I guess what kind of suck is that the flavors aren't really that strong you know it's like you you do get a flavor but when they say like for example like different stuff like this pineapple Express definitely I had like a different taste you know especially like other cartridges they throw in like a little extra flavor to make it think like Oh like a pineapple type you should hide Apple Express or some [ __ ] but you know you you just know you're getting the extract from this sharing or from some legit pineapple Express you know the book is lit man if you guys owe a good thing I would I would totally recommend this brand and this these cartridges it's like cartridges especially if you guys don't want to if you don't wanna like hotbox your room or some [ __ ] you guys are burning like in the bathroom real quick you guys have a quick sesh you know cuz the smell isn't that strong there's no like stick to it like rock gardens oh my god they have like a crazy like leafy it's it's a [ __ ] it's it's a strong a smell on the other [ __ ] you know they have they have strong smells of [ __ ] down [ __ ] late cuz I do not shut the [ __ ] up I got a chatterbox anyways you guys thanks for watching like always soon everything we have from dispensary man in Italy some flowers so thank you guys for watching like always if you guys did enjoy make sure guys drop a like a comment subscribe like always make sure you guys go down in description go follow me on social media all that stuff I do got a main channel I got a mmm I do upload like vlogs prank stuff like that right now recently I've just been kind of uploading really slowly on that one I've been focused on on to other things you know this channel done other things so it's a lot of behind the scenes so again everybody drop like comment subscribe hit that Bell so you guys can refine it every time you upload it I'll catch you guys in the next video Tim pretty lit final thoughts [ __ ] yeah", "FBru-i5Xf5g": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well hello everybody welcome to a brand new podcast today again we got another cartridge of you but today we're gonna be doing something a little bit more different I've only tried this brand at least like once and it is the king pan brand honestly the reason why I really I wanted to make this I had to make this video like I have to make this video I have to show you guys exactly what I really think about these and the only issue that I have with these but other than that I think King pen is hella fire it's I guess it's one of the world's most awarded cannabis fate I mean I guess I could believe that because this [ __ ] is it's pretty far is it better than raw garden heavy hitters you know what it's on its own it's on its own level so today I got some Cali oh it's eighty-three percent THC checked it out and I got a Minuteman I mean the design of this is pretty sick you know I think it's pretty dope it's powered by loud pack if you got you guys to see that right there and it says right here a 1 3 second draw as I see while serving so like always everybody you know a 3 second drag that's gonna be equivalent to one hit and let's seize cartridges king pan cartridges are available in indica sativa and hybrid proud to be the most avoided cannabis bait in the world okay in the world but hey man you guys better be cool watch out cuz you know seven 10 laughs who knows how their cartridges are gonna be raw garden to a man everybody's trying to come on big fan of raw garden because everybody that I know that smokes cartridges and I'm talking about like you've wired from like different cities and stuff they're all going for those rock garden songs oh man you better watch out cuz you might not be the most awarded soon so bono so I've actually tried a couple of these before I do have another flavor King Louie Oh got some King Louie og but I wanted to save that for another video but shout out the packaging but let me just show you guys one thing because these are just again everybody I do not condone the usage of these products I do not promote the sales of these products and I don't sell anything on this channel or I don't push anything it's just an educational review it's for cannabis patients 18 and up you know people that are just wanting to look for a review so let's go right here oh so got myself a little half not too bad not too bad I do want to take this sticker off Rennie let me say [ __ ] it maybe take it off there's a little sticker right here sometimes the sticker kind of kills the color it doesn't get you like that full color if that makes sense you know kick off that sticker there you go slowly nice and slowly BAM oh okay look at this this looks kind of fired I do like the logo right there you guys see right there okay you guys see the logo and it's just some clear wax - and this is clear - like the liquid inside is so clear look at that look at that let's do a little test there you go it's not moving at all we got some sativa on our end so you know I'm trying to wake up but like just one thing I can't everybody I've talked about this in different videos don't get me wrong man these King pens are fired I like them to me they're kind of like equivalent to like a heavy hitter so cheers everybody let's try it out whoo that flare mmm that [ __ ] is so fiery literally just tastes like gum kind of like an orange that's like an orange e flavor and you can just tell us a tivo right off the bat honestly sometimes a lot of people could smoke a sativa and they feel like they took like a shot of coffee you're like a little cup of coffee which is kind of crazy to me it's the other way around I feel like sometimes I could be slumped but smoking sativa it kind of does kind of wake me up like mentally it's like a it's like a mental wake-up type thing you know the physical wake up I feel like I'm a little [ __ ] little tired just cuz I smoked it you know but here like hey I'm show you guys king pan BAM eighty three point zero three percent THC so oh well like how these hey the design is pretty cool you know it's kind of heavy notes made I'd like a little likes a little type of metal but one thing I really do like about the kingpin is that some other flavors are just like lose it they got they got a good taste you guys like I I completely like I approve of the taste the taste is pretty nice hmm oh yeah let me tell you guys one thing though and I know I feel like a lot of people are gonna be able to relate to this but let me know in the comments down below but check this out so if you guys see the very end of this so yeah I see the bottom of it right there like this bottom right here I feel like some some of the liquid stays right here you know it's it gets stuck right here and I feel like you don't 100% complete like you don't want a hundred percent like all over the juice doesn't go inside the you know like the little coils inside if that makes sense you know there's always like a little bit left over that's just stuck in there and that happened to me like two times already I bought two cuz back then I used to like the king I used I select heavy hitters brass knuckles and King pens those were like my two daughters before I even knew about like raw garden and all these other cartridges it was always it was mainly brass knuckles I don't really like the brass knuckles and the heavy hitters see here and there I came across a king pin but actually I think yeah cuz my first cartridge ever was a a brass knuckle it was some sv og I remember that I was the SF vog and it was the full gram and I remember when I first bought it I first bought my first pan I was so excited I was like bruh I'm gonna get so late sigh my room while watch a movie watch a show I'm like ooh it's gonna be sick and that's exactly what I did you know I freaking got my home chart I mean I spent without any somewhat charge but I thought it was in charge so I kind of charged it up you know put it in and I was just like oh dude I'll if I can get it can I can remember to lose and it was in the next room it was the next the next door room I switched rooms in my apartment but back there I was inside yeah this is a tea but I feel like I'm kind of like can look creative you know get a little bit like let's [ __ ] get this bag baby let's look in yes but I remember that's - I freaked I think I watched the epic movie you guys remember that movie those like dumb parody movies the epic loot it was like scary movie epic movie disaster movie [ __ ] love these those lows those stupid parody movies I think they're so funny they're so interesting cuz I'm late half the time but in reality they're they're [ __ ] shitty movies but I always thought they're hella interesting the one that I really like oh my god you guys should go check that one it's called Stan Helsing it's a parody of Van Helsing but that [ __ ] is just ash it's just so funny honestly damn I feel like one thing about the King pens is I feel like the airflow is really nice like there's a way too much now way too much air flow but the air flow is just like on [ __ ] point what's my name before I do remember it was like I forgot what 2014 what was one out like I was first introduced to a couple pens no yet no 2013 Oh 13 or 14 yeah I think it was 13 or 14 one of those years but it wasn't like a it wasn't like a cartridge like a wax cartridge you know like like like distally you know it wasn't stuff like that it wasn't like live resin - it was more like a little globe it was like these little globes and inside was like a little like a tab it was pretty much like you're taking a DAB and there was like a little piece like a little coil in the middle there's like a globe and inside it was like a little coil and it was like heat up so you don't have to put your dab on that stuff you'd have to put your down on that and then you would hold it and I should the coil would heat up and then that's when you take it out that's what I remember the first pens that's that's that's what I'm I'm you know like what the hell is okay to smoke out of a pin likewise and after that that happened and I made like a year or two after that that's when all these like distillate that's when all you got all these like wax cartridges all these like random cartridges coming out and they were fired you know I I came across like for sure a lot of real ones but I'm not gonna lie I didn't come across maybe here and there - three of them that were for sure fake and that's cuz again I've talked about this I say this in every single cartridge video if you guys if you guys are buying those fake-ass $20 cards to stop buying that [ __ ] man don't just just cuz you're you okay right now you're in your head you're part like all 20 bucks bro [ __ ] that I'm not gonna go buy a $35 half gram or a 55 or $60 a full gram at the club and I could be buying a full almost a full gram on 20 bucks just like you guys man you guys are smoking those deadly pesticides you guys are smoking that fake [ __ ] I don't care if you're like local drug dealer or whatever selling guys now man this is some fire that's just the real [ __ ] nah man [ __ ] that if he's selling that [ __ ] I got 20 bucks unless you personally know the person and you know that he's making it and you know exactly what's going on that [ __ ] don't trust that [ __ ] bro cuz if you're paying 20 bucks even 20 bucks for a half gram bro I don't think so no but hey sometimes you guys could get I mean I mean I'm not gonna lie something you guys could probably get like a nice little there's probably people out there that get some nice little plugs or you guys you get some real [ __ ] for really low shout-out to you but majority of the people out there hell nah man you guys copy nothing [ __ ] just save your money and just go buy yourself a [ __ ] full gram of like a heavy hitter you know raw garden you know like cuz I know a lot of people that just mind some fake [ __ ] say it and say this real [ __ ] but I don't [ __ ] I don't think so I don't know I would I wouldn't risk it because at the end of the day she guys's body you're not gonna feel the damages that don't see your body right now but you're gonna feel it like maybe 20 30 years down the road when you're like and then you're 50 60 s you're gonna be like tan mask [ __ ] I smoked all that fake [ __ ] this [ __ ] sprocket effect is 2-1 like 50 60 who knows hopefully now but [ __ ] that's what we're doing that that's why I'm doing this review you guys so [ __ ] makes you guys drop alike man drop a comment what you guys have favorite flavor if you guys have tried kingpin and if you guys are new hit that subscribe button click that bell so you guys can notified every time we upload but sure y'all want to take a hit like what's up I bought a when I first found out that there was fake cartridges out on the street that's why I kind of like completely I'm like [ __ ] that dude I'm not I'm stopping I'm not gonna buy off the street I did a couple times here in they're not gonna lie but this was like maybe like three years ago yeah this happened like maybe three almost four years ago I bought a [ __ ] cartridge it was a brass knuckles cartridge and I bought it for 30 bucks at 30 for a $30 full gram and I'm like okay this guy that I knew at the time on this guy probably bottom and bulk got him super [ __ ] cheap he's just adding another extra five you know another 5 10 bucks to the price to each cartridge so that's that's cool you know he's making a profit I smoked like maybe like one third of it in like the bottom of this she started getting black I'm like what the [ __ ] was it getting black I started getting black I'm like what the [ __ ] dude this [ __ ] is not normal she's starting it I like what the hell's inside this cartridge so I showed one of my other friends but if you like it's obvious I doing this is fake bro you're smoking like fake wax fake this to it you know you're smoking fake distill fake to steal like he's like nah bro just don't [ __ ] away so what I did I was like [ __ ] the [ __ ] grabbed it screwed it off I just did that [ __ ] away and from there I was like dude I can be something you can't be something that fakes you do I did know some [ __ ] one girl though I'm not gonna lie like she [ __ ] oh my god I'm just disgusting but I mean she wasn't disgusting what I'm saying like just she just had no idea one time like [ __ ] I met some girl that had a cartridge that was so [ __ ] dark so cheap you can tell the plastic was so cheap like I asked her I was like what you are this [ __ ] I bought it for my friend house like let the [ __ ] how much like it's like 20 bucks and I was like bro what though it was so dark she was smoking like black tar [ __ ] wax or some [ __ ] ha and I was like dude throw this [ __ ] away and she's like nah and I was like okay cool you know I wanna I want to like taste I'm not gonna inhale this [ __ ] so I took it here oh hell no my mouth too blew it out as [ __ ] tastes like plastic oh she pointed and she part finished it knowing her knowing that chicks you pod killed that [ __ ] she got laid off her ass how [ __ ] all these deadly pesticides all these like chemicals and [ __ ] I have no idea but I don't know I just don't think it's worth it honestly I think it's just it's best just to go to the your local club you know like just go to the local dispensary these brands I know it might not be like 100 percent safe but they're free share you're way better than the [ __ ] that people caught cop off the streets and I talked about this in almost every single cartridge video because it's just so important to not be smoking these book these nasty like chemicals because it's not it might not affect you right now but it's gonna affect you down the road so [ __ ] a lot of people say they leave comments down below saying that I need to take I need to hold in my heads for holidays but your lungs instantly absorb all the THC one day when the smoke goes in your lungs it like instantly [ __ ] absorbs all the THC you know so it's not like you have to keep it in there for it till I grab the most tasty you know but oh that's why usually I hit it I hate it make sure it goes all in the lungs and I just blow it out right away so I'm like yeah I got all the teasing I needed I don't need to keep that smoking my lungs I'm already I should that's about to be wow I'm lit can't even talk anyways everybody at your price cut it off right now makes you guys drop a like a comment subscribe if you guys are brand new and click that bell it's really important guys click that bell so you guys you know five every time we upload let me know in a comment down below if you guys did that give you guys a shout out cause everybody this is the kingpin uh-huh the Kelly oh and Kelly OH skitty I get everybody I do not condone the usage of these products I do not promote the cells of any brand anything like that and I do not sell anything of this channel this is literally just an educational review for Canada's patients 18 innit you already know", "VZ1879gKHN8": "[Music] hey guys what's going on on baggage girl couch Queen and today I'm coming to you with another cartridge review now this one is from copper state say that I picked this up at Seoul flower dispensary my local dispensary here in Sun City now listen I'm gonna tell you something sunflower just opened their location in Sun City they did not come to play games with you guys okay they put all the dispensaries on notice I walked in there and they had like this trifecta deal like three you know three levels of deals first day you know your first visit you get like boku and then on every three visits your first three visits they give you this free yes yes they weren't playing games okay so this one I picked up this copper state forms actually they're I guess their form is in snowflake Arizona so it's local as well while I was there I also picked up a new bait a pin and this is from Moxie so I picked this up as well go ahead and get in here I picked up if you can see that DaVinci og all right so let's get in here and again free smoke right and let's get that in I'll tighten it and then I am twisted a little bit because you want to look or flow in there that's just me personally let's go one two three four five all right so it's it's blinking all right I'm gonna give it a little chance to to heat up a little bit but again copper state and let's see if I can there it is again that delayed smoke so these are stronger than flower so if you're a newbie please be careful like that was that was one puff and I think that's all I'm going to do maybe I'll do like a half a puff I don't know but you have to be careful with these because this isn't like flower you know if if I were to get like DaVinci oh gee like in flower form it would be anywhere I'm not sure but usually they're in the range from like 18 to like 20 something percent 25 24 whatever but this this is much much higher I'm talking almost 90 sometimes % so yes you do have to be careful with this so that you're not overdoing it because it's easy to think that you can just kind of sit here and puff up and you can't do that so this is like puff puff let's turn this off okay this is something that you can just continue to puff on let's see it's just still lit and that is it for me I'm done and I'm serious I don't play games for this because I have overdone it in the past if you see some other videos when I first started I was a newbie and unfortunately for me somebody suggested vaping as a newbie I know right crazy and it was not I did not have good days or good nights for a long time and I didn't know why I was really sick so like I said be careful on that again I I just don't sit and puff I just really don't so that was what 1 plus 1/2 puffs me and I'm done but it's very good now I like the the straight THC like this carts just I do not like the flavors and I had to learn I did you know when I went and I got some the cartridges you know they were like strawberry whatever pie or something I don't know but for me the flavored cartridges tore my throat up and I was like gagging and it was really bad for a while so when I do do the cartridges I will do something like and copper state this is a really good one okay you're not gonna get like the flavor that you normally would get with the flower or the flavored ones but if you're you know for if you're doing this for pain relief you know any of the other medical medical reasons or if you're just doing it to get high this will get you there and this will get you there quickly okay so again copper state this is DaVinci og and this is good this is yes for me I like BAE pants because they're so convenient but you know in general if you watch my videos you know what I prefer so anyway thank you guys for watching thank you for subscribing and I will see you guys later bye [Music] you [Music]", "6MO-ZGV-BUM": "i'm like yo there's some pink puffy [ __ ] i mean hello kitty posters and [Music] chocolates [Music] all right guys what is up simplistic here back with another video i am at ben's house once again and uh if you've been seeing this tronium battery around it's because it's been dope but they also gave me a box one too so i'm gonna see what this is and then i'm gonna probably give this little small one to ben and then i'm saying the small hand for the band no i'm just kidding um but yes this is the box battery it's like a box mod type [ __ ] and uh they're kind enough to send me one so let's see how this works oh yeah shout out to the mahomey van for always being dope you know saying but this is what it looks like uh the back draw activation so there's no button 380 milliamp per hour battery micro usb compatible with troy pods which is the the cartridges the empty cartridges that they provide one year warranty so there you go right off the bat very very nice um [Music] i was about to say that's it it's supposed to there's a quick start manual [Applause] micro usb adapter which they offer for the the small one and the long ones so this one you use for full grain this one for a half gram manual also a qr code if you want to scan it well let's just get into it we got that nine dollar half grand papa herbs look how much i have left because i went live again last night shout out to the people you know what i'm saying oh nice so it's auto hit so how do you turn this on and off it's weird oh it hits it's actually a lot smaller than i thought it was going to be oh wow definitely start the day with this there's no button just hit it there's no indication here that's pretty cool like you like it has these like uh where you can see the oil yeah yeah you just you just hit it it's actually really smooth compared to the other battery this one there's no voltage setting though so uh it kind of just maybe it's like a smart battery i don't [ __ ] know maybe i adjust to the the cartridge how smooth is it is it cool i like i like the way it feels too how it's like uh it's got like this little the form factor right and that's his thumb yes yeah also um like i said the drawback with these ones how'd you like it it's cool so these are basically the drawback of having a stick battery is that if you put in your pocket it could break you know what i'm saying if you sit down if you just like put in here you know sometimes you just put a pencil in your pocket and sit around with it you know some tight pants or some [ __ ] you know so it does happen um micro usb on the bottom uh i thought it would be usbc by now but you know i'm saying you can't really go wrong with micro usb it still charges pretty fast 380 milliamp per hour battery um other than that i'm taking more uh like a few more hits with this uh i'm enjoying it um maybe i should take a hit alongside with this one to see how smooth it is compared but is there any light that indicates like it's i think it's right here can you see no no light there's no manual there is many oh what the [ __ ] what it's right here see if you can see the light oh yeah okay so the light is right here so you can so like i said uh they did send me two batteries the stick battery and the pocket battery and honestly i'm i'm digging this one uh the light is i mean it's kind of visible in the in sunlight but overall really really good experience and i'm saying it's basically the height of this one still you know i'm saying so but check them out i'll post everything in the comments below you know i'm saying i'll pin a comment because i've been getting you know deleted because i've been posting links and strikes and stuff so i'd rather just post it in the comments you'll that's where you'll find it but definitely a good battery from um i'm saying other otherwise known as t-vape as well so thank you for watching the video see you guys the next one [Music] he [Music]", "gD6NUfvKW3M": "good morning tubers my name is Matt and I'm a medical marijuana patient here in the state of New Jersey and for years I've been smoking bud break I can't roll a blunt to save my life well bong hits a nice glass piece every now and again so technology brings me to this cartridge that I I didn't discover it you know but it's new tomates the roof brand they claim its co2 supercritical extracted they also claim it tests up to 85 86 percent THC they've got several different flavors I've got a indica and Fuji indica I think you can see that okay I'll show you the cartridge real fast that's the inside the box says on the side here all natural solvent free as the size of the cartridge up top half and here's the cartridge itself a little squiggly are 4ov brand color-coordinated per flavor this purple R is the og indica they suggest that you prime them before you use it so what I'll do is and you see it's got a little rubber mouthpiece cover on there I'll take that off now this isn't the actual mouthpiece can be used as a mouthpiece I use it as a mouthpiece works great but Road does offer a mouthpiece that's attached inside I think it's a silicone mouthpiece I'm not exactly sure because robe is only available on the west coast I'm on the East Coast don't know how I got these anywhere so your average 510 thread it's an all Pyrex glass cartridge stainless steel parts it's got a ceramic wick it's um they're pretty awesome I'll read you their little info or stats card what's new it says improved cartridge the new design as a ceramic core which improves taste and flow if your cartridge appears to be less then completely full don't worry so moil has already been absorbed in the wick now from experience I've got to tell you these cards are the bomb they will empty all the way down you see that a little bit right there yeah that'll get smoked like this cart has lasted me probably five or six days and I'm a full time smoker full time like in my pocket all times I charge it twice a day like full time smoker that's here this is the sherbet flavor pretty awesome it's it's not an oily substance it's more like a gel and I find that sometimes in the cold weather just overnight kids jammed up and it won't come through you won't get a good hit okay it's kind of shitty so particular handy dandy George you gotta be smarter than it first light it you just hear it up real fast real quick spinning the cartridge around eating up the jail you'll see it fall don't spend too much time on it voila yeah it's all formed down at the bottom now okay touch make sure you don't burn yourself take a couple dry poles alright dry you'll taste it then here we go raw brand cartridges you can't get them find them cheaters", "JVvjqk9nMJI": "you know what is going on guys today [ __ ] you would think after [ __ ] years I would have a different intro I hate seeing that but getting in front of camera is like really awkward for me still test now this new best dab pen compared to my last one this baby still rips it's called pulse battery $80 on

so I don't get no more [ __ ] trouble here been in way too much trouble lately with the law first strain ever invented and it was because this dude grew in Alaska and like Aurora lights you know the Northern Lights in Alaska went over the weed and weed before this was never a green it was always red grown by Mexicans but when this dude drew it in Alaska with the aurora lights it turned green for the first time so he called it the Northern Lights and the second ever strain was alaskan thunder [ __ ] from Alaska as well obviously BAM first two strains I actually really like this these flavors good as [ __ ] just don't know it but I've been sitting in this chair for like 15 minutes just on my phone [ __ ] hitting the dab pen I totally [ __ ] forgot about the video I was just getting stoned

like a day ago my recent video got restricted you can still see the video but it's a dope restricted only certain people can see it and sometimes I guess now they only pops up on you know certain people's channels or whatnot alright guys what pretty nice piece I couldn't even finish that dad it was too [ __ ] big bro but since that's happening I want you guys to follow me Instagram snapchat cuz I have a snapchat guys and then I want you guys to also follow me on my second YouTube cuz then we can post anything on that one I can do stuff that's not marijuana related I can do stuff that is

just smoking on the nut cart right now it's just another day but [Music] why not show you guys a new car so this is the eating card looks pretty good tree oil is like a little bit lighter than the car comes in a box like this [Music] hopefully you guys can see and it's a sauce Clark guys as the GDP so it's more like a lion president's not cut with anything they have other cars like this and you know how to tell the difference between the sauce and their regular ones their distillate rp1 these bits of gold tape right here in the sauce on it the other ones do not have that I mistakenly bought one that wasn't a sauce when I wanted the sauce one maybe I'll do a review on that one too but I was like damn I did not want to do that so I got the sauce one like the next day and I was like [ __ ] it but yeah there's also a difference between sauce and live resin which I am unsure what that is I'm have to do some research or you guys can tell me in the comments cuz you guys you guys are smart guys all you guys out there you always comment and you know you school meal and stuff and you give me the right information that I need but let's try this cheers guys also this has better air flow you see the little slits it has better air flow so you know when you're waxing clogged it's hard to suck this one's way more easier like apparently we're gonna find out though let's cheers Cheers [Music] I need no life boy that [ __ ] tastes skunky like it's super tank has a skunky a skunky earth earthy type flavor like with a hand of light I don't know I guess it's more earthy I was gonna say like more of a tangent an torini type flavor but it's more earthy than that but you get a kind of a sweet taste at the end on the exhale actually pretty [ __ ] good but it's expensive guys it's like 50-something a half after [Music] but yeah guys I'm just kicking it back today it's just about to be a low-key shouldn't be going out to begin with and I'm just hella tired from work and [ __ ] so I decided to just chill it's not really drive somewhere and go do a vlog so we just tail back at home and relax trying out a new eating card like you can find these guys eaten they're free they're freaking in Hayward they're in California guys if you're from California they're literally in Hayward they got their own store you got their own flower edibles and concentrate guys they also sell other things too but they got their own [ __ ] and then don't buy from know because nug is actually selling half grams of their stuff that's not sauce for pretty much sauce price and I got screwed that's how I got screwed earlier I should have just went straight to eat it I wish I would have went straight to eating it would have been way cheaper but it's a fire cart like I don't know it's a contender for sure because I just want to do a bunch of different cards like try a bunch of new cars that you guys haven't seen and that I even haven't seen because like I have never seen anyone try

louder in this video I noticed the audio of my videos has been a little bit hard to hear if you don't use headphones to watch the videos so just got done busting a dab of some of this cherry wine from extracts labs easily some of the tastiest CBD that I've had and I have a very tasty product to review for you tonight as well so I got this earlier today this is something I've been wanting to try for a while secret nature's vape cartridges now I did a video on secret nature's but back in the past so if you'd like to see that go ahead and check it out but this is secret nature's vape cartridges these are some of the most highly regarded cartridges that I've seen online everyone says they're top of the line and the reason why is because they're you they use cannabis drive terpenes so they use terpenes derived from actual but this particular cartridge i'm going to be reviewing is the gelato strain gelato if you don't know is one of the most popular top-shelf cannabis strains right now in legal states it's like 30 percent THC I think and it's a cross between well it was the gelato strain was created using the famous strain Girl Scout cookies or GSC so this is supposed to be a extremely popular top-shelf cannabis strain and I've never tried it so I decided to go with the gelato cartridge flavor it is a hybrid because the gelato cannabis strain is a hybrid so they extract the terpenes and they mix it with CBD distillate this particular distillate that they use is 51% CBD 0.2 three percent THC so you get that full spectrum entourage effect the only thing that this oil is lacking that I would have liked to see is CBG and CBC those are some other cannabinoids when you get high concentrations of all these cannabinoids you get what is called the entourage effect which means you get its more full spectrum and they work together to produce the effects that they would have it would have naturally caused or produced in like but if you're smoking bud so the more cannabinoid spectrum you have the more effects you are likely to feel so this is a 1/2 gram 500 milligram cartridges if it's 50% CBD there's 250 milligrams of CBD in this so the first thing I noticed when I open this package up is the packaging on secret nature this packaging is super professional-looking in just premium and it sits like a hard cardboard stock it almost reminds me of like when you buy a new phone the black cardboard box it comes in that's kind of what this is and I like that they use cardboard versus plastic the amount of plastic that we use as humans is getting out of control it's not good so any company that's using a paper or cardboard I applaud them for that so I'm gonna go ahead and show you this packaging it is beautiful it's black and it's got gold ink and it's even like indented and raised up in some parts so when you open it up it slides open which is cool and then the cartridge was sitting right in there so really cool packaging in the front says secret nature artisan cvd gelato hybrid vapor cartridge full spectrum CBD distillate 500 milligrams on the back that secret nature our goal is to help people enhance their chosen lifestyle through relaxation meditation relief in creativity this 100% organic extract is a true full-spectrum CBD distillate has been purified to concentrate beneficial compounds while removing unwanted plant materials full-spectrum oils contain a wide wide array of cannabinoids like I explained together these compounds synergize entourage effect to create the desired effects from the planet we use real cannabis flower terpenes THC free source from artisan cultivators in California to enhance our extracts and give a true plant experience this company is out of Rogue Valley Oregon without further ado so 10 out of 10 for the packaging let's get into it I'm going to show you the cartridge before I taste it so this oil is like really light in color it almost looks if you've ever poured a mountain Dew in a clear glass that's kind of what the color looks like and it's got this really nice metal mouthpiece I'm not sure what kind of cartridge this is it doesn't say C cell on it but it's definitely a ceramic coiled cartridge the oil is very thick as you can see the bubbles are not moving which is expected CBD oil is usually very thick because it crystallizes around 60% so these are supposed to be some of the tastiest cartridges available because they have real cannabis terpenes so we'll go ahead and try this gelato so the first thing I noticed when hitting this cartridge is it kind of has a a hard you have to kind of pull a little bit harder than you wouldn't normally then I've had to pull on cartridges in the past which doesn't bother me sometimes I like having to pull a little bit harder because you can almost feel how much smoke you're taking in a little bit easier and the mouthpiece has a really sturdy feel to it I don't know it feels good on the lips Wow so the flavor on this stuff is amazing you get all flavor and nothing else you don't get any weird taste you're just getting the terpene flavor so it kind of has like a woody fruity taste to it I know that sounds weird woody but that's literally what it I'm getting and it's an enjoyable taste yeah I don't know how to describe it a head it's like oh like a woody fruity taste like almost like if you I don't know I'm almost getting like some strawberries what I want to say but extremely tasty um if you want a cartridge that for the flavor check out secret nature because this is the best tasting cartridge I've probably ever tried this blows for the people's card Church out of the watermelon taste I mean I thought this tasted pretty good but I mean this is this is the real deal Wow amazing taste I'm I would actually really like to try all their flavors now too rather not like a sample pack because it's really that tasty so I got this from the chrome leaf if you watch my videos you know I've been getting a lot of cartridge from the Khalif website it's because the cone Lee's hat the chrome leaf has the cheapest cartridge prices that I've found online so the cone leaf is a reseller so they'll buy also from a company and then sell but they're pricing their pride it's very very cheap I went to the secret nature website and the cartridge on the secret nature website are even more expensive than what you'll find that the column leaves so if you're interested in cartridges check out the palm leaf and I would highly recommend secret nature I think this 1/2 gram cartridge runs at about 40 maybe like 44 dollars for a half gram so it is expensive but it's not uncommon for what we're seeing CBD cartridges being priced at right now and this is I'll tell you what a premium product I would choose this over for the people for sure just based on the taste and the looks of the oil but like I said the only thing lacking in this is the CBG and cbc that's okay it still is a full spectrum product I have to give this 10 out of 10 the effects on this stuff I did hit it a few times before I did this video just to try to give you guys good effects I'm not tired at all it is a hybrid so just with the terpenes you're not gonna get sedated or anything like that and especially it's got the lower CBD not lower CBD percentage but right around 50 so this would be a great daytime product to use I feel energetic but focused as well and I'm also used to CBD so if you're not used to seedy trying a cartridge like this may make you very tired you know it kind of just depends on your tolerance your body type what time of the day you're using it but overall good effects on this stuff I definitely feel it with any constancy be concentrate you will feel it if it's full-spectrum and I feel just a little bit lighter a little bit more uplifted a little bit happier more and more content with life that's my review on secret nature gelato cartridge I couldn't give this anything less than a 10 out of 10 to be honest with you well I've give it a 9 out of 10 because me personally I would like a little bit more full-spectrum maybe a little bit more THC like right cut off maybe even some thca to really bring out the full spectrum effects and hit yet but nonetheless this is a very uplifting cartridge and extremely flavorful that's all for this review I hope everyone's having a great day night whatever it is as always peace out", "FsAQNRb5FFk": "what is up YouTube amateur Blavatsky's here gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys now really want to appreciate my new

have gotten I've never pay like 50 a little bit over 50 bucks it was almost a little bit over 50 bucks almost not over 60 though so I'm really excited these cartridges are new they just hit my dispensary I looked them up on Instagram I have like 2000 followers so they're just like kind of new to the market as well but these these are like alright these are game changers you know as you guys can see the on the side that says it what's a sale man it says less than the 2 v battery you know you don't to burn it and it says distillate free guys this is not a distillate cartridge this is a straight liquid diamond sauce car I've never had a liquid diamond sauce card I've never seen a review on YouTube there was only one guy who did a review there IRS's it's an ice cream cake and yeah this should be pretty bomb you know the it's full gram I don't know where these guys in their Humboldt County so yeah guys we're gonna get in straight to so you have this little button here press this button hey let me show you guys a little close-up ice cream cake and it's a 76 percent THC what I think yeah 76 percent so yeah guys this is pretty dope you know the everyone that the shot was telling these are pretty far and we're gonna go ahead and see I'm gonna I'm gonna let you guys know I love rock garden and [ __ ] but I'm gonna see if these are better than raw garden so you know I've never had a liquid diamond sauce car which it says there is pretty dope you know so if you guys ever see these be on the lookout so as a little button there and you got impress it and you gotta twist it off slow sticker pull out I don't break the damn thing oh [ __ ] Wow looks pretty dope guys so we're glad mom how do you do this do you just pop it up just pop it out and bam down this is a pre feels pretty good no nice and heavy the oil looks pretty decent you know it looks kind of different from what other cartridges would look like gots nice little day in there but you get a full ground because I I was reading their information on Instagram as well you know if there's a big day is because the Okoye in there has a nice big koala as you guys can see you know it's a pretty nice big coil in there so it's what it does is the coil sucks up some of the oil in there so that's what put some damp but you guys took it you're full ground you know I'm saying yeah I ain't getting ripped off or nothing like that so like I said these this is probably like the second Ursula review on YouTube guys there's gonna be you know these cartridges just hit the market so I don't know how long they've been out but I heard they taste like exactly like [ __ ] like if you're taking adapt hey you know what I mean like straight really it's it's is it I'm think no distillate so I'm gonna flip it over hold it for a little bit this is a distillate free cartridge guys it's just gonna be fire as [ __ ] it was like 55 bucks you know out here 55 bucks for cartridges it's kind of expensive you know and with tax on top of that so we're to be him I'm going to try hit those imma see if I have some flavors but I'm sorry you do get a little clean taste like a live resin like what's it called like a raw garden would taste like so you don't really get like in a specific flavor to it now I want to let you guys know um I just hit that criteria for for YouTube to be for my channel to be monetized so I'm not really really excited you know I'm really hoping you know the channel pays off that we can help the channel grow buy more products and [ __ ] like that so you know for you guys and as if it wasn't for you guys I would never got my channel monetize you know it's [ __ ] crazy so if you guys ever see ads on the videos don't [ __ ] skip them guys watch those ads watch them all please it really helped me a lot in the channel but thank you guys you know you guys are awesome so we're just gonna go numb we're going to hit this and I'm let you guys know if it's really worth it or not you know what I mean but cheers guys if you guys are smoking out with me go ahead and do so take a little hit just to get some flavors I could taste it oh wow the flavors guys I would describe it is if you guys took a literally a [ __ ] DAP it oh wow that's crazy so it literally tastes like some real real wax guys they don't taste like a cartridge you know this thing is amazing the flavor I would describe it like if you would take like a literally a dab of the raw garden taste like waxy clean taste to it it's [ __ ] bomb but you don't really get like an ice cream it's an ice cream cake strain so you don't really get the ice cream cake in it but you do really get this like I could cushy like a clean taste cushy taste it is so good it tastes so clean I'm gonna go ahead and hit this again I might hit it a little longer and try and kill myself at awaken Bay but cheers guys hope you guys are smiling on with me mo oh wow most definitely I will be getting some more of these this one's only flavored they had it was a ice cream cake I'm not heard they had like a banana oh gee they have a lemon tree but I'm I shot the only Hodgins ice cream cake but if you guys ever see this ice cream cake you guys got a copy I'm not [ __ ] around with you I'm over-exaggerating it sings fire I'm not playing it tastes exactly like [ __ ] dab it tastes so like that's so real like it's crazy I'm sure you guys the packaging again so you guys can see you know it's distillate free or 100% cannabis which is pretty dope you know the thing these are game changers right here you know liquid diamond sauce cards these are actually liquid diamond sauce cars not no [ __ ] and the cartridge itself you know they got to it's really cool they got the nice new ceramic tip on there everything's ceramic on the cartridge I'm pretty sure cuz it looks pretty dope guys so if you guys if you guys want to go on Instagram and look up Ursa to get some more information or you know just to check the cartridges out for you guys itself and I also seen some cartridges that had like some fuzziness and they're like they actually know like I had some actual accidents so it just depends on the cartridge you guys get well but hope you guys are ready for that Super Bowl if you got a Niner fans like this V no comment you know I'm a big man of fun as well hopefully we win it probably just a barbeque that day tomorrow you know drink some beers and [ __ ] watch the game that's on this Saturday morning he has plans which you guys smoking on but I'm gonna hit this guy before I cut the video short guys and I'm I'm

rip like a [ __ ] rock garden as well [ __ ] alright guys but thanks for watching guys you guys stay tuned I'm gonna be coming up with a new beat as I said and yeah", "3983X2_q71k": "[Music] every one is a leak in California here for another review video today today the review is gonna be based on Big Chief extracts a cartridge company here in California I wanted to go ahead and do a little review talk about them show their cartridge do a little product review and everything like that so let's go ahead and just get started in showing it this is what the box looks like this one is sunset gelato sunset gelato is a hybrid strain so it is 75% indica 25% sativa dominant I also do have white widow here which I'm gonna be opening the box and showing you which is why this one's just the front cover when you do go ahead and get into it this is what your cartridge is going to look like it's in a childproof packaging when you take it out there's a little hologram that you can scratch off to get the QR code so that way if you want to go ahead check it online see the results for everything you can go ahead and do that as far as the packaging I would say it does look pretty nice they did take time to engrave in the front and emboss the Big Chief and the little tobacco man and everything the only downside I would say on their packaging is on their stickers which for all their boxes the percentages aren't actually embossed into the boxes they're just stuck on none of them say hybrid or sativa or indica so if you were just someone going into the club or buying it off somewhere and looking at it you wouldn't know what it is unless you had all the streams memorized the one that I currently have open and ready to go is granddaddy purple I've already gone through about half of it granddaddy purple is an indica based strain for those who don't know there's a lot of reviews and granddaddy purple from flower to extract edibles so it's completely up to you you know how you want to use it how you want to use these products I do recommend as I always say in my videos if you're under 18 or you're just doing this recklessly that's not a good way to go for it I use this personally just to help me with stress and anxiety and sleeping and I personally do think that this granddaddy purple strain is a good strain I will say their oils are very clear very clear yellow they're not like a super clear like some of the really cheap cards look like like the exotic carts and those really cheap ones the candy ones you know the supreme ones those street cards those ones are just clear trash this one doesn't taste like an oil like what I would say like a coconut oil or like a kitchen oil it actually has a cannabis taste but it doesn't have a fruity taste which if you've watched any of my previous reviews that is what I always say I like I personally am NOT a fruit east type person I would rather have something just taste like the straight string so let's go ahead and puff on this so that I can slow down with my talking and get into the review now as far as hitting it when I hit it there is no scratch or pain or I want to Kaufmann I hit it even if I take like a long puff on it which is something that I like [Music] compared to other brands I will say this does remind me of the packaging that jetty had with the false wooden tip but I know that they are all going through pretty much the same suppliers just buying this in masse and then making their little logo adjustments putting their brands on all these taka jeans and everything so can't say too much about that but as far as it works it does work I have it on a heavy hitters battery you can put it on any type of sea cell battery that you want some brands like heavy hitters recommend just put theirs on theirs but Big Chief extracts doesn't have their own signature battery that they recommend or seesaw voltage that they recommend as far as I know the coolest thing about them is that little QR code that you can scan here and go online they do have a website you can look them up online and check out the different strings what's gonna come out next and everything they do have tons of strains which I do like that about Big Chief extracts is that they don't have five or ten strains that are out for three months and then that's it they do have a lot of strains and they do come year round which is great I've known about them just for a little over a year now I believe they haven't been out too much longer than that because they were working on getting licensed getting their products out there distributing them getting them into clubs and that's why they're still around because they think they're trying to just keep getting out there as far as the review that's pretty much what I just kind of wanted to go over with Big Chief extracts I just wanted to do a little review talk about them talk about their packaging talk about the strains talk about what I like about them if there's anything I'm missing in the videos or anything you guys want to see just go ahead and comment pretty much the first parts of my videos really talk about what I want to talk about what I want to explain and then the rest is just me trying my product hitting it and then just rambling and talking on my battery is dying on this pen so I'm gonna have to charge it so it looks like I'm gonna end the video here again if you guys have any comments or questions go ahead and leave them in the video I pretty much try to always respond when I can you guys have anything you want me to review or anything you want to say like I said go ahead and let me know in the comments if you guys want to follow me on Instagram right now it is king/california cush i'll go ahead and link it down below have a great day morning night you guys thanks for watching my video bye", "Hisk_MGEuaY": "to fam strip boy vaska's here i gotta be doing a cartridge of you today you know well big thank you to many subscribers and

but here we have a sub lime my dispenser you always has 30% off like the cells everyday so it's pretty it's pretty packed you know when they have like a 30% off at the dispenser so this I seen these around before the sublime cartridges I don't know if you guys have seen them before they're like they're out of Oakland California it's like I'm like an hour and a half away from Oakland which is pretty cool you know so these are pretty these are pretty cool I had a get one they're called sublime I'm pretty sure you guys I see them around I don't know if they're popular or not or if they're fakes or whatever but you know these are pretty cool they're uh these are new boxes like if you go on their website on the Instagram I should say learn new boxes that post it on a post about them that you know they have any boxes and whatnot so how did it get this cartridge cuz it's a Sour Diesel you know all the cartridges I've tried I've never had a Sour Diesel before so I was like I've definitely got to get it and this is a hybrid sativa hybrid so I'm really really interested in it so on the back it says ingredients premium cannabis oil with terpenes in this so hopefully it's pretty good now the price on these guys they're really really cheap they're like 25 bucks a gram so I was like I'm definitely gonna get it and it's a pretty nice box you know you got your THC percentage you got all that good stuff on there you like a good cartridge to have you know and yeah guys like I said it says life-of-the-party on it cuz how it's a hybrid sativa you know sativas keep you going through the day I don't get you lazier none of that [ __ ] you know which I think indicas in hybrids up I do like them but that's more like when I'm chilling you know when I'm I got about I like to you know stay active and you know be aware of my surroundings you know I don't like to be falling asleep yawning and [ __ ] so yeah that's why I like my sativa so as you guys can see here that gots the best number and this is Oakland California wherever they're from and yeah guys it's pretty interesting it has a little sticker on the bottom here I'm just gonna need something to pop it open real quick so it's a turd 8 it's Saturday today it's about 10:00 10:30 in the morning let me know what you guys up to on the weekend you guys have any plans parties you guys gonna turn the [ __ ] up or what I could have gone to the Bay Area soon later have some stuff season it up there so so yeah guys we're gonna get to it with this box that's a little that's a little button right here like a [ __ ] like any other cartridge [ __ ] so you just pulled it and it should come right out like that so the box is pretty neat as you guys can see has a little artwork on the side it says reel reel on it and so the cartridge itself guys is [ __ ] amazing as you guys can see the top it's like a round it's like a dang babe cartridge sorta way you know like the top is round it's not like a like a seashell cartridge I should say which is pretty cool because I liked those round tips you know they it makes the cartridge more appealing so we're gonna go ahead and take the cartridge out and yeah at least these things look pretty damn me the cartridge look fancy so we're gonna take this little rubber thing off and yeah this is like a ding babe you know it has like that round tip like I said I really like those kinds of cartridges that have it they just make it more appealing like I said and and this was a Sour Diesel so it's a sativa and we're gonna take it off we're gonna got to do the bow test flip it around my nose our little chalk excuse me good nervous and just like chew my nose I don't know it's just when I was kicking him so pretty thick oil and I've never had one of these before so I'm really really interested in them already got another dry hit it I'm gonna get a little sip of my iced coffee real quick then me uh I'm go ahead and dry hit this um see if I get some flavors off it I always do this should I try to hit it but the [ __ ] I've always forgot to get the rubber seal off so now we can try it now first of all you do get like a little citrusy taste to it but I'm gonna be honest it's not like a live resin tastes like a clean it's like a like a fake fake taste which I don't really care I mean it doesn't taste that bad it you do get like a little lemony taste to it so we're gonna gonna get my battery I have my yo cat with me today badi is one of the so it's pretty good battery I'm not gonna lie you know I'm not promoting nothing like that but it's just a really good battery itself you know it lasts is a [ __ ] a while so you guys like to vape along all day in [ __ ] you should get definitely get one of these your calves you know they're pretty they're pretty cool for the price of like three blokes so it comes with the little magnet you just screw it on the bottom like that and let me know what you guys smoking on a get smoking are karcher smoking some weed while watching my video really I'm curious about that and I like to know what my subscribers of smoking on smoking some dank or what but yeah guys I got the little magnet screwed on there and it's on so where did I just drop it in BAM so yeah guys if you had this smoke alone go ahead and do so and like I said in the beginning of the video I really appreciate my new subscribers you guys are awesome and you should always be sure to let me know which kind of videos or cars juicy I'd like to see you know that way I can do my best to get a hold of the things and bring out the content for you guys you guys want to see but you guys just you know stay in touch like you guys always been and yeah guys Cheers we're going to hit this and I'm not gonna sugarcoat [ __ ] on this it was like 25 bucks for the cartridge so at my dispensary so it should should be good right if it's from the decision we're gonna see Cheers Wow first of all guys you really really get a piney taste to it like if it would be like a jack rare well this thing really surprises me it tastes like sort of like a dizzy like honestly it tastes better than this dizzy for for being a sativa hybrid Sour Diesel I'll definitely I'm probably gonna go back and buy like two more of these [ __ ] that's how good it is I'm not over exaggerating on the flavor nothing but to be honest for twenty-five dollars a gram guys this is a bang for your buck right here these sub-sub line they had a dad like done' you have like ducting three flavors or four it only have like a sativa stiva hybrid indica indictor hybrid or just straight in dicta you know and those are only like four strains so it's not like they have a [ __ ] or sativas but they only have the specific sativa hybrid one and the how to get it's a Sour Diesel and you guys know I love my sativas you know and its really good the flavor too it's like it's not nothing fake it tastes pretty good like some natural terpenes in there I'm going to hit it again and see if I can get a good profile flavor profile for you guys wow this thing tastes really really limiting doesn't it taste like like some fake Terps you know like a fake cartridge with taste like but this thing is [ __ ] great this thing's bomb you can still like you can taste lemon in your mouth still once you blow the big old clouds out but for the high the THC was like 70 80 80 70 % let me see 84% and these cartridges were made in October so they're pretty fresh cartridges guys and the high for my first high of the day I'm loaded already this is my waking big you know how to [ __ ] you get the V there goes like a smoke man but I'm gonna hit it again for I cut the little short I just love tasting up the vape you know it just tastes so good let me know how you guys if you guys do it the same you know you guys take a big hair hold it in try it out it's fire I like doing that you know you really really get the whole taste to it now these cartridges are they're not bad guys I thought they were gonna be like they were gonna be good as good as they are you know these things are [ __ ] fire if you guys ever see these you come across you guys go ahead and [ __ ] these I'm probably gonna buy some more but different flavors like an indica ii show you guys different flavors i have but for the quality on the oil and for the car to just solve look at that it's a pretty nice gold oh you know with the little round tip you don't really see those a lot and then these are [ __ ] nice $25 guys out the door and but yeah guys be sure to LIKE and subscribe and let me know which kind of cartridges did you guys like to see I also do like some roll a blunt smoke coupling with you guys know should I catch you guys just let me know in the comment section but yeah guys I hope you guys have a good day good rest of your day no don't get no [ __ ] be good and you guys stay tuned peace", "erXpR_x6YzI": "what's up YouTube it's your boy mr. bling seed back again with another video today I'm coming at you with an unofficial dank vapes comparison and review the carts I have in question are pineapple express an ace of spades OOP I move the pineapple Express so the reason I'm making this video is because I know that dank vapes carts are all illegitimate but there are still some that are better than others and some that are more healthy for you to smoke are at least more safe for you to smoke than others um and if these are all you have like availability for it then you should at least know which ones you should buy and which ones you should just stay away from altogether because that way you don't waste your money and you're also at least being an informed consumer and you're staying relatively safe so today we have two different cards as you can see the packaging is also different the strains are different but they're both say tank faiths which is wild and you can see like if you look more closely there is a lot of difference in these cart packages you have this one which shows the card from this side it says 1.1 grams and DANC on the side it has raised sort of like background art I guess I could call that and a holographic dang face logo on the top the front the bottom and the side except this side on this side it says dang clips official account all organic no propylene glycol and on the back it says Ace of Spades is a creation from TGA sub cool seeds that takes advantage of the popular sweet and sour combination that never goes out of style a crossbreed of black cherry soda and Jack the Ripper this strain has an earthy berry and citrus smell that carries over into the taste with distinctly lemony flavours Asus blades pants ace of spades plants grow fast and need a lot of space because they will get both bushy and tall flowering occurs at eight weeks and they are generally large and heavy see the funny thing about Danks vapes is that on the back of all of their carts they just have the leaf Lee articles written right there which I mean I don't hate because it's easy for reviews because I can just read the back of the packaging but like it's also kind of lazy what do you think about it anyway so the Apple Express card we have raised letters but flat background art we have irregular art on the front and Danks waves on the front you can't see the cart from the side but it still says dang faves official account all organic no propylene glycol on this side it says the same thing and it has a holographic tank on the top and bottom the description for pineapple Express after I drop the cart and focus pineapple express combines the potent and flavorful forces of parent strange trainwreck and Hawaiian the smell is like into fresh apple and mango with a taste of pineapple pine and cedar this hard-hitting sativa dominant hybrid provides a long-lasting energetic buzz perfect for productive afternoons and creative escapes so there is the packaging review of these cards now the question is which one is real and which one is fake so after doing a bit of research online you can find that there pretty much four major ways to see whether your dank babes carts are real or fake and that would be looking at the packaging itself which I just showed you guys but now I'll go more into detail with that the Instagram account that's on the side of the packaging the C cell atomizer itself and the wax quality so I'm gonna go over each of these cards one by one and just show you like the different points to look at and then uh I'll go ahead and review them and show you guys how they both hit and I'll give you my opinion on which one tastes better so after doing a bit of research online you find that they're pretty much four major ways to check whether or not you have a legit sort of official tank vapes cart versus a knockoff that your dealer just kind of put some snake oil in the four major ways would be looking at the packaging itself the Instagram account on the side the there are signs on the bottom of these C cell atomizers that'll tell you and a wax quality so in this review I'm gonna be going over each of those four points with each of these carts and showing you which ones are more trustworthy and which ones aren't but then I'm also going to be hitting both of them to show you guys the wax quality and I'll tell you how the hits feel if they're chemically and burn or if they're like sort of smooth and tastes good um and then finally I'll tell you guys about the highs based off each of them so yeah let's get into this review I'm actually pretty excited for starting this recording I did do some like light sort of examinations of these karts to see which ones I thought were real and fake before starting the video and I'll just tell you that right now I'm pretty sure this one is legitimate banks vapes carts and this one is not so let me show you why I think this so according to my research and I'll link all my sources in the description below but first off it says that the dank vapes packaging that is legit has the cart shown on the side and that's kind of funny to me because I've had a dank faves carts like this before which was the strawberry shortcake one and it had the same packaging pretty much exactly except a sort of like red theme because it was obviously strawberry shortcake and that being said I've also had carts that are like the pineapple Express ones I'm going to this more in a little bit let's go back to the Ace of Spades anyway so online it says that legitimate dank babes carts have raised lettering for the stream but like lowered lettering for the actual date vapes logo and the back art should be raised and that the theme of these carts are basically all black secondly on the side it should say dank vapes official account because that is the only actual dank vapes official Instagram account that exists some fake carts will just say like dank vapes official or like dank vapes account but if it doesn't say if it does say tanks beeps official account then usually it should be a more legitimate current than others I say that because as you can see on the pineapple Express it also has the right thing so next up if you open the packaging and you take out the cart first you can look at the wax quality and see that uh this one is a bit runny it's not slow it's sort of uh the air bubble transfer is really fast in superfast which is not really a good sign for wax quality so I would definitely watch out for that oh when I actually hit it I'll be able to tell you more about if the wax like is good but for now I'm not very like excited to try this cart um if you look at the bottom let me see if I can get that to focus okay yeah so you see this K you see a stamp number and you see C so though that shows that this is an official C cell cartridge or atomizer at least zoom out there we go looking beautiful um so yeah as you can see this is a real C cell atomizer with some lower quality wax in it which is kind of funny to me because well I go through the process of like getting the best packaging getting good like atomizers and then putting late some kind of crappy oil in it obviously I'm saying it's crappy just based off of these like visual tests but when I actually get into like tasting it maybe I'll be wrong who knows umm another fun thing that I did look into or my old C cell cart or atomizers so we have this one from the serial curtain they see that this is a real C cell cartridge as the C sell the CA and decay on it if it's a fake it could still have all of these but the font will be um kind of stretched out and big and not like actually etched in to the cart like it is with these um on this traphouse Curt atomizer that's supposed to also be a C so you can see that it doesn't have C cell on it it has like another brand so this would be one of those knockoff sort of atomizers that are sold from China and that's on this trap house card so a lot of companies have been using DC cell cars because they do hit nice and they give you good flavor but some still use legitimate C cells and some also still use like knockoffs so this is the ace of spades one final look before I go on to the pineapple Express and I'll be right back alright so with this pineapple Express cart you can see that you can look at the wax itself and the atomizer from the front of the packaging which if you look online and will say that this would be second-generation tank vapes packaging which I'm not really sure how like believable that is but I mean everything else on the packaging checks out the Leafly description on the back it's got raised lettering on the front and not a raised deck vapes logo but those dang capes logo is still holographic and gold um it's got raised artwork it has the actual like tank vapes account on it and the packaging just feels like it feels quality and premium which i know sounds weird but like if you're getting a fake packaging you can sort of feel that the Pat the paper would be like kind of shitty and not like good quality and thick like this is let's go ahead and open up the packaging and look at the sea salt cartridge itself now looking at the sea solid cellphone this is what leads me to believe that it's a fake because as you can see it checks out it looks fine um the bar in the middle is not thick on some fakes that bar will be hella thick but uh when you look at the bottom of it its it will focus it's a sea cell but it says M 208 when you look up see sell em 208 on google it'll bring up the Jupiter Cecil atomizers and in case you didn't know Cecil also owns Jupiter so like the liquid 610 or batteries and any of the lake Jupiter atomizers are also legitimate Cecil atomizers except for the fact that Cecil atomizers always have to have three prints on the bottom it'll have either Jupiter or that little K C cell and then a a lot number or a serial number this only has two so it can't be an actual C cell cartridge so it's a fake atomizer bought from China but if you look at the wax quality you can see that it's sort of good the bubble is small and it's moving very very slowly so this needs me to believe that the lacked quality itself is either very good or it's mixed with something very thick to make move slower which is why you have to like look at all these sort of uh signs that I'm trying to show you guys versus just like one or two of them so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is throw these cards onto my C cell m3 battery and I'll just show you guys how they hit um just so you can see a bit of like the wax quality and like the clouds you can get but I'm not gonna do a full review until tomorrow because I'd like to have a day with them to actually be able to test the wax quality and the highs because when I'm doing a video on something that could be like like health risks I'd like to at least give you guys a real review that's comprehensive so I think having a day to test like if the wax gives me a headache or if it makes me feel sick or if it just burns and tastes bad like I can tell you that better based off like a full day of using these than just um like a little five-minute review so let me go ahead and take these first hits and then we shall see tomorrow what my final verdict on these cards is I got a new sort of filming spot for now because it's summer and oh my god it is [ __ ] hot as hell in this house anyway so we're gonna be taking our first hits off of these dang babes carts what I'm probably gonna do is I think I'm gonna hit the Pineapple Express one first than the ace of spades second because while I think the Pineapple Express could be a fake I really want to test out this max quality more than anything because really that's what matters when you're buying these carts too is wax quality so let's go ahead and screw it on with the C cell I'm three let's just take a rip cheers guys so as you can see that's a pretty nice cloud I think especially for like a first hit off of a cart that's not even like preheated yet so let me take another hit and then I'll talk about the taste and like how it feels but so far I'm having positive opinions on this it tastes really good it actually tastes like like a bit of mango and pineapple so I'm already becoming a fan of this pineapple Express cart I'm gonna hit it one more time and then I'll go ahead and switch over to ASA spades Cheers yeah yeah I'm definitely a fan of this right now plus as you can see like I'm not coughing right now and if you watch any of my other videos you'll see like Ike off like a [ __ ] with baby lungs so positive opinion on pineapple express tank vapes let's go ahead and check this Ace of Spades over the next we're gonna hit this ace of spades card let's see how that goes okay packaging go ahead and screw it onto the seesaw 11 3 let's take our first rib Cheers okay so it tastes kind of bad and like I don't even think that was a very good cloud from it so let's try again I'm not sure how familiar you are with Indian food but this current sort of tastes like cardamom which is a very big seasoning in Indian food and I'm not a fan of it um it also just kind of burns the back of my throat when I'm hitting it so I'm not really feeling too confident about this an ace of spades card from dang babes let me hit it one more time and see if my opinion can change yeah it is really spicy not spicy but it just really tastes like cardamon and I was expressing a sort of like sour sweet taste so I'm kind of disappointed but either way I don't think it'd be a true mr. blinky review if I didn't hit these cards out of the dab cap just to test them out even further so I got the daily high club piece from a a blue dab cap in this cart let's just hit both of them through the dab cap for today I'll see how they feel then tomorrow I'll come back at you with like a full review so Cheers on the Ace of Spades so late even ripping it out of it to have cab it took forever in a cloud of the piece and then it still just didn't even taste good so hazel speeds right now I definitely have a negative opinion of it it could change you to eat today and tomorrow but for now I really think this pineapple Express is gonna be the better card let me go and load it up and then I'll take it through the top cap and they will end for you today all right so we got the pineapple Express on the dab cap let's go ahead and hit it through this piece and then I'll catch you guys tomorrow Cheers okay so I cut out the coffee but they ain't very nice you could see the cloud it was very uh thick and dense and it tasted amazing it made me coffee lot that was because I think it was just a really good hit so i'ma go ahead and review these carts in like my personal use and then tomorrow come back and tell you guys like which one is better or not I can tell you right now though I am fried as hell so one of these carts are maybe even both of them who knows they definitely work so yeah I'll see you guys in the next day I've been vaping on to ace of spades which is this current and the Pineapple Express since yesterday evening and I think I have an actual good review for each of them so my ace of spades review would be that the atomizer itself doesn't nearly hit as hard as the Pineapple Express won which in retrospect isn't necessarily a bad thing because it means this wax will last longer then the pineapple Express wax but it'll also take you considerably longer to get high initially when you're trying to smoke in um the high on it lasts three and a half to five hours which was really cool and the way I can describe the high for me at least was that it made me feel kind of tired but relaxed enough and like it also helped me focus enough that I could edit like this video as well as do some studying so that was really cool I really like that so I'm a fan of the high for that the negatives of it would be that it did make me feel a bit paranoid which I'm not a fan of because like just having like general anxiety this cart made that a bit worse so I would definitely only smoke this car at night and if I'm trying to actually like either just go to sleep or maybe get something done at night other than that I would not smoke this during the day simply because it would make me paranoid and it just doesn't seem worth it especially when the Pineapple Express makes me feel pretty like energetic imma go into it more in a second but like my overall review of the Ace of Spades would probably be a 6 out of 10 it would get a 7 if the atomizer hit a little bit better and if it didn't make me paranoid but uh I would recommend these dang babes carts pretty much only if you don't have any other choices or if your other choices are like exotic carts or Mario karts cuz these are at least a bit better than those but they're not like amazing so yeah that was the a subspace I'm gonna take another hit as the final review hit of this cart so cheers guys hope you're vaping along or smoking something let's get it so ya didn't cough so that's nice it's a nice smooth hit this is a fully charged C cell m3 so yeah Ace of Spades six out of ten would recommend only as an alternative for like worst cards now let's get to this pineapple Express find out will Express if you guys can remember is the fake cart which is funny to me because it's my first cart out of the two um the wax is definitely thicker and it hits better than the ace of spades cart but like I said the ace of spades cart is definitely gonna last a lot longer than this one um the high off of this cart makes me feel a bit energetic helpfully focus on my tasks and one of my favorite things is that it makes music sound a lot better and more clear which I'm always a fan of when I'm smoking because I love listening to music um well I was a high off this drain I went on a walk I cooked dinner and I cleaned my room so definitely a very very like good day stream especially if you have some stuff to get done I'm about to edit or finish editing this video on this high so I'm very excited for that which is funny to say because like editing is boring but uh now this card makes everything feel a bit more like interesting and definitely just helps me focus better um a negative of this cart would be that I sort of felt maybe a little bit aggressive at like when I was coming down from the high so I'm not really a fan of that but other than that it's pretty much all positives this car I would give like an 8 out of 10 it's better than a lot of other like brands that I've had like chrono Polly is not as good as damn boots but it's uh it's as good as most of the other dang babes I've had so it's funny to say but I kind of almost prefer this little fake packaging on the pineapple Express card just so y'all can see it hopefully it's in frame like this is packaging that you can buy generically but the wax ended up being better quality than the real dang vapes so I guess what I would do if I were you guys would really be to just test that wax quality by like flipping it because it seems to me like that is what is like the biggest indicator of if your wax is gonna be good quality versus like if it's an actual see saw cartridge looking at the packaging really all you got to look at is wax quality because all of these cards are fake although they're not fake but like all of them are illegitimate and they all have the pesticides in the loop so at this point you just gotta like choose which is the biggest bang for your buck and the biggest like risk you want to take and I really don't think this is bad quality wax like it tastes fine to me and it doesn't really hurt let's just take a hit so I can show you guys it takes so amazing I really can't express that enough but uh yeah so eight out of ten would HIGHLY highly recommend the pineapple express if you ever come across it um make sure to stay informed and try to stay safe guys cuz like this [ __ ] black market card business it's kind of wild I'm learning more about it everyday and I'm just gonna keep like showing you guys what I learned I hope you enjoyed the

senior review for 2020 this year so I thought it might be the first one to do it so there it is so I have two honeycomb car cards cartridges and um yeah I spoke these a couple hours ago and these really didn't I thought hey you should probably review of these so let's start off with them the packaging right here so this is what the package looks like and as you can see this is its THC level and I think each of these cartridges had the same THC level eighty-three percent THC and 32 percent CBD and I would definitely recommend you to check out their Instagram they post um everything there and yeah I have indica zoo keys just do this one I'm just different flavors um sorry I want to say it Maui Wowi sativa and like I said same THC please follow their Instagram the show they always update their news and cartridges and yeah so let me just open them out right now as you can see these are definitely real folks this is the logo is so you can see right here pretty cool I'll show you the other one too well yeah same thing clear it's all real this is a fake [ __ ] and these have given me I have no problems at all with these and these are just really good I definitely recommend you all to buy these and you know mine might as well take a hit right now so I my pen right here there we go it's a little burned right here I think I am think I smoked outside one time and I brought outside I was on my jeans and the oil just was so thick there just froze and so I had to heat it up and I guess I made this that or I just burned it too much huh but ya gonna smoke this right now and let's see how this goes yeah just a giant nose to get Cheers yeah these are really good yeah how'd you smoke this like a couple minutes ago I'm not gonna smoke this but ya get the idea these are really good and um actually before I go like I said check their Instagram because they said something about their they're a half a gram cartridge how it will not have a a honeycomb logo on the top and they say after they're done with their half a gram cartridge is and them right they'll do the deed over one gram too so yeah definitely keep in mind in that this is um well should I just drop but um it's just my review and um yeah in conclusion I think these are really good and um these are like next to my favorite like um brass knuckles and um slime breath and yeah these are really good and I think you all would really enjoy it I think you should all give it a try and yeah thanks for thanks for watching this video if this helps you all um the next time you buy a cartridge and you take you

cinnabration i hope you guys enjoyed these hilarious apple jacks commercials if you did leave a big thumbs up and also hit subscribe and that bell icon and you'll be notified when i post new hilarious top 10 videos but now it is time for commercial review we're gonna rate these apple jacks commercials in four categories originality and creativity humor and engageability broadness of a pill remember ability and then based on those four categories we're gonna find applejack cereal's overall effectiveness score so let's jump right in with creativity and originality i love the fact that they turned their two flavors into characters i think that's a really great idea and overall i think they do a good job with the commercials so i'm gonna give them a seven out of ten on this category now let's look at number two which is humor and engageability and there really are a few funny moments it's always fun when you see two competing characters kind of fighting each other and trying to mess with each other so i think there's a good dynamic there but there isn't really anything that makes you laugh out loud so i'm gonna give him another solid seven out of 10 in humor and engageability next let's look at broadness of a pill i love that they set most of these commercials in new york city because that's one of the most familiar cities in america ton of people live there also everyone loves racing everyone competes so i'm gonna give them a very good nine out of ten on broadcast of a pill i think both the young and the old could enjoy watching these commercials finally let's look at remember ability and on this category once again i felt like they did a good job but not like a crazy job there's nothing that i'm going to be thinking about long after the commercials have ended so i'm going to give them another 7 out of 10 on rememberability so then that brings us to our overall effectiveness score when we bring all these categories together applejack's commercials get an overall effectiveness score of 7.5 out of 10. a really solid score but i have to say their commercials are not as good as their actual cereal because applejack's cereal itself is like a nine out of ten cereal it's a really good cereal so definitely try applejack if you haven't and then once again guys hopefully you enjoyed this video leave a big thumbs up hit subscribe also you can check out my

they got it like a little thing going on right now when you just you order online and then you get a time where you come pick it up at so I'm here at my time right now to pick it up I got the cards this is Ronald like I said wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now", "hS5h4wzp6Jc": "how's it going you guys welcome back to beyond skylines

the comments down below what you guys want to see me do I mean if it's anything you know I will see you wish to come like I said this is gobstoppers I'm gonna stop talking and let's smoke Cheers so uh

flavourings gonna be ten on hi it's gonna be two ten and there's no smell so can't smell that but if the smell of the car was it'd be a ten out of ten would try again eh also let me know what video

footage we'll do a review up there in the mountains um really also it's really nice if you've been if you've never been there you guys should check it out good place to eat is Hall of flame burgers it's so bomb honestly this one time we went up there and I think we went up there like a year ago and so whenever it had been raining really bad we couldn't hike we took the bikes up - we couldn't mountain bike whatever so we went to this place and then we ordered and there was that flat place called the flame burgers we did our order and all that and the power went out so like we ate in a complete darkness but ten out of ten would try again because that place was so far even eating in complete darkness was awesome and I mean it was just a good time it's a cool little spot chill really chill town so don't be expecting anything crazy anyways moving on I hope you guys don't matter I don't mind the random rants you know it's just a boy make you some conversation coming back I want to start uh reviewing hemp hemp herb box oh let's take it real quick I'm using my evo D twist I think I showed you last video they're really nice I like them I just spoke a little bit under 3.8 yeah I probably I'm gonna focus in on that but I really like it I noticed a lot of people are starting to use those little ones but those little ones are freaking you pay $40 for a small ass you did that I think this is harder of course it's bigger well I mean I'm just not willing to pay the 40 bucks but everyone's different everyone's entitled to their opinion I hope you guys making your dreams come true today and putting in the work into everything you want to do in life you can achieve anything if you really believe that you can and if you put in the work and follow the process to do so to getting to what you need to do so um with that I'm out of here let's take a huge-ass trip because we're coming to the end of the segment like I said I feel like on camera I just need to get a little bit more comfortable so I'm sorry these feel like a little bit weird I promise I'll get into the group of things and I hope you guys enjoy the content that's to come because I want to see you guys enjoy it that's what makes me happy and scan it yeah shout out any by the way shout out Edwyn sparring shout out a custom girl 420 custom girl 420 I've been watching that dude since I was like freaking in middle school it was insane um even but I love that dude you're a huge inspiration bro peace let's take a rip thanks Kenny", "US6E6S1FhDM": "what's up YouTube this is I saw images back with another product review I did one of these earlier today they're probably gonna drop at the same time or within a half-hour 45 minutes of each other so I haven't dropped that one yet I'm gonna drop that one in a few minutes and then I'll drop this one short they have to so this is another mary's medicinals review this one is durbin poison i would show you the other one but i got rid of that one today no because it was bad it was really good I could have kept it from my own but I already have stuff for that so I figured I'd hook somebody up so this one is durbin poisonous a sativa I don't have any more of the information delete Li next to me at the moment my potency is THC seventy four point seven nine percent zero CBD production date is seven 1919 and it's kind of spatch number used by day psi lab tested on seven twenty nine nineteen test batch number in national poison control number it's a label if you want to know about the other one go back and watch the other video that I'm gonna draw up to shortly says contrary to a popular relief it's made at the same place that the platinum beeps carts are made up [Music] that one's from Saginaw so once again the bottom not like a little pull tab piece pull that decide the only difference between this one and the other one I had is the other one had a black tip this one has a white tip this both I know my room is dark at the moment I still gotta get that light not very dark the bubble is not moving super quick so it's not watered down liquid whatever the situation is so let me look this up to the bomb battery take a few rips and let you guys know how I feel about this one I'm not getting any real predominant flavors from that at all I think you can tell it's just an old card like that kind of flavor like some basic oil without a lot of Terps well then give this one a go the other one was good was actually really good so we're gonna see what this one's all about it's not bad that's pretty earthy though it's pretty damn earthy actually as I said I'm going to the sweet flavors so the next review I'll do I'll probably enjoy that one a little more just based on what I feel the flavor is gonna be the sugar cookies one was really good great flavor this one isn't bad at all just personal preference I prefer the the sweeter flavors versus the earthy tones I said that in a bunch of them but this is not bad I would definitely recommend this to people I'm gonna say they're two and home right now and the products I've tasted the potencies there and at least the sugar cookies I thought that [ __ ] immediately was really intense I drove to my friend's house I felt pretty pretty [ __ ] baked no I don't support the I don't promote smoking and driving you know you can still get a DUI even though it's illegal I'm sure there's still a gray area with all of that but DUI is driving under the influence so this is something obviously drove on I made it safely I didn't swerve all over the road I know not a drunk so yeah I would definitely recommend that to somebody - a lot of people actually as I said it comes down to flavor preference a lot of people like this kind of flavoring more than the sweet ones some people wanted to just taste that straight wheat excuse me not the nose again yeah Mary's medicinal and there's - an O on this channel so far I'd recommend them I'm gonna get my hands on some more the flavors and just keep trying then I'll look into some of the other companies and see about testing out their stuff but Mary's medicinals give it a thumbs up very tasty just something that was just a little too woodsy for me so I personally probably wouldn't buy this one again for personal use um the sugar cookies absolutely I'd buy that again and again nothing bad on that one flavor taste everything was there but it's as I said it's not a bad flavor it's kind of like Mars og wedding cake any of those other ones from platinum it's just got that that type of taste to it yeah pretty hot I can feel it I'm a little high before I did this video I'll be honest I can definitely feel like the kicking it up a notch being a sativa I definitely feel like through my frontal lobe right here I got the foreground of my forehead yeah I wouldn't sound like super uplifted at the moment pretty sure I was smoking on the indica yeah it was an indica a Skywalker OG I was hitting that on my club and a little bit ago that wants a straight indica so doing that before doing a sativa you know I kind of riding out both feelings at the moment but yeah as I stated there to when I won this journal I definitely recommend Mary's medicinals so far unless I can find some research stating otherwise well I'm gonna say they're all good but uh I'm gonna run I got some xbox overwatch to play relax kick it hang out with my boys but yeah if you guys don't mind smash that subscribe button hit the like button comment below she'd chat about anything just depends on what you want to talk about or if you even want to talk if not just like the videos just like the videos whatever you need to do to make yourself feel better at the end of the day and if that brings a smile to your face saying I [ __ ] this guy dislike hey glad I can even help for that split seconds so peace to [ __ ] out guys you never fantastic weekend and I'll see you guys in the next video", "N20D40QT8IU": "okay so we're doing a comparison between two cartridges is the Cardston and this is the cart buddy and basically these go on top and pretty much they're very similar the difference really just comes down to build quality and a couple little features so the bud buddy is a little bit cheaper it's just 3d printed but it does the job you know it holds the things in there I don't believe it had a rubber piece in the bottom it may have this one definitely has a rubber piece in the bottom wasn't sure if my buddy came with one but I couldn't find that and has the same rubber piece similar rubber piece on top so like when you're twirling around you can pick out a cartridge the card stem however does have it connect it on there okay like that doesn't just fall off little the cartridge bit about the same in either one the holes are about the same they both hold six cartridges this is much heavier something like this is a lot lighter but this has a better like build quality feel to it the spinning is a little smoother than this one this one kind of it's made to like go in the notches of like these flat sides and this is kind of spins around and has like its own notches inside so this one is definitely higher quality but it also costs about twice as much so this one's going for about what is $18 plus about $4 a little less than $4 shipping systems about 22 shipped and this one is like 39.99 3195 just under $40 ship so it's almost twice as much for this one and they both do the same thing but some people might like the higher-quality build and the this feature here so really both are good products it's just what do you want to get if you want to like have a nice fancy metal feel get the card stone I'm just wanting Jeep that does the job get the cart buddy so that's my comparison of the carts from car buddy basically they both do the exact same thing but the cart system has the extra feature being attached higher build quality and has a kind of a different notching way that it turns around and this is just kind of like your cheaper version but both work so the better one I would say this one is better but more expensive this one is does the same job not as smoothly but still great product and it's much cheaper so that's our comparison of the card stem versus the card buddy this is dab connection thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "Hy9-NrmlBvs": "you guys know your uncle Rick is just super in the flour that's kind of like my thing is what I do I'm not really into the vape I'm scared of it to be honest I think it's like a step away from a terminator or like a Robocop situation all right uncle Rick trying new things see Deb it takes hella think I mean it's a super day there's like I got vocal gold dankness uncle's across the board you were to say hey uncle what's your favorite kind of buddy Acapulco gold I smoked it once in Hawaii what's that back in the day this guy gave me a whole garbage bag full of Acapulco gold and all I had to do was help him burn a Chevy Corsica yeah total just tranquility peace prosperity so it concluded I just wanted to say uncle Rick approves yeah I got I smoked a lot of this thanks for coming out tonight drive over drive home it definitely tastes dank I don't know if I mentioned that earlier but dank tastes for sure certified dankness", "jDMFQ429UZM": "hey guys his dad connection and reviewing cookies gelato and I got this in the class reveal I believe area somewhere around there it is a legit cookies cart it was a good price it was 30 bucks for a half not bad at all and so far it's okay the taste is not so good it tastes kind of co2 ish you know kind of like co2 oils and not doesn't taste like this w VAP co2 oils those days exceptionally well if you've tried those but it tastes kind of more like like the regular kind of co2 oils a little bit it kind of tastes like a mix of the distill it and the co2 oil the second thing is it does use good hardware it uses real see self I like the ceramic tops this is the th 210 I believe they call it and yeah so good airflow I know it's gonna be efficient of course it uses a Jackson cartridge so many times but it's it's not that strong oil is is decent its decent it's pretty good it's not super good and you know California bands that are stronger would be AeroPro and select I would say they're both way better than this I would take both leaves over they this ones that I've tried for Nevada brands also AeroPro roots blows us away you know I expect more I thought because it's like a big company cookies is like everywhere would be really huge but roots that is like advertised nowhere and is a small brand in Nevada that does like no advertising and I'm sure probably has like a tenth or twentieth the budget of cookies makes a way better cartridge then cookies can of a t'v as well was way better than this but so AeroPro and select though are your the california ones that are both way better than this and you know I just give it like to some sideways cuz I was hoping it'd be really good and it's not really good it's just pretty good but here we go with take a hit you can see how it looks yeah it's alright so this cookies gelato I got a few of these cookies cards so maybe some of the other ones will be better but after the gelato yeah it's just all right pretty good pretty good not really good not great so this is dab protection thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "avlYCguphSQ": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or I don't show you my personal information all right yo what's up guys Ronnie right back at you um I have another court review for you guys in this video I'm actually doing a kind live resin again if you guys see my like last review I did a Arnold Palmer this is [ __ ] fire I haven't really smoked on the car too much besides for when I did the review because I'm trying I'm if you got yeah if you guys didn't know I'm going to ET see you in like two weeks like what is it May 17th so Loki trying to save this car gonna feel others for you wanna go easy because this car is like I said in that review it taste so far like it actually tastes like Arnold Palmer like it actually tastes like [ __ ] you're smoking lemonade and iced tea like I don't know it's [ __ ] fire but um this video we're gonna be reviewing true Oh G and this brand I mean not this brand um this flavour or strain or whatever you really want to call it I know it's kind of been I don't know if you want to say it's there one of the classics or originals or whatever but I know it's been around for like a really really long time like I seem like a YouTube video somewhere I forget the dudes Shanno or I would shout him out but um it was posted like literally four years ago and he was a reviewing kind live resin and it was true oh gee so yes that's just like a little proof that the true og flavor has been around for a while but I don't know this is my review so I'm gonna give you my thoughts opinions my honest review everything I had to say about it the Arnold Palmer one was a hybrid I think that was like I said sativa dominant hybrid if I'm correct and then the true oh geez I got heavy indica up here and the guy so just looking at the two parts they can look at the two you can already see you can see huge color difference that Arnold Palmer it's like a lot more like clear a lot more [ __ ] yeah a little gold you know what I mean the true OG is like that darker I don't want to say Brown but like like dark gold I don't know this I know it's throw some fire whatever this lit because I don't know I've known about this brand forever so I know it's a fire this lit the only thing that I don't like about them well I don't know I mean they're a little pricey they're like what 62 bucks for the four grand quarter there's like this brand right here I have some of review out on these like if you wanna go check them out too these are [ __ ] stupid fires but there's $70 for the full Graham Carter so these are a little bit cheaper than these but these are definitely more fire in my opinion there was a those are stupid fire but 70 bucks for a gram I can't really justify buying that you know what I mean the only reason I even bought these was because there was a buy one get one for a book I'd rather because I can get two grams of like actual concentrate like shatter for the price of one of the years you know and I'd rather have like actual wax but I don't know these are just good for like when you're going to raves like concerts or you know what I mean it's not like oh nice but yes you know you see the color difference but if you want to see review on the Arnold Palmer one go check that video out but like I said with the one true orgy in this video so let's just go over the packaging a little bit I can't waste too much time on it kind libraries and Ruo Jie yeah pretty basic the side of it says organic blah blah blah and then kind that's new ritual every video I have to [ __ ] drop something but it's you guys but if you guys have been watching my reviews dude I don't know why but I [ __ ] drop my cards and have you [ __ ] video for some reason but if you guys want to do some more research from the brand its kind concentrate song right there so check them out then it has like that Arizona warning on the side apartment of services coming back I don't mean just all that [ __ ] it has to say to cover their ass and that was it see another sticker right here oh it says uh natural sources supposedly they marketed as natural and organic so that's pretty far I don't know how true that is says solvent free natural and organic right there in the bottom two I don't know one of the one of the cons like that like if you wanted to make like a pros and cons list about these cards I mean I guess it's not really too big of a deal but as long as it's a thousand milligrams you know what I mean but I always loved it one like like I said on this large carts it says the THC percentage on the bottom I always love that these um Clank these cards the kind I don't at least from what I'm seeing I don't see any percentages it doesn't say what it's what it's tested at I mean as long as it's a thousand milligrams I guess it really doesn't matter you know what I mean so also what I not just noticed too briefly real quick I'm gonna get this out of the way and I'm we're gonna open this card of this Arnold Palmer one where's a harvested on for eleven nineteen so this is like some fresh or all right here this is brand new this one right here is harvested on eleven twenty eighteen so it's a little bit older a couple more months old I don't really think that has anything to do with the quality of it but I mean that's just pretty cool know when I got a fresh card you know I mean yeah besides for that let's just hop into the rest of this video so let's open this up oh gee off the top then it comes in these little plastic things not the nose in the box that's weird so when you take it out of the box that's you're greeted with you get this nice nice looking cart also another thing that I really like about these cards I mean I know a lot of cards have them so it's not only just this car like a lot like a lot of different brands do it well I mean I don't know I guess it's just all personal preference and also kind of depends on the battery you have but they're gonna say like the white accidents that use just because like when I put it on them this guy pin that I have just like blue one white I don't know it just looks so sick you know what I mean but um here's the quality the oil real quick so you guys could see the clarity of it in color let me find the bubble so there's the bubbler that you can see the consistency of it right there so it looks pretty thick it looks like it's barely even moving um if you guys haven't seen my past reviews I always say tell me down below in the comments what you guys think of the oil to lucas's even though this is my review and you guys are watching my review I'm like really really interested to know what you guys think of it too so make sure you tell me don't blow me comments what you guys think of it oh I think the other one was a little bit like the Arnold Palmer was a little bit thicker than this one is this one it's actually like moving up slowly the Arnold Palmer one was barely even moving but this is actually slighted input I don't know it's still really big oil that's a really good sign this is what it looks like on the pen it's a pretty big pin though I mean like so yeah this is a pretty big pin that's like the only downside of it like especially when you have a four grand card on it it's like good like I don't know six inches maybe you don't [ __ ] know how big that is but um here's the quality of the oil one more time for you guys stupid clear like you see just a little dark that's literally like the only thing I could say about it but besides I mean like the color that the color has to do a lot of things you know what I mean it could do with the strain a weed they like the strain they used to make though or or it could do it there's so many possibilities unlike what could affect the actual color the distillate you know what I mean so don't really like just use that to judge the so yeah if you guys like to know just don't use that that's like your main source of like judging a car just like the color of it you know what I mean because there's so many different like things that could like affect that like so many different variables I could affect the color you know what I mean so so we got the trilogy no I don't know that is a little upsetting that doesn't have the THC percentage on it to be honest so but anybody from kind is watching this I mean I should say a little detail that I'll really cut like a lot more if you guys add it on your packages but like I said it's not too big of a deal but let's just turn this on and get our first couple hits I'm gonna preheat the battery up a little bit get it ready for us to hit it let me just uh voltage so I have it on like a pretty low temperature like just a little like 2 2 point 7 volts so pretty low so you guys are smoked if I didn't mention it I should have added it into the beginning of this video but if I didn't don't watch this video that's for 18 21 or whatever little you were ages Smokey's in the area or you have your medical marijuana card like I do oh yeah I just have to say that [ __ ] to cover my ass but you should hop back into this if you guys are smoking along with me Cheers um and yeah just get into this true OG client library and choose I definitely add that og wish taste oh yeah all right of it even though I'm not I'm not too old I'm not like a og I'm saying not how old I had a nuttin but I've been smoking for a minute um I haven't had a G cush for a minute so I don't know you don't really see too much like real OG Kush now anymore like in the area that I live there's so much like exotic [ __ ] and like I don't know I just feel like that's a new wave it's like exotic strains and that means you know you don't really see too much of the classic like Oh green crack like [ __ ] ogee curve like you know all the og [ __ ] you know what I'm saying you'd only see that too often no more you just see a lot of the exotic stuff so it's pretty like I'm nostalgic to say the least like the hidden some og [ __ ] like that it actually tastes like some fire oh gee it's some real live resin too which is really really like another nice thing about the car and just like the static of it like especially on this pen I mean you can put it even on like the average loss is my evo labs pan this is like a also one of my favorite pens I love this pin so much even on this pin like this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] badass like just black and white you know and this pen actually has on three temperature settings it has a low medium and hot so we're good I have it on the low temperature right now so I guess let's just move this we're gonna heat it up yeah it's preheating for me right now [Music] tastes Oh fire yeah the taste gets a five out of five right off the bat the way it smokes you see I'm barely ripping it I'm blowing clouds it gets a five out of five for the way he smokes it [ __ ] rips my smoked a little bit before I made this video but I'm definitely [ __ ] like I wanna hit this what two or three times so far I mean I'm already higher than I was when I started this video so yeah I mean it's definitely some [ __ ] hope we're not [ __ ] you know what I mean um so these carts should definitely fire but the price of them is they're cheap within the select parts that's a good thing but there's still a little pricey if they were about like 55 bucks I think that'd be a better price point but 62 was a little bit expensive in my opinion for a ground you guys ever tried on time live resin time we don't blow in the comments what you guys think of it and um I don't know if you guys are liking these like um Medical Marijuana reviews or like we train our views or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call these and you have any other recommendations or constructive criticism or anything like that you guys want to tell me time we don't blow in the comments read every single comment I try to reply to every comment I can or at least majority of them or at least like favorite them or you know let me do something I'm always trying to show as much love back to you guys as you guys showed to me because it's like honestly like without you guys that wouldn't really be [ __ ] I mean I'm not really the biggest youtuber right now but still without you guys I wouldn't be nothing you know I mean but so if you guys ever hit me put my Instagram you guys see I always hit you guys back and show as much love as I can so I mean yeah I really do appreciate you guys showing all the love and support you guys do like it honestly doesn't go like for like unseen like I really do appreciate it I'm not making that up but if you guys like really like these videos um the card reviews aren't stuff like that time we don't blow in the comments I've just been like [ __ ] so insanely busy it's been crazy working 40 hours a week trying to do this YouTube stuff keep my Instagram pages active like if you didn't know I have a page where I resell some FTP clothes in the street like that and there's some other stuff so I have so much [ __ ] I'm trying to work on at once while I'm doing [ __ ] 40 hours a week at work and then I figure I said I didn't know I got a [ __ ] DUI for medical marijuana so I got a I'm on probation for that so I'm doing dealing with a bunch of [ __ ] but uh so I'm just [ __ ] insanely busy right now but these videos are just kind of easy for me to record and get out like kind of fast you know what I mean that's what I've been doing them but um we'll have more reaction videos out soon hopefully so if you guys want to see them and you have any requests for us then we don't blow in the comments but definitely this car is definitely fires [ __ ] if you ever um if you ever see a kind live resin in your area I recommend definitely picking them up definitely if they are and if they have a buy one get one free deal like they have when I got these definitely pick them up because it's a [ __ ] steal I don't see why you wouldn't um don't smoke none of those fake hearts going around that's for sure we're all square I'll give this like a four out of five I mean what I said I meant to say a 4.5 out of 5 so like half a point away from a perfect score just for the fact being that they're like a little pricey like I said if they were around like that fifty five dollar mark that'd be a lot more like I don't know I just think that'd be like a better price point for them I mean I don't know I mean the worth is 662 dollars you know what I'm saying but just me personally I don't like spending that much money on just one gram because like I said I can get two grams of should have it for that price but I think 55 bucks should make it a better deal and I think they'd probably sell a lot more cards than they do now if they lowered the price a little bit but yeah that's just my honest review so four point five out of five that's the overall score pace five out of five the way it smokes five out of five I pretty much everything gets a five out of five except for the price point the price point gets a four out of five so that's the only reason it gets like a four point five out of five and I like I said I still have a couple other cards I could review there's a lot of other like dope dispensaries around me there's actually like a kitchen where they make like edible hamburgers and [ __ ] like that pizza so I can make a video there if you guys want um just really anything you guys want me to do is help me down below in the comments but yeah these carts are stupid fired four point five out of five final reading I know I said that a bunch so I'm in the video here let me hit this one more time to see if I have anything I want to tell you guys before in the video and then we'll just ended off that so the flavor on that is so good though like that it tastes so [ __ ] good just if you ever see them in your area definitely pick them up and if you ever tried them down below in the comments for you guys sing at them but 4.5 out of 5 like I said and besides for that it's been Ronnie ray give the video a big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] it slides for that you already know peace out", "JYcC1RudsfU": "[Music] what is up guys but from hey buds have I got some exciting news for you from Rove for new disposable pens from Rove all the same flavors you're used to right now they've only got Skywalker og tangi and wahwee og while we the most popular flavors by far four row but check it out this is going to make your arsenal complete it's got 0.4 grams of oil same oil they use in their other pens but they've made it disposable 0.4 grams you say that sucks well as you know the oil from Rove is a lot thicker which means the battery needs to be a lot hotter for that oil to burn so instead of getting a half a gram or even a full gram in a disposable you get halfway through it the battery dies you're pissed off you're at a concert or you're somewhere where you're using your disposable and and it doesn't work so what they found is this is the best combination for the consumer so there you go hot off the press if your dispensary doesn't have it yet get on them find out when they're getting them and load up I'm sure they're going to come out with more flavors in the in the near future and I will let you know when that's happening but right now check it out disposables everybody loves the disposable so there you go hop on it let me know how you like them I've only had it for a day and and really loving it so hope you enjoy like subscribe share the video let people know that it's out there and we'll see you soon [Music]", "CcBlWmWPFyk": "hey guys what is going on today we're looking at another cart this time dabbe woods this is the Russian cream one there's there's a few other ones you can pause that right there if you want to read it there's flavors of all the backwoods flavors and then there's some extra ones like banana and I think there's like a strawberry one but these are a black market cart kind of similar to exotic or Mario cards maybe not maybe not as bad as Mario karts but where's the car I really like these wooden tip styles I think it brings out flavor the oil itself these these could be anything you could order these packaging this you could order this packaging and the cart I like a dollar a piece and buy them in bulk and film yourselves you know so you never really know what's what's inside these but this one in particular pretty decent oil I'm a fan and they have an Instagram I was looking at it earlier and so I think I think they are somewhat official I think there is a official dab woods just like how you can buy smart carts packaging in the same way in bulk but then there's also an official smart carts you know and I was on reddit and I saw that someone posted and said it was there they're sold in unregulated dispensaries which I don't I don't know which state he was firm but I don't know you just never know I'm probably not gonna be finishing this one just just to be safe but I would definitely not smoke multiple of these maybe if you want to give it a try I just I get how it's you know dab woods like it looks crazy you know it looks like like there's a lot of cloud around it so maybe try it try it once but I would not be smoking these if you want to you know remain healthy have your lungs last but definitely some pesticides definitely some unknown substances you never really know just be safe always research the carts that you get know what real ones look like know what fake ones look like that's pretty much it thank you if you like if you want to see more videos like this other car brands and stuff the channel", "iiMVNYAVfQo": "[Music] [Music] what's up everybody my name is Kenny tonight and this tonight [Laughter] what's going on everybody my name is Kenny tonight and this is the night dimension and today I want to talk to you guys about DMT pens and this may not be something that's been super popular in the culture or in the psychedelic society so you know so far to this point but I think that as time goes on people are talking about these things more to the point where I one of my friends actually asked me what I thought about DMT pens and the pros and cons of them so I wanted to just talk about that with you guys now right off the bat you would think DMT pen that's got to be a terrible idea because it's just gonna be abused by people and what a great way and what a great way to spread the love of these things by having people use them just like marijuana you know or a vape because that's what you would first think when you think Oh a DMT vape pen you know it's so what are the pros and cons and I think that right off the bat the con is right there abuse you could abuse the substance and we could pass a message of the substance that really isn't what we're trying to do with these things and you know honestly I think that's probably like the only con I mean that I can think of because that's what I was thinking about more and more as I really opened up to this topic because at first you that's what you think is a sort of negative perspective of it but as I'm thinking more and more you know what would be better having people be able to use a vape pen you know for people be able to use of a pen to smoked DMT rather than like a crack pipe or a bomb you know because this is an experience where you are going to be quickly taken you're yourself you know and your normal ability to have proper motor control and so it would be safer to have you to just be able to take a hit out of a pen put it down real quick and then you know go into the experience but then obviously it's so easy to just take another hit but then with DMT it only takes that third hit or up to that point where you just you know you can't stop it and you have to come down which is another thing that I wanted to talk about is that a lot of what's happening when you're heating up the glass or you're using whatever method to smoked DMT the temperature is super important so that's when I was thinking if we had a vape pen where we could correctly cook the DMT at a proper temperature at a proper rate you would be able to have the best experience because you'd be getting the most amount of dimethyltryptamine versus any other household version or anything like that so that was one of my final thoughts on the DMT vape pens would be is that it could be a definite thing that we could use in the future but it would be highly recommended that they be designed in some way to where you could only take a couple hits you know it's not going to be you know for those of you who can tell this is a marijuana vape pen so it has just you know it has the whole entire thing is the whole entire cartridge is filled with this liquid I could hit this thing all day you know but to be able to just maybe buy cartridges where you have a couple hits you know and then in order to be able to do another thing you have to put another one on or you know able to open it up and put a piece in there go at it you know put it down and that way it's more respectful and more ritualistic rather than just being able to use it whenever we want to so that's just my thoughts on the topic I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you guys want to help support the videos help me out in any way I have a one-time donation on PayPal if not you too speedy stuff like comment subscribe dev on the mother effin haters and I appreciate you guys I'll see you guys next time and enjoy the end screen for any you guys who are still here peace", "CcqVbopKY2c": "you know I do ladies and gents we are back with another review you already know it's been a couple days since my last review I just wanted to say real quick that that's because I've had a lot of stuff going on at school some really important tests and stuff I usually have really important tests all throughout the year but this this specific course in my school kicking my ass it's really difficult but we're good through it we just finished today so I'm treating myself I'm treating you guys we got a new video it's about to be smack right before we jump into this video let's go ahead and throw it out there this channel is a adult smoking cannabis channel only it's for 18 to 21 and up depending on your state and how legal medical or recreational marijuana is I'm here in Arizona I have my own medical card everything I do on this channel is legal yeah so now that that's out of the way I guess we can get right into this so I'm completely sober right now I smoked a little bit this morning awesome an old cart that I had actually was a venom acts I was supposed to do a video for that but I just like I said school was just training me I was stressed I just couldn't do it but I the two cars that I showed in the last the strange Saturday which we're still debating if we want to do Sunday or not but the let's train Saturday I said I had two carts those were venom X's I think they were tangi I don't remember pineapple tangi or something like that I got i don't remember the strain but i threw out the boxes but they were supposed to be two different ones now it's going to review them and have two two videos two completely separate videos but since they were the same it would have been useless and only one video and like I said I just was stressed as [ __ ] so I just skipped out of it and didn't do a video but we are we're here with another video and I got to cut two videos coming up here so this one and then another one the cards were reviewing on these two videos are gonna be pure earth no I don't remember exactly I could be wrong but the first pure earth cart I did actually was one of them I beated viewed videos I think in their first or second which is actually insane so if this video can be even like 1/4 or 1/2 of that that would be dopes mad appreciation so the cart we're gonna review today though is the pure earth DJ short right there I don't know if you can see that there you go um uncut VAP cartridge is a half gram I won't lie to you guys these are probably my favorite boxes I've seen out of any descent cart they're just so [ __ ] elegant I don't know it's just it's super dope um I don't know if y'all are into video games or anything like that but there's this game called destiny - there's this raid at the boss by Calvin our model remember that narrates called but this [ __ ] color scheme anyway flashbacks if you play that game but yeah this box is clean and and just like the other one they're the same box got a little pull tab there I'm pure earth it you know somehow some rep saying this or whatever [ __ ] yeah you guys killed this box gorgeous box so on the back here says in infused with authentic cannabis terpenes no PG propylene glycol propylene glycol PG I don't know what that is or MCT I don't know what that is a proprietary pure atropine and cannabinoid profiles so that's what that says right there on the back right there then there's their website and then all their other information blah blah says requires pure earth battery for use this product has been tested for potency wow that's cool so that says that on the back right there and then read above that it says right here this little like black dark black line so the extremely potent cartridge use small draws until comfortable with the effects so that's super dope I'm excited this isn't my first pure earth like I said I do not remember at all what that one was what the strain was how it hit anything like that so if you guys want to know before you see this video go ahead and check it out you know check out my channel you know life subscribe do all that [ __ ] if you haven't of course but well let's go ahead and open this [ __ ] up I think you just pull okay there's a sticker right here the best thing to use lightning cables for if you have an iPhone is for cutting a little like [ __ ] piece of corners like that [ __ ] yeah cool boom and then not a tape no that's done boom she just slides on out there and it oh no I thought it locked um so it didn't fall out but it doesn't uh box [ __ ] hollow box it's a very sturdy box so that she you know you could take this [ __ ] and eat it and not really have to worry too much about breaking the cart which is which is really nice that's uh that's a good feature to have on carts let's do a little hydration break here guys drinking another pees tea Georgia Peach you already know yall already know so here's the Box simple box right there on the front it even says it says the this is an indica dominant so I didn't even say that this isn't in a kendama net strain it's like 8020 ad indica xx sativa but you know basically indica just oh that's nice so this is a little really soft foam packaging so it's gonna be even harder to break your carts in here if you drop or throw them in your backpack or whatever you got to do that was loud I apologize for that um yeah so here's the cart so this is pure earth there on the front super dope and then here on the back yeah well cuz I'm a terrible youtuber and everything like that it says the strain which is oh I drew that [ __ ] it says the strain which is DG a short and then it says that it is an eighty indica 20 sativa so it shows you like the breakdown which is super cool it's going to pop this cap off alright there we go there's the bottom authentic see so [ __ ] you know you already know here we got the dr. zodiacs Moonrock battery here I really want to get another one of those cards just to have the battery to be honest but those cards did smack as well we just charged this one up you already know how I am when it comes to hits on the cards I think a fully charged battery is always gonna hit hella harder that just makes a [ __ ] ton of sense to if you'll think about it I mean you know but if you guys like to you know use your batteries all day that's fine I do - I did - I burned through them then I charged them for the [ __ ] video so cuz I want to show you guys the potency I had its finest so let's do one more quick hydration break here without out of what what did I just say and with that out of the way let's go ahead and take our first draw up this DJ short nice it was cheesy shortcake doesn't say it's on the bus it says DJ short but anyway guys Cheers hopefully you guys are smokin medicating along with me let me know if you are now in the comments I'm always interested to see what you guys are smoking on guys well tooth Wow Wow that tastes man i that tastes exactly like like a strawberry shortcake that's that's part guys that is that is delicious man awesome let me show you the wax here kind of got a little piece of paper here so you can kind of see a contrast there super dope so that was I just realized like that was me probably shelling off the goddamn lakhs for like 30 seconds and I'm gonna tell you why because I'm already feeling this [ __ ] hard I was facing now I just face that [ __ ] showing you guys what I actually hydrate afraid but oh I hope you guys can't hear that noise I was watching Bohemian Rhapsody outside a little bit of a Bond movie if you guys haven't seen that Mia shut the door boo boo that door shut look at that Pro youtubers - the yellow shouldn't have heard that but you got it anyway nice um back to the part I'm a big fan of this part already I'm a big fan of all my cars to be honest but this one's flavor wise right on there probably not eight out of ten nine out of ten easily potency just not one hit man that's a it's like a four I'm already gonna for pretty good so [ __ ] let me just kind of regain my breath here like nothing like hitting anything all day so I'm a little Oh what are you doing eating yeah but just gotta get a couple hydration breaks video and you'll be chillin just fine so god I feel like I have to Kaufman try get it out there we go ladies and gentlemen we are gonna do number two guys truth yeah if you guys if you guys are a big fan of like strawberries or like short like case like Strawberry Shortcake's anything relative to strawberry

I've ever had like that pardon me it's hurting me deep but for the first one I've ever had nobilis I should like a shortcake or strawberry anything definitely definitely solid it's highly recommend to

guys drop a like this comment subscribe hit that Bell so you guys get notified every time we upload and I guys everybody will see you guys in the next podcast educational purposes but yeah stop it", "iX7Zcy6J0-Y": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well welcome back everybody to a brand new video today we got another educational review yet again everybody we do not condone these products this is an 18 and of Education review from the cannabis patients out there but today everybody we got another King pen I decided to pick two up just because I know I noticed that I've reviewed King pen before this is a King Louie og by the way some indica I've noticed that I've I've only copper King pen like once now I just had to review a second one and now this is my third one that I'm reviewing on this channel I think this is the third one that I'm gonna be on the channel but this is some King Louie we got it right here shout out Disney's for sponsoring this video this is actually a glow-in-the-dark shirt but it fits perfect for the King Lily so shares everybody oh wow this one makes a lot more fatter clouds in the cartridge video I did before so you guys have watched the Kali the Kali oh oh I wasn't actually make able to make big clouds and I'm like okay maybe it's just the airflow of the cartridge but this one is the exact same size and last time I actually didn't have it on the lowest temp so let's go back to the lowest ten I like taking them low temps just so for the flavor the last one we did was Callie oh and again let me let me take another hit Lucy oh yeah something's wrong with the other cartridge that I did haven't talked about at all like damn is this what happened that color went out of the airflow this one I'm already late with this one with the King Louie just literally like to dress oh that flavors nice mmm has like a cereal taste to it like if you guys ever tried um what is it rice krispies or crispy rice crisps you know there's Cocoa Krispies and the other rice krispies the colorful ones pebble pebbles I think pebble crisp dude I honestly don't even know like a fruity yes I got like a sweet fruit type of type of flavor which is pretty nice and I'm not gonna lie damn King Penn what's up with that man I mean we got the callee oh that [ __ ] did not hit well you know what's funny to some of them actually don't hit well like I've noticed that this that wasn't the first time so if you guys watched my previous video on the kingpin Caleo review um I wasn't able to take like big ribs like this one like I wasn't able to make some time like you know nice clouds oh this one you can make some nice clouds and it tastes nice just the one thing is indica so this just about having me slept but damn that's funny cuz I remember I had a I had a friend that actually bought a half game card to we're hearing it and we're both like what the hell it doesn't really have like good like it has air flow but you can't really make clouds and you don't feel like you take a nice hit out of it so I'm just like maybe just something with the cartridges that maybe they're just a little they're just a little delicate you know kind of made this flavor does taste really good though the King Louie I had this before the King Louie og hell yeah [ __ ] like it kind of has like an OG taste to it I mean its own g-get also supposed to taste I go dude but you can kind of you could taste say you know like I said before I've talked about this before King Penn was one of those brands and I first started when I started buying cartridges and [ __ ] days ago so it's always nice to go back to the roots you know and that's what I was talking about in the last year too like I was just saying that come pretty much like it's always nice going back to the roots you know I wanted I actually the review of brass knuckle cartridge just because brass knuckles was one of the first cartridges that I've ever you know smoked before so that's for sure has to be here on the channel but I don't see those allow anymore like right now it's all it's literally select and raw garden selecting wrong our name but rock garden is my all-time favorite everybody and the select is pretty nice too that she gets me baked um but check this out you guys so it's kingpin it's the world's most awarded cannabis vape is this still up to date is this still the most important in 2019 let me know in the comments down below the alien labs is also my favorite when it comes to like some sauce diamonds ooh ooh shout-out look the lights are matching the shirts kind of matching huh let me know in the comments down below if you guys have ever tried kingpin and if you guys have any issues with kingpin cuz I've had one one issue with kingpin before don't get me wrong the taste is great you know the flavors are great to have a bunch of flavors you know I got I mean every time I hit this [ __ ] I get pretty late you guys said clearly see you have to like my second or third drag I got [ __ ] lit but again last time my previous purchase was a Cali oh and that one had too much air flow like it had good airflow but it wasn't really burning like this one is burning you know so I didn't get me like it got me lit but it gave me super lit you know it tasted it did taste good though but we're gonna find out I'm gonna have to remake another video and um see exactly if it doesn't because if you guys can see it right here look let's see right here I didn't show you guys a cartridge yeah there you got the cartridge this one for some reason this one doesn't focus that much like either tell it clear or who knows but you guys see towards the bottom of it it's like okay towards the top it's a little bit more yellow than the bottom because in the bottom it's like really tight down there you know so not a lot of like I'm not a lot of the liquid is going down there so you guys he usually right here in these areas right here it gets stuck I feel like some of the liquid gets stuck so when you finish the cartridge it's like literally like you feel like there's like a layer that just won't be smoked no matter how many times you hit it it just won't burn because last time when I got one of these this was a while ago this is maybe like a year ago when I got it I got myself a king actually no it was the first king no that was probably maybe like maybe like three months ago three four months ago we had a king pen cartridges are the same half gram in it we got it all the way to the bottom right and they were just like a thick nice little layer and I'm like okay cool it still has a lot started hitting it and I was like dude it takes burnt and I looked at it and I was like dude that layer is just stuck right there it's not going in and it's not going in the coils you know so I was like what the hell I was like I hope it's just maybe like a the thinnest little leftover layer like [ __ ] I don't mind but it looked pretty big it looked like almost like 1/3 so I'm like dude in any other cartridge that's gonna fall all the way to the bottom and it's gonna get soaked up into the coils and it's gonna give you a hit you know is that I know a lot of people you guys I'm pretty sure you guys know how this works right there's like little coils that heat up inside this so this kind of every time you take a hit it burns the it burns the liquid that's in there already and then it leave it kind of you can see like it dries off the cotton or dries off the coil and then this liquid goes in there it gets soaked up and it's like you know it's the circle of life until it's gone but if you guys hello if you guys are enjoying these cartridge videos make sure you guys go down in description go follow all my social media you guys are enjoying these videos drop a like comment down below I'll let you guys know what and then subscribe you guys right now click that bell so you guys get notified every time I upload but leave a comment down below let me know what is you guys's favorite all-time cartridge because I've got a lot of people asking me the comments that there is just so many like you guys drop comments right and you guys let me know the stuff that you guys are smoking in your area and I'm just like okay you know I gotta keep there's people dropping comments you know from the east coast from Europe and I'm just like brah what the [ __ ] I got I had a couple people from like Philly Canada oh I'm just naming all types of [ __ ] places but this is like connecting it's like a video to the world so that's stuff that's [ __ ] sick bro I didn't know it like our first one I started their selves like okay maybe I'm gonna get people from Cali watching my stuff then people started dropping from other places like what damn and again everybody these are just podcasts they're literally just like a podcast or just kind of the spheres in shape because we're kicking back you know we're keeping this pretty much raw you know you know what's funny I'm hella way I'm just looking here this is YouTube recommend you guys like the weirdest videos cuz lately I've been watching a bunch of fire ants versus bird-eating tarantula and I'm like what the [ __ ] like I've seen I follow this channel called ants Canada or something like that he shows like his ant colonies and I'm like oh [ __ ] that I guess how the hell did I get like how am i watching is and then a while back I was watching videos about like spiders and tarantulas and all that stuff and I'm like dude what the hell YouTube recommends me the most weirdest [ __ ] ever yeah what to get it is it flashes on fire every cartridge that I get I gotta I always make sure that it's like someone good cuz I know you guys seen a couple cartridges on these channels like for example old pals or the which one of the Humboldt forms I think yeah that was like the strawberry straw man has something like that um I looked at like more of like the the details of the cartridge you know the information the stuff that's in the cartridge you know I try to do my research on that but I looked at the details and you know unlike the stuff that's in there and I'm just like okay this is kind of clean this is pretty uh this is pretty safe to smoke and it's fire you know it's probably a good review you know is that's why you know this is like more like this is like an educational Channel so I gotta I want to make sure that I even I review even like the low key brands you know the brands that people don't really like I feel like eases like right here I don't know do you guys what kind of delivery services do you guys have so the final verdict I like the flavor and the design of it's pretty cool it got me pretty loaded and taste it tasted good but those I was pretty cool it's just that one thing the airflow this one had great this one had great airflow like I could make clouds the other one the callee oh that [ __ ] did not have good like it had good airflow and it felt the same but it just was not making clouds so I don't know what's wrong with that I was gonna get a full gram but they didn't have full grams so I was just like [ __ ] I'm gonna just get two so hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure hands up like a comment subscribe click that Bell you guys gonna find it so you guys can notified every time I upload and [Music]", "chxmXCybr1Y": "what is up we have the Rascoe

too much and huh I liked it anyway so today's strain is a Thin Mints Girl Scout cookies and the cartridge is a distiller 1/2 gram and it's made by Burano I believe that's a Maryland company that's one from and it's a hybrid so THC percentage is 80% and I don't know how I think CBDs got 3.11 and yeah so it's got a good taste yeah unbelievable I mean I after like through two seconds I'm coughing my ass off like this is for all the people that said that my cookies cart was fake right but i'ma show y'all this one right and y'all gonna see oh hold on hold on why I said look the same okay so this is the box right y'all and that's right yeah Girl Scout cookies yeah 60 bucks four or five or you know for a half a gram and here we go right here so look at that beautiful oh yeah I'm beautiful too so beautiful man so perfect so I'll just drive it right I'm a little pen so we're gonna do a pre I think this is dead it would die on our view huh so", "ByDdoErGrs4": "so you see me rollin up a backwoods you see me roll up a Swisher high hemp hemp wrap and various things but now the new thing that's going on is cartridges and vaping fine cannabis oil so I reached out to few you know vendors and brands and you know that's gratefully enough they reached back so with no further ado I'm gonna give you one of my first reviews and it is Trudeau's brand and they send me a couple of samples but I'm gonna go ahead and start off with this white fire OG so stay tuned first one right here and I'm gonna go ahead and open this up and see what they talk about yeah so this is what it is I don't know if you can see it so as you can see it's the white fire OG it says it's 91 percent THC I'm just going to open it up go tip look at the oil that's some good good honey oil looks powerful you don't have to give it a try true kind of swear that I am gonna have multiple devices the smoke out of everybody should so we're just going to get to work cartridge onto my battery pack make sure it's fully charged and get your work I always needed a few times first see as you could see the smoke is coming out so go ahead and give it a few taps first and pull to actually make sure that your device is working then you could get to work what I like to do is hit it a few times then take my hand off of the battery button and then push it back on and get it going and get a good good cloud going or I could feel the pressure of a good smoke in my lungs and then I get a good hit and then I let it out so go ahead and check me out oh yeah oh yeah very very good very good the gold honey has a good flavor I feel like up 90 91 % look at me Joe so white fire oh geez indica if you're not used to into this then um you might want to get you a hybrid or a sativa so I think the Troodos you know on a scale of one to ten is a nine point two until my personal opinion so go ahead and he CDs at the smoke shops or anywhere Trudeau's they know that they certified stay tuned", "RdTC5g4B5Zw": "what up guys the grass skirt lounge boy fred and i am back with a new vape cartridge and vape pen review so this is a slim pen and thanks to the homeboys at the I'm sorry thanks to my homeboys at the UH at the grass ninjas for hooking me up with this now this right here is the cartridge that I'm smoking this is a half gram car cartridge this is uh let me see cuz there's a glare so I can't really see if you guys can see this or not let me see if I can put it in the focus and I cannot so um this is alaskan thunder this is a clear solvent free this is made by amber industries now I've been smoking on this all day and I gotta tell you some now I forgot to ask whether this was actually a I'm sativa or an indica but it seems to be more of a sativa than an indica I seem to be it could it could be a hybrid but I feel like I'm getting a sativa high from this because I don't feel lazy army is I'm feeling more of a mental high right now and it's real subtle to I'm not like completely like [ __ ] fried but as you guys can see the the actual cartridge the actual cartridge itself looks like looked like the Dyna puffs or the or the bloom cartridge oh wow oh no not the bloom because the bloom is different as the plastic tip with the with the wick inside but this looks like a lot like a diner puff cartridges though same type of apparatus got your arm your we tink string here and this is the slim pin now I still do have my brass knuckle even though I think I'm gonna need to replace that because I think the battery is bent has been dying a little too quickly but um this I actually like this um so far as price this is a lot cheaper than the breast brass knuckle um at least it would have been cheaper for me I don't know what the other the market value of it is but I know how much it cost to me but anyway now charging it the actual up can the actual connection for the for that for the kilt for the cable for the charge people for the USB plug cable is right at the bottom of this so you don't need an additional adapter to screw into the top like you do with the brass knuckles also this has three different settings also three different voltage settings so as is typical with which as standard with any vape pen or 12 battery you pressed it five times and it turns on I don't know if you guys can see the indicator light but it's glowing green I had it set to green green is the is the second highest voltage and you just basically press it three times I'm sorry if I'm not getting this in a shot like I said there's a glare so it's hard for me to tell now click the three times the blue it oh I turned it off actually now what's on my apologies I hope you guys sort of greenlight the indicator light so it's green now I click it three times and now it's blue the blue is the highest voltage at 3.8 so here the voltage rating readings on red is 2.8 green is 3.3 volts and blue was 3.8 volts so blue is the highest voltage and 1 2 3 and now it's so I'm red so I'm gonna take a puff from each one I've been hitting it all day from from each different setting so I can kind of gauge how big of a toke I'm taking which I actually like this is pretty dope so as you can see just a 2 3 second arm drag doesn't really unproduced a whole lot of smoke but I don't know how you guys failed with uh with uh with vaping but if it's some topknot some really good vape if it's a good strain you know I'm a gay you show me like I'm a choke off that [ __ ] but um it and I guess that's the same with uh anything I fit some good grass or whatever but you know anyway so let's go to the next setting I'm rambling cuz I'm high how bad figure out as the music for some ambiance now in the green as I hit it another two three second drag I get more of a drag I get more vape from that so that's so that's that's a slightly heavier hit then the red setting now let's go to the blue and now it's blue here's a little trick to my obvious keep water might be went out when i blaze man it cuts back on the awning on the choking off the grass whether it's bud or cut bait cartridges that you're using um because we we will excuse me we will make your throat dry I know it dehydrates the [ __ ] out of me so I keep water cuts back on me coughing and gagging and [ __ ] which is usually caused because I'm thirsty it's [ __ ] more than anything so I'm gonna go ahead and take this last pull off the blue give you guys a I guess my critique on that [Music] now I know if you guys can see the smoke but the blue setting with a much heavier hit than the green or the red setting so the blue is the highest setting and it's performing as its performing as it specifies on the battery let's see this is a 290 mAh battery a 10 millimeter by 92.7 millimeter battery I'm gonna see bottom micro USB charge adjust the voltage by quick pressing the button three times rechargeable battery for the use of vape cartridges fits all 510 thread so these are so the cartridge like that's explained before now everything is being Universal and standardized now so the batteries in the up cartridges you know you could pretty much intermix them you know you can use different cartridges with different batteries so on and so forth so that's the good thing about vaping nowadays and I'm the technology is advancing so what was for what was once you know top quality you know state-of-the-art tech so far this is concerned now it's becoming more moderately priced but so far I like the slim pin you know it seemed to keep a charge pretty well even though I went down to gardenia to meet my homeboy yesterday and we are we chopped it up for a minute did I lower exchange and stuff and I did just make some ice cream - man I posted it on my Instagram channel so follow me on Instagram the grass skirt lounge on Instagram also on

so right here guys we got a cartridge nothing special right if you guys are watching this channel you guys should already be familiar with kind of like what cartridges it's a cannabis vape that uses oil and yeah it's pretty simple I wanna say when they cannabis base we first became a thing this is pretty much what everybody had or what everybody was going for it when they were trying to create their own product they were all creating cartridges so you were seeing like thousands of new cartridge brands hit the market and they're all kind of doing the same thing by throwing the oil in a tank which has an atomizer that allows you to burn the oil pretty simple and back in the day everybody's the thing these were bait partridges so this used to be low-key I would say nowadays this is far from it when people see a little cartridge or anything like this they automatically assume or think you're smoking some type of wheat or some type of cannabis so I would say that's the negative which used to be a pro for this but now that this is a negative I would say you're probably gonna see less people smoking this out in public or just you know more plainly like just taking random hits out in the open they're probably gonna start covering this up a little bit more originally cops didn't even really know what this was I feel like every cop every security guard if you go to a club if you go anywhere they automatically know where this is they're gonna either try to take it away from you you can't take this into Disneyland anymore so these are a lot of negativity to having cartridges I would say over pods nowadays just because everybody knows what it is but if you don't go  and the place that you're at really doesn't give a then is the same thing as smoking apart [Applause] alright y'all and this right here this is a plug play and what these are these are cannabis pods and pretty much it's the same thing the same exact oil that goes inside a cartridge you guys is the same world that goes inside of a pod it pretty much just takes a different shape so he now made it so that the cartridge doesn't look like an oil cartridge anymore or a standard small vape they made it look like more of a jewel so now I pods the only difference between the two our pods look like jewels and they're more low-key they have a custom device where they're not Universal and they don't all use the 510 connection where this this cartridge could go almost go on any date device that has the standard 510 threading and so it's very Universal where it pods this isn't gonna go and sit inside of a jewel it's not gonna fit inside of a steezy they all have their own unique device and that's okay oh yeah I would say they both have if they both have good oil they're both gonna have the same potency if they both have really good a good cartridge and they're both a good pot they're gonna have the same type of hit except nowadays when you take this places you can probably take this into the club you would take it almost into Disneyland museum parts because it looks more like a jewel it's more in the norm and it's more like people don't assume when you're hitting this that you're getting high off cannabis they think you're hitting that jewel and so it were trying to be more incognito and more low-profile more low-key I would say the way to go is pods nowadays for me personally since I have family members you know especially younger ones I'd really been thinking I'm hitting that jewel rather than me ingesting cannabis or hitting my cannabis vape all day long but if you guys enjoyed this video and you guys enjoyed hearing about the differences and kind of like my personal preferences between the two please drop a like drop a comment down below subscribe to your boy and I'll see you

video today today we are doing the dome pen or it's either dominant dome but in a lot of other videos I see people pronouncing it as dome it is a disposable vape cartridge oil pen let me just double check put this one is pineapple Coast it's a hybrid 1/2 gram they have effect spectrum from sativa to hybrid it looks like it's a leaning towards a sativa if you can see that yeah so this is sativa here hybrid indica and it looks like it's closer to sativa hybrid so I'm guessing pineapple coast is some mix of pineapple Express now wait 500 milligrams it's 1/2 gram cannabis oil vaporizer when you open it up it says directions pick up inhale enjoy if you can see that there when you open it up comes in a little case here which I want to take out comes in this little case and then you slide it up take out the pen and then that's it close it back up put it in the box now all of this packaging is because California has a lot of standards on how you have to package it so it has to be very childproof if it's not you have to do some type of double packaging whatever so as far as the pen this is what it looks like on the other side it says the dome pen and then it has a pineapple and an edge for a hybrid so that way you know it's pineapple see I think it'll focus maybe not probably not oh well but yeah anyway there is an oil line here so you can see how much oil is left in your pen at the bottom this will light up green and excuse me if we're always just looking bad in my videos but I always just do this just on the go just because I want to just make some videos trying out the different products testing them out especially to see to remember if I like them if the products are good if they create any smoke if you know the batteries work if the product works if the cartridge works and that's the main thing this one is bigger than most most disposables do come as a point two five or 0.3 milligram so the fact that this is a half gram is really cool but whether the battery will last through the whole half gram is the question I have been using this for the past few days so I am there's three oil lines and I'm down on the first oil line I don't know if he'll be able to see I'm down to the second and third but it will last I hope it'll last till the end of the pen but I do like it I don't know if it has a pineapple or like a citrusy taste to me but it does have like a really pure oil like you're dabbing oil which is what I really like about this taste here it's not like a fruity flavor which is something that I don't care for as much I don't mind it but I don't care for it I personally really like the strains that have like a very oily taste to them as far as smoke it's not you know a big cloud producer um but just create a really good you know small cloud for you if you know you need a cloud for it cuz some people you know they don't want to just hit something and there's no cloud or anything like some of the oils come out with or some of the cards come out as that I really do like it I like the disposable is just for the fact that they're easy to take care of you can throw it away once you're done with it which is kind of the negative because with the cartridge you're just throwing away the cartridge and you can recharge the battery but either way you know it is a nicer way to be on the go on the way to somewhere and smoking and not worry about smelling like pure weed or worrying about hiding you know a lighter your weed your raps whatever it is so yeah I personally do like the dome pen I like that it's a disposable depending on where you buy it out you know you'll find disposables anywhere from thirty to fifty a disposable sometimes if you're lucky I'll catch them for twenty twenty-five but I think this one's really good I think this one is really nice I like that it's 500 milligrams or a half gram battery does seem to last very long it's a really nice sleek design on the end it's just a tiny little air hole it's a boy or a suck big it's like the product out of I guess and then the other side is just white that's a light that'll turn green so you know it's gone so you know it's working and you know I pretty much like this one I would recommend this one if you're just looking for a little disposable I'll do a few more in the future but I just wanted to do this one while I got it if you guys have any questions or comments about it leave it in the question comment section otherwise have a good day bye guys", "t21UF6fsJ2E": "what's up guys Katie with the grass skirt lounge so I have a new bait pen cartridge and I'm doing this with my brand new phone by the way this is another high fly vape pen cartridge this is grape ate another indica last time I had two bubblegum cush which was [ __ ] amazing by the way it was a spectacular man the flavor the smell and the potency was was top-notch one thing though the like for instance what I've noticed so far between the brass knuckle cartridges the bloom cartridges and the high fly cartridges while the the wick versus the coil system I prefer the how can I say this not prefer the coil system the coil system is um seems to I say give you a better took you you can get a better toke off the coil system versus the wick system the bloom cartridges are still good I mean they're [ __ ] great the indicas are top notch you know it's just the it's just that difference between the the coil and the wick where it seems a lot looser it seems easier to pull the with the coil system it seems you get a better vape it seems with the coil system it seems the stronger vapors you know I'm more lucid me but uh whatever I mean I like them both you know but I would have to say I prefer this apparatus over the coil system I mean the UM the wick system so anyway back to the great thing now the great babe is fire the only drawback I see so far to to the high fly joints is they go kind of quickly you know the the concentrate seems to be the concentrate seems to be I don't know what like kind of running almost not as thick as the bloom or the the brass knuckle cartridges are but other than that I be you get a nice toe this Grape Ape it's very potent you know it uh it definitely gets the gag reflex jumping off but so far like I said I haven't found any drawbacks to the arm that the debate cartridges produced by high fly they hit just as well as the brass knuckle cartridges so stay tuned for on the channel for for me and my experimentation with other brands and other cartridges as well because there are plenty of them out there I've only barely scratched the surface but so far the three that I've tried I like but I like to I prefer the coil system over the wick system and that's about it the grape eight high fly is good so far without from what I've seen the high fly cartridges have the same strains as the brass knuckles I'm the great babe the UH the dough see dose the only ones I believe brass knuckle didn't have that I didn't see was the bubblegum coach cush which again I highly recommend that gelato gelato is it's [ __ ] amazing and what's the other one King do we can't do it it's [ __ ] good to go seek dose that's one bubblegum could gelato dough see dose all of the ones that I've had are good but those three are like the potin right into Grape Ape is right up there with them so you get a chance to uh get a vape in check it out at your local dispensary or a vape shop smoke shop wherever you get them from and I'll be seeing you guys leave in peace", "sYgs1ZVPvaM": "going down YouTube boy Lonestar coming at you with a quick review while I'm here at work while I'm on the clock while I break down this new cartridge down to you you me a second baby bad my bad I have to take a little quick break but yeah I'm here on the jail be bringing you a quick review on there's a neck thar be disposable cartridge straight from Colorado man no middleman no no no no friend hooked up none of that straight from the dispensary as you can see it's a hybrid blend watermelon half a gram see the THC 81% a refined they actually got a beautiful color to yourself right here man check this out or well and I did it straight real deal this is no off market off a black market a middleman hooked up none of that this straight from Colorado man this is real deal Holyfield all in that beautiful color man thinking that that thickness look how beautiful that is my look you seem as beautiful color man it actually comes with it actually comes with the that like I said the disposable pain comes like a little bundle my own about it so I have about this watermelon and bluegrass but I figured I'd give this watermelon to try see what it does see they got the is comforting USB ports which give me a second man while I try to take it out for you real quick hold up okay check this out because a lot of disposable pain pretty dope I had actually boss about the the clear disposable pin the grapevine will touch on the other video the previous video which is actually was filmed before Arkin I'm filming this that clear pin man that was our right foot the battery died on me pretty quick but guessing this when I can recharge man if I run low I guess second I should be charged and be able to finish the whole cartridge because that last one I had I wasn't able to finish the whole cartridge the battery died on me and there was no way to to to recharge that battery on that pen but this is a good nice looking oil it's real deal I'm excited to try it man Colorado was beautiful man I can't I can't it was just I've never been in Colorado never been to Cali you know just to go into these stores man and being able to purchase these items and trees man like it was those damn Best Buy or something know what I mean so that was pretty awesome man I was a new experience for me that was pretty dope but uh yeah man from the smoke on this right now while I get my mind right soccer function make Darby disposal can half a gram what about", "25ZPhrmHCNs": "holy [ __ ] that one that one was hot I'm excited to have my hands on this so I can finally give it a try this is the 710 labs life resin pod I've had a lot of 7-10 labs concentrate to my day but this is totally new to me I haven't even opened the box yet yeah comes with a little instruction manual and the pot got a live little peek C logo they put it on all the cartridges I always just pull it off I'm not gonna lie it looks like there's pretty good stuff in there it looks super thick I usually [ __ ] with 7/10 labs so I expect this to be a pretty good experience here's what it looks like with the battery that you have to buy separately because I don't know any other battery company that makes up pod for this this is [ __ ] weird I don't know any company that has a pod like this and I don't know any battery company that makes a battery like this so this is super unique I don't really think that's a good thing but let me try the pin out before I voice my opinion [Music] that's pretty smooth really doesn't have a crazy taste I hid it until it wouldn't let me hit it anymore it's on a full charge I don't think this battery changes heat settings but it does have like a light indicator here and when it's green it's above 50% then when it's 20 percent to 49 it'll go to blue and then it's at red when it's below 20 percent battery so that's kind of cool you can know where your battery life is actually at all right that hid a little better in swears usually the first date of a car or a pen usually the best one and then it just gets progressively worse but that second head was way nice done the first one I want to point out the definite difference in color between the box and the actual pen like this is a actually angry oily color and then on the box it looks like it's like bright yellow I've had the Z or Z before I thought it was called C Oz but the guidance offender told me it's called zoz so I've been going with it when I dad did it tasted a lot better than it does out of this pen but this is their cure for which is like their lower level actually believe it's the lowest here I think they just do it 1 2 3 or 4 so that might be one of the taste isn't that great it's not bad but like I've had some cards recently where I'm like damn this is so [ __ ] flavorful and there's light pressing cartridges this is a la Crescent cartridge and I'm really not getting a crazy flavor up [Music] definitely starting to feel the effects a little bit and then nice little head higher I do want to say it is very smooth this is a waste another hit that I really ever expected out of a cartridge this is definitely some new technology I really don't think I like it though like this battery shape I do really like actually it's pretty sleek but the charger and the USBC and like who has that I mean I actually like you so I guess I can't fish but I have one USBC charger in my house and I have like 50 normal USB chargers I don't think a lot of people have USB C charges just laying around like a couple people do but not like the vast majority which is I think what you should still hate or - I know 7/10 laughs is more of a higher-up company but it's just like they were like how could we make this as difficult as possible let's find a pallet battery that nobody has ever used before so people have to buy the battery now let's give them an annoying charger like I don't know I feel like they were just like trying to be annoying when they were making this battery but for all I know in two years this battery is going to be the standard and I'm probably gonna be eating my words and they were totally ahead of the game [Music] this really doesn't give you a long blinkers man the design on this pen is definitely cool it's pretty trippy I like how it kind of wraps around the side of the pen so each side you get a little bit of something like doesn't have that weird no sniffle either I just realized you know how sometimes when you smoke a cartridge you're like really tickles your nose this is not that at all the total THC is 80 point four one percent and the total CBD is 0.1 nine and eighty percent THC is pretty high for a pen actually a lot of especially on the black market a lot of pens though a 97 percent THC and a cartridge and it's like bro if your pen is 97 percent THC like it would not burn them those wicks that is not possible honestly anything above 80 is not gonna burn very easily in a normal cartridge so I've always been wearing when I've seen like 85 90 percent even in the PA market I've seen it before I've seen th see that's like 95 percent THC just to live like tested in a jar and it's like a [ __ ] Rock I just don't see how I could possibly get that in the cartridge damn that is actually Sunday pretty hard now yeah dude 710 labs get your [ __ ] baked sorry for the lack of content on my page recently you guys got some big things on the way I don't want to share them until it's officially out but I'm super excited to share with you what I have going on with popcorn in the near future and obviously when I was in Denver the last week of it we got my dog spayed so I was actually like kind of busy being attentive to her and then since I've been back I've been getting my house ready because my girlfriend's actually moving in with me her lease is up in September but she's just kind of over being in Colorado so she's gonna fly here with Piper next week so I've been getting my house prepared because I've lived here by myself the entire time which there's enough space for both of us but I've definitely spread out all my [ __ ] so I've been consolidating stuff and you know just getting everything prepared so when she moves back here she can just move right in I was thinking about doing another Q&A video too so if there's any questions you have you can leave a comment in the YouTube video I'm gonna try to pull as many off yours I can oh my god man I'm setting to get pretty [ __ ] big I'm not gonna lie oh my god feels good to be back you ever get like so big sometimes that you feel like you're like a different person so and you're like wow I like literally feel like I'm like an alter-ego all of a sudden like I am not the same person I was 20 seconds ago nothing really anything serious it's just like you were like in a bad mood and now all of a sudden you're just carefree like well it is like Jeff too has arrived it is a whole new version of me I remember the first time I took a gigantic dab it was like four weeks into that like I was thinking blobs but like I don't like a half gram that like it was ridiculous and I remember like I was so high but like I was almost tripping if you guys have seen the movie the masks where Jim Carrey has like this alter-ego were he like puts on a green mask and he's like a totally different like crazier person I felt like that was me oh whoa okay I am the man in the mask right now holy [ __ ] like I am lit but usually I'll just get super awkward what am i honestly I'm super awkward when I'm sober it's like a social anxiety I have I just I don't know I don't know what to say sometimes I don't know what to do like what I do with my hands work put like what the [ __ ] I'm just weird brah but please if you ever seen me in public and want to say I feel free to even though I'm a little after it I really don't mind I think it's going to meet you guys it kind of helps but I face the the people I'm making videos for and all I are super [ __ ] chill I don't know what it is but everyone haven't met it's been like nothing but kind of friendly Beckham I say what's up oh but I'm curious how long this is going to take the bat out still looks like there's a decent amount of oil in there two giant air bubbles on this side really doesn't have the best taste though like the highs nice it's okay when you actually think with just a glee about buying your own separate pen having to have this whole separate pot system it's just too much the flavor was alright at first but it's really really lawful flavor it's like resin it's not dis Calypso it should be a little bit better flavor you think but I am getting so high yeah I really honestly think I'd rather just buy gram of 7/10 left like Ross and the BIOS pen and battery I feel like at least at the cost of what it is now I feel like this is going to be more of a gimmicky thing or more for like the heady boys that just want to have it but really isn't for like that everyday smoked beer like this isn't really something you need to have oh I guess where these blinkers aren't too rough on you I'm trying something to spend in one sitting but I don't know if it's gonna happen guys this really shouldn't taste as bad as it does for the amount of oil that's still left in there there's gonna be a long day boys holy [ __ ] that one down what was i that [ __ ] hurt oh my god that was intense but double records how you do it boys oh my god [Music] oh yeah it tastes like [ __ ] that - we'll just burn through it right oh my god I'm getting so I I have to be getting pretty close to the end there's some giant air bubbles in there please and soon and drops in this video if you take one second just like like for me I would really appreciate it it goes a long way you'd be surprised what a like would do so if you're watching any of my videos and you like it please click like I'd really appreciate it this one's for everybody that clicks like triple oh my god hope you got oh that hurts a bad one I do that goddamn whoo it's weird how a pen high is so much different than like a weed high it's looking at joint we're so gonna pen like if I took this many hits of a joint I would be a totally different high it's not like I'm not high though it's just that like a joint just hits different and like weed dabs just hit different than pens I don't know what it is I feel like if I took it dab with the amount of stuff I just smoked chances are I'd be higher off the dad I don't know though maybe that's just me god be suck no no I to die one have so many levels of emotions on me so I'm like this is awesome it's like it's okay it's like all right that's pretty cool it's like this sucks like this isn't such an emotional roller coaster I really don't know how to feel about these when I had the live resident of the cr-z it was way tastier than this like I was actually like my blood how pasty it was I was like wait this is Rossum like that's how good I thought it was and then now I'm like hitting this pen only yeah this is trash I don't think I've ever had any string of seven ten laps that was Tier four so maybe once they hit Tier four it is really just like the bottom of the barrel but there's so many better things you can buy at the dispensary instead of this and RJ even from 7-10 labs like the amount of money it cost for a battery and the pot itself it's like just by a grandma live rosin it'll go a lot longer and be a lot more enjoyable like this this sucks no cold is this telling me I don't see it anywhere dude the amount of information Colorado gives you is nuts like versus Pennsylvania like this is the one thing that blows my mind this is the kind of information you get out of one of your most popular Colorado companies you know you get the THC CBD batch number yada yada in Pennsylvania they have the date of his package do they have like a code for the person who packaged it they have the THC the CBD the CBN the CBC all that [ __ ] there's so much more testing in Pennsylvania you really have a better idea what you're actually smoking when you get [ __ ] from PA it cost so much goddamn money though [Music] this thing's hitting hard however it tastes like [ __ ] dirt getting up triple I'm so so almost empty you can see my hand oh my god I decide to ever oh my god you guys I'm so [ __ ] high it's not getting any better but hits are a little less intense though so that's giving me hope that this pods almost done if there's one thing I can say it's that the pod is in full effect right now I still stand by my statement that taking it dab of this amount would give me higher though I actually asked my battery's about to die and I feel like I got close enough that's what I'm gonna call the video I'm not gonna smoke any more of this so click like if you enjoyed I really did not enjoy this pot but if

if a lot of you don't know some carts not all not all good sup you're like they'll get like you can take off the top screw that off damn just like open parts what you can do is if say you're waxed it's you to like down here like barely above you take babe cheese stick it in that hair right there if you stick it in this little hole between the glass and this little tube you could actually fill out with juice and if you like say you take it right you take this car fillable juicing kind of just slowly go around and around move around sometimes you want take a lighter heat it up the glass get that extra t-h-e concentrate off you just kind of roll it through and then that kind of mixing any liquid THC combination all right so if you want to talk about if it's healthy well it is like it's definitely possible to do you just saw me like like if you can see how fast it goes so you know there's like vape juice in it like that's fast really bad you've seen my videos before buy my car reviews and they were like them Alice Lowe Alice low but [ __ ] but I mean it is healthy for you like technically like it's not bad for you I don't saying like it has nicotine stuff in it but you can put it on nicotine Nash's VG and PG you're pretty and that's not really gonna do anything for you just kind of get to flavor it will flavor up your cart a bit give me some nice nice flavor but I would I would recommend it honestly I did this a lot especially when I was a younger younger like breath it was like what my freshman year of high school or some [ __ ] long ago I put like these little three [ __ ] babe uses and like my cartridge is it [ __ ] I get so smacked how long but now it's just like something keep it up you can still get high off it if you fill it up with dreams you could definitely still get [ __ ] up because there's already wax in the glass and [ __ ] all over now you're just kind of scraping the player up bottom of the barrel with do not try water I've had friends of mine I tell them it works with juice they put water in it don't don't do that just [ __ ] up your [ __ ] like I know the normal person wouldn't thing but there are some people who think it's fine like I think it'll be okay no it's not don't do that stupid like it's just kind of the same juice how to put this pod but do it quick yeah but it's definitely it definitely works I do like it I mean it's not too bad I mean hello by new cart well you're scare some money then definitely investing because these are like two milliliters or a gram is like probably like two milliliters probably tank wise so I mean thug you get a normal bottle for 20 bucks since got like 30 grams 30 milliliters Phillip carts like 15 times don't keep refilling them that will burn it eventually but like I mean you could resell it and use it what do you want there's kids my own size for the dogs yeah we're bad feet okay alright be shoes I'm sorry problem with the dogs scare you outside world people walking their children around but yeah back on topic these they're good it works yeah so I mean it's probably not the best a lot of people might not advise it because there is like for me a lot people make a team don't open a teen in their veins which is you can do zero nickel but I'm gonna Nick teen I got 50 making this right now yeah I like it it's good but definitely I'd say it works for me my work for you if it doesn't work for you then don't do it if you try doesn't work you don't like it don't have to use that juice longer use youths on anything sell the bottle online you only use to Miller's practically brand new say it's brand new sell it it's good but yeah but all I got let's take one last double hit and then we all go home I'm already home what you know I'm going to order done make sure you guys can see you wrote on that's what we call good IV stirs I got my breath back okay I'll see you a veces next video and leave a like and subscribe if this helped you peace out",

peace", "y4z7Sz3k_Oc": "welcome to weeding aloud as you can see today we were going over another Cara leaf vape pen cartridge thingy whatever you want to [ __ ] call it but it does say pen right there I'm just saying people in the comments it does say pen on the package - don't bust my balls over me saying pen that's not an old fogey thing I'm not an old fogey you [ __ ] okay but 34 years old I just got a lot of gray hair [ __ ] you get your back broken looking to spend the next 10 years in a [ __ ] wheelchair after a year and I'll call mark and see how you look now moving on oh yeah the packaging it's all pretty just like Newports pop package this is a good one this is a whole Hawaii gu this is 375 overall milligrams with 75 milligrams CBD and 300 milligrams of THC now I can never get this [ __ ] and focus or for those I can't tell it was like gain focus right there right there hold still you get the idea I'm not lying to you it is a THC vape pen she got to keep rubbing it in beat the dead horse why don't you I will haha I certainly will I like these cartridges though I really do I'll [ __ ] aside they got their label embossed on the metal then they got these like huge rubber caps hold all the oil and I really honestly believe that they do these caps so big because if you notice it covers up the four airports and by sealing those four airports if anybody knows anything about vaping if you actually make tanks you really know that you know you got to shut that bad boy off while you're not using it if you don't want your oil to leak out so there it is the hole was kind of a dark gray almost got like a purple tinge to it as you see that purple tinge to it my seeing [ __ ] is the camera picking that out I've never seen like a purplish oil but this really has like like almost like a light brownish purplish weird tinge to it I don't know is uh it's a ye dude got purple and the purple string I don't know I have to look that up I'm behind here people I'm the blind leading the blind sorry I am unlike my for Fitz this product that if they think I got three more to good keep it rolling keep rolling with the punches check it out Brandon fool ain't been touched boo-yeah and they really fill these bad boys up to the one video I had been smoking on that one all day after I left let's eat this bad boy out for a second mmm this one's putting out pretty damn substantial amount of cloud I feel it I feel like I need to turn that thing up even you know like it's got a lot of oil in there this is when it's got a little extra oil in there talk about a cloud maker that's the best one yet damn little bit oil coming through this is this thing's [ __ ] strong [ __ ] yeah I know why I'm liking it it's got a mild like front face and then when it comes on slightly fruity slightly sweet like with like a hint or undertone of like maybe just a touch of pine you know I mean a little bit of piney but not much just enough to like say like a pine cone fell past you you know I mean like while you were driving for something were you like hit a pine cone while driving home and then when you got out of the car you could smell it like that you know Oh people that's the back y'all because you know I have one of these right now get one of these immediately immediately you don't have to bother battery you just you you and really need to go to trial in these cartridges or these pens this is one of their strongest strains and quick tip here with this one you got 75 grams of CBD free usually for distressed uh like I think it was like $32 for 300 milligrams of THC but they they got this batch with 75 milligrams of CBD in them as well so they just went ahead and sold these for the same price as the other pens without even up charging it they could it could have charged it up to like the other ones that were this kind of ratio like the 1/4 the one before ratio where I want to say they were like 42 or 46 they were a little bit more so they could have charged more for this and they actually just gave you this the 75 milligrams of CBD for free so again this company is impressing me on every turn that's hard to do [Music] I can make me red-faced and coffee also hard to do and Gough this heart since I did a damn slap-dab that's the best lady tasted and blow doctor knows lawyer piloting it I'm something of a bud Somalia I still feel like like new Monet or the Mon Turk in there to feel like maybe that's what I'm getting on the nose is that citrusy kind of floral citrus floral excess oil on the coil from packing that's basically the whole reason they put that rubber thing on there to seal these to keep that from happening but apparently it didn't work on this one as most leap enthusiasts know though that all that extra oil in there and the coil just makes more of a I'm telling it and it's just working on me what else was fourth fifth review took me three more to go two or three more go Oh still haven't revealed what's in the grab bag you gotta watch the next video to see what's in this bad boy it's got a childproof zipper on it so you know it's got to be good anytime they put a childproof something on it you know it's it's some good [ __ ] alright seriously this strong strong oil if you're looking for some good quality Swiss the do doctors like Rotorua hi milligram count like myself these 3 and 400 milligram 375 and 400 milligram big pens cartridges are the way to go buddy let me tell you I've been smoking on one of these for about half a day I was lit for I even started doing these reviews now I'm just burying myself that's good I sleep good tonight two thumbs up Hawaiian do or Hawaii glue with whichever it's abbreviated guys come on you know I can't [ __ ] know-it-all hwg you your guess is as good as mine if it said GDP it'd be a lot easier or girl GS c or AF g afghan gu but HW g it's Hawaiian do or Hawaiian girls were you heard it here first this stuff is strong I'm putting this one away I'm saving that one for like when I'm in real real dire pain need need something super strong like not CBD told you they have you go get the this particular one you're gonna get the same 75 milligrams of CBD free something that can actually swallow for old oil some distillate oh you want to see that catch it on the next video peace spay and neuter your cats people don't let them just run around [ __ ] it right so what Bob Barker always used to say anyway and yeah this is weeding allowed signing off as always like if you like don't if you don't I don't give a [ __ ] cuz that's not why we're here peace", "_q2YChBKNZg": "so the video did get cut off like what I thought so I put my other car back on because I didn't want to hit this one yet so I'm gonna go ahead and pop it off and put on the TK old cart let's go oops and go I had to take off the little rubber piece I'm just gonna put it on my other cart just so it doesn't get like dirty and all that they're gonna I got that all put the new one on focus there we go it's not really focusing whatever I turned her off back then I'll turn back on there we go let's see first fat they're killing me I wasn't even sure if it was hitting it's hitting but it's hitting sitting very weird to be honest I don't know I don't know I don't know why to and wait though there's like zero smoke coming out of this I don't know if I got a busted cart what but this is not very good right now I mean some smokes coming out by there's nothing made this videos gonna be short because it's not I can't really hit this like I know the person like close that got me this I'm just gonna have him give me another one because I mean I don't know it's not really hitting that much and you said that like a couple of them weren't um working correctly so decided for one's busted just let him know and he'll give me um like another one so that's straight ahead that'll be in this picture right here nice boat on the TKO there we go that's a thumbnail picture right there so I mean I don't want to say we're done with this one this video I don't want to be finished with just that the form in the video 3-minute video I'm just gonna put on back on my cookies cart smooth that for a little bit just talk almost drop down so I'm just gonna put it back in the case now I know every box like it's like different there's so many different types of details um I guess I'll just depends I don't know so put the cookies cart back on and this oil on here is so I'm trying to get it's so thick because I've had this for like I don't know three weeks and I hit it every day and it does not die let so many people hit it like it's really super thick and lot of smoke comes out so it's pretty good I was pretty good most probably one of the best ghosts I've done to be honest freakin Lippert I like a little cutter something I'm newnode it from but I guess okay I don't even talk about nothing really yeah so uh let me know what you guys are smoking on let me know what type of battery guys use I always say it I just like to know because I'm more looking that cooler batteries come on that - beep um you keep I think that's the name here's the box I don't know what happened on my desk guys babe you keep pretty nice think two stories and then here's the back and then I have just well yeah it's a pretty nice battery small it's not like I've seen the key batteries I think double the size not the best that's mean in the video thing guys for watching subscribe leave a like comment do whatever if you guys haven't already I don't start giving some activity on this channel I've been gaining subs and I'm having fun so yeah and you guys watching she didn't sign me out peace", "peOBfaZ0RZA": "that only seemed to irritate your understanding is not required only your obedience beyond your way sir this time when the night to have leave the world beyond the door seem more sorry about that beyond chapter the winds of winter god I love me some george RR martin another thing I like is liked about that we put some light on this okay and he's heard blood that be light and there was and it was good so how you guys doing how you been what you doing huh long time no see ah that's quite been there since yesterday well as you can see we've had a change of venue that's a sore subject so I'm not really gonna get into that right now well what I am gonna get into is a review of these new pens that I've been trying to know that are freaking amazing hold on a second I'll show you what I'm talking about now I have chance to grab a hold of some [Music] Mario Kart pens these are all-natural lab tested no PG nope EEG no VG I guess it's like vegetable oil on other things that give you like popcorn long stuff like that no contaminants or pesticides detected in compliance with prop 215 section below do not drive or operate heavy equipment keep out of the reach of children unlawful to redistribute alright so as you see we have three different flavors well they're not really flavors these actually what I love about these bins is they're strange specific these are not flavors added to it it just uses a really cool picture to advertise the actual strength so for the fire oh gee you can see here there is Bowser yeah Bowser right I believe it's Bowser yeah Bowser sorry it's been a while so I played Mario and this I mean they'd say Mario karts but obviously this is Donkey Kong if you can see that is that brain you see it here my mother did is it I don't know I'm kind of curious about I know it's like gorilla glue like the actually like this like this yeah I didn't still in the garage in case you were wondering it's just a really fancy garage yeah so on the gorilla glue kind of curious on what that substance is there that he's squishing is a really gorilla glue or is it go real like a loop you know um as I am and finally we have Weaver huh weird he went on the wheat we already did this one sorry and finally we have Wario and he is the brand in case you cannot read that cookies the breed should I say cookies so we have fire og as Bowser to get [ __ ] up on that one gorilla glue as Donkey Kong a gorilla fitting and wah do his cookies which happenstance gorilla glue and cookies are hybrids and fire oh gee is it indica yeah so let's get the show on the road we are starting with the fire og takes your wondering what kind of battery I'm using is an eye stick power I've had it for like two years and this thing is freakin amazing I mean I'm in a wheelchair I dropped this thing almost on a daily basis I've ran it over with my wheelchair like twice and this [ __ ] is still [ __ ] kicking oh and you can run it way down and use these small refillable the refill pins and you'll lock you lock it right cuz I've learned to hear these up on accident then I got like figure out I'm going to use a syringe like draw the little I'll put it another one that's still working so if you do get one of these make sure you lock it on like three to five dip it in our pop pop you like your quill but that's what's three point three watts is what I got and that's to get a good flavor and what I'll do is I'll turn it up to like a 3c I got a lot I got unlucky then over it up to like 3 8 or 3 9 relock it cuz you don't wanna burn the coil up especially when you got money invested in the oil that's in there and need the medicine hmm yeah you get a lot more oh yeah that's a good stuff I'll always have loved fire oh gee though and this really does taste like the breed um this is probably good you see how much I've been swimming around it's probably gonna be one of my favorites oh yeah bookshelf I like to keep like memorabilia and stuff some knives for grandpas to supply that look at this freakin bowie knife right here I just inherited sadly lost the grandfather recently and almost had a little breakdown but we're doing good now my grandma gave me this I have a matching one from my grandfather k-bar I had a handle I don't know to match this one so it's like a matching samurai said you know like but it's an American bowie knife and k-bar right doesn't get much better than that right you want a bar lover quick story then each point is that each one of these were the possessions of each of my grandfather's that one was my grandfather the cowboy and moonshiner and general alcohol you know to the day died you mean when he was not long I took home the CB handle outlaw you know imitating him and learning from him this is an actual Vietnam issue K bar that was used by marine in the field and I took it to a knife maker recently say knife maker that did that and uh this one I need to polish it up though it's a it's been sitting out in the shelf since got brass is corroded you know and then he had possibly it again this was blackened or gluten steel you know gun blued steel so it was black so he had to polish this thing for hours to get it any kind of shine out of it at all just good my grandpa had you know God blue did so many so many times over the years to keep it from rusting um sadly I've lost both my grandparents but I have these two minutes to remember them by into your mortal lies my thoughts on them sitting on my bookshelf playa visualize them and see them remember them every day that's the way they should be if you leave this world and people don't remember you then you didn't make an impact so I feel like by not remembering my campus or memorializing them on our bookshelves we we are forgetting them and leaving them in the past yeah I'm getting a little motion let's go back to the testing ah gorilla glue this was for you grandpa the general outlaw and the moonshiner yeah I tell you a funny story yeah I was like 10 to 12 years old you know almost old enough to know better we were in the hug Club and we would go down to the woods even that come on with me grandson we're gonna go water some tomato plants I always was wondering like what the hell are these tomato plants doing way the hell out in the woods away from the damn farm you know like away from the farm the farm house and not even really on our property just property where our cows were allowed to graze just think it was a state land actually he's dead now so you know who cares I'm confessing to a crime that I committed when I was a teenager and had no idea that it was even a crime until I was thirty right okay so long story short or water in these these these tomato plants and after about six months you know I asked my grandpa why don't these tomato plants ever produce any tomatoes and what the [ __ ] are those things on top of them and then he he told me the gig but he didn't tell me the gig but I don't really remember what he told me I'm just no subverted he probably wouldn't think he probably took me his store bought me ice cream like subverted my brain waited from that right good job grandpa because it took me a long time to figure it out I love you but uh you know he he was a man beyond his years and in thoughts and ideas and the way people you know that's why it became a bootlegger because he thought that it was wrong that they took this thing away from us that we had so all of our lives it was like air or water you know you can't take alcohol away from somebody when it's so readily available we can't take a plant from the way so money but it's so readily available all over the planet you can grow it anywhere you could make alcohol anywhere you can you know it's not like they they couldn't stop alcohol during Prohibition and they're not going to stop marijuana in the modern time if if they think they can they're stupid and if you think that they can you're stupid because the clear evidence of all the thirteen seventeen states or whatever that of Divac be either decriminalized are completely legalized in three states that have made it recreational it is what we cannot have a country divided on the subject this is one thing that I think all Americans can stand together very easily and you know what it's really hard to think about war and all that when you're then a peace circle pass it around enjoy we pass around a peace pipe that's all I'm gonna say that's what I'm gonna end this on so do yourself a favor go sit down in a circle with your friends pass around a joint or a peace pipe and spread the love right because that's what we need to do to to get these laws enacted reacted changed whatever we want you know like to get the legalization of the recreational usage and the you know people who should have the right to use it with for religious purposes I'll completely empathize with the Rastafarians in every state in our country who cannot consume the like holy vessel of their church legally that is insane to me it's just a plan it's just the plan you know we need more more knowledge and forethought in this world our what is possible what we should imprison our people for and I wish a [ __ ] would tell me with my paralyzed self double amputees that I'm breaking the law this is my medication just as much as all of this all of this the doctors want you to take that crap shove it down your throat every goddamn day but then wouldn't you pop for a piss test they want to jump all over you and make you go to [ __ ] drug court or something you know it's insane what without world is coming to what a person in a wheelchair I'm just gonna right now what an individual paralyzed double an TT should not have to jump through hoops and and be treated like like a drug seeker or or a junkie would they go to doctors for help and that's the truth that's my experience", "ghlm7kzvzWU": "what up woody yo i'm kyle and in today's video i'm going over a strain of weed called sk skittles it's with the z skittles um it's by potter's cannabis co it is a cartridge um so it's half a gram and i got this for the full gram was 45 so half a gram was like 25 30 bucks so it's lit so um but it says it's going to taste like berries sweet grape and the effects are calm euphoric delighted so that's good as [ __ ] um it's tested at 86 thc and has a total cannabinoids of 89.44 that's great dude that's [ __ ] great um let's

just probably a little bit old but i don't know we'll see but other than that it looks it looks really good i like it weird a little bit dude it's all good though let's try this all right yo now let's attach it to our battery i'm using the imini it's lit yeah you definitely get like that grape taste oh yeah i [ __ ] with it it's like a grape you get what they said you get that grape you get that

love", "HrDbe_WPuHc": "how's going YouTube this is outs coming at you for TV TV in the studio with a very special video for you today I'm super excited about this one we have the best oil pens and 510 threaded batteries of 2020 a lot of your experience will come down to your battery cartridge and oil all working together in harmony but the battery is the thing you have the most control over so choosing one or even multiple batteries that match your needs is the most important thing obviously the better the battery the better your experience will be with your cartridge and oil also because these batteries are relatively inexpensive and you might find yourself with multiple carts it's perfectly OK to own up more than one of them I personally have three that I cycle through if at any point you like this video throw us a thumbs up would you if you're gonna go scrubbing your way through it at least leave us a like before you bounce and if you'd like to pick up any of the batteries I talked about today links will be in the description below without further ado let's get into it sitting in our number one spot this year is the tronie inline of 510 batteries trone ian landed in the market with a splash releasing a handful of batteries all at once the line consists of three batteries the neutron hITRON and tau tron and an oil cartridge called the tron pod they also have a disposable battery which I'll touch on later what I like about Rhoni and batteries is that they've nailed the space between budget-friendly and performance with a device for every consumer their units are versatile and calibrated to work more effectively with a wide range of 510 cartridges and oils the patron is one of the cheapest and smallest offerings of the Tyrolean line along with a distinct pen shape it also has draw activation which works with any draw activated cart so make sure you check the instructions on your cartridge before choosing a battery the Piton battery is built sturdily and can handle any size 510 threaded car it has 350 ml amp hours of power which is impressive for a unit of this size and price point and I absolutely love that there is a USB charger on the bottom of the device it couldn't possibly be any easier to use just screw your cartridge on and inhale the neutron is another incredibly budget-friendly battery and just like the patron comes in at under $15 offering a very similar pen shape the neutron has a one button three voltage settings and a preheat function the on-board voltages are two point six three point three and 4.0 volts giving you a large range to work with that preheat function I touched on before does a great job of warming thicker oils and concentrates it is universally compatible and should be able to power most carts you throw at it five tabs will turn it on two will change between temperatures and three will activate that preheat function it is no larger than a literal pen and can be completely hidden by most hands for some stealth vaping at the top of their lineup is the Tao Tron the Tao John features a magnetic adapter for your carts that you can easily screw on to the base of your 510 threaded cartridge that will allow the cartridge to slip completely inside the housing protecting your car from damage the couch on has been designed to automatically detect the resistance of your cartridge and is calibrated to accept almost any viscosity of oil when fully charged it has a max voltage of 4.2 volts when you draw from the tower on there's a light that illuminates at the bottom of the device to show that power is being supplied to your cartridge the design is just super clean and I love the fact that they have cutouts to show your oil levels which is certainly a feature I prefer for my batteries there's nothing worse than taking a dry head it is draw activated and features a 380 million power battery that charges via USB and even for the top of their line the tower on is extremely budget-friendly I like everything about this device from the size to the power I love how small the tower on is it's shorter than other pens it's smaller than other mods it just works and that's why it's my number one choice I know a lot of your experience is gonna be down to buying prefilled cartridges but for those who like to fill their own cartridge Choa nyan has also released the Tron pod the Tron pods are perfectly calibrated from the tronie in line to offer maximum efficiency they also offer better wicking than most cartridges on the market meaning less time waiting and filling and less dry hits I've also been told some oil producers will be working with Tony and to get these Tron pods filled so keep an eye out for that lastly TRO nyan does offer their disposable vape pen the alphatron the alphatron is the solution for anyone looking for a disposable pen that also has a childproof lock it is designed for one-time use and is geared towards those who prefer to fill up their own cartridges the battery comes pre charged with enough juice to finish the attached Tron pod considering you get an empty cartridge and a battery for the price it's not bad at all the literal only issue I have with it is the spelling alpha with an F come on people as a Greek boy I cannot stand by and watch this travesty happen alpha is spelt with a pH okay droning sitting in our number-two spot this year we have the vessel battery if you are a classy as [ __ ] oh no sir with a need for the top of the top rugged devices look no further than the vessel it is a seriously gorgeous device that comes in a plethora of colors to suit your tastes there are three voltage settings on the vessel 2.8 3.2 and 3.6 bolts there is a notable difference between the voltage settings as well and the vessel can handle any cartridge with aplomb I've been using mine for a while now and I've never put a cartridge in that it could handle if you have a wider diameter cart you will have to forego the shield but it's super easy to take off the vessel is a 240 million power battery that you can get about a hundred rips on before it needs to be recharged it is slightly larger than your average oil pen but it's nothing to write home about as it still fits in any pocket or bag and the included cartridge protector can stave off most dents and scratches and keep your cartridge safe I really like the performance and look of this device it makes me feel super classy as I'm taking ribs in an alleyway on my way to the grocery store the price point is a bit high but if you want a top-of-the-line high performance device the vessel is the battery for you in the number three spot we have the tried and tested and true pocket one plus a great device with a lot of versatility the pocket oneplus has a wide cartridge area and can accept almost any cart you throw at it don't throw your carts at it and then blame me and please just don't do it don't it also works with top and bottom airflow cartridges which is pretty cool the pocket oneplus is another solid device that protects your carts from breaking it also has that magnetic adapter just like the tower on the and it has three temperature settings which is just the icing on the cake it runs up three point seven four point three and five point one volts if anyone cares I use the preheat function quite a bit yes it does have a pretty heat function another thing to love about the pocket oneplus the pocket oneplus has a 660 million hour battery that should last you a number of days even if you're a heavy user ok this is not a challenge don't come back to me and say I hit it 483 times in 30 minutes and the battery died that battery tops up in about 45 minutes which is also pretty great the oneplus is a great size and the button placement is spectacular I'm laughing because I might be the only person that cares about button placement but seriously it's great 5 clicks will turn it on to will change temperature 3 will activate that preheat function it's just simple to use just like the vessel the price point is a touch high but if you're willing to shell out a couple extra bucks you will certainly not be disappointed coming in at number four the C cell battery lineup has two great devices for use with your favorite oil the palm is a great budget-friendly device that is built really well it protects your cartridge and features a 500 million power battery simply screw the magnetic adapter onto your cartridge and slot it into the base the palm fits easily inside your hand great chest and is a great buddy for a night out the silo is the palms slightly bigger brother it keeps most of the same features we loved about the palm like that 500 milliamp hour battery and the fact that it protects your cart the silo fits into any pocket and you won't be worried about any damage to your cart because of that card protection I touched on earlier it also has the little newer slot so you can monitor the level of your oil in the cartridge there is no voltage control to speak up on either C cell device but for the price point I don't see that as a big drawback at all I personally find the silo to have a slightly better form factor and I just like the way it fits in my hand either way C cell batteries are built really well and a solid pick for any user the only thing I would note the narrower cartridge opening means they are not universally compatible but again a minor issue sitting in our number 5 spot the Lynx herm\u00e8s 3 is a solid pen this ultra slim slick device does a good job of pumping out clouds but where it really shines is flavor the ceramic atomizer does a good job of pulling the terpenes out of your oil it has three voltage settings to customize the flavor and the density of your clouds the atomizer doesn't leak and wicks really well this is a solid choice for anyone who sources their own oil and wants a refillable device complete with a tank as the atomizer is really good quality and can handle being refilled multiple times the kit itself comes with the pen the USB charger and the handy carrying case which is really typical of links and just gives you everything you need also typical is their consistency with build quality as the hermes 3 is a well-built device that features a 290 million power battery it's super easy to use five taps will turn it on three will change voltage settings and as long as your buddy Jon knows how to press a button and inhale at the same time you should be okay to pass this around at parties without having to explain to anything I'll leave the choice on whether or not to do so up to you and that's it for this one guys thank you so much for watching this video I hope I helped you even a little bit to choose the battery that will work best with your

your boy mr. THC man I'm back at it with the banger now look you guys this is gonna be part of my cheapest versus most expensive series where I go to different dispensaries and I try out different products right so last time I tried out flower I got the cheapest eighth and the most expensive eight in Washington State today I'm in Las Vegas so I visited planet 13 which by the way if you're in Vegas and you have to choose between reef and planet 13 I highly recommend you go to Planet 13 I felt like it was a way better dispensary they had a lot more options it was a lot more open and you were able to really move around and look at everything they had I went down there and this time I decided that we're gonna be reviewing their cheapest versus the most expensive cartridge now before I show you the product I just want to give him an understanding of how much everything came up to okay so for the half gram the most expensive half gram it was priced at $100 before tax right now I bought let me see how many items you got we got one two three four or five how about five items here that I bought and it was $55 in taxes so let's just give it you know let's just say that every item had $10 tax to it right just the same so that means that that $100 half gram is now 110 dollars because of the tax not to mention that this half gram didn't come with the battery so I had to buy a 15 dollar battery now the fifteen dollar battery doesn't really have a ten dollar tax to it but just because I'm dividing up the total tax that I was charged for everything that I purchased I just thought that I would throw it in there and had another $10 to the battery to substitute for the tax so now we're at a twenty five dollar battery and that a hundred and ten dollar and a half gram so that puts us at a hundred and thirty five dollars in total tax included battery included cartridge included with a half gram which is really pricey if you ask me and for the cheapest cartridge it was fifty five dollars which was a disposable cart which means that he already came with the ability for you to use it you didn't have to buy the battery on this I was fifty five dollars but now adding the $10.00 tax that I might need to all the items it was about it $65 cartridge right there now this is pretty expensive this is a Las Vegas prices I know Cali would have been wait jeepers like never in my life have I paid over $100 or even a $100 bro for a half gram of distillate like what the hell because I'm pretty sure this is just a little right I don't think it doesn't say anything about like live resin oh it is live resin my bad so not for distillate its life resin but still man this is an expensive cartridge right here you guys so this is what the expensive one looks like right here it comes in this fancy box which I'll give it to them I mean at least they you know they message some of that money that they're charging for this product into the way that the box looks now I'm gonna break down for you guys the whole entire like THC percentage etc etc you know what I'm saying so so the THC percentage test at eighty two point 61% CBD is zero there's no that there's no CBD and there there's cbn 11.1 total terpene so the terpenes is actually like the flavor profile to your product right it's gonna determine how the product tastes and all these flavors and aromas also play a role into how the high hits you so the terpenes are actually really really important this has an eight point zero five percent terpene base which is really hot especially for a live resin so this is supposed to be really gas that's actually what you're paying for when you're buying this product you're paying to get more trips to get more flavor and more quality out of your high and since it's life present it's gonna give you a way better higher than the distillate I personally hate hitting distillate man like when I first started I just I didn't know any better so that's just what I would do but after trying like the life resident I was just like all bro you can't go back to just regular distillate now look I'm gonna open it up and show you guys what it looks like when you open it a little box in here you see that boom Wow what look at that you guys it's like sick now they have their logo right in the front it's crazy because the guy at the shop was like just smell it smell it oh my god it smells so good it just smells like strong strong concentrate now if we look at the back of the box once it opens up that's how it opens this is what the inside of the package looks like so they're talking about the philosophy provide only world-class cannabis products for customers our state-of-the-art production process utilizes THC distillate and cannabis derived terpenes coupled with premium hardware is simply unmatched this technology consistently delivers an unparalleled vaping experience where elegance meets perfection hmm okay so again 110 dollars right here after tax 15 dollars but since we divided the text evenly do all the five items that I purchased we're gonna add another ten dollars to it and just say that it was a 25 dollar battery after tax 135 dollars right here now I was told that this battery was already gonna be charged and ready to go I believe this is Planet Thirteen's like the branded batteries that they have there we're just gonna go ahead put this on here and take off this top rubber piece now before I go ahead and try this project I'm actually gonna open up the other product that we got and talk about the cheapest wax battery that we got so this is roots I got the cush mango and this one I have a believe all the testing for it I got all the testing right here so mango Kush oh you know what I'm so sorry on the last one oh I did tell you guys the TC percentage tripping I'm high you guys I'm already late alright so for the mango push this one tested really high in THC percentage so THC tested at ninety one point ninety seven percent again this is the cheap one this is the $55 sixty five dollar after tax cartridge right here okay um let me see CBG which I really don't know exactly what that cannabinoid is and test that twenty four point forty nine milligrams look at the terpene percentage though the terpene percentage is at one point zero three so basically this one has eight times the terpene profile than this one so this should make for a way more better quality experience and high but this was more convenient you know this one is just you open up the package right pure and simple you got everything right here in the back okay now when you open up the package this side right here is empty I don't know why but everything is on this side so you can just like use your finger to you know slide bad boy out there oh now it comes like this right you just pop this open and you're ready to go wow that feels good at the finger okay is this what is this what is this okay so roots this is I know these are disposable but why is this like this I don't think that you guys is logo this is basically their local you guys look look at this I don't think you guys just logo should be able to come off that easy I mean I'm pretty sure it wasn't meant to happen like that I'm gonna just put it back for sure it's meant to look like this but first impression mm-hmm you know but yeah guys here you have it to my left side we have planet 13s cheapest babe cartridge that's disposable so you'd have to worry about buying a battery and to my right side their most expensive premium $100 bro 110 after-tax 135 after we add everything up with the battery 65 over here on the Left what do you guys think would you spend over $100 on a oh you guys say [ __ ] that I'm spending $65 after tax out the door and now I don't got to worry about the battery I'm just don't listing away what I'm doing I don't know hey guys we're gonna have to taste them and really see how we feel about them we're gonna go ahead and start off with the roots all right let's go ahead and give this thing a shot now we're gonna try to complain I really want a good to flower look we're gonna do a blinker out of them and if we're gonna do like you know shorter pause and we'll do longer pulls we're kind of play with it a little bit to try to actually get the flavor flavor you know put it down for a second I was like what does it think don't blink Wow dude the room just got foggy my eyes bro my soul left my body okay that was strong that 91 percent THC dude it's different however though it reminded me of like when you hit a dirty Punk no offense I'm not trying to talk [ __ ] you know what I'm saying because wasn't that bad okay hitting a dirty bomb it's a lot worse but I still reminded me of just like when you take one of those rips that just leaves your throat oh you know tasting all nasty and [ __ ] I think that I got really hot too like the disposable battery it took a really long pull so I kept I was feeling like the mouthpiece getting hotter and hotter so maybe it was a little too hot for the product so now we're gonna try small pools medium pools and longer pools to get the flavor out of those but I need to get some water bro god damn alright so there's been a solid ten minutes right off the bad guys the flavors wasn't there dude like I'm sorry you guys can improve on the flavor you know what I didn't write this thing just to lit oh this is hash oil posh this side of that let me see and this is the mango cush I believe is what this train is called the other strain cold it's called medicine Chloe I believe is with this one here is called a hundred percent pure cannabis oil no additives no fillers no synthetic terpenes okay so maybe that's why it has that flavor because it doesn't have faked our booth actually it's obviously pretty good cuz fake Terps or [ __ ] you know you don't want a bunch of fake Terps like dis lis it's just a bunch of fake chirps but it says it's hash oil I don't know is that like I really don't know all right but this is its hat it's premium hash oil so the other one is like resin let's take a short poll and see I'm saying a couple straw polls and just see how like it tastes and stuff yeah I mean now that I hit it more the flavor isn't really what's off-putting I think it's more like it's just a very dry throat it tries to throw up quick we take like a medium part of it man but you know what gets you so bad bro I started to explain something to my go downstairs and now saying all kinds of things well always like do so look the highest am i high is no joke this is not this isn't for rookies right here bro still knock that ass out you know you guys $65 brothers a good bang for your buck for real now I want to take like a longer pool just to see at what point I feel like it's you know it's too much or it just makes your throat too dry or whatever yes definitely with like the bigger pools that it leaves like that burn and your throw afterwards you know maybe it's just like the temperature because I'm just something that longer you're hitting it the harder it's getting because it's just on and more consistent you know but median to small hits on this thing is to go to to enjoy and if you're just trying to get like super medicated I guess like you know a long a long rip will do it for you oh I am eight to 10 out of 10 I'm out of 10 for real and I was the cheapest one now we got you guys the medicine Chloe and the medicine is spelled like M EDI Zi it's full of fun easy all right I guess we gotta turn it off with the blinker just like we do the other one so cheers you guys Wow there's some of the cleanest I've ever tried I'm hurt I'm hurt I swear by the end of this video I'm being so sleepy hi guys so the flavor was phenomenal it's like when I coughed it didn't burn my throat so I kind of like thought it was like what what my throat didn't burn it tastes crazy I don't even know how to explain the taste it tastes like when you hit a really really clean joint with some good flour you know and you just hit it and you just tasting the flour me like damn this flowers clean and the flavors on point that was crazy yo what the hell damn I'm up to highs on for myself don't be like here babe you have this one it's kidding all right let's take a small rip a medium rip and then a long rip I'm really excited for the small ring because it tastes so good Wow you know it's crazy and I don't know why this is what it tastes like to me but it tastes like a lemon raspado which is like just Google that little hemming dress bad I'll put a picture you you know what I mean that's what it tastes like it is delicious who this TT is crazy I don't know I mean this is more for like the premium smokers you know I guess this is more for like the people that are like I need quality every single Hey which I understand yo cuz even though the THC percentage is lower you're still gonna get just as bait you just gotta hit it maybe a little bit more but every hit can it be more enjoyable so it comes out to like some people might rather be like buggy I don't really care if the taste isn't as a1 as long as it gets me more late which I'm not saying this one won't get you more loot to this because you just got a pie smoked out of this a little longer but the quality of it I mean you're ingesting into your body so I guess at the end of the day you gotta make decisions sometimes young but I think it would be worth paying a little extra to go for like quality but that's just my preference medium pool do like the flavors still consistent and it's crazy how these trips like play a role with your mouth huh pause right they like they don't dry your mouth up you know I feel like this is over the battery it would get hot really quick and dry my mouth up now I'm not sure if it's also because it's a disposable that the quality might be a little different on the battery I'm not sure you know but dowsers my experience I'm gonna take a long pull out of this I'm so baked I feel like all right it's gonna pull down this fire this fire so I would definitely say they're both really good products because at the end of the day even though this one doesn't have like the best flavor in the world it gets you so big I was like baked out of my mind earlier what this was like uncomfortably be do you know what I'm saying this one however gives you a better experience like it's more premium it's probably way better for your lungs and it just tastes better all around I feel like the high is really good and the more you hit it too higher you're gonna get so it's really up to you what you want but yeah your boy mr. THC if you guys enjoyed this video because you got smash that like button let me know what you guys want me to do next on this series cheapest vs. most expensive out", "nkmoR9M4HyY": "what is up family so I wanted to come back with the review I went to the dispensary and I ended up picking up a few different flavors of big gas extracts this one is banana bread if you like banana bread and you definitely want to pick this up it is a spot-on every time I even let it sit on and off for a day or two use it let it sit never have no leaking issue works fine every time flavor is on point every time great flavor at that it tastes like you're eating some banana bread like right out the oven like amazing consistency on the flavor definitely zoom in there oh not again there you go has website and go to type in your number it'll bring you up a bunch of information about these it was a lot of information that most companies don't really see too much like you'll see a page or two they had like three or four or five pages you can look at it was really nice everything in detail so if you're able to check these guys out and pick them up at the dispensary go ahead and check these guys out amazing company I'll go ahead and give you a couple rips show you my new invention and then I also got a video coming up on my new invention straight banana bread like on point banana bread amazing job big ass you guys got on point banana bread straight now for my new invention though faint mine's a fourteen millimeter fits in BAM third cat Cheers fam later peace-out much love and respect", "q1ORndkAYwg": "yo what's going on morning so I was going to bed last night and I came across a few videos on these cartridges and I guess some people are saying that they may have gotten some fake ones and I picked these three up the past couple days probably within the last week or so and honestly the first ones I was getting where these exotic carts this is the last one that I have right now I actually smoked this one but I just kept the packet to show you all but and I did have a problem with this these exotic carts are also my favorite and this the indica get oh jeez I pretty fire and then I had this white widow the dang big came through and I was pretty stiff white widow you hear that back in the day in high school and stuff I heard that any use so when this came up I snagged this and I was extremely happy at me and tasted like some really good whoa and and then I came across this one shortly after the OG Kush and I was like an OG Kush breath sounds fire and here's the cartridge right here so I've been smoking this for probably three or four days now just kind of when I'm in the car and stuff and when I next was I wish I had these cartridges but these two when I put him up to this one this oil and the OG Kush is a lot darker and when I first got it it was a lot it was a lighter like a more clear yellow almost I don't have that kind of brown amber to it it was a lot more clear and I saw like a little operation it but I don't know nothing that really raised my my eye at all or nothing on it but uh after like maybe another day or two of actually smoking on it it got a lot darker until like what yesterday I was like damn this stuff really got darker and I started looking up some videos and I guess a lot of people are questioning whether they're getting real gaining creeps or not yes so yeah I mean this at first it didn't seem too bad I'm it didn't taste the best but now like to me it honestly kind of tastes like a trim Ron I'm les you know when you get that slab of oil and it's been the trim run it's kind of got like more of a earth be like kind of green just I don't know I don't I don't punch you in the in the chest the way I like it some good wall does your way if this is and people are filling up their own cartridges and stuff I mean that's kind of sad I mean it's just you're ruining a good product either way this was the only one that I got I've had a few of them over the past month and this is the only one that I've had that has gotten a problem but from what I've seen online I'm not the only one so let me know what you guys think you know definitely next time I buy a cartridge ugh I guess I'll be a little more careful and look at a little bit more but this one also had an air bubble on it when I got it and the other two that I bought didn't have any air bubbles in them at all so or nothing thing but I don't know I'll keep on smoking and I'm getting stained not like it's definitely not like the other two pens but right here this og man no bueno no bueno I am out", "8yWpvcl5SUY": "welcome to community canvas reviews today i'm going to be reviewing a white label live resin cartridge um i had a bezel i think it was or bevel one of the two um bezel there we go i had a bezel distillate cartridge in and i just kind of got bored of it honestly because the terps are not very strong part of it being um they're not cannabis derived terpenes so live resin should spice that up um the live resin that i got is actually less terpy than the uh or it has less terpenes total we'll see what it tastes like anyways but less total terpenes than um uh cured resin surprisingly but either way we'll try it out it's wedding cake which is an indica this is cultivated by green queen farms and it comes in at 84.05 total cannabinoids um and 5.39 total terpenes um yeah so i'll read the terpenes and show you what it looks like but first let me flip the camera around for you [Music] uh [Music] all right let's try this out step one take off the sticker all right um first that's the thing about some good live reds and this um just some i don't know yeah some just good live resin cartridges i can smell that one no leakage whatsoever perfect seal that just smells nicely very sweet and almost like perfumey that's some interesting elements there so it's got a pretty basic um oh yeah that's it's got painting in there a bit smells kind of piney slash perfumey mostly but the leading terpenes and are the basic um are pretty standard beta cardio filling at two point zero four two percent uh limiting at one point five percent humiliate at zero point six percent um beta mir seen at 0.5 alpha pinene at 0.18 cedrine at 1.7 or 0.17 um alpha vista bologna at zero one point zero point one six and finch all at 0.127 so they always have a very detailed um terp list right there but usually a lot of the ones at the end are in pretty low amounts i don't think i can ever really taste them that already smells like it's gonna be way better than the other one was so um got two uh little silicone caps and the branding on this is c cell c240 620 but yeah proper c cell so that's always good um so first thing it's very very clear and light that happens with some white label um i think part of them being just like they they get stuff from different cultivators a whole lot just depends on who cultivated it what the starting material was like i think and white label actually as far as i know white label means like whenever there's um a producer doing white label extracts it means that they're doing extracts for other growers stuff instead of their own stuff so i think they've just made a name of that and that's just like their process but that's usually what that means so um i answered on reddit recently somebody posted a live resin cartridge by white label that was also very clear and wondering if it was real and also they had someone tell them that it was delta eight but they also said it looks like it has delta eight terpenes in it which if you know much about cannabinoids that's not even how that works so um but they came on reddit to verify it and i posted some cured resin and live resin that looked similar and that's just how white label is sometimes i don't know if it's crc i know they seriously well i don't know that but i'm pretty sure they crc some of their dabs so maybe they do their cards as well um i've never had a card that was remotely bad they always put out really good stuff and it's priced a little higher than some of the other stuff i get so i don't get it as often but part of that is it's higher quality too so i don't think they do it badly so all right so here's wedding cake yeah that smells it's just like a general sweet smell it's um i feel like there's like a very even smell of like the pinene and it's like limonene and something else that i don't know which i actually want to say is one of these terpenes in a lower amount and i definitely smell pining at 0.184 so i think i'm smelling one of these other ones either alpha cedric and alpha visceral or pinchol um i'm pretty sure finch all taste i've had finching which i assume is pretty similar just in this last buddies card i had and that was very like like so i don't think it's that probably i've had uh visible alone i think that's pretty sweet and i don't know about cedrine let's see about taste and smell okay upon hitting it you just get a very a much more pronounced and very standard like weed taste um i say that like it means a lot um a very just like nice balance between uh earthy and herbal and like um vaguely like musky taste to it uh not really musky someone says like the other two though um yeah it just tastes like weed usually does for most streams and don't stand out anyways uh that's how i remember wedding cake to be too i've had wedding cake from a couple different producers never a live resin so that's kind of cool but i've had select elites and that's just distillate with their terpenes and tasted pretty similar yeah so um it's not a a real standout strain to me um things like that are like mandarin cookies and like or tropicana cookies was a really good one or blueberry muffin um things like that usually stand out more to me than like wedding cake where sometimes you have strains that really do taste a little bit like what they're named and then you have stuff like wedding cake where i feel like there's maybe more behind the name or they just thought oh that's a good name for it or something like that um sounds pristine or primo or something like that very good very good but doesn't taste quite like wedding cake and the terpenes don't really stand out to me yeah those terps linger very nicely um very present unlike the non-cannabis drive terpenes that were in the last one that's why i switched it out though um i'll have the other one as a reserve in case i run out or can't get any more or something but wow this is nice and the effect on it very nice and full body too um a really good live rise and that's a good thing about the stream too is it um it's just well-rounded very well-rounded so sometimes something being well-rounded enough can make me be interested in it a little more if it doesn't stand out because sometimes that's what i'm looking for like right now for example and the perks of having a proper c cell at that vapor production all right so that's hitting pretty nice i'm getting some aftertaste again but i think it's some of those terpenes or maybe just all the mixing together but it's nothing really strong it's just so so much of like so little it's hard to describe but mostly just like um i'm getting some herbal tastes and some earthy taste like i said and i'm also getting like a weird i almost want to describe it as like how talcum powder smells that's a weird freaking thing but like it's like a very like reminds me of like a rocky taste or something i haven't tasted rocks so i don't know but that's what i imagine rocks to taste like i don't know if that's uh it's not a bad thing too it's very interesting i have to wonder what um alpha cedrine is like the effect is very nice and terps are just they stand out very nicely as they should with some live resin so yeah i think i'm starting to repeat myself a bit so i'm going to close it out here with some smoke rings at least one of those was a ring i'm pretty sure alright thanks for watching uh like and subscribe if you want and stay tuned and um yeah i'm a lot more interested in the cured resin this one's kind of a placeholder but the in the cured resin is a josh d strain which i've done a little bit of reading about because my name is josh as well so i thought that was interesting enough and he has some pretty good uh good-looking stuff and it's a josh d strain extracted by white label and it has more terpenes more cannabinoids more thc cbd um all of it really just seems like a better cartridge honestly it was cheaper i probably should have just got two cured resin cartridges um but yeah stay tuned for that one that'll come around in the next day or two so thanks for watching like and subscribe and stay tuned for more", "I9babjQA-aM": "whether you got an exotic car or a tank art I'm going to show you how to get the oil up so this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got an exciting one for you

style of vaporizer cartridge I'm going to show you how to get the oil out of it first things first let's take it to the deck and introduce you to what we'll be working with all right so here we are first things first let me go over the utensils that we will be working with today this is a stand that I made myself to hold cartridges in while I filled in these are a couple of varieties of syringe that are available this particular style right here works adequately for filling and emptying most cartridges that you get on the market today specifically 1/2 gram cartridges and 1 gram cartridges this will generally empty most of those now this tip is a little short and as such I'm showing a few of the available sizes this is approximately 1/2 inch one inch and a one and a half inch tips right here in varying diameters for filling no next to it I have a 1/2 gram or 0.5 milliliter and a 1 gram or a 1 milliliter cartridge these are one-time use non reusable disposable cartridges these are also 0.5 milliliter or 1/2 gram and one milliliter or 1 gram these are refillable and reusable the mouthpiece screws off where these are a press fit and they have to be forcibly removed now these are the two styles that I recommend when you are replacing the oil into another cartridge as you will see the exotic cards uses a slightly different cartridge right there but I prefer when I'm refilling to go with a tried-and-true cartridge to ensure the failure does not happen again with that in mind the first thing we're going to look at is these tips now as you can see this is a one and a half inch tip right here this is an half inch tip right here no this is a half milliliter or 1/2 gram cartridge as you can see this tip would work adequately to recover just about all the oil in that cartridge very well in the 1 gram cartridge as you can see you would be able to recover most of the oil except for what is stuck around the chimney right there for that a longer syringe such as this is a much more adequate okay now that I've shown you a couple of the utensils let's get these cartridges open real quick and we can see what they look like all right here we are so this is a lemon berry Gang babes cartridge with a C cell with a pronounced THC of 90.9 9% here's a little bit of a close-up if you'd like to pause that to get a little bit of the idea of the flavor then this is a C cell cartridge right here just like it states C cell right there this one right here this I believe is an eye crusher cartridge and this is some fruity pebbles from exotic cars this has the hologram I'm right there and this is a hybrid this one here says it's been 80 and 85 all right okay and here we are now please bear with me this may take a minute for some of these I have found that on some of these cartridges this perfectly round tip right here does not always work and I have modified one slightly so that it is slightly oblong to fit down around that chimney a little bit and that's what I want to be using right now to ensure that I'm able to reach cover as much oil as I can I'll be working with this first one this is a fruity pebbles from exotic karts I believe this is an eye crusher cartridge what we're gonna do we're going to start off with just removing the lid it just twists off just like that right there you can see set that to the side now I have a custom-made stand right here that I tend to use to hold my cartridges when I'm filling them if it tends to stay pretty pretty good right there right and you're going to take your syringe and just insert it and start drawing up right as you can sort of these have both been warmed up a little bit to ensure that they do flow decently I definitely recommend that as you can see you want to try to get as far down into that that edge right near that hole right there as you can get and then lean that the cartridge as far away as you can and just try to recover every little bit that you can and don't don't be afraid to suck a little bit of air up in there I mean you really want to you want to be able to try to recover everything that you can there for sure all right there's a little bit there what I recommend you do at that stage is just set it on the side and let it gather on one on one side real quick heat that up a little bit let all that oil gather on that opposite side and then you can stick this back in there and and utilize it that way well this is warm I'm gonna put this into another cartridge real quick just to ensure that it flows pretty good like I said then just put this tip right down in there this is able to go actually down in there like this to recover oil from one of these are necessary and then all right there you go sit that put Leon that and remember this let these sit for a few minutes that then oil bubble down in his holes and if it's good and warm like this one is it'll get down to those holes no problem alright and that's basically how you do that one as you can see on this there's a little bit gathering down on that edge we'll just gather that up as much as we can right there and uh this here just set it right off to the side with the cap there and uh that's basically garbage now with the dank veins it's a little bit of a different different different ballgame here you've got to remove this mouthpiece this mouthpiece is a press fit on here it does not just come off so what you're gonna need to do you're gonna need to grab this with a pair of vise grips or a comparable pair of pliers and there you go alright pull that mouthpiece right off of there now we take our syringe we insert our syringe all the way down and get just down there see how far that went in and then we slowly start to draw that all out of there all right we want to put the syringe on the bottom edge and start drawing there we go he's just taking all that oil right out of there all the way down until there's almost nothing left in there she'll be able to empty that thing out completely alright and there you go that's basically one done unit that point you can get comparable unit exactly basically the same unit brand-new these cartridges can all be purchased at vape art smart comm there is a link in the description you simply take that cartridge you take that syringe you put it right in there just like you four set it right down near that inside down there just like that there's a fill up in there all right and there you go put the lid on that get that near the old vise press that in and WHAM bulb Lambo there you go let's get this back on top and I'll tell you guys how this works out alright folks well here we are back on top with the new cartridges we got the fruity pebbles crammed down into this bad chicken right here this is a refillable csail

know because I like the cop now I'll let you from unless you walk up", "iYW3J0AD9MM": "how much delta a should i take if you ever ask yourself that i'm going to be answering that question for you in this video maybe not fully because it really does like vary per person but i'm going to talk about in general like how much delta should you take for certain desired effects normally in my videos i'd be vaping a delta eight cars open but for this video i don't have any delta eight cards because i'm all out so so i'm gonna be vaping a clarity instead because it's like four in the morning and i want to go to sleep after this or shortly after this so it makes sense gotta have some trouble smoking the video you know can be a dang frank video with no smoke what i mean they can't because my shorts last tick tocks some thomas might have smoke in it because if i because if i blow clive they'll say on tick tock i'll get the video taken down if you're taking delta edibles i recommend starting off with 25 milligrams most daily gummies i see is typically dose at 25 milligrams so i would just assume if most companies dose these gummies at 25 milligrams it's probably four reasons probably because that's like a decent amount for like just a little show effect everyone racks yourself differently plus tolerance exists so 25 milligrams so one person may not be that much better another person might be a d like a good amount if you're worried that 25 milligrams may be a little bit too much for you then i recommend cutting that gummy in half or only in half of it and that would be like 12 and a half milligrams and you may not be feeling a whole lot because for me personally when i eat 25 milligrams i don't even feel a whole lot so i feel like if i ate half of that i really would be feeling a whole bunch but that's just me you know everyone is different for me personally i like to take around 50 milligrams every time i use silty edibles because for me that's definitely a decent amount because whenever i eat 50 milligrams of delicious bowls like i'm definitely feeling high like sometimes if i eat like 25 milligrams i mean of course i'm already feeling like a little high but like when you like 25 milligrams it may be like just like just a little high but like with 50 milligrams it's like i'm high you know like i don't know if you know what i mean but like i feel like you might when i get to higher doses just like a hush milligrams or over it that's when i'm like uh i i may fall asleep you know after just a couple hours because it would definitely make me like a little bit tired and just because i ate a hundred milligrams of delta thc does not mean i have to go to sleep and being that high may entice me to take a little nap and everything i'm saying about eyeballs can pretty much be applied to tinctures too i never used the delta e texture before i've used a cbd tincture before but i never used a delta a texture before but if you don't know what these tinctures are this is just all that you can put under your tongue it's like a little dropper that you like you take off the caps a little dropper right here put it under your tongue like sit there for like 30 seconds and you just swallow the rest of the older the distinctions just like this with delta a and i'm pretty sure will give you similar effects to those variables but in a quicker amount of time because since it's absorbed under your tongue it absorbs pretty quickly almost as quickly as you smoke and you're vaping it don't know if it's like just as fast or faster but pretty much around the same time frame it would be you know relatively fast and because i've never used a delta a tincture i can't fully say the effects would be the exact same as an edible but i would assume it'd be similar and i'm kind of curious how similar that is because adultery edible like the effects are pretty great and if i can get those effects in like minutes from just pruning under my tongue like [ __ ] i might have to copy in some delta a tinctures another common way to consume delta hc and i think the most common way to consume delta thc is through vapes those are just for vapes it's like it's kind of hard to speak on it's like most people don't even like care about the dosages of vapes it's just like they just take as many hits they want so you know they feel whatever they want to feel definitely going to be taking a few hits or sometimes most of the time a lot more than just a few hits but that's that's just me [Music] thanks to dang frank you now have some idea on how those you dealt athc and if that was beneficial or helpful to you or if you just enjoyed the video drop a like on it it will really help me out and it only takes two seconds and if you enjoyed this video then

honestly Chuck's so this has been my daily driver since then I've been using on almost all of my cartridges if you guys want to check this one out I'll make sure to put their info down in description below relax om9 thank you for this battery and it's on the red setting let's go ahead and take a Cheers I mean my cheers hey cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over man we back at it with

right cool so like I was saying man's been a while since I smoked the raw garden I decided to call a cop went in oh my gosh all for those two to three hits man ah it is phenomenal though that was pretty freakin lame man I finished recording like 12 minutes a 12-minute was supposed to be 12 minutes total of the video and then um it just stopped recording man I was talking about all right so I finished when I checked back the recording it ended off at I was a 2 to 3 hits in and then after that I ended up taking like another three hits and I ended up talking a lot more talking about the battery talking about the giveaway talking about all that stuff so I guess I'm just gonna have to I don't even remember what I said I'm gonna be honest with you guys I don't remember not a damn word that I said B is what I shoot most of these um cartridge videos it's off the top of my head because it's a review video and things like that so it's nothing as planned out nothing is planned out now you guys know that so [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] get into this thing man alright guys so like I was saying two to three hits and deep I mean now we're like 6 or 7 i'm high [ __ ] right now guys we're gonna try to brainstorm so you see where i left off alright so this rock garden cartridge right here that i'm gonna show you guys this is this is the setup that i've been running as of late and honestly this setup is honestly pretty fired like it's it's the m9 Relaxo battery with whatever cartridges but this this battery right here honestly has the best voltages for any cartridges from low temps to high temps it hits all the spots you know and the raw guard you can never go wrong with raw garden man you can never ever ever go wrong with raw garden i think the only thing that i have an issue with with raw garden like i said is like i have an issue with how many times they cross the same strains over and over and over again and i know they're just trying to be like you know creative and trying to find new strains are gonna smack and things like that but honestly do have it's like if you see if you see things not progressing you see them digressing and being the same thing over and over i it maybe you should just try something else you know you're not gonna get better results doing the same thing that's facts this thing gives the fattest hits like oh my gosh that one got me dude I forgot how hard these raw garden cartridges met I honestly I remember I used to freaking get like baked off of like like two to three hits and right now I'm like ten hits deep now I'm obviously frickin blown I'm probably gonna have to just sit here and just be on my phone and chill with the a/c on for a little bit before I do anything but your voice is baked as heck so like I was saying man the my overall experience with raw Gardens I love it there there indica smack all the times for me I feel like the sativas and the hybrids are a no-go I feel like that's not only with rock and I feel that's with all all weed or anything in general men are actually not even but I think with bud and dabs I'm cool with but when it comes to cartridges the hybrids don't do anything for me it has to be a straight-up indicator and that's why I like indicas a lot more than anything oh man this that hate got me bro like I said I'm super baked right now let's give you guys a full rundown so the flavor profile on this [ __ ] already forgot bro [Music] so it has like a little fruitiness at the end when you Excel but a gas the earthy taste when you when you inhale it's pretty smooth it's smoother than most of the raw gardens that I've tried definitely it has a little bit more of a yellowish tint to it also and man it is this is an indica dominant I definitely feel the indica hitting me I'm lumped right now like I said my eyes are actually turning a little bit red so that's actually quite crazy I need a damn very good and then um yeah but like the Tate like I said the taste is phenomenal like every other raw garden that I've ever tried nothing too special but at the same time you know it's better than most of the cartridges that I've tried so raw garden you get you get you get another 8 out of 10 from you man you guys need to make something that's I don't know man you guys need to do something you guys need to do something different for the community I feel like you guys have done a weed thank you for everything that you've done that Bo we kind of want something different man at least from from me man I want something different from you guys so yeah guys I think I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here hopefully we at least reach to 10 minutes so you guys can have a good video to watch man let me know in the comments below what you guys what is your guys's experience with raw garden you know what do you guys like about it what don't you like about it what are your what are your favorite strains above them you know because I know they have some of this like I said they were they have some of the same strains that they cross with multiple times so let me know what you guys is favored right now in them in March 2020 man let me know which one's the best one you saw I think that's for me the best one that I have ever smoked from them I think was a the summer Bubba I think this summer Bubba for me was freaking phenomenal or that one or the LG Chem one of those two so yeah like I said I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it man hopefully you guys have a positive blessed day after seeing this video man stay motivated like always and we'll catch you guys in the next word", "sQF8-dl5fls": "[Music] yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing some of my orange cookies wax so hopefully that does look good on the camera i don't know how the lighting is but yeah hopefully you guys do see that so it's more of like a sauce and we're gonna be hitting it off of my blender so i'm really excited to be going over this sauce because it does taste and smell really good so i'm gonna go ahead and heat up my banger and i'll be back once it's all hot so i'm just waiting for my trip timer to go off but here's the the wax or sauce so it's really saucy and once this timer goes off i'm gonna go ahead and put this on top and we're gonna go ahead and take a rip i'm gonna pick up the rig so you guys can hopefully see the smoke more but yeah i'm just waiting for this timer to go off so i know how hot it is should be any second now like five more seconds and it should be good all right so let's go ahead and give it a hit put on the top now let's go probably have about one more hit okay so that was a really good hit i'm going to take one more and i'm going to end off the video there so i'm going to do again i'm going to heat it up and wait for the timer to go off and number two of the orange cookies cheers so super tasty oh makes me feel really nice oh that was really good so like i said this is the orange cookies like a sauce tastes amazing so i want to thank you guys so much for watching make sure you guys follow my other social medias because i'm really active on there i'm active on here as well but make sure you guys follow the other ones but thank you guys so much for watching make sure you guys leave a like comment subscribe all that and this is ethan signing out peace [Music] you", "yYmEmulc4QQ": "[Music] yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing the half baked extracts live resin batter so here is a better picture hopefully it is focused on the camera but instead of using my other glass for the video instead of using like the actual rig i'm just going to be using the puffco peek pro just because these different videos even though the rig is fun to use it just takes a lot of time for videos and this is just more convenient for videos if you're just going to be tasting the flavor anyways because it keeps the same temperature so i'm going to be hitting this um off the peak pro at 490 for i believe it is a minute and 10 seconds so i'm gonna go ahead load this up and we're gonna go ahead and take a nice dab so let's go so here's what i'm going to be loading up if i didn't say before i don't think i did this is the recon flavor or strain if you want to call it but let's go ahead load it up and take a hit so it's all loaded up now and we're just going to wait for it to reach temp and once it vibrates we're going to be ready to go i have a turbo in here so hopefully you know i do get a better taste so all of the chirps will be splashing around so just vibrated and here we go uh do so i'm getting a lot of freaking smoke out of this at this low temp it should be over any second now so the batter tastes really good on this low temp and the reason i have it for a minute a minute and 20 seconds and so all of the batter um is used and i don't have any left so i don't need to keep reheating it so that's a good temperature to put it at so i'm only going to hit that one time because i really don't think i really need to go over it that much so it does taste really good i'm gonna have their instagram down below so here's like the little logo that they have and then here's what i just hit so really good flavor puffco peak probably can't go wrong with it really good device just expensive but if you do have the money to spend on it i wouldn't pass out on it's better than some of the other devices that are cheaper but if you want the best device this is it it's just kind of expensive but that's gonna be it for the video thank you guys so much for watching and this ethan signing out peace", "7vpgJ80MjUs": "[Music] [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] oh", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "MgyTCP4ZuMs": "okay guys so the cart thingy my bobber is

refill the pot of the jewel so that you can save uh pretty much big rather than changing the pods every time okay so as you can see i still have a little bit of juice left there but for the sake of this video i'm going to show you how to open it okay so there's two latches here on each side so you just need to do is you could use your if you have uh nails just slide it in it could take a while to master this okay so there you go so this is the tissue for to wipe this clean because there will be a moisture around this area right here yeah and you can just use your nails to pop this rubber open there you go do that you just need to [Music] pat this rubber to dry and set it aside and now it's time to refill the joe pods so this accommodates one milliliter of juice well it's best that you use salt mix for this pods because salt nicks are what you say uh it for pods because it produces i mean when using the pod uh you need there's little vapor that it produces so you need a higher nicotine content but in order to get that throat tip that you've been looking for at fill 50 milligrams of salt neck is the throat it will be compared to around 12 milligrams of free base nicotine okay so i'm going to show you a trick and how to place the rubber cap back one tip is that don't place it on top then just press directly because the juice here will get vacuumed inside of the chamber so what you need to do is stick one side first slowly slowly until you shut everything okay so that's that and the next one is every time you refill the pods you need to get out the or pull out the uh what they call this i forgot what's this called but all you need to do is just grab a screwdriver and you can just pop it open i mean slide it out it has a yeah okay so just place this one on a tissue so this acts as a sort of like a spit back protector because it absorbs the spit backs so i just pat it like that not too hard okay just soft okay then transfer again and do the same thing over again okay just soft don't press it really hard see now there's juice here so this would be more like brand new again when you place it back in so to place this back in i had to just just lay it on one side then just push it with a screwdriver see so again on the other side just place it on one side and slide it in okay so that's it so your pods smallest like brand new and in order to place this back again just snap it into place okay you'll hear the clicks on this latches okay that's it now have a full working dual pods so let's test it out okay so for the first few puffs they advise that you just take a small hit so that the juice will go to the heating coil so that produces paper so puff blade puff it a it produces more vapor now and so yeah usually i get spit backs when i refill the pods but the one that i thought the one that i taught you i'm sorry is when you slide the the absorber or something on the sides and pat it dry yeah so that it can now absorb the newly placed juice okay so once again guys thank you for watching i hope you like enjoyed this video and informative you find it informative so see you again on my next vlog and don't forget to hit the like and

in the cancer space to come give their valid opinions like i always harp um until there's a cure prevention is you know the cure so um make sure this is cancer screen week uh make sure to have your screens done you know and all that so this is the second part of my um conversation about cbd and like you know the first topic is to cbd or not to cbd now that's the question on everyone's lips so cancer patients like me and suffers from chronic illnesses have been faced with an option to alleviate pains and side effects from cancer treatments and i thought to bring this uh on the show so that someone could give her insights from her point of view this is my second amazing guest who's going to be talking about this and i would like to introduce her very soon now the known benefits associated with thc and all that the legalization of marijuana and everything is so complicated but you know a lot of people still swear by its efficacy so to take us down and explain to us what it is cbd thc i would love to welcome my amazing guest jill woodsworth to the show welcome jill i'm so happy to have you here thank you grace it's an honor to be on thank you so much and i could talk about cbd and cannabis all day oh wow we have a lot to learn from you in this episode i'm sure so actually um i didn't want even though um you know your buy and everything is going to be on my show notes but i wanted the audience to actually hear you out what you're all about so what started your interest on foray into cbd uh it's kind of it's kind of a two-part i think personally i started hearing i'd say around 2014 2015 uh cannabis i believe it was medically legal in massachusetts and i was you know and i'm gonna mention cannabis i know we're talking about cbd so um and i can talk about that a little more but i think my interest started with with just regular cannabis i um actually i went through several recovery programs i i just shared briefly that i have three children i have five children three children have a genetic condition called tuberous sclerosis complex so uh you know in the process of raising them i got very stressed out and had to go get some support and in the recovery process uh you know there was a lot of pharmaceuticals added to my my regimen and i started reading about them and you know i was really i was sick a lot i i uh pretty athletic i'm still a runner i run every day and i just felt like i wasn't as well as i'd been in the past and was curious as to why um you know why i needed to be on all these pharmaceuticals and started doing so and i'm not knocking them i i think that um there's a lot of wonderful ways that we can be healed and have our health improved you know it's just a lot of times in our medical system they're prescribed here and there and sometimes um they're not there's not a consideration of the interactions and what but anyway so i started expl you know reading about that people were using um cannabis and cbd i didn't even know about cbd i just heard cannabis for um for various like mental health issues and and um and physical health so i started hearing about it and reading about it and at the same time thinking maybe i could and learning that other people had done this they'd kind of gotten off of some of their pharmaceuticals and um so that's where i started started my own journey and i did it you know explore that and slowly tapered off my uh many medications prescribed in um a treatment recovery program and started to feel really better and i was really surprised you know i it's kind of like one thing to read about it and it's kind of like you're like yeah maybe that works maybe it doesn't and that's kind of what i thought i thought oh you know it's just to get high or whatever and but then i started digging in and realizing there's just so much more there and uh and yeah and so then two part i learning about it hearing that people were using it for autism and for epilepsy and having my kids the same thing that they are on just a whole a whole medicine cabinet of pharmaceuticals and um wanting to maybe relieve some of that so and also knowing that the um the thc component of cannabis um needed to be really careful with that with them so cbd seemed like the safer option so i started really learning more about about cbd itself and the and i'll talk about it but there's other cannabinoids along with cbd that are non-psychoactive that are that are also helpful and we're just at the very beginning of learning about this amazing plant because of the it's really been a political and uh you know a lot of legal issues around it so exactly exactly it's the legal we will come to the legal issues very soon okay you know because um yeah what people don't realize is that the hemp plant has been used um from the 1800s for several things um and so it's it's strange to realize that now it's considered taboo so to speak so we're actually um happy that people like you are bringing this to the fore um to make sure that you know you're not forced to it's not mandatory but especially for for us like cancer patients for example i have met a lot of people who have said you know during chemo i'm so sorry but i had to do it i had to take drops and all that but we'll come to that because i needed to expeciate um you know not to gloss over it now so so um cbd and thcl as you had rightly said are synonymous with um cannabis but for those of us who do not know i know and probably a few others that would watch this video educate us on the similarities or differences please sure it all it it's all the same plant it's just can be the hemp plant is basically where we get cbd and um it it it's the way it's the way and you know i'm i'm not gonna i'm not an expert on this particular aspect of the discussion but um it can it is bred more for you know the hemp plant is is non-psychoactive so it's and you can actually harvest it at different points in the growth cycle to capitalize or to to access different um different cannabinoids it's it's the same plant it's just there's one it's grown um it's got female so you're using the female seeds and if it's the male seeds you're going to get cbd so the females good male if you're looking for that cycle essentially the same plan it's just really how it's um extracted like you were talking about the what what did you call it terpenes or something like that that's right and that's like another part of the um that the um terpenes are part of the case you know they're give it the aroma and they add to the experience and they actually are finding out that the terpenes have a lot of properties that are therapeutic and medicinal too yeah yes exactly okay that's that's very well that's yeah that's good to know you know because um actually my my first guest um said uh basically the same thing you did so it's good to know that um you're being consistent yes you know you're being consistent so um for what you what you used um during you know this period of pain and also for your children what forms does cbd actually for these purposes does it come in uh i'd say well it comes in so many different forms you know you can take it you can take a pill um you can you can smoke it you can you can make edibles and you can use tincture and in fact i i have a little bottle here this is like a tincture bottle of see okay um and you just take out and you have a dropper and you put it under your tongue and that's a really popular way um way to consume it and the edibles i would say take longer to get into your system so you're looking at it it's sometimes it has a different effect because of the way of your metabolism going through your digestive system and that in that form um so so what you're trying to say is that the tincture goes directly i mean when you put it you've just shown me now you put it under your tongue right so it's sublingual yes it's sublingual and therefore the the ones that are put in edibles so it takes more time you know to yeah and it actually sometimes it has a little bit of a different effect i know if you're concerned okay thc edible it's going to be a lot more intense longer high or experience and you know so you you've got to figure out um what works best for you one thing with cannabis is nobody's the same obviously and um what works for one what form works for one person might not work for another and then there's the these stronger like oils that are kind of like a tincture the fico and the rso and i know a lot of cancer patients do use those really strong oils so um so yeah there's tincture and edibles and um let me think there's you know there's there's um like hash and um trying to think of the other forms um yeah anyway um what i i wanted to find out was you know i have um a friend of mine too that you know one of the side effects of chemotherapy is neuropathy and um you know she she got this ointment as well to be able to use yeah and massage her feet which was you know cbd infused and she seemed to find a lot of relief kind of you know i completely forgot topical because that's topical exactly i brought i brought this is a topical roll-on that is a cbd and cbg combination and this has been exceptional for um i use this with my son who who is now using some cannabinoid medicine and you know you can so that one is for what that one you're holding what is that for well it's for pain and it also is for you know systemic you know it will it will give it go into your bloodstream and this one happens to be a nano um cbd and cbg so it's very small molecules and it gets in quickly and gives real good bang for the buck so it's this is becoming more and more um as people learn how to formulate this type of cannabis it's really effective and it also bypasses the digestive system so it's not going to interact with any other medications which for cancer patients i know that you're you're probably taking medications and stuff and sometimes a topical might be a better choice and you know it's not going to go after some types of pain more inflammation-based pain would be um yeah would be it would be ideal but so there's just so many different and there's different forms of tinctures and topicals and then there's the salve too that you rub on like i think i have one okay a body bomb this is like right yes yes that also is um can be a very effective i do know that sometimes um with the topicals if it's not formulated i would go with a really good brand because sometimes they just they they're not any good so yeah that's probably something we're going to get into but yes we're going we're going to talk about that brand because you know cbd is all over the place you can go to the gas station and buy it you see all these brands and you don't know which is actually you know which actually claims to do what they say they do you understand so since everybody is willing to try out anything just to get some kind of relief from pain you see them going for just anything based on you know what cbd is supposed to to to do so of course we know that the cbd market has expanded considerably and you know people like us we we swear by it you know um it's it's it's popular now but from your own point of view from your own point of view why is cbd increasingly popular now why do you think uh you know it's a good it's a really good question i think there's probably multiple reasons um i think people are learning more that are you know that it works and they don't need to go be as reliant on a doctor if they can treat something at home that they you know that they might have to go to a doctor to get some kind of a prescription for um you know if you can access it without a prescription that's one reason and the non-psychoactive aspect of it you know it's not going to get you high you can use it during the day and you you can really take a lot and there's really very minimal side effects however uh people should be aware that it does interact with other medications so you definitely want to um check that out and you know so i think that's it's it's multi there's lots of reasons why it's not that expensive um and you know i think there's just the market just is is crazy and there's a lot of people coming in that don't really know what they're doing they're not formulating it to where it's it's a good quality they might be using lesser um a lesser hemp product or you know not not a clean processing plant and they might not even be getting it tested you'd always want to check the labels and make sure that uh you know the dates it's a current it's it's been tested recently and there's no pesticide there's there's a whole list of things that you don't want to have in your cbd yes i was just coming to that you you beat me to it because i i needed you to um you know that that person that would be watching right now to say what what advice would you give them you know when purchasing cbd products and thank you for mentioning you know independent testing so independent testing could you tell us what it entails independent testing would be not associated with it would be a separate lab so you're not there's no like if you have your own testing done on site and you know who's to say you you couldn't like alter that in some way ways you're getting that is if you are running the show right for commercial purposes right exactly okay if you're producing it um and you want to get it you don't care about how it really works or whatever and you want to make money off of it saying it's tested on site or you know kind of just bearing that detail in in the paperwork that's with the with the product yes so you want to look for independent testing from a lab that's um outside of the the actual um wherever it's produced so it's a separate independent lab that's you know and you can research that with uh with different types of cbd you can you can look at the labels and you know i think that that might even be too complicated for a lot of people so when i started looking into it i just talked to people that knew that had done it before that i i found to be reputable and i just started asking them you know what brands are you guys buying where are you getting this and what's a good brand um so yes for me that's a lot easier than worrying too much about the testing though i still always look at the bottle and and make sure you know that um it's not expired yes and having the what is it the barcode because somebody was talking about the barcode earlier you can have a barcode that i know i actually have a product that i developed another business that uh i worked with a guy that developed the topical cbd cbg and so we have a little um like a qr code that links to our site and the barcode is um and so right there you can pull up the testing you can look at the dates and um you know they and also they test you want to make sure that they're testing each batch because it's produced in batches okay so that's another detail that um it should say a batch number on it the batch number right that's that's good advice yeah you should be able to find this information on the website it shouldn't be that hard to find you know they should put it front and center if it's hard to find the test testing information or if it's not there i'd be a little wary okay so and um somebody was also my my other guest was also talking about the soil and water components where these things are grown because sometimes hemp is apparently said to suck out um you know the what should i say all the dirt and grime or whatever it's a cleansing plant so to speak yes it's a cleanser yeah so yeah absolutely you want to make sure it's grown in a place where it's not absorbing a lot of extra chemicals heavy metals chemicals sides yeah and they and the testing should show that it should be tested for heavy metals and solvents and all that so oh that's that's magnificent so anybody that is watching has to make sure that they abide by these and you know um like you rightly said it shouldn't be too difficult but sometimes you were lucky to have the opportunity to meet other people that could give you some advice and where you could ask questions but there's some people that are lost don't know where to go or you know so these these will be like um [Music] you know um good takeaways for them to hang on to when they're looking to find out much more about cbd and um uh related issues yeah thank you so much yes come here for that and i was just gonna say that um i could even provide for you that you could put in the show notes or whatever some links to some some good brands and some sites where you can get good good information that would be highly welcome i was going to ask you for that so that with that information i could put it out and put them in my show notes for anyone that would be interested in um taking a look you know and seeing what they can you know find out there so jill this has been so wonderful i i would love you to you know tell the audience more about what you do and your information too besides the other information will be in my show notes as well what's your business all about and you were talking about you know um a co-worker somebody you work with tell us all about that sir sure i have i well i kind of have two my foot in two businesses uh i'm a co-owner of a podcast platform called tsc talks and it's i launched that with uh actually because of a what i felt like maybe you can relate to this i need to talk about um the the process and the case management around this rare disease that my my offspring had and see you know i felt like there was just so many gaps in what i was hearing from doctors and other professionals it's kind of like hey nobody's really giving telling you the the hard parts that people need to know that people need to be able to um connect with another person going through the same thing so i started the podcast to talk about tuberous sclerosis complex as a parent and had other started interviewing other parents and uh other people that were affected and then and then medical professionals and other professionals that that work with this population and slowly uh i i kind of ended up kind of veering off of just being immersed in the tsc world because um you know it's it's kind of a rare disease and and i wanted to expand and ended up starting you know talking to people with autism and um eventually really kind of my personal interest in cannabis at the same time was developing so um and i was starting to really be frustrated with the disconnects and the the um just lack of cohesiveness as children age into the adult realm a lot of the services fall fall off and you're dealing you know if you're you don't have a parent that's helping you case manage you know you really just get eaten you know pushed down by the system so um anyways so i saw that cannabis might be an opportunity to get away from just talking about you know all these really um kind of sad and depressing stories and give people some hope and um and another tool in the toolbox for managing their care that's not quite that they can actually take a little bit of charge of their own care um and you know and possibly reduce the pharmaceutical load um so that's where the how i ended up and i just i once i kind of went down that road um i've just learned so much about all this i alternative natural remedies and different options yeah options yeah yeah so that's the podcast and then through that process while i was interviewing um people i actually bumped into this gentleman named mike robinson who has a stepdaughter with severe autism and he was using cannabis for his own um he actually uses it for his cancer and he's had cancer three times and i believe he's um in remission and then implementing it for his daughter who step daughter who was pretty much i don't want to say a vegetable but she was seizing like 24 7 and just taking her from there to where she now she's like she's going to school she's still non-verbal but she's toilet trained i mean huge strides just use it using cannabis now he's um got just a lot of connections and knowledge so it wasn't just like your guy off the street just bounced into it but i was like fascinated i was like i've got to learn about this because maybe i can you know i can help my kids i could help teach these people in the community that there's other ways to manage this condition or they can supplement what they're doing already with this more natural um this natural plant and i guess i started learning about the endocannabinoid system and i don't want to take too much time on this but i feel like i should just mention it we all have an endocannabinoid system it's a major physiological system of and it contributes to homeostasis so um we all have it it's not taught in medical school because of the you know basically we have an organ-based system and to implement that would basically mean rewriting everything so you know i learned about that and um really it's just i don't know i just felt like that's where the podcast needed to be on this alternative health space so that's where i am i talk about and marginalization and oppression in the systems of care that we depend on you know i feel and i'm sure you can relate to this you're just um there's just i feel like there's a lot of power there's there's a power structure and there's a lot of for pro there's a lot of profit made from health care and medical care and you know no one's looking out for the patient no one's really there and so just empowering you know parents and individuals affected just to to feel like they know something because you go through and you know this you go through all these experiences and you're learning it's not like you're not you know you're learning as you go ahead you're meeting people different perspectives all that that's why we have the platforms that we have so we can push all these issues to the fore because like you rightly said nobody's talking about it and it's systemic you know yes it's systemic yeah so so that's the podcast and then like i said i met this gentleman mike robinson and we somehow got together and worked with a couple other people and he uh formulated a product called we've named it forest bathing you can see the forest and it's yes cbd cbg topical that uh is i said nano before so it's got nana it's small particles and it's got terpenes in it um smells lovely and so we had the process of building and marketing a product which has been such a challenge because of the legal issues i will say we've lost we've probably lost money yeah um timing with kovid was bad too but um we're you know we're keeping at it and um yeah i am i am thrilled about being getting the opportunity to work in this space and to talk to people about uh how they can take charge of their own health um yes indeed that is very um pertinent for people to know to be part of their not leave it to beaver kind of thing uh to be part of the the medical trajectory and no you know um well-being is is it it shouldn't be complicated you know so far as you know exactly what it is your body can take or not take even your mind what it is if you know you can take or not take because when people like us are going through cancer or autism you know looking after autistic children or whatever there's just so much that's happening and it's not just the body itself it's the mind so we honestly so that that is major during well-being when you're talking about well-being is the mind first so um i i think that patients uh survivors should be able to choose what it is they you know what what what road they want to go on and not be mandated to do farmer all the time i'm sorry to i'm sorry to say yes farmer is instrumental to a lot of us still here today but we should be able to like you rightly said you were on medication before you now got better after using this i've heard so many people talk say the same thing and so there must be it's not just about um you know cbd or getting high whatever no it's actually doing something good and and that is the message we want to also portray and project when we're talking about it a lot of people wouldn't love it wouldn't like it but um you know as you you you never know if you don't try right so absolutely yeah you know it's not for everybody and it doesn't you know everybody's system is different i will say that um i would say probably a hundred percent of the population probably has some form of endo endocannabinoid deficiency people with autism have that so when your body takes it your system takes a hit yeah it throws everything off balance and so then it's it's over compensated and under compensated in in such a way that um disease develops and uh so if you're using cannabis um or cbd actually just cbd you can get back into some homeostasis regulate yes and a lot of the minor like um for instance fibromyalgia is is a real um low-hanging fruit for cannabis or cbd um in terms of being an endocannabinoid deficient deficiency and it's amazing you know i've implemented it with my son and he's still on pharma and we've kind of balancing it but it it really made a huge difference and it wasn't like um it fixed him it just kind of helped i would say not only with his overall health but his mental health and so you know those things are just like to take a kid who's got like rage or aggression issues which he he definitely had and to use a natural substance that you know you don't have to necessarily go through the doctor for though when you are managing a child or personally a complicated medical diagnosis you do want to have that that medical medical yes because i'm not a doctor yeah yeah so oh yes that's understandable that's that that you must especially you're dealing with a child and then those issues are complex like you said it's a rare disease so um one also has to be careful to um what uh one is putting into the body right yeah yeah and then you know that a lot of these uh children or adults again they're on a bunch of medication so if you're going to introduce cbd you want to make sure that um you're working with someone or you've investigated how it will impact the other medications some it will increase the intensity of like for for instance uh clobazam is a anti-seizure med and cbd will make that much stronger so you know okay you just never know and so this is where the doses come into play right knowing what exactly yeah so now that they don't but knowing so that it's not too extreme right too much right i would say start start low go slow mm-hmm yeah that's fantastic advice oh wow this has been an amazing conversation jill i wish we could do this uh all day long i would have to bring it bring you back again you know to to just talk about this talk about this so um i'm going to sign out now but before i sound you out you know sign you out i'm going to you know sign out and talk to the audience okay okay so my dear audience and friends there you have it you've been listening to the amazing jill woodworth um who has been giving us her point of view about cbd its uses the controversy and what it what the takeaways are so the key takeaways are that you you can't get high with cbd it's legal and safe to consume however you also have to make sure that if you're under animate or having to deal with any medication you have to make sure that you know everything is in sync and you're not doing too much or doing too little um you know for many people now cbd is becoming a healthy addition to their lifestyle and well-being and so i think that you should all be encouraged to do your research educate yourselves and make your own choice that is to cbd or not to cbd so don't forget to like subscribe and share this channel this is grace b

welcome to vote pro podcast the award-winning cannabis news podcast brought to you by votepropot.com here are your hosts phil adams jay britton and andrew mccready's biden's pick for drug czar is a bit out of the historical norm we're gonna tell you why uh jay speaking of history is gonna give us a little cannabis history lesson and uh jay you've also got a little bit of business news right for those who follow canna business um we've got all of that and so much more thanks a lot uh folks for coming and joining and sitting down or driving or whatever you're doing but listening most importantly to our humble podcast thank you and welcome to another episode of votepro podcast um we're gonna get started with um some inside the beltway news what about that sounds good but first let me just interrupt no please do can you see we we do this on zoom so he's looking at it see what i got today i just got this what it is i don't know i'm going to say it this i bought a cartridge a vape cartridge from my vape store in virginia which is not thc it's just this is right delta 8 thc have you heard about it that's the big craze now there's a little loophole in the law delta eight is very close to delta nine which of course is what we all used to using to get high phc delta nine delta eight is a molecule a compound rather that's in the plant in the flower on a much smaller quantity but what happened when they passed the uh the hemp bill the farm act the farm bill whatever the hell they called it farmville making hemp 2018. what they what there's a loophole where they go in and they can pull the delta eight out of the flower and concentrate it and sell it and what it does is it gets you high but it's different from delta nine it's a it's a sister to delta nine gets you high but it's how do i explain it it's like you feel you realize you're high but you don't have that lack of focus you know how you get you know you do a couple bonuses you're always done and you're standing at the kitchen sink or you have the refrigerator open for like 15 minutes why am i standing in the time thing you don't get that and you don't get the paranoia so anyway you can buy this now legally and it's pretty interesting pretty easy now so so you're enjoying the effects of the delta i took a couple hits before the show so let's see how that goes but no i've tried it and it's a uh it's hard to explain it's not like a stone thing like what you're used to smoking a joint or something but it you feel it do you feel a physical uh sensation you feel a little bit of that euphoric kind of i feel good thing and i feel relaxed wow yeah but i don't have that like what time is it man so anyway i just thought i'd throw it out there for those of you what did i come to the kitchen for again you know what i'd love if some people would write us write us you know podcast that's pod pod cast at votepropot.com let us know what you think of delta eight i'd be interested to see yeah let's get a little bit of i didn't mean to interrupt your very important up-to-date political news phil i just don't patronize me man okay go for it no i'm kidding we've got two separate bills that now these are both been introduced into the house and senate before but uh didn't go anywhere and as we know when the senate was controlled by the republicans senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is not in a rush to get any of these things done that's for sure so they've been reintroduced and there are two of them and i'm going to start with the secure and fair enforcement banking act it's called the safe banking act it was reintroduced this week by colorado representative ed perlmutter and this has got a lot of bipartisan support they're more than a hundred co-sponsors um and they're from both parties that's great and it's got a very strong chance of passing now what the legislation does uh would allow financial institutions to basically serve the cannabis industry without facing any federal penalties which many banks and credit unions they don't want to take on any cannabis clients because of these federal sanctions the fear of right um and what happens well they have to operate on a cash basis and crazy and it's it's a pain in the ass and dangerous i mean these guys are walking around millions of dollars right yeah they're vulnerable to all kinds of crime and it complicates you know they've got all this financial regulation compliance and it's just so complicated on a cash basis it's just it's not worth anybody's time in the financial world i don't know who on the republican side is sponsoring it but it might be uh kevin kramer do they have a fair amount of republican support yeah they've got strong republican support i think it will pass i i have a feeling it would have passed if if mcconnell had ever you know dated to to put on the floor um but that's hard to say but it's a good bet to pass now um promoter said uh quote it's time to enact safe banking to align federal and state laws and reduce the public safety risk in our communities and and that's true and uh we're just inching our way towards some sleep legalization this is inching our way this is this now this is in the house um and a similar bill is expected to be introduced in the senate next week i don't know who is going to sponsor it but um that's that's the scuttlebutt the other bill is um called the claim act and again this is how i don't know how they come up with these acronyms but it's the the clarifying law around insurance of marijuana act you know it is what it says now what what it would do is it it basically keeps the federal government out of the insurance uh uh out of the penalties for insurance companies covering cannabis industry firms um it just would prohibit it it would are they penalized now yeah you can be penalized simply for offering coverage oh my god to uh to a cannabis firm and and uh and and the same thing as the same lines as the banking yeah and the same line as the banking it's a sort of a financial industry and um it would also now there's a lot of provisions of this bill but it would also the other thing is it would require the gao uh the government accountability office to study and to report on any barriers that are being imposed barriers to the marketplace to financial services licensing any of that stuff the gao will be responsible to keep tabs on this and make sure that this all flows smoothly and and people are not being unduly burdened and the senator on the democratic side who is sponsoring this is bob menendez of new jersey and on the republican side is rand paul of kentucky well rand paul's a libertarian right so he's always going to be on the side of getting the government out of your face that's right and he said here's what he said the principles behind the claim act are simple respect the voices of the states and their people and stop shutting out legitimate businesses from obtaining basic protections ah how do you argue with that you know how do you argue with that right yeah exactly so why are they doing this doing this being federal legalization in such an incremental way why don't they just if they're gonna take the time to pass all these bills why don't they just pass a bill that says it's legal you know why all these little incremental baby steps yeah that's that's the way government works as well the the old saying is that politics is the art of the possible yeah so they're doing what they can what they can yeah well you know what the uh with the makeup of the congress and the white house being what it is they have an opportunity why are they doing this all piecemeal i really don't know because they can but they but they're doing what they can i guess send us your thoughts at votepropot.com contact or send us an email at podcast votepropot.com and please give us a 5 star rating on apple podcasts if you'd like to be part of the show call our message line at 240-257-2441 remember we had on um we had on a guy i don't know maybe a year ago or a little less than a year a fellow by the name of warren bobrow oh i remember warren well he had a great time with oren yeah a lot of fun he's a he's a big wig in the industry you see him on tv and you see him all over the place he uh he writes for forbes magazine he writes for forbes and a bunch of other magazines uh on cannabis and he's also known as the cocktail whisperer that's right and he was on the show uh to talk about a lot of things but one of which was promoting a new line of uh infused beverages he has which i believe are out now called claws k-l-a-u-s oh cool yeah so this is a story out of there i suppose with a k yeah the original version right um this is a story out of marijuana business daily by bart shannon and the title of the story is how are cannabis infused beverages doing in the market basically sales of the cannabis infused beverages are up 40 last year as companies sought to capitalize our new marijuana customers seeking a familiar form of consumption and those looking for an alternative to drinking alcohol okay according to data from seattle-based cannabis analytics firm headset sales of marijuana infused beverages increased 40 last year versus 2019 recreation and recreational markets such as california colorado nevada oregon and washington state cannabis infused beverages rose from 67.8 million to in 2019 to 95.2 million in 2020 wow so that sounds like a pretty significant growth does to me but what you have to realize is the overall industry grew 40 too so they grew kind of you mean the overall cannabis industry or the overall beverage industry cannabis okay all right but they didn't lag behind so that's good right they're at the same 40 growth despite the strong growth of infused beverage market um there's a small port there's still a small portion of the overall mix they're about one percent one percent of the entire cannabis sales are beverages now that kind of surprised me i thought it would be a little better than that but this year they're at 1.2 percent 2021 so far so david they're edging up a little it might seem obvious but kind of the marketing idea i think for most of these companies is that you've got a lot of people who are new to cannabis yeah either have never tried it or haven't in a long time and some of them are a little cautious about rolling a joint or doing a bong hit or buying a dab rig you know right but it's easy to buy a drink pop a top and drink it another thing is they say that um this is again how they're marketing it it's much more acceptable but let's say you get a cocktail party with a bunch of friends somebody lights up a joint right everybody turns around and looks what the hell is going on yeah right you know what i'm saying it's like but but if you go to the refrigerator and grab a can and crack it and pour it into this i'm just gonna give it a second thought nobody thinks about it so they're thinking that's kind of the uh the whole idea so so it's a kind of a social fit in type of a thing social acceptability now here's the question um you've had cannabis infused beverages before i don't recall that i ever have um i understand they don't taste so great well again that was warren's that was warren's deal that he was going to produce something that really was good he's written six books on making drinks yeah and he says that he has come up with a formula and a way to infuse drinks and market them that taste delicious we have not i have not seen his drinks i think they're in can uh california yeah i don't think they're available in maryland or virginia or virginia yeah no but i would like to try some clothes me too me too i have had a couple of different uh and and i've they're fine if you the kind i've had or you put a little cap full and you drink the capful like fruit punch or something so it's like a little five hour energy or something i have not tried like you know one of the seltzer drinks where you're going to drink 12 ounces right i don't know what that's like i wonder how much [Music] thc is in one of those salts or drinks it varies a lot of them are actually um making them fairly low like five to ten yeah yeah so that you know you can drink a couple socially and not get hammered you know right and uh i think that's kind of the intent i mean why would you buy a drink that's 40 or 40 milligrams or something you know they're five and you can drink two or three and and get a little buzz and it comes on slowly and that's one of the things they talk about in this article was some of the people are cautious about china because it takes a while for it to kick in yeah so there's a couple of uh manufacturers who claim to be coming out with products that kick in in between five and 15 minutes well that would be helpful i think yeah like you have a glass of wine or a drink you know and you feel it and yeah 10 minutes later you know how it's affected you right and the problem you you and i both know that edibles is sometimes you it's an hour an hour and a half and you don't think you've gotten any effect from it and you drink six of them so the drink the drink market is doing well but it's not blowing the doors off anybody so uh you know good luck to uh to warren and all the all the manufacturers anybody have any experiences with some of these cannabis infused beverages love to hear from you bye he's the president oh right the president um i've heard of him yeah been around a little while he has been busy you know setting up his administration and uh we've been sharing some of that with you in the last few segments or last few episodes this week um and this is an article from marijuana moment um which i love by the way there's all kinds of great stuff um about his top pick what a lot of people believe is his top pick for the director of the federal office of national drug control policy aka the drug czar and rahul gupta is the leading candidate for the position of drug czar he was the former chair of the west virginia medical cannabis advisory board um and he served on biden's transition team what makes gupta a little different is that he has actually publicly recognized the therapeutic benefits of cannabis whoa that's encouraging yes he has really and and he has and he worked in west virginia with the control board advisory board on a legal cannabis program so to authorize medical use of of marijuana so um that's a little bit different take on a drugstore you know drug czars are usually the enforcement czars saying no no but this uh rahul gupta may be if he's picked he may be ready to break that mode what an interesting what an interesting pick seriously what does that say well i i think the the what how do you read those tea leaves you know i don't know because the sum total of biden's picks um since really mixed messages right there was that's my point the other one uh uh oddly enough also named gupta of anita gupta um who was uh confirmed i believe as the assistant attorney general is not in favor of legalizing or decriminalizing drugs she just said flat out and we told you about that last week merrick garland who was confirmed as attorney general may be a little less strident about it we just don't know so i mean up and down the biden administration i i just i'm not getting any strong indication uh of a pro-cannabis bent from these folks although i'm not getting an anti-cannabis spent either so i mean that's something yeah it could be a couple things could be just that that's just not a priority for them and that's not one of the things that you're looking at on the resumes of these people or because drugs are you with things drugs are that's what i was going to say but drugs are a guy who's very pro that seems to that kind of i don't know well i think it's it's it's encouraging if if you're going to read anything into those leaves exactly whatever whatever kind of leaves that you want it's encouraging we but again wait and see the odd thing is that the the drugs are the director of the on dcp is required by federal law to oppose any legalization effort of any drug banned under the controlled substances act so i don't know where he's gonna fit or or what's gonna happen but instead of a dilemma he's in there but maybe it's time for that law to go as well so yeah um let's let's let's hope got a new segment we're gonna try this out all right on a regular basis we're going to do a little piece on history history is related to cannabis last week we did a little something on on the beatles yeah and uh cannabis remember i got a 100. thank you you did i got both questions right i think the idea is to we'll cover a lot of different topics you know events that occurred you're not going to quiz me again are you i might have a question for you yeah uh but you know just just it could be anything it could be 2 000 years ago the chinese and what they did with it it could be you know how marijuana became illegal in the united states in the 30s we'll cover all that but we're going to start out with something fun this week and that's cheech and chong all right so are you really mad all right well you know there's a lot more to cheech and chong i think than what people assume by the characters they played well the characters we grew up with the characters we grew up the stereotype stoner you know many people suggested that you know that they were detrimental to the cannabis movement because you know they they created this stereotype the stoner stereotype they they defined what the stoner is i disagree with that oh i heart will heartily disagree with that do you good because i would argue that chieftain strong did the exact opposite that they through their comedy kind of shined a spotlight on the culture of the 60s and 70s and part of that counterculture was cannabis now and as much as anything they made fun of it exactly but if you look at cannabis and the way that cannabis was perceived the use of cannabis before cheech and chong before the 60s right before the counterculture it was the reefer madness thing right our parents generation the 50s the 40s and before yeah they believed that people that used cannabis were you know mexicans black people yes and that they took it it was like heroin and it made them go crazy and rape women this is what people believed and i think they opened the eyes in some ways them and others right through their comedy and just regular dudes yeah and just to get a perspective of what they did cheech and chong the ones that you hear on the records in the movies and the stage were actually two really hard-working really intelligent comedy writers performers yeah they created these characters you know and there's not unlike what you know uh three stooges or you know the lord or something exactly you know it's a character to make fun of and laugh at right but the stoner characters that they portrayed was an artistic creation it was just something they did them that was funny and and it was a vehicle one one of many i mean he listened to their records they had all kinds of characters kinds of stuff that's right right cheech marin said in an interview that he never smoked pot while he worked ever not once not when they were on stage doing comedy not when they were making movies or records oh i believe it he wouldn't be able to this guy was really smart he went to i'm talking about cheech he went to uh cal state at northridge and he was an english literature major oh yeah and he only he dropped out eight credits short of graduating to run to vancouver canada to avoid the draft vietnam to avoid the vietnam draft and that's that's that's where he met uh tommy tommy who's the canadian right exactly not only that cheech was this cracked meal he was a member of the five sigma kappa fraternity sure why not if you ever listen to an interview he's a smart dude he went on the first uh jeopardy uh celebrity remember that celebrity oh he knocked it out he kicked the ass of no other than cnn's anderson cooper crushed him crushed him didn't just beat him and crushed him but he's a smart dude yeah um so anyways a little history the guys met the two of them met in 1968 in vancouver and marin was uh delivering carpets and he met tommy chong tommy was a musician and he was running an improv group in a strip bar that his family owned and so he talked marin into joining this and they after a while doing the the the stuff they became a stand-up duo right and they became quite popular in vancouver and they decided they've kind of done all they could do in vancouver they said let's go to la they went to la and they were discovered in clubs there by no other than lou adler now those of us who follow music know whoever is he was a huge producer he owned the roxy right he owned uh uh a couple of those clubs on the strip oh yeah couple clubs of strip he owned um dunlap dunlap dunhill records he started that record company huge record label he did he produced tapestry yeah one of the biggest selling albums of all time yeah he saw them in a club said hey let's make a record they're like a record yeah let's make a comedy record right so like in 1970 they made their first album which did really well it's just called uh chichen chong 71 and they followed up in 72 with an album called big bamboo that's right big bamboo and that began yeah well that was the biggest selling comedy album in history at the time yep and then their third album won a grammy so i had that one that's right after they had all that success with records they decided we need to make a movie right well so they put the script together they went around a bunch of a bunch of the studios in la nobody would do it nobody that that was too controversial a couple stoners it's not gonna be fun it was stupid you know um so what happened is paramount lou adler worked with paramount and they said paramount said hey what we'll let you use our studio and our facilities but we're not going to finance it so they financed themselves they were eating peanut butter and sandwiches by the time they finished that movie they spent every penny they had yep making that making up and smoke up and smoke which was huge yeah i think they spent a few hundred thousand which is nothing for me it grows like 50 million or 45 million uh so they did really well yeah so that's kind of their history and they actually split up at some point and i think they're mid 80s yeah a little bit of a falling out and they each went their own ways actually cheech had a very successful solo career in television oh yeah he was a regular on uh one of those cop shows well no cheech was on the cop show nash bridges nash bridges right tommy chong was on uh the one with tim allen what was that show uh home improvement home improvement yeah yeah that's right so they they they had a little bit of a falling out and uh and they did get back together eventually and and that they made an appearance on the late show as stephen colbert in 2018 in a response to john boehner remember boehner sure he was a republican uh speaker of the house and he left he left congress and he became he found himself on the board of a big marijuana a cannabis entrepreneur now yeah yeah so they went on to talk about that and they expressed their displeasure that uh marijuana was no longer rebellious and i i love this quote i'll finish up with this cheech said that um he could now buy weed from a store in a strip mall when we used to have to buy it from behind the store in the circle so anyway i think cheech and chong did a lot to kind of reverse the stigma and kind of make it fun yeah light-hearted make you realize that it doesn't make people who use it murderers and rapists and addicted like regular people just regular guys now you may remember this back in junior high school jay and i have known each other since then yeah that's right we had our junior high school had a very good basketball team and we would have pep rallies each start of each season and one year we had a pep rally do you remember michael alexander oh yeah tall skinny black skinny guy he did they did a version of basketball jones which was a big it was huge he he had a basketball with him and he wrote the words on the basketball in pen in case he forgot them and he played what was the character's name tyrone shoelaces that's right and i think a lot of the teachers had no idea right [Music] that was like early 70s man yeah yeah yeah 73 74 something like that here's the final final question all right let's see how let's see how your trivia is one question for you their first film as we said was up in smoke what year was that film released 76 77 78 or 79. 78 bam you're good man nailed it yep i just you know remember where i was when it came out that's great that's great all right so i'm three for three on one and the thing about tommy chong is you know when i when i wanted to learn how to do the a canadian accent or those kind of i i listened to tommy chong is that right oh yeah man you know he's got one of the best canadian accents out there you know i never even know what he's talking about but you know he's got a great one well it's funny because cheech marin does the best like hispanic southern california compton accent yeah but that's how he speaks at all but yeah well he doesn't normally speak but i guess that's how what he was brought up on but he was but the two of them man well what a great comedy team some of the best comedy ever guess that just about does it for us this week we are glad that you joined us um we hope uh you enjoyed the show and if you did tell a friend about it
