{"yTANu5Hcl1A": "hey everybody welcome back as you can see just some natural lighting today and that is because I feel like I'm often talking about my cycle but it is because I have endometriosis so the pain excuse me for my voice but the pain can be just really bad so I didn't even feel like setting up my lighting today so I just set it up like this so welcome back but I am currently in a lot of pain so I'm gonna talk a little bit about edibles the first thing you should know is that if you've never done adipose before you need to find something that's very low dose okay your liver transforms TCA into 11 hydroxy THC which is a much more potent format of THC and it is very intoxicating so that's why oftentimes people will have like really bad trips on edibles because they think that they're taking like these small doses that dosages they think like Oh 10 milligrams whatever and then it hits like 30 so you have to be very careful if you've never done edibles before if your tolerance for edibles is really low outside of that apples are incredible for pain and that's why I'm choosing to go with them today because like I said I'm in a lot of pain and I like to be really honest with you guys so that's what I'm working with today I have some babies Eddie these are medicated shoes there are five choose each one of one flavor and each Jew has 20 milligrams of THC I'm not going to lie that's pretty strong even for me like I don't have a very high tolerance for edibles but I chose Betty studies because as you saw on the package it's vegan it's gluten-free it's dairy feet free and it's made with real fruits and veggies so like I thought that that was pretty cool that they were still taking in so many people's like dietary restrictions I do like that it's childproof I think that's important to do you have children in the home I know of course you want your stash to be somewhere secluded but it's also nice to know that it has that childproof lock on it as well so looks like I did get one of each flavor okay oh my god this smells so good I believe that this is the flavor very good thing very good things that's right cute so the papers kind of stick into it you know that's okay had a lot of practice with now and laters so it don't bother you too much I think that they need to get better paper because it's sort of like stuff to it you know I think that they could do a little bit of treatment to the paper or more treatment to the paper get just like a higher quality wax paper that is really delicious oh my god okay y'all need to sell that in popsicle form that one's really good it's a little hard to chew it definitely does have a tacky texture to it it's kind of getting stuck to my teeth for me that's a little inconvenient it's just only a little bit it's not yeah I'll only dog like half a point lemon tastes like any other lemon candy you know sourness and her bitterness which doesn't really bother me that much it is not as good as the berry very good team River so this one's called my little lemon heaven that's cute what's next next up is orange beautiful aren't you beautiful maybe a little bit a little bit the orange one does not mask the taste of the teach the at all I definitely taste cannabis it's not nasty it just has that like earthiness that you don't really expect when when you have a really well-made edible so the last one that I'll be testing is lime a good person I'm a good person are you that's disgusting okay it's this good it is disgusting and it's really sour I don't know II love lime flavor like I like limes ooh that's nasty who does next I'm not gonna spit it out because I need my medication but oh that's nasty it tastes like expired spray was consumed by a STONER pissed out and then repackaged as some new health to drink I don't like it at all it's nasty would s gross I thought the women was gonna be the worst flavor the line is hate it hate it so what I'm gonna do is take about just half more of the very good things because it was very very delicious I really really liked the flavor on this one like I said only thing that I don't really care for is the texture I do think that yes it's taffy I think it's supposed to be a little bit more fun cute recreational but it's really hard to get off the roof or your mother or your teeth Cheers oh right now my pain level is right now my pain level is actually not that bad it's maybe had a 5 out of 10 a 5 out of 10 so it's manageable earlier it was much higher like around 7 or 8 and that's why I decided let me just go ahead and try and get dress into this video but right now it's kind of cool down I think because I was moving around I keeping my mind off of it I think this will be really really helpful so yeah I'm gonna watch some Doctor Who and report that then maybe like our so that [ __ ] hey if they're dead late I still feel my cramps but there may be like like a 2 or a 3 they're still manageable the high for me it's a little bit more heady it's also like kind of sitting in my chest I noticed like the first sign that it was starting to hit with that my heartbeat started going a little bit faster for whatever reason it's odd it didn't cause anxiety or anything but that's just the first effect that I noticed and oh and then after that I just started to feel like scattered I went from not wanting to do anything today at all to feeling like ok I can manage the pain I might do a little bit of yoga so I mean I think that's dope like I could see a change already especially also a change in mood it's not necessarily that I feel productive it's just that I am in a place where it's like oh I can finally kind of take care of myself because yoga does help it wasn't heavy yoga or anything nothing fast or sweaty just kind of moving my body in a way that felt natural and in a way it I guess it was intuitive type of movement so so far I'm really appreciating it like I said I think my pain level is more like at a 3 now I think it's only about like 3540 minutes later my metabolism is really fast so edibles to hit me pretty fast I am gonna eat some food real quick as well I have the munchies so bad like edibles always do that to me like I get crazy munchies with edibles so I have the munchies really really bad so I'm gonna eat some food and watch more TV and if there's an update I'll check in later I'll see you guys soon continues to lesson because I can't function I'm trying I'm Jack I'm here present okay so I just forced myself to get up so I could check in with y'all I'm very smacked I'm very much enjoying it probably still gonna do with some more because it does feel really really good I don't want to go over the edge I am still gonna wait a little bit longer it's been about 20 minutes since my last check-in so I think that's almost an hour and almost up there it feels really good I feel like I'm gonna take a nap and I really I need to eat and I'm probably gonna go to sleep but I'm gonna say that my final score for Betty's daddy's is gonna be um I think a 4 out of 5 4 out of 5 and I am really happy with the end result again and result being I'm pain-free which was the main reason why I was using today you know so anyways thanks guys for tuning in I appreciate you supporting me if you want to support support oh if you would like to support me further you can follow me on instagram

"vE5RSv89Se4": "[Music] greetings my beautiful lovelies it's Emmy welcome to beautiful Duluth Minnesota I am here today visiting my beautiful friends and also tasting some pie we just drove up to the north shore of Lake Superior and stopped by Betty's pies which is a North Shore institution the parking lot was packed we thought we beat the lunchtime rush because it was 1:30 but no the place was packed we had to wait 15 minutes for a table so I decided to get a bunch of slices of pie to go so I could do the taste test later so Betty's pies is a North Shore institution it's been around for over 50 years they have a large selection of pies including cream pies pies with the top and bottom crust and crunch pies with a crunch topping and I got at least one from each of those categories so I have all my pies open in front of me and now we're going to taste them so the flavors a pie that I got today are pretty classic but I did get a couple that are signature Betty pies so yesterday at a bookstore I picked up this and this is the original Betty's pies favorite recipes and I just looked at all these flavors that I'm gonna be tasting today are included in this book so I'm super excited to see how the recipes will taste compared to the real stinking deal alright enough talking let's do some pies okay so the first one I'm gonna taste is this one and this is the apple pie it consists of two layers of crust and of course an apple pie I feel like oh well we'll go shall we smells just like a classic apple pie I can smell the Tang Younis of the apples I can definitely smell some cinnamon let's give this a go flaky crust the crust is also speckled with a bit of cinnamon sugar so by the looks of it this looks like Apple pieces it doesn't look like slices alrighty let's give this go eat the Lucky mouth oh that's a good apple pie you know what I'm immediately struck with it is nice and tart I love a good tart apple pie I don't like pies that are just so cooling Lee sweet and this is not this tastes like fresh crisp fall autumnal apples it stain it's got a nice bite to it I love it the filling itself is soft and well-cooked it's thicker than apple sauce but more kind of soft and cooked in pureed that way there's no crunchy bits no chunks mmm delicious just a touch of cinnamon on the top not overly cinnamony all you really taste is that really great apple flavor it's one of the best apple pies I've ever had actually I'm not usually an Apple type person because I've just so those reasons I told you things can be too sweet or the apples are hard and they're not well cooked this is wonderful the pie crust is actually really great - it's not buttery but it is flaky and just really good counterpoint to the filling of this apple pie delicious mmm by the time I get back to New England it's gonna be full on Apple Susan and I'm definitely gonna be trying that apple pie recipe definitely okay to switch things up next I'll be tasting this and this is the five layer chocolate oh my word now when I say five layer there's one layer of crust looks like there's a layer of kind of chocolate dark chocolate then it looks like to be a cream filling and then on top it looks like chocolate pudding so one two three four there might be something underneath but it looks like a very decadent kind of like Boston cream pie here we go take a bite there's a bug in there get out gross already here we go whoo homeboy is that rich oh that's pretty delicious so the texture of this pie is very fluffy and put any but light at the same time not dense when I say put in the I imagine really something quite sweet and it is sweet but it's more whipped and airy but it has a really great chocolate flavor to it chocolate and chocolate pudding like but has a really great chocolate flavor to it yes it does taste like chocolate pudding but there is also kind of a chocolate intensity to it as well not just like cocoa flavored mmm and the crust works really well here we only have a bottom crust just enough to kind of hold all of this like luscious fluffy cloud nests together but it doesn't take away from anything texturally it just at the bottom there a little bit of kind of tender cooking this almost then you got your layer of chocolate and just kind of putting me moose like fluffiness I'm not really a cream pie person but this is really delicious it's got the richness of cream without feeling overly heavy and decadent sweet but not overly so a little does go a long way really nice I really admire the chocolate flavor in here it doesn't taste fake it actually seems like there's some real chocolate in there rather than being kind of a cocoa flavor like that okay next is probably my favorite type of pie and it's strawberry rhubarb pie now this pie is similar to the apple pie has a top and bottom crust and it looks like it's dusted with sugar as well but I don't think there's cinnamon in there I hope there's no cinnamon because I don't want cinnamon with my strawberry rhubarb pie it smells great I can definitely smell the strawberries this is my favorite pie I'm not a huge pie person I don't make a lot of pies but this is the one I do bake every year because I love strawberry rhubarb pie so much I actually usually make it with just one crust sometimes I feel like a top crust just makes it to crust heavy but it is traditional this way so let's give this one a go oh it's flaky the filling oh there's a big piece of rhubarb right there alrighty here we go and that's pretty stinking good the rhubarb adds a nice acidity to it the strawberry flavor is really pronounced rhubarb to me doesn't have much of a flavor of its own to me it just adds a lot of acidity which I really like and of course you have to add sugar and there's plenty of sugar in this pipe I like my strawberry rhubarb pie a little bit more acidic I like that burst of taking this the filling and both the apple pie and the strawberry pipe are wonderful in the sense that they're set they're not too watery the crust isn't soggy which I really appreciate Anna pie also so there's a lot that's been considered and mastered in these pies they're not overly newsy they're well-constructed pies next we have the begun by another classic here and common pie I don't usually get because it tends to be too sweet for me but since I was doing classic pies I thought I had to get one so this has a bottom crust has the classic pecan filling underneath which is very very sweet and then on the very top you've got pecan halves floating on top so let's give this one a taste then it's absolutely delicious pecans have such a natural buttery nutty flavor of their own is just they are a perfect complement to any kind of dessert and this of course is a classic pie for good reason it's delicious it's very sweet but buttery and rich and the filling is slightly sticky but not Luzi and again the texture of all these pies are excellent the filling holds together while maintaining kind of a separateness from the crust which I really appreciate you still get some of the flakiness of the crust it's like a candy bar pie mm-hmm really really them I just need a bite or two because it is so sweet hmm delicious Oh next we have this one and this sallow pie is called the crunch pie because instead of having a top layer of pie crust it has a kind of streusel kind of crumb topping on top this is called the Great Lakes crunch pie and it's full of different berries and I believe rhubarb as well based on the recipe that's included in this book and this looks incredible all right here we go oh my gosh yes I see some rhubarb I see some purple berries what look like they might be blueberries and then it's got like an oatmeal streusel topping on top all right here we go mmm oh yeah mmm that one is great as well again the filling really holds together this one is slightly pasty there's probably some kind of starch or flour that thicken the filling so they don't just ooze all over their place this one tastes a little bit pasty but again it does give you a beautiful slice and there's this clear separation between the crust and the filling the craft still remains flaky at the bottom on the top you've really got a nice streusel topping with a little bit of the chew from the oatmeal it is sweet on top it reminds me a little bit of a coffee cake topping a little bit like granola sweet but you can still taste the berries in there I definitely tasted some kind of blueberry ish blackberry ish flavors in there it's delicious and I think a little bit of raspberry in there as well I really like the berry flavors in that hmm I also like the crumb topping on that a nice little bit of variety in terms of textures in your mouth oh and lastly I got one of my other favorite pies pumpkin pie we're coming on fall here pumpkin pie reminds me of Thanksgiving I always have a little sliver everything's giving because I love pumpkin pie so combination spiced pumpkin yes it says Thanksgiving and autumn to me so had to get some of that so let's give us a taste this is a very nice slice of pie very handsomely cut a little darker than some of the pumpkin pies I've seen maybe there's a lot of spice in here let's give it a face and find out oh yeah hmm there's a lot of clove in this recipe very close heavy and when I say clove heavy I'm comparing it to my favorite pumpkin pie recipe which actually comes from the side of a can of Libby's canned pumpkin I love that recipe to me that's just quintessential classic pumpkin pie this one is much more heavy in the cloves which i think is the reason why this pie is so much darker in color I don't like that flavor so much I'm maybe it's just my natural proclivity towards cinnamon flavors but it's a little bit too kind of potpourri ish for me but it still screams pumpkin pie it's just a little bit too close heavy for me but if you like pumpkin pie it's still a good one the again filling is very well made in the sense that the proportions of the ingredients keep this a very solid pie it's not losing all over the place it makes a beautiful slice and like all these pies the crust is excellent YUM now it's time for occipital so there you have it my little taste test of Betty's pies if you're ever in the Duluth area take yourself on a beautiful Drive of the North Shore and get yourself some pies you'll probably have to stand in some lines but it's well worth it all righty thank you guys so much for joining me I hope you guys enjoyed that one I hope you guys learned something let me know down in the

it's drizzled with caramel sauce at the end so it pretty much takes apple pie to a new level now I'm making the crust for the pie I started with three cups of all-purpose flour I used a 1 and 1/2 cup measure they're so handy and I'll add a teaspoon of ground cinnamon half a teaspoon of ground nutmeg and then a teaspoon of salt this is the pie crust recipe that my friend Sylvia shared with me years and years ago I added the spices just to give the apple pie a little bit of an edge I got all that stirred around now I'll add 3/4 of a cup of cold shortening I just cut it into squares and then the same amount of cold butter now I'll just use a pastry cutter to slowly combine the dry ingredients with the shortening and butter I got most of the big chunks of shortening and butter broken up so now I'll add a beaten egg I didn't over beat it I just barely stirred it around with a fork now I have a little container of ice water and I'll just add about 5 tablespoons right over the top whenever you're making pie crust it's important for the ingredients to stay really really cold otherwise everything falls apart now finally a tablespoon of vinegar the acid in the vinegar just helps the pie crust stay extra tender now just stir it around with a spoon until it just comes together now I'll just break the dough in half and then I'll put each helping into its own plastic bag I'll just form it into a rough ball and then after I stick it in the bag I just flatten it slightly and that'll make it easier to roll out later okay I'll get the second one in this pie crust is so good without the spices but it's particularly delicious with all right now I'm gonna stick the pie crusts into the freezer this crust is for a future pie and this one just needs to chill for about 20 minutes so in the time's up all I have to do is get the dough out of the bag and onto a floured surface and start rolling I just keep going until it's slightly larger than the pie pan then I roll it around the rolling pin lift it onto the pie pan carefully unroll it and press it in then I tear off the excess dough and tuck the edge under neatly and go around pinching the dough to crimp it I've just been slicing a bunch of peeled apples I've got about six seven cups of apple slices in the bowl and now I'll add a half a cup of sugar and then to make it a little bit thicker I'll add a quarter cup of flour to combat all that sweetness it needs a little salt about 1/4 of teaspoon and then I'll slice a lemon in half and I'll just squeeze in the juice of half of it that is all combined now I'll just bring up the beautiful crust and I'll just pile the apples right in the crust and when I say pile I mean a pile I don't believe in having a level apple pie okay just perfect now there are many delicious things about this apple pie and this crumb topping is one of them it's butter and flour cut together with some brown sugar quick oats which give fabulous texture and a little salt all stirred together okay now the crumb topping just gets sprinkled all over the pie use my hands if some of it falls onto the floor no problem there's plenty more where that came from big pile now I'll just use my hands to let it fall into the cracks oh my gosh look at that gorgeous now the pie goes into a 375-degree oven for about an hour then there's another thing to add to the topping before it finishes baking half a cup of chopped pecans delicious okay back in for five more minutes well my house smells heavenly and that means the pie is ready to come out of the oven it just looks amazing ah nice and golden those crunchy nuts on top the crust looks gorgeous now to finish it off and to make it caramel apple pie I'll just crack open a jar of caramel sauce and I'll just drizzle it all over the pie my gosh that looks so good you", "teukgrRQols": "[Music] hey friends welcome back to my kitchen and welcome to the recipe therapist honestly there's nothing better than a homemade apple pie baking off in the oven today I'm gonna show you how I make my Apple berry pie I'm gonna be using fruits like fresh blueberries and fresh strawberries and I'll run with that I'm also going to teach you how I make a full-proof homemade pie crust it's so delicious buttery flaky you can only love it so let's get started we're gonna start out with a pie crust first so let me show you what I put into it we're gonna be using a nine and a half inch glass baking pie plate I've used this several times it works really well we also have some all-purpose flour some sugar and some salt now in my pie I use a combination of buttered flavored shortening and salted butter I like to use both in my pie because I feel like it just makes them more flavorful flaky pie crust we're also gonna be using some ice-cold water and the secret ingredient to this foolproof pie crust is vodka believe it or not vodka works so well in a pie crust because we need something moist to pull the dough together and rather than just using water which kind of sits in the pie while we cook it this cooks all the moisture from the vodka and the flavor of the vodka cook out when we're baking it in the oven and it just assists in making a much more flakier delicious pie crust so I'll be using my food processor today for this recipe we're gonna start out with the dry ingredients first but what I've done was I taken 1 cup out of of the flour and I'm preserving it for later after I add a shortening in the butter so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my food processor and I'm going to add the flour ok gone all in there and our sugar and our salt okay and then I'm going to just this is what the mixture looks like when it's all nice and clean mind or the dry ingredients so now we're ready to add our chill shortening and butter so I cut it into little cubes like this like half inch thick and like I said they're nice and chill so they're gonna go right in okay and then I'm going to pulse this until it's nice and combined and there's no streaks of flour left the mixture looks like with the shortening in the butter you see how it's kind of crumbly like that that's exactly what we want so now we're ready to add our reserved one cup of flour that we Said's before and we're gonna add it right in here to this mixture and then we're going to pulse this until it's all broken up in there and you're gonna see it's kind of gonna come together really nice I took my pie crust mixture out of the processor and I put it into this bowl and this is the look that you want you see how it's nice and big and crumbly this is how it should look after we put our shortening in now before we I just wanted to point out if you didn't have a food processor you can use a grater like this and take your frozen butter or and your frozen shortening and just grate it like this and you would add it to the mixture and you know just mix it all together and it would work just as well so now we're ready to add our ice water and our vodka so I'm going to take my chilled vodka and pour it right in okay and then the recipe calls for water tablespoons of ice water so I'm gonna start out with four and if I need more I'm going to add it in sometimes I do and sometimes I don't so what I said I'm just gonna add the four and then I'm gonna mix it together with my spatula okay a nice you know firm spatula and then I'm gonna begin to mix with my hands and it's gonna come together into like a ball shape when it's all said and done so I add a little bit flour because when you add the liquids to the mixture it gets kind of like sticky so right now I'm forming it into a ball just like this and this is what we want it's nice and moist and I'm just gonna go ahead and form it into a ball and then we're gonna come back and I'm going to show you how we're gonna prep it for the refrigerator so this is what the dough should look like this is absolutely perfect this is exactly what we want so now I'm going to take this dough and we are going to divide it in half because we have to wrap it up with some saran wrap someone to divide it into because we have a top layer and a bottom layer and it's so soft look at it this is exactly what we want so I'm going to warm it into two disks like this okay it's nice and easy to work with I have my swim wrap ready I'm just gonna wrap it up like this okay and I'm going to put this in the refrigerator for a half hour and it's gonna solidify a little bit and it's gonna be perfect for us to begin to roll it out very high so let's cover the ingredients on the inside of the pot while our dough is in the refrigerator we're gonna start out with a thickening agent of the pie I use tapioca 1-minute tapioca I've made this pie for so many years and this is my absolute favorite thickening agent I don't use cornstarch or flour however if you want to go ahead but this recipe for me works best with the tapioca we also have some salt here some lemon juice some cinnamon and I'm going to be putting some almond extract and vanilla extract I have some salted butter and of course some sugar now for the food I have some fresh berries blueberries three Honey Crisp apples they are my absolute favor for this pie especially this time of year with the ball coming up and some fresh strawberries that I slice in half [Music] I finished slicing my apples and they look great I cut them into quarter inch slices like this I do that because it ensures at the end of the day you get a piece of apple and every bite it's really important now we're ready to add our thickening agent which is the tapioca and our cinnamon okay going right and I want to get that ball in and the vanilla extract and I could smell it really smells good and such flavor to the pike I'm gonna go ahead and mix this and I'm doing it in this order because I want to make sure that all three of these ingredients are well coated on those apples and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna add some muttering hold it I'm ready to add my fresh lemon juice my sugar and my salt okay I'm gonna mix this and this is gonna start to form a little shoes on the bottom that that's sugar coat all of the apples now I wanted to just tell you I'm using Honey Crisp apples because like I said before they're my Apple of choice but a close second that I've tried is a Pink Lady Apple which works very well for this recipe and a gala Apple look at my athletes to say I'm nice and coated they are this is what you want the tapioca the cinnamon the sugar all nice and well and combined in these apples so now I'm going to put the rest of my ingredients which is my almond extract into my berries in a separate Bowl you're gonna see later while I keep why I keep them separate and I'm also just going to put like maybe a half a teaspoon just to swim up a little bit and I'm gonna mix this together being careful not to they come off and then we're gonna come back my pie crusts already so now what I have to do is begin to roll them out but before we roll them out I have to need up just a little bit with the flour so I have my flour here and I have my sister and I'm just going to put a couple of spoonfuls of flour and my sifter and I'm going to put it on my cutting board because I do need a lot of flour to roll out this dough and so I'm going to just place it in this flower like this and I'm gonna need it about five or six times just like this so my dough is ready to go it's ready for me to all out and now I take my pie plate and I turn it upside down just give me a basis of how big I need to roll my dough out so I'm going to take my disc and I'm just gonna begin to roll it like this back and forth and then using a see it's gonna roll out really nice [Music] so the bottom of our pie crust is ready to go I've spread it out and now I'm going to show you a little trick of how we're going to put it into this pie plate so I'm gonna take my rolling tent and I'm gonna go at the end here and I'm just going to begin to roll it up right and I'm going to take the one end and [Music] then I'm going to begin to you know manipulate it into this pie plate and I think it's really looking good so I'm gonna go ahead and press it in like this and I'm going to come back and show you how I pinch the edges so I've been pressing the dough into the pie plate and it just is so workable it's so perfect and what I do is I fold the excess edges like this okay some people cut them off I don't cut them off I fold them under and I use them I don't want to waste any of this and you know what else it does it makes for a better edge of the pie and you'll see that later so we're gonna come back and then we're gonna fill it up with our fruits and it's gonna be so delicious ready to layer our pie yes layer it we're not gonna mix these two fruits together in the same Bowl we're gonna layer this and that's what makes this place so special so come take a look at these apples you see how they made that juice down there and you can see it's already starting to thicken up that's the tapioca I'm telling you it makes such a difference in this pot so I'm going to take half of my apple mixture just like that with some of the juice and I'm going to layer the bottom and I'm just going to Pat it down I can use my clean hands to put a little bit more just like that all right and then I'm going to take half my berries and put them right on top okay and I'm just gonna repeat this process I'm gonna come back and I'm going to show you how we're gonna do the top I finished the second layer over the pie and you see how beautiful it looks I place all the berries nice and evenly around the pie and it looks just perfect so now we're ready to put our butter or salted butter and I cut it up into little pieces like this and I'm going to take my you know clean hands and I'm going to just evenly distribute this butter around the whole top of the pie and this is gonna add such delicious flavor I'm just so yummy now we're ready to do the top of the pie so I needed the dough when I showed you before and it's right for me to roll out so I'm just going to shake a little bit more flour on the top okay and I'm going to roll this out like I did before nice and big and then I'm gonna show you how we're gonna slice it for a nice lattice top my pie crust is rolled out into a perfect circle which is going to be great for me to show you how about I do that fast at me or lattice hot so what I have here is a pastry wheel it has like this fluted edge and I'm going to take it and I'm gonna go up down the pie vertically half inch slices just like this so the whole top of this and then I'm gonna show you how we're gonna put it right on top of this homemade pie so now I'm just going to take the middle slice and I'm gonna make this easy for us guys I'm not gonna do a fancy basket weave what I do is I pinch the edges like that into the already you know made pie cross and take another piece and I just go along the whole top until I cover it and then I do the same thing for the next layer I'll go across nicey-nice works for me so I layered about four pieces along the top and then I take two pieces and I go around the edge of the pie I have one there and I have one here and you see come up here I have these two ends left from my circle so they go around the other part the last two parts of the outer edge see this so we're gonna have this nice decorative edge to the pie now the remaining slices I'm just gonna go nice and easy across the top and pinch the edges in there and then I'm gonna show you how we do the final decorative edge so I already started doing my favorite decorative edge for a pie which is what you see here and I want to demonstrate I left a little section here to show you how I do it so I just take my forefinger four fingers and my thumb and I press the forefinger in while I'm pressing the thumb out like this say and you come up with this beautiful decorative edge like that okay now I'm going to take this pie and a lot of people do an egg wash I like this I don't like the egg wash I do a water wash okay it's real simple I have my little pastry brush here and I just brush it really lightly I'm not drenching it with some water okay I don't want to you know make puddles or anything right on top and on the crust just a little bit and then that's enough that's perfect but then I'm going to sprinkle some of this sugar on top and it's gonna give us this nice caramelized top and that extra-special crunch that we love so much on our pies and our homemade pies [Music] I've got my oven preheated 375 and this is gonna bake for about one hour and I'm gonna put it on this cookie sheet and it's gonna be hey guys welcome back so the PI has been cooling off for about 20 minutes and take a look at it it looks really good you can see the apples in there and the berries see how they still keep their shape that's because we layered the sky we didn't you know mix it all up and mash it all up together and that's exactly what we wanted so now I am going to attempt the taste of this part so [Music] different tools here in case I need slice it and I like here the crispness of this flaky pie crust oh my gosh and I think I'm gonna use this spatula to get in there real good and show you just how oh my gosh you see this look at this pie wow that looks really really good and I just have one little apple here that will be left behind I mean otherwise you see look at this you see that gel doubt that's the tapioca and in the pan you can see the glaze that's exactly why I use tapioca and just see how beautiful this pie is I'm telling you guys you have to use the tapioca so now I am going to take a taste I use my knife this piece right here oh how this stays together so nice look at this and that crust stay together see that it's buttery is still smoking actually I might have to blow on it [Music] oh my god I am not stopping at one taste this is so so incredible I'm telling you the pie crust the combination of the bellies that's happy oka this pie is outrageous I really hope you guys like this recipe because a lot of time went into this and I'm telling you it's a great recipe for the full recipe I am gonna leave it in the description box below don't forget to hit that subscribe button and that little bell for notifications and we will see you next time to serve up some more love take care [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "lUnNZTAcmAc": "[Music] hi I'm will and welcome to my kitchen today we're gonna be making some wheat apple pies we're kind of modeling them after that nostalgic like drive-thru apple pie I'm sure you bought a few those when you're stoned but now can you do both it wants to birds it won't stone [Music] yes so here you see we've got about an ounce of D carbs weed that's all ready to go to makings to sea water so I'm gonna bring it over to the stove okay so we've got our D carved wheat here but before we deal with this we're gonna melt some butter we've got about it pounds worth of butter in here when you turn your stove on you want it pretty much as low as it can you just want a slight simmering we're gonna mix this butter in [Music] take your time don't worry about the pace just take it slow so nothing burns you're not gonna put the lead in until it's all melted so you know that Shakespeare could have been a STONER in 2001 anthropologists actually found marijuana residue left over into his personal smoking papers okay it's all melted so now we're ready to add the wheat to the butter there we go so now we're gonna turn the oven far down close to simmer really and we're gonna keep it at that for two to three hours while we gently stir it that's gonna be a while but once it's done we're gonna strain it through cheesecloth and then just let it cool down for a while after that it'll be ready to go for our project see you in a little bit okay so we've got our weed butter it's all cooled and ready for cooking but first we're gonna have to peel and dice some apples Honey Crisp this is a Honey Crisp apple which is really good for baking because it's soft and sweet and it doesn't require a lot of other additions to it just peel the Apple essage so these are very soft apples which means you don't have to cook them in the pan for very long and so they won't get as burnt and there's less of a chance of losing any of the THC content okay now that the apples peeled we have to dice it up you want the pieces to be small but not too small [Music] we want to make sure you're being really careful when you're with your fingers when you're doing this [Music] oK we've got all these now can put them in this bowl [Music] and we're gonna go over here to make our filling okay so now we're ready to make the filling I'm gonna put this down and then we're gonna put in two tablespoons of the wheat butter that's equivalent to about 80 milligrams we're making five to six pies that's like 15 milligrams each per try and so after we've put that and you just want to dump all the apple slices if you want to turn this step up to like a medium temperature you don't want to burn it too much and then I'm gonna squeeze half a lemon over at the apples this is gonna trick them from oxidizing they won't get all brown and green okay we're just gonna cook these for a little bit see you're waiting for that pulse to get soft and warm and then once they reach that point you're ready to add the rest of the ingredients this is really easy filling to do there's a few steps involved but it's actually pretty simple it doesn't take many ingredients and it's really delicious so I recommend it starting to look just about right I think we're ready to add the rest of our ingredients so first we're gonna add a bit of cornstarch this will help thicken the consistency of the filling and then this is just cinnamon for flavor [Music] now some nutmeg awesome nutmeg is pretty awesome that's quite a twist okay now you need a big thing of brown sugar oh it all kind of came out in a clump you just want to mix it evenly throughout and blast you just want to add some water then you just want to keep mixing it up just keep stirring till you get that really nice thick consistency apple pie obviously is an American tradition this is a bit more of an alternative America but it's still really delicious and the way we're making them it's great for on-the-go it's amazing for a picnic a festival it's just a good thing and if it gets you high then that's just a bonus yes okay turning the heat down simmering okay so once again starts to get really syrupy you want to pull it off and let it cool okay so now we're ready to cooler filling so we're gonna just empty it all off onto this tin foil pan I'm just kind of spreading it out so it just can cool quickly nothing too complicated okay so now our filling is ready to be cooled so we're gonna put it in the fridge for like five minutes so we'll check on that in a little bit okay so now our fillings been cooled and we can move on to making our pie crust so we're just gonna be using a store-bought crust if you've made it yourself you could cook it with wheat butter as well but we just did it with the filling this time you want to cut it into two squares but one thing you have to pay attention to is you have to make one of them larger than the other [Music] shutting it down [Music] okay so now you sprinkle some cornflakes onto the dough all of this will have a stronger base to your crust when it's cooked okay so after that we're ready to add our filling you want to use a few spoonfuls not too much keep it in the center don't bring it towards the edges and then the reason you make the bigger one is you put that on the top so when you seal it it feels really well and it doesn't like explode in the oven or something so you just put it over and kind of fold the edges of both sides and and then once you're done with that you can take a serrated blade and just gently cut a few openings in the pipe definitely excited to get these things out then they're gonna be sick as hell I think then after that it's pretty much ready we can put it over here with the rest okay they're pretty much ready to go in the oven now they look pretty good to me you want to put them in the oven about 425 Fahrenheit and sleep it in for a half an hour but check on it after 20 just in case [Music] do you know that the cannabis use of adults 15 older has now outpaced the growth of use of any other age demographic and they're done look they look pretty awesome like they're fresh out of the drive-thru or something remember they're about 15 milligrams each no when you're dosing but have fun if you're able teen I know I'm going to enjoy thanks a lot take care take care", "hg4hKRdyH24": "hey everyone it's Dorothy from crazy for\ncrust dot com and welcome to my kitchen today I'm going to show you how to make a pie\nthat's a marriage of two of my favorites an apple pie and a pecan pie and it's\nfabulous I know you're gonna love it just as much as we did all right\nso raise your hand if you love apple pie that's me raise your hand if you love\npecan pie that's me to marrying them together lose just the next thing I had\nto do and so that's what I did in this easy pie recipe I combined my favorite\napple pie recipe with my mom's classic pecan pie recipe and made a brand new\nhigh that everyone's gonna love this holiday season you start with three\nlarge eggs to the eggs you're going to add dark corn syrup then you'll add your\nmelted butter granulated sugar salt now for this recipe I add the pecans\ninto the mixture and stir them together because you want the pecans all coated\nwith that nice gooey mixture so they don't burn\nthey put pecans on top of a pie into the oven they're going to burn if they don't\nhave that pecan pie mixture all over the top of them the one thing I don't like\nabout apple pie is when the apples are crisp I like a smooshy apple I don't\nlike to eat apple pie and have the apples bounce back at me so my little\ntip for every apple pie that I think is I cook the apples just a little bit\nbefore I add them to my pie now when you cook your apples you can\njust do it on the stovetop for a few minutes or you can do what I did in this\nrecipe which is just pop them in the microwave with a little bit of water for\nabout three minutes and then they're soft and ready to go into the pie one\ntip when you're making this pie is that apples are pretty wet and so is the\npecan pie mixture so you want to make sure that you drain these apples really\nreally well once you cook them they release some liquid and so you need to\njust put them in a strainer and drain them for several minutes just to make\nsure they're all that excess water is gone once your apples are cooked and\ndrained really well you're going to add some sugar and some\ncinnamon I also add a little bit of cornstarch to\nthe apples so that when the pie cooks any extra moisture gets nice and thick\nand is it runny then you're going to use my all butter pie crust or a\nrefrigerated one and add the apples to the bottom of the pie spread them out\ninto a single layer then pour the pecan pie mixture over the top make sure to\neven it out so the pecans are in a single layer and the pecan pie mixture\nis even throughout the pie a really important step I don't want you to skip\nmake sure you put your pie on a cookie sheet in case it spills over then top it\nwith a pie crust shield and they until it's puffed and golden and that's it\nthat's how you make this dessert mashup pie it's pecan pie and underneath there\nI can see all the apples mmm it smells delicious and I absolutely cannot wait\nto cut into this thanks for watching today be sure to subscribe to my channel\nand eat something sweet", "2_RhQnKNG90": "Greetings my lovelies! Hello, it's Emmy! Welcome back. Today I'm going to be making a giant Oreo cake, but it's gonna be a seasonal take on it: number one being this which I tasted in my live Oreo tasting -- and this is the Limited Edition Apple Pie Oreo. And so this will contain this filling inside of my giant Oreo version. And the second apple pie part will be in the cake. The cake will actually contain a whole apple pie. So the two layers of the Oreo cake will each have an apple pie inside it. And that was inspired by Charles Phoenix's cherpumple cake. Now if you haven't seen the cherpumple, it's amazing. Basically, it's a three-layered cake and each layer of cake contains a pie: a cherry pie, a pumpkin pie and an apple pie -- all stacked up on top of each other; and frosted like a cake, so that when you cut it there are three pies inside it. If you want to see me attempt it let me know in the comments down below. So I've already prepped my cakes -- let me walk you through what I did there. So the first thing I did was I mixed up a boxed cake mix. I prepared it exactly as instructed on the back here. So I added the cake mix; the eggs; the vegetable oil; and the water. Mixed that all up, and then I used these silicone pans and I sprayed these really well with baking spray; then I took about a cup and a half of the cake batter, and poured that into the bottom of the greased mold. And then I took my pies -- I bought these from the bakery section at my local supermarket -- because they were the thinnest pies I could find. If you're using a frozen pie, you want to bake it as instructed and wait for it to completely cool before you place it inside the cake. Okay! So next we're gonna take our pie. We're going to invert it, slide it into our layer of cake batter; squish it down; and then we're gonna add another cup or so of cake batter on top of that. Then do that with the second half. And then bake this as instructed. Place it in an oven at 350 degrees for about twenty-five to twenty-eight minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Let me take our cakes out. We're gonna let them cool on a rack for about 10 or 15 minutes. Then, taking a serrated bread knife, we're gonna even them out a little bit -- cut the top off. And then we're gonna take them out of the mold and let them cool completely before we add our icing layer. And now I'm gonna make the filling. So what I've done here is I've taken an entire pack of Apple Pie Oreos, and I've opened them up.... and I've removed the filling on the inside. I'm gonna combine some store-bought frosting with my Oreo filling. Mmm. It smells like frosting. All right, so I'm gonna go ahead and use the entire jar here -- and I'm gonna combine the apple pie mix...okay. Looks kind of like peanut butter but it doesn't smell like peanut butter -- no it doesn't. It smells like a craft store. Okay, I said craft store. Not crap store. As in the place where you buy pom-poms and glitter. All right. Combine this together. *whispering* I probably should have used a bigger bowl. That's all right.... There is our filling. Now let us assemble the cake. (*English accent*) I've got myself a cake stand. Right. Get my hair out of my face. Place your cake stand on top of this. Quickly flip it. Now we're going to generously slather our filling right on top of that. Now we're going to take our offset spatula and schmear this... Now if you were a pro, you'd probably be piping this, but I'm not pro! Not at all. Boy, that's a lot of frosting! Um... I didn't tell you to go over there. Yup! That's looking pretty even. So, I'm going to use two spatulas. On top... Yessss! It's a little off-center, but you know what? Not pro, right? Except, I want to be pro. Okay, come on. All right. All right. And there is the giant and very heavy Apple Pie Oreo cake. Isn't it magnificent? Alright, we've come to the moment I've been waiting for: I want to cut into this and see my pies hiding inside. I want to make sure I have a very sharp knife. Slices pretty readily. All right, here we go! Aha! There it is! Amazing! Apple pie inside of a cake. Look at this thing. I'm SO glad that this worked! I thought of many different ways of doing this -- I actually thought of doing small homerun pies instead of an entire pie, because I knew that an entire pie would be a little bit too thick but I decided to try it anyways because this cutaway is so much more impressive with a whole pie as opposed to two small pies. So, yay! And here is the pie. Or cake? Pake? And it is falling under its own weight. Let's get a bite with everything: cake, pie crust, frosting, second pie.... Itadakimasu! Boy howdy! Is that ever sweet. It's pretty tasty, though. So that bite tastes just like apple pie: cinnamon-y, sweet, a little crunch of cooked apple, and then, of course, you've got the frosting that we put in there, too, which gives it an injection -- a large injection -- of kind of the artificial apple flavor; but since we cut it with the frosting, it's not as perfume-y and as strong as when you have the Oreo cookie itself. I didn't like that at all: it had ever little lasting floral, perfume-y, scented candle flavor to it. It's here, but it's not as persistent. I like that much better. Let's get a bite on this end here which is more cake.... Mm. Mm-hm. And that's a very different experience -- that's cake and frosting with a little bit of pie crust which you get in terms of texture, but not much flavour. Let's try a middle piece -- I think this part is gonna be the best bite right here. Mm-hm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think this transitional section right here is the best, because you get a little bit of cake; you get a little of the pie. It's not just all pie filling; and it's not all just cake. It definitely feels most Frankenstein-ish right, right there. This is a really fun dessert. I think it would be really great to feed a crowd: there's so much dessert here. And you don't necessarily need the Oreo outside at all. You could just do this with two cake pans, of course. I've only baked with silicone molds a couple of times, and both times I've felt like it imparted a little bit of that silicone plastic flavor to the cake -- at least right on the surface where the cake batter touched the mold. The first time was when I made a giant peanut butter and jelly sandwich cake; and this time; both times I feel like there's a little bit kind of a rubbery taste. Perhaps it's my imagination, but I don't know how else I would have gotten such a complicated shape otherwise -- without using silicone. So there you have it: a giant Apple Pie Oreo cake.

that's in this apple pie is apples cinnamon butter and two frozen pie crusts what do you see how we make this right here oh it's so good well I chose to use Gala apples now for a Washington Apple but they aren't necessarily recommended for apple pie but at three pounds for a dollar forty nine we're using Gala apples now they say that uh because they are so sweet and they're so juicy but they will cook down and when you go to make an apple pie with them you got to worry about the the filling settling down and leaving a big space between your top crust in your and your apples so here's the first step and I'm gonna let them simmer and cook down for a little while get some of the moisture out have to apologize because I got so excited about making these making this apple pie I didn't notice that my camera wasn't recording well you saw that I had to this pot full apple slices and I'll let it simmer for a little while not not a real long time and you basically want your apples to be like translucent or something like a like an onion and what I did then is I poured the excess juice off so all I had then was some real soft apple slices baylin's No then I took cinnamon and I just covered I mean I covered the apples in cinnamon I mean the whole area was covered in cinnamon and then I put about Oh almost a half a cup of butter cuz that's just what I had sitting here well I'm sorry half a stick of butter no hang on man I'll tell you how much I put in there I put a quarter of a cup because a stick a whole stick is a half a cup so I'll put a quarter of a cup of softened butter I say soften just cause to set out on the stove wasn't back in the fridge okay anyway I'll mix them apples up that cinnamon and that butter got out my frozen pie crust that I had let's start falling in the refrigerator then I poured all this concoction in the middle of that apple pie crust and then I put the other frozen pie crust and I ended up having to run some hot water on the on the aluminum to get its turn list oh by the way it isn't really good Oh anyway man just talking about it wants me makes me want to take another bite hmm okay after I put crust over it I went ahead and I rolled the edges of the bottom pie crust I rolled them on up so you see you see aluminum all the way around okay and that helped it bond with the top or the up upper crust now I didn't put any butter on top and I did not add any sugar so these Gala apples are sweet but I did cover the entire thing with aluminum foil and then I baked it in the middle racks 350 degrees for 25 minutes then I took the lumina fall off the top and let it cook for about 10 more minutes I meant to go ahead and raise the temperature but I forgot to so I'll let it cook for about 10 more minutes at 350 then I came in here and I bumped it up for the last 10 minutes at 450 so 25 minutes at 350 remove the aluminum for another 10 minutes at 350 and then another 10 minutes at 450 so 10 10 20 about 40 minutes I took it out I'll set on top stove and let it cool you'll see you'll see [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "y_5fUjFi4e8": "this is called mock apple pie zucchini mark apple pie and you won't believe it but when you make this pie people eat it they think they're eating apple pie i want zucchini i want to try it yeah tell us what you do here all right first of all you have to peel your zucchini you want to get all the seeds out too you don't want any seeds in your apple pie and you can do this however you want to you can do it however you want to just you know that almost has the that has almost the exact consistency it looks as an apple yeah it does it looks like apple you want to get the middle out with the seeds get rid of that i usually do it about like this it's like a little chunk of apple it's like a little chunk of apple and when you really when you feel that consistency it's almost exactly like an apple it is it really is and when you look at it yeah even after it's baked you look at it looks like pieces of apple so about six cups of that you may help you cut some of that out okay they look like little green apples they do they look like apples now what's the next step we need to put in a pan just enough water to barely cover it and boil it until they're just tender you don't want to cook them you don't want to mush them you don't want to mush them just cook them until they're tender then drain them and let them cool that's let them cool and you said if you'd if you didn't let them cool and you went right in they'd get mushy yeah so you do want to make sure that you rinse them or drain them or maybe could you rinse them with cold water i think you could but then you want to drain them really good you don't want them soggy yours is now chilled and it's put into those i mean if you didn't know you'd think it's a piece of apple same consistency yep now what you can do all right now what we need to do is get our uh all of our ingredients together the sugar the spices and so forth i'll put this in here and then we'll put those on top of this yeah mix it all up together tell me what we need and i'll pour it in there ingredients rice all right a cup of sugar a half a cup of brown sugar now we need one and a half teaspoons of cinnamon one and one half teaspoons of cream of tartar cream of tartar now i need two tablespoons of cornstarch smells like apple pie to me mom let's see now we need a half a teaspoon of salt all right now this is all mixed up now the next thing we have to do is get our crust ready because it's all set just like you're doing regular apple pie just like a very good like i said looks like granny smith apples doesn't it and if you don't tell anybody it's zucchini just watch let's trick dad okay now we need to put the top crust over it just trim it off trim off your edge we can take a fork and go around to get it together take this knife and put punch some holes in there so they can kind of breathe after a while now sometimes you can put the butter on top of your zucchini but i like to put the butter on top of the crust all right got your butter out mom how much you need oh just a little bit it's nice and soft a little bit just a little bit across the top well okay that's okay too because butter is good for you oh is it yeah okay they're still popping that's good that's a beautiful sound now just put a little bit of sugar along with the top i like to do it that way for how long 450 for 10 minutes and then you turn it down to 350 and bake it for about 45 minutes [Music] and in just a little while we're going to add some [Music] the moment we've waited for you and do the honors okay i can't wait to try this this is uh you know another way you know like i say so many people get to get that big old zucchini thing i'm gonna throw it over the hill don't throw it over the hill you can use zucchini for so many things it's it's a shame not to use them because we got dad bringing in a little oh there you go good now look at that i dare you just from looks tell the difference now here's the real test you gotta be kidding me it tastes like apple pie doesn't it i like hotel i don't think so either mama it's delicious been making that a long time yeah you didn't tell me sorry about it i might have sent you to your room now i'm really worried that's my mama right there she makes good stuff thank you very much that's a good recipe i did yourself thank you mock apple pie", "XPcTvcgydh4": "best fight forever hi everyone it's chef Alicia and today I'm going to make an apple pie with a crumb topping for you so let's get started with some apples which by the way we picked at an orchard which was really cool so back to the apples I have a few Granny Smith here and a Roma Beauty also I like to use a variety of apples what I make my pie I don't always use these particular kinds but I do always include Granny Smith because they are great for baking apple pie they hold their shape really well and they keep just a tiny bit of crispness and the pie so go ahead and peel all of your apples and then we're going to cut them up start by cutting it in half and then turn it and cut it in half again so that you end up with four equal pieces and then we need to take out that little core that's in the middle right there so there's a really easy way to do this and all you have to do is lay it on your cutting board and cut it off at an angle so there's one of them and I'm going to show you one more time just like that cut it at an angle and remove that little core once you get all of the cores removed slice your Apple into quarter inch thick slices try to get them as even as you can they should look about like this and you want them even so that when you bake them they bake evenly and we're looking to have five cups of sliced apples when you're all done now we're going to move on to our filling and we're going to start with a half a cup of sugar and I have my little helper helping me thank you and one teaspoon of cinnamon along with one quarter of a cup of AP flour that's the all-purpose flour okay thank you helper bye-bye we'll see you later and now I'm going to stir those ingredients up until they're nice and combined we want them to be evenly combined so that when we sprinkle them over the apples you don't get like one very sugary apple and then one real flowery apple so stir those ingredients together and then sprinkle them over top of your sliced apples after you sprinkle them over top of your sliced apples stir up the apples and make sure that you're stirring kind of from the bottom because that flour and sugar it kind of likes to find its way into the bottom of the bowl and then when you go to add your apples into your pan you're going to have this big pile of flour that's going to be on top so just stir from the bottom next we're going to make the topping so I have a new little helper and we're going to start with a half of a cup of brown sugar and the next thing that we are going to measure is going to be one cup of AP flour and we are just going to add that and right on top of the brown sugar and again this is for our crumb topping that's what we're making next is one teaspoon of cinnamon and you can adjust the spices to your own flavor but I like mine spicy so we're also going to add 3/4 of a teaspoon of nutmeg along with 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom which happens to be one of my very favorite spices in the world and thank you very much little helper ok so now we are going to stir that up again so that we have an even consistency and if you have any little brown sugar lumps in there just kind of mash them down with your spoon it's not a good thing to have the lumps in there to this I'm adding 1/2 of a cup of butter and I slice this into slices before I dump it into the bowl just to kind of make it easier to work with and then I'm going to stir it a little to give it a coat of flour and I'm using a fork here which is just fine but if you have a pastry blender that'll work even better I happen to be on vacation in a hotel right now so believe it or not I did not pack my pastry blender go figure so I'm using a fork it's cool but this is the consistency that we're looking for it should kind of be like cornmeal with big chunks of butter covered in goodness so like pea sized chunks the next thing that I'm doing is I'm adding my apples into my pie crust and this pie crust happens to be a store-bought one which I usually make them homemade but again at a hotel and I didn't bring my rolling pin so I'm using a store-bought one and this is a pretty yummy one anyway but anyway I'm just kind of pushing my apples down in their little you don't want to pack them in really tight they do need some air space to cook into steam and their liquids going to kind of come out of them but you also don't want to have a lot of holes like big air spaces because those are places where your pie can kind of collapse and then it doesn't look as pretty when it's done you get like the dents on the top of your pie and it's just not a very pretty thing so I'm just kind of filling in the little holes you can see me I'm a little bit crazy I guess when it comes to this but go through place your apples and I normally bake with a nine inch deep shell when I'm at home so this is kind of going to be a nice big mound of apples on top which is very delicious and it's fine and we're going to make it work so I'm going to pile my apples right on top and a nice little mound don't they look delicious and then we're going to put that beautiful crumb topping right on top so I'm just going to be kind of careful here because like I said I do have a nice little mound of apples going on but they are going to cook down nobody worried about my apple pie it's going to be gorgeous and I'm just going to gently place this crumb topping using my hand and kind of slowly going instead of just dumping it all on the top and once I get it all settled on there I'm going to bake it at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 45 minutes to an hour so there it is ready to go in the oven and there it is out of the oven and there it is ready to eat and just for fun here are a couple more pictures from the apple orchard we had a really great day if you would like this recipe or any of my others you can visit me at best bites forever.com thank you so much for

this must feel like this feel I got that's on the bottom oh I don't know how that was supposed just cut this and then we'll stick that on yeah oh I see white look at the picture yeah on the bottom okay the graham crackers supposed to be on the bottom so that's how we'll try it says apple pie Center in milk chocolate and graham cracker candy bar maybe so the graham cracker that is on the bottom you'll probably be able to get three or four I would think we want to make sure we get a piece of graham cracker on the bottom this people they get burbank Ashley wants to try the okay I'm taste the pasta box even parts are tuna like the texture that whatever that Center is it's a nugget or whatever it's grainy like sugar in your teeth your teeth have something to bite down into but then you get the crispness of the it is but I would that is yeah it's broken but they don't stick to latest home pumpkin pie Center in milk chocolate and graham cracker candy bar and you love pumpkin pie it's good but I don't think it's pumpkin power more one nutmeg flavor it's good but I don't taste pumpkin I get a little of it I guess like you I get it's a spice cake yeah come on it tastes like spice cake but then it's delicious it's very good once again it has that texture your chocolate crunch it is very sweet just like the super yeah the compact Center in milk chocolate with pecans and graham cracker candy bar it looks amazing that's why it has more calories because of all that's on it yes and actually ashlynn wants to try this but I want her to try it the way it's supposed to be with the graham cracker on the bottom that is so good that probably takes more bother than any of the rest of them taste and it tastes like Pathan no that is I would eat that all day long really yes now the texture this is a little creamier it all smoother than the other ones have those granulated sugar pieces this one does not necessarily have that but super super sweet tastes just like the ends out of a polymer compound yes it's good yeah that's delicious and the nuts it would be the same thing without them no no that is a very good it's good that's surprises me cuz I wouldn't have thought that the Apple would have been my favorite but I think the Apple out of the three the Apple was the best even though didn't taste like happening um no but it it had a really really good Club right there was an apple a little bit there were mine it tastes like an apple pie it's good enough to know but don't think you're getting a big hunka happen because you're not right but definitely worth a dollar 49 I think I know that's a little high for a candy bar but this is really good chocolate and super sweet and once you eat one of these yeah you're doing right you'll be finished yeah so that was very very good no thanks for watching", "5v_PLvtrOC4": "hey how's it going welcome to another episode of rock kitchen today i'm going to be cooking some leftovers now how to repurpose food from yesterday and make it into a new meal is one of the number one skills that you need to have in order to be a real chef how can you repurpose this food or use every part of that animal or make a new dish from a dish that you made yesterday you just don't put leftovers on the plate and serve them up again it's never going to taste the same it's the first day you cook that meal with that being said now the leftovers i'm going to use today came from the gingerbread that i boiled back when i did the cajun turkey and baked turkey and pineapple video so i have all the fruit that i put in that pot i made three batches i made one with peaches or just pineapples and i wanted one with grapefruit so i did it in layers i made the first one pineapple then i added the grapefruit made the second batch and then to the pineapple and the grapefruit i added a can of peaches and then i put another thing ginger in i made the third gallon so i mean three gallons so now i have all of this ginger grapefruit pineapples or i mean uh not oranges peaches sitting here from that day um the ginger and the sugar kind of pickled them so they just like sweet ginger filled and delicious what can i do with this pile of fruit i don't want to throw it away it's been sitting in the refrigerator for about a week or two and it tastes just the same as they did on day one i said maybe i should blend all of this down and make a pie now let's give it a shot [Music] me [Music] [Music] me [Music] blackfoot [Music] is [Music] hmm [Music] is [Music] i'll be [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Music] 75 oh [Music] [Music] all right we all set now i waited for about four hours let it sit on the stove so i can cool down cut the oven off put a little screen on it on top of it so the heat can escape [Music] the pie is ready put it in the refrigerator overnight after it cooled down so we can come back tomorrow because it got kind of late waiting for it to cool down so now let's check it out let's get it outside of this see how it came out [Music] [Music] oh [Music] real with me [Music] [Music] you can see both the layers inside the pot so i've never seen anyone do a two layer pie i wanted to make it three layer but um i changed my mind at the last second let's give it a taste it's very delicious now i didn't have to put that much sugar in it because the ginger mix already was boiled in with sugar so that provided the sweetness but you can make a two-layer pot just like you would any other pie with the normal ingredients but just put it in layers do two thin layers three thin layers or whatever it tastes very delicious and paired on the side if i had some rum raisin ice cream it's my favorite ice cream but like this video leave a comment subscribe to the channel and check out the merchandise page thank you see you next time [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "MBo5w-RegxE": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] you", "E8XXrTbaymU": "hey guys so today's video i'm going to be teaching you how to make this delicious apple pie i really hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you do make sure to give it a thumbs up before you go and please subscribe to my channel also make sure to follow me on instagram that is linked in the description along with my tick tock so without further ado let's just get on with the video first off in a large pot you want to add your lemon juice and lemon zest then moving on to the apples i use i use gala granny smith and honey crisp then um once you have all your apples together i'm using 11 apples by the way that's what how many you're going to need and you just want to peel them um preferably with the apple peeler because that will make things a hundred times easier but i forgot i didn't have one so i just used a knife um so peel your apples and then you want to cut and core them and you can slice them into however thickness you want so mines are kind of thin i would say um and i used a mandolin for mine it's definitely not necessary and i don't think it made the process any faster but that's what i used [Music] then as you cut and core each apple you want to add that to your pot with the lemon juice and lemon zest and you just want to cover that with the lemon juice the lemon juice just so it will help the apples from browning and by the way the pot is off so do not turn it on it is off the entire time um obviously you can see i switched to a bigger pot because the cast-iron one was not big enough so i switched um to every pot and then i added in all of my sugars and at this point you want to turn the heat on to medium-high heat and be careful not to turn it too high mine was slightly too high because the bottom part of my pan got a little bit burnt but um it was fine it wasn't too bad um then you just want to add in your flour and you want to mix all of your ingredients and very well make sure you're getting all the apples covered with what you're putting in there then you want to add your cinnamon nutmeg in your cardamom and sprinkle that in there and just mix that nice and well and again make sure you're incorporating all the apples with this spice mix [Music] then you want to put a lid on this and let this sit for 20 minutes and make sure you are checking i would say every five minutes and mix it up just so you um the apples aren't getting stuck at the bottom and you know all the apples are getting mixed around so make sure to do that and this is what it looks like after 20 minutes then we're going to transfer the apples onto a baking sheet um and we're just going to spread them out i used two baking sheets but i only show you guys me putting it on one and then once you finish doing that you want to set in the fridge for 20 minutes or into a cold while we prepare the dough moving on to the dough in a medium size bowl you want to add your flour your sugar and your salt and you just want to whisk this until other ingredients are incorporated [Music] then you want to add in your cube coat butter and you just want to mix this until it's nice and combined and if you have a pastry cutter i recommend you guys use that but i didn't have one so at first i used the back of a fork and then that was not getting me anywhere so i ended up using my hands then in a small bowl you want to add 1 4 cup of cold water and then 2 tablespoons of an egg then you just want to mix this until it's nice and combined and then i made a small well in my flour mixture and i just pour in my egg and water mixture and mix this with a rubber spatula until it's combined and as you can see the dough was not coming together so i added a couple more tablespoons of water until the dough was forming so if your dough doesn't come together just add a couple tablespoons of water at a time make sure you don't overdo it so your dough doesn't end up too sticky so make sure you just do it a little bit at a time and watch the dough come together and then stop and also make sure to not over knead it [Music] do then you want to cut your dough in half and cover each one with plastic wrap and then set it in the fridge for 30 minutes [Music] once your dough has finished setting for 30 minutes you can now start rolling out your dough [Music] and i am using a 10-inch pie pan and i got this from target and i sprayed the inside with some olive oil spray just so the pie crust wouldn't stick [Music] once i place my dough in the pan i make sure it was nice and smooth against the pie pan and there was no holes or bubbles or anything like that then i used a pair of scissors to trim around the edges of the pie pan and then i went back again and trimmed it to the size of the pan [Music] and i don't know if you guys noticed but the pie pan does have like little crimps in it so i just use my finger to help find it and made some crimps on the outside of my pie dough [Music] so then you can add your cold apples to your pie pan and i didn't end up using all of this mixture i would say i probably had a half a cup of the apple pie mixture left over and i forgot to do this but if you want you if you have like a muffin pan you can use the excess pie dough and like fill it up with the muffin pan with the pie dough and add um your filling to that and make mini like pies but i completely forgot to do that actually i think i still can i might do that that's actually a good idea um so yeah [Music] once you're finished filling your pie you can now start rolling out some more dough for the lattice on top or you can do a fully covered pie as well but i'm doing lettuce so yeah [Music] so [Music] uh to [Music] now you want to place the pot in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes and while that's in the fridge place a baking sheet in the center rack of your oven and preheat the 425 and let heat up for 20 to 25 minutes and make sure the baking sheet gets really hot once your pie has finished setting in the fridge you now want to add your egg wash over top and make sure you don't be shy with this because this is going to help with the browning and stuff um i still i feel like i did miss a couple spots of the pie so make sure you guys pay attention and that there is no dry spots because egg wash will really give it that nice golden brown color and also this is optional you can just also sprinkle the top with some cane sugar now you can just place the chill pot on the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 15 minutes now we're going to make this little foil contraption to help stop the pie from bounding too much so first you want to create a foil sheet that's the same length of your pie then you want to fold in half fold it in half again then at the corner you want to make a half circle so when you open it it would be a full circle mine's just more for oval but you get the idea it worked the same once your pie has been in the oven for 15 minutes you want to take it out and cover it with the foil circle thing we made and you want to turn the heat down to 350 and bake it for 40 to 45 minutes [Music] and after it's come off the oven you want to let it well the direction says to let it sit for four hours but i only let mine sit for two basically you're just waiting for all the juices to set so basically whenever that is for you but like i said i only needed two hours for mine so i don't know you can kind of just keep an eye on it and try to see when it will be ready and that is today's finished recipe this apple pie was very delicious if i was to change some things i would make the crust a little bit thicker because i feel like i wanted more of the taste this pie has a lot of apples i don't know if you guys noticed but it definitely has more apples than like a regular apple pie which is very delicious and i really like but for that reason i wish i made the crust a little bit thicker and maybe a little bit more lattice on top just so i can have more of the crust but yeah nonetheless it was very delicious and it is a very sweet pie i will tell you that if you guys don't really like really sweet things i would say to cut back on the sugar maybe half or like a little bit less than what it already is but i don't know that's up to you just letting you guys know but it was definitely delicious and something i would make again um but you guys enjoyed today's video make sure to give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel

Cochran hired his mom and sister as dessert\nchefs. Using mom's original recipe, they created\nthe fried turnover-style apple pies fans know and love. They soon became so popular, the family had\nto bring in a corporate supplier, and by 1968 the apple pie had been added to the official\nMcDonald's menu. Everything was chugging along fine for McDonald's\nhot apple pie until the early '90s. Then, on one earth-shaking day in 1992, McDonald's\nstopped deep-frying its apple pies and began baking them instead. Fan reaction was\u2026 predictable. \u201cah.\u201d Over a quarter of a century later, devotees\nof the fried apple pie are still grumbling, creating internet petitions to try and Make\nAmerica's Apple Pies Great Again. That kind of demand even led to black market\napple pies being offered, with one L.A. chef even cutting a deal with McDonald's former\npie supplier to produce what he called \"Throwback Apple Pies.\" So did McDonald's learn their lesson? Apparently not, because in 2018, McDonald's\nchanged the recipe yet again in another apparent attempt to produce a healthier dessert option. The Twitter outrage was palpable. One user tweeted, \"McDonald's changed their apple pie crust\n& we should be rioting in the streets.\" While another added, \"Where's the green box? Where's the apple PIE?!! The Franken-Strudel you have offered 2 nite\nis yet another example of big business sticking it to the common man!!\" In other words, if you are lucky enough to\never find an original McDonald's Apple Pie, don't waste it by throwing it at Nic Cage. \"I have to see my kid with pie on me man? See how this s--- looks on you!\u201d \u201cNo man.\" Before McDonald's recent change, the apple\npie filling used to be a gooey mix of diced apples, which could be from anywhere: Italy,\nNew Zealand, an enchanted forest, etc. Now, however, McDonalds has pledged to use\nonly fresh, home-grown apples. Specifically, the franchise will offer pies\nmade from six types of apples: Golden Delicious, Jonagold, Rome, Gala, Idared, and Fuji. A McDonald's spokesperson explained, \"Our new freshly baked Apple pie recipe is\nin line with other positive changes we have made. We removed, for example, artificial preservatives\nfrom our Chicken McNuggets and switched to real butter in our breakfast sandwiches because\nthose changes matter to our guests.\" In addition to apples, the company has experimented\nwith more than 40 different fillings and seasonal flavors in pies over the last half century\nin the U.S. and beyond. Most famous, of course, is the cherry pie,\nbut they also have been known to cough up seasonal flavors like pumpkin pie, as well\nas all sorts of rando types like strawberry and creme, pineapple, and blueberry. And that's just in the U.S. Overseas, you can find variants like Australia's\nHot Chocolate Pie, China's Taro Pie, Thailand's Corn Pie, and Japan's Bacon and Potato Pie. Yum? Given the success McDonald's had with their\napple pie, it's no surprise lots of other fast food chains have copied them. But how do their pies stack up? Let's start with Burger King's Dutch apple\npie: Unlike the McDonald's apple pie ,which is really a turnover, Burger King's dutch\napple pie is an actual slice of actual pie. It's less portable as a result, but it's also\nmore\u2026 pie. How about Taco Bell's caramel apple empanada? It's a pastry pocket of diced apples and brown\nsugar, and a little stingy on apples, but it gets bonus points for being only $1. Popeye's cinnamon apple pie is a turnover\ncovered in a blanket of cinnamon, so that's great if you happen to be really into cinnamon. At 430 calories, Arby's apple turnover is\nthe most caloric of all these pies. However, it also comes with the flakiest crust\nand a drizzle of vanilla icing. \"Arby's: technically, it's food.\" In 1971, McDonald's introduced McDonaldland,\na magical fairytale world where McDonald's characters like The Hamburglar and Mayor McCheese\nromped around. And the pre-eminent flora in this wonderland? The Apple Pie Tree, which skipped the middleman\nby growing fully cooked pies rather than boring old apples. Sadly, McDonaldland was essentially razed\nby the early 2000's in the name of progress, but wayward Apple Pie Trees may still exist\nin the wild, haunting older restaurants as you devour the fruits of its imaginary branches.", "ADgpI7D2XcY": "Today we're making apple maple pie [ music ] Come on in.\nWelcome to my home. This is a take on a traditional apple pie In fact this is a take on a really old-fashioned version of an apple pie. Super simple we are using things that we have either made before , or we've used them to make other things I have a pie shell. Which if you want to learn how to make your own pie shell or pie crust. Hit that \"i\" in the sky, it will take you to the day\nwhere we make the pie crust. You can purchase a pie crust you can get your\npie crust however. This does not need to be pre baked it will bake when we bake\nthe pie so so simple when Stressless super, super, super simple. Then the next thing that we are going to use oh we're going to come to that but It is oh we're\ngonna use the apples from our Apple infused vodka, If you want to learn how to make apple infused vodka hit that \"i\" in the sky. If you do not have apples\nfrom Apple and fit from Apple infused vodka, You can just use regular apples and mine are going to be cut up pretty big, Simply because my family wanted them that way, I don't know it's their choice I'm not an apple pie fan oddly enough. So, but we are going to do thi. We're going to start off with our butter remember like I said, all the ingredients are listed down below You can also check out my Patreon, which will take you to a place where you could actually then just get a copy of this and just copy it over it's really simple I'm going to put my butter, and my flour into a saucepan. Take that over to the stove and melt it down\nuntil it becomes a paste. Once it is a paste we will add the maple syrup and the water. Bring that up to a boil and reduce it to a simmer We'll simmer that for a few minutes about 3 to 5 minutes until it thickens up just a bit Our mixture is now simmering So what I'm going to do quickly this is about a cup and a half of those vodka apples. So the apples from the apple vodka if you don't have those you're just going to go with these straight apples. I'm mixing that in with Granny Smiths This is gonna be so good I'm going to  toss these around. to combine them I have way more apples than I need and I realize that. Then, I'm going to put the apples into my pie shell Like I said I have way more apples than I needed. I'll probably regret piling it up this high I haven't haven't regretted it so far but probably will this time. Now. I know I did a super, super, super, super, super rough lattice. For this. Super rough I'm going to top my pie with my lattice Oh wow. That worked out way way better than I thought it would If you are thinking about doing this without the lattice on top DON'T! Don't do that You need the lattice I'm just tucking the edges in, and putting a few edges where they need to be I have my oven preheated at 425 degrees I know that seems really high but there's a reason for it All right this is going to seem crazy. You're going to pour the caramel over top of this. Nice and slow you want to make sure that it gets into\nall of those nooks and crannies. And hopefully doesn't run over. Now you can see why I put in the tray underneath yes I am taking the time to make sure\nthat it really does get it down in there I'm going to take this over to the oven\nand bake it for 15 minutes After 15 minutes I'm going to turn it down to 350 degrees and then bake it for another 35 to 45 minutes or until the apples are nice and soft. All right our pie has been in for about an hour I'm gonna have my tasters test this, because as I said before I am not an apple pie fan. I mean everybody who knows me actually was amazed that I made an apple pie okay so I'm officially back from my tasters and they said it was really good, so yes, This was super simple to make I'm actually surprised That it worked out as well as it did. because like I said I'm not a pie person. So this one was way out of it for me but it was a request from my family so I thought I would let them taste it\nand of course nobody wants to be on camera but according to them this is really good It's super easy to make like super super simple to make And if you make this let me know how your experience comes out with this. So that can you know get ideas on this one this was really fun to make I liked the whole crust of the whole caramel on top of it I had never seen that before I've made apple pies before but this is the first time I've seen the old-fashioned caramel on top, so that was a lot of fun to make if you have a request that you'd like to\nsee me make let me know down in the comments don't forget to check out my Patreon because that's how I can make these things which I  myself wouldn't necessary I can make them through the support of\npatreon and at patreon you also get a You also get the recipe that you can copy over and save for yourself. but this is so much fun and I\nhope we get to see you in again next time. Don't forget to check out these\nrecipes I picked out just for you.

600 by today and Matthew and Martha Barlow over at Pablo barbecue theme for today is or for the collaboration as what favorite thing would you do with the fall apples and I actually know what they're making because we talked about it and I'm not making the same I'm making an apple pie so I was thinking what recipe should I follow so I asked my wife and she said well why don't they just help you know here she is welcome hello I'm Elena and today we're going to show you how to make a mint apple pie okay so let us bring you in and show you what we've got okay so I'm gonna start off by removing all the leaves from the herbs and chopping them we're not gonna use the stems and for the pie we need witness so I will start by peeling and removing the course okay let's go so the herbs are chopped and now we just need to butter the form and start cutting up the apples just gonna loose a little bit of butter this is to make the pie let go a little bit easier once we're done we're gonna build this pie with the abbot's on the bottom and the rest on top so there we go [Music] and there we are so the APUs don't really need to be arranged because they're gonna break down when we cook this and I'm gonna put the herbs on top of there while Hannah is showing you how to make the crumble and first we take butter and then the flour and you mix it up and then then you add this sugar nice 1 cup of sugar coming up or thank you take a little bit at a time and work it in there yeah cleanup crew and then you add the salt okay half a teaspoon of salt and then maybe I should have the Tabasco at this point okay no hot sauce for this one and we will not make it on the smoker and the last thing we add is the oatmeal that's two ounces of oatmeal just like so and it's at this point you need some shoulder massage like that and now we just have to add it to the pie we're gonna bake this at 175 Celsius or 350 Fahrenheit and it's gonna be in there for 4 to 5 minutes at least until it's turned golden and then we're gonna enjoy this and you're just get to watch sorry so time to do that but before you do that don't forget to put on the thyroid oh yeah forgot about that so I don't know if you followed but it says apple pie made by Helena unless I anyway see you in 45 minutes okay I just heard a timer and so I think it's time to get it out I don't know would you like to check if it's done I think it looks lovely you should smell that the mint and the lemon balm it's really really smells nice now I just need to cool down a little bit and then we're gonna bring you in for a taste test there we go the pies done and we're gonna serve it with a little bit of vanilla cream and that's basically whipped cream with a little bit of vanilla extract in it and I think it's gonna go really well with the other taste right we just have to try it - no I think that Helen actually knows the pie is still warm but not hot time to taste it there you go thank you I want a little piece of this as well I think I need to take that okay I told you before you eat pie and ice cream with a small spoon and really it this tastes the way up a punch of taste with a little bit of mint in it mm-hmm we got a little bit ago so we're gonna enjoyed this I hope you're gonna enjoy your day as well thank you for watching bye", "2xbWaBe-_hk": "i'm emily osterberg founder of baking betty's here at the mall of america in bloomington minnesota and we use premier's new edible ink printer eddie for printing all our logo cookies baking buddies i started it in california i love to bake growing up and i just i would bring cookies to work and i thought hey what a great idea i should start a business doing cookies even though i've never worked in food before so i started doing wholesale and stuff like that and i started out with one cookie flavor now we have 26 different flavors and i moved back to minnesota a year ago and opened at the mall of america where we are today so we were getting a ton of requests to do custom logo cookies custom images on cookies prior to using the eddie we used these edible frosting sheets where you had to print individually and you had to peel them off one by one i was trying to you know research different products and try different products to you know find the the best solution for us with the eddie it just is a better quality product it saves us a ton of time because you're actually printing right to the cookie the turnaround time to package is just it's huge for us it definitely helps that it's nsf certified because we're supposed to only use nsf certified products with food it's very important that it's a stainless steel a food grade printer just it's very easy to use so you can just pop the cookies right onto the eddy take them off it's easy to clean it's just a very seamless process it just prints i mean it looks like literally it just printed off of a printer you would never be able to tell that this is you know printed on an edible you know with edible ink on a cookie like it just the quality of it is just so amazing recently we did a project for 800 of the logo cookies and we used eddie for the first time with that large of a project and it went super smooth such an amazing process every single cookie all 800 looked exactly the same the images were crisp and perfect the eddie has been amazing for us with these large orders i feel like anybody could learn how to use the eddie printer in a matter of like a day so it was very very easy seamless process i think the biggest thing was just adjusting like the cookie size and making sure you have the icing right and once you got that down i think it's pretty quick and easy so it just creates an all-around better product for the customer and saves us a lot of time", "mhpA3ujw2bw": "historically Theodore Bailey the first settler on the mountain homesteader to the property he planted all of the fruit trees that are on the property this variety is called a bell Apple it is one of the oldest apple trees in America these trees were brought from another continent through Thomas Jefferson to the east coast where the Bailey family originated brought across the country in order to plant at his new homestead this is one of those apples the bell Apple is a cousin to a granny smith apple this Apple is a perfect baking apple so what we're going to do is pick a few apples go inside and make some apple pie filling we go look at all the apples we have this is going to be great today we're making apple preserves your end result will look something like this and they will be put into these quart size jars so let's get started this is like a granny smith apple it's firm and it's a little bit tart it bakes really well in a pie or preserve so this is the Apple you want to shoot a nice firm green is preferable so all you need to do this our apples cinnamon vanilla a little bit of brown sugar and the thinking of that I've chosen is some cornstarch and that's all we need to take our granny smith apple our Bell apple and we're going to use an apple peeler today if you don't have one you can simply peel your Apple take the core out it's the same thing this just makes the work a little bit easier this peels and colors the apple forest which saves a lot of time what you're going to do is slice and pour your apples whether by hand or on an apple peeler it doesn't matter an apple peeler cups them all into nice little uniform pieces but again slicing and chopping does it matter it's what you eat it count is in there the core takes the middle out so it saves that work for you and then all your little piece is going then we take about a tablespoon of cornstarch and you sprinkle that on to your apple mixture i like to use brown sugar when you use brown sugar and butter in an apple mixture it makes a caramel type tasty filling which is really delicious so I'm going to use my brown sugar I'm going to take about a half a cup because these apples are very tasty you put that into your apples with your corn starch cinnamon to taste like to get a nice coating till I can smell it and then my homemade vanilla and you're just going to add a couple tablespoons of this as well to give that nice aromatic smell when you start baby then I take my albums that have been coated with all the things I showed you and you're just going to toss that lightly in a bowl until everything is covered then you take your mixture you would put it into a pot on the stove and you would start cooking it until your corn starch thickens like pudding once your to that stage you're done you can remove it from the fire and just let it set and there are some tips on making apple pie ice cream topping preserves for more recipes like these go to Bailey's palmar resort

video for today man today i'm going to be giving you guys a quick review on this limited edition apple pie kitkat man so make sure you guys read comment if you're new hit that subscribe button for your boy and make sure you're dead now let me tell ya this [ __ ] right here man this [ __ ] was hard to find i went to like six seven eight nine stores man ten stores man i could not find this [ __ ] but then i ended up going to walmart walmart had this [ __ ] i had to ask the lady at the front at the self checkout i was like hey you know anything about that exclusive kitkat she was like which one because you know they got like that mint one they got the damn birthday cake and then they got this one i was like i think it's like apple pie or some [ __ ] she was like oh yeah it's right over here so she just like took me to it and pointed at it and i grabbed a couple of them because it was a couple there and that [ __ ] was kind of triggering because i was looking all around for these shits i probably spent like like eight nine ten hours looking for these damn things bruh i thought the pack was white for some reason but not it was yellow and my first impression is yeah apple pie all i can think about is ice cream as you can see they got a little ice cream on top of the apple pie right there on the little picture and that's all i was thinking about when i was thinking about this [ __ ] was [ __ ] apple pie ice cream this thing right here got 20 grams of sugar with 17 grams included added sugar so 34 total sugar in this thing 220 calories as you can see on the package and it's got a whole bunch of carbs about 27 grams of carbs oh okay god damn 40 grams of sodium 2 grams of protein that's all right i mean you know kitkat i don't think it's too healthy for you but it's all right to treat yourself wow this [ __ ] almost smells like froot loop cereal this [ __ ] almost smells nasty like it smells like a knockoff apple pie uh they're pretty durable so you feel me they use the same kitkat formula whoa what the [ __ ] that's something i never tasted before it tastes like apple pie a bit yeah it tastes like apple pie but it's almost reminding me of something else i just can't call it it's not super sweet when you first bite into it but when you start to bite in more into it it tastes a little sweeter than you get like a little different taste that you haven't tasted before and i'm guessing that's the the apple pie like it's almost like you're really biting biting into apple pie like when you get into the middle of the apple pie like the most apples taste that you can taste as well as sweetness it's like real apple pie almost i don't know man i don't know it's like they executed the exterior and then the interior is questionable the inside is where it gets tricky i don't know if i like that i don't think this is something that i'll be picking up it tastes like something else i just can't think remember those apple suckers with the [ __ ] with the caramel on top and then the other side was green when you sucked all the caramel off or whatever that's kind of what this tastes like i think that's what i'm thinking about a hint of caramel [ __ ] what the [ __ ] i'm just trying this for y'all man i'm trying to understand what's going on here do i like this or not and answering my mind is definitely hell no this [ __ ] ain't it adam but i could see some sick people liking this [ __ ] this is nasty i can't just i gotta go i cannot i cannot yeah i'm high as [ __ ] but after i start thinking about it and i start really tasting it this ain't it nah man this this right here loki makes all the other kit-kats disgusting kind of like this ain't it for me bro i don't like this one at all this [ __ ] is [ __ ] nasty it almost tastes like a medicine stick but [ __ ] i think i was too high that kind of [ __ ] me up so i kept going but i had to understand where it was coming from now that i understand where it's coming from i don't think i can [ __ ] with this kitkat and i don't think i want to [ __ ] with kitkat for a minute because this threw me off this is kind of extremely nasty i can't if i had to rate this kitkat on a scale from zero out of 10 man i

Hinda and welcome to a new bacon video on cooking fantasies if you are new to my channel I post about one video a week so far only bacon but I will also be doing cooking videos soon so make sure you subscribe to my channel and let's get to it in today's video we'll be celebrating autumn with a delicious apple pie we'll make a base off pad Sucre or sweet shortcrust pastry we will fill it with apples and raisins and we'll be adding a crunchy top layer made of almond flakes and honey so make sure to watch till the end for all the tips and instructions you need to realize this delicious pie for all the ingredients in grams and cups measurements I will leave you down below in the description box and let's get baking so first we will prepare the sweet shortcrust pastry very basic and very easy mix all the dry ingredients together sift the flour the powdered sugar then add the salt and the almond powder and give them a quick whisk to mix everything together and now grace the butter directly into the dry ingredients and it should be very cold and right out of the fridge and it's better to cut it into pieces this way it one means in your fingers while writing it and finally add the egg and use all your finger tips to work the dry ingredients into the butter softly and gently and try to use only the finger tips and not to overwork the dough as soon as it starts holding together and you don't have any crumbs left it means it's already ready now wrap it in a food-safe plastic wrap and place it in the fridge for at least half an hour or up to three hours the longer the better and let's prepare the apple filling and for this pea core and cut the apples into thin slices I used Gala apples but there is no rule you can basically use whatever kind of apples you prefer all apple sister and of course keep adding some lemon juice to prevent them from turning brown until you have all the apples ready in a pan or saucepan with a thick bottom on a medium heat at the butter sugar vanilla extract and the raisins and keep stirring until the butter melts totally and then allow to simmer for a further minute [Music] now add the sliced apples and the cinnamon and allow them to cook on medium to low heat for another five to six minutes until they're tender but still not breaking apart [Music] and now we go back to the sweet shortcrust pastry so take about the two thirds from the dough and roll it out between two pieces of parchment paper and you can of course test with flowers needed to prevent it from sticking and the colder the dough the easier it will be to work with it I used a 23 centimeters that's nine inches springform pan you can also use a twenty centimeter springform pan that's about seven point eight inches and I layer the bottom with parchment paper so [Music] flip the dough into the springform pan and press it against the sides and the corners and the point is to try to touch it as less as possible and then proceed as you see in the video to add the side just make sure to even it out and using the parchment paper will afford you the butter melting and sticking to your hands and you can use the back of a small spoon to push the edges slightly back then pierce it with a fork and bake it for 10 minutes in 170 degrees Celsius that's 338 Fahrenheit preheated oven with only bottom heat on and as soon as you take it out of the oven use the back of the spoon to push it back against the pan for a more even finish and now sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon bread crumbs before you add the apple filling the bread crumbs will absorb the extra moist and aloe the crust to stay crunchy and as you can see the apple slices are quite tender and well infused with the butter and cinnamon now put the same pan again on the medium heat and add the sugar the milk and honey and keep stirring till the sugar melts then add the almond flakes [Music] and if you prefer to you can add a handful of chopped nuts at this point as soon as you take it out of the heat sprinkle the field again with some breadcrumbs and then spread the almonds and honey mixture on top and finally bake your pie for 40 minutes in 170 degrees Celsius that's 338 Fahrenheit till golden brown if the pie gets brown before the time is over cover it with aluminium foil and finish baking so that it doesn't burn from the top and once out of the oven allow it to totally cool for at least one hour before attempting to open the springform when still warm the shortcrust pastry is still very fragile and would easily break finally - with some powdered sugar and it's ready to enjoy this pie is one of my favorite autumn trees it's very delicious you must try it it also goes well with walnuts and pecans so if you like those don't hesitate to add some I hope you

cups of granulated sugar 2 teaspoons of baking powder half a teaspoon of salt and lastly 1 cup of chocolate chips let's get to making some muffins the first thing you want to do is preheat your oven to 375 degrees [Music] the first thing we want to do is add all our dry ingredients to the mixer so i'm gonna add the flour the sugar two teaspoons of baking powder half a teaspoon of salt and then we are going to mix that up [Music] once you're done combining your dry ingredients then it's time to add your wet ingredients the first thing i'm going to add is the melted can of butter [Music] the vanilla and the two large eggs and mix those ingredients well [Music] once you've mixed that well you can add your cup of chocolate chips [Music] and our muffin batter is done before we fill our muffin pan with our batter we need to prepare the pan and what better way to prepare it than using more peanut butter i'm going to use a tablespoon of melted can of butter and i'm going to brush that all over each of the muffin tins now that our muffin pan is prepared it is time to add the batter to each of the tins all right we're going to place these in the oven for 20 minutes what just had a thought i think once the muffins are about halfway done baking i'm going to add on top a little bit of sugar and brown sugar just to give it a little bit of extra sweetness we're trying to hide that wheaty taste as much as possible so little sugar topping to it these are our cannabis infused chocolate chip muffins yes i went a little bit ham on the sugar topping but i'm gonna let these cool for about probably 10 minutes and then we'll try one all right you guys i'm back i've been waiting over these muffins waiting on them and i think they're ready i think they're ready i think they're ready okay so i'm so excited i have a nice glass of milk let's get one of these muffins out and try one first things first the can of butter worked really well at acting as a non-stick like type spray because it came out all in one piece like this is the most perfect little [Music] it smells a little weedy i'm not gonna lie when we were baking it it didn't smell at all but like now that it's actually in my hand i can definitely smell the candy butter which is [Music] um it's not the best it doesn't taste the best it's not the best tasting on a scale of one to ten i'd give it probably like a a six it's edible oh my god it looks green [Music] look at that it literally looks like lime green inside of the muffin from the can of butter and the taste is just like it's just so off it has like such a strong wheaty taste but you guys know i'm gonna still eat it so that i can give you guys a report on how did it make me feel i both said from the big bite that i had at first it just kind of felt like a walk on my stomach which is more like how edibles feel when i'm like this is gonna like slam me adding that sugar on top that was a good choice [Music] because there is such an aftertaste to this muffin you were gonna want that sugar it i think it's what it's like saving it like i keep lifting my fingers because like i have the sugar on it and it makes it like slightly better i need some milk gonna go finish my muffin and i'll be back i don't know if i'll have a second muffin or not probably not because like i'm not feeling the taste unless this muffin just like knocks me on my socks and then i might have another one like right now but they're gonna be something i'm gonna have to space out and make myself eat i'm not gonna lie to you guys all right i'll be back in probably like 30 minutes to an hour probably an hour it normally takes about an hour cheers [Music] oh my gosh when i smile ew what gosh no you can't have my muffin no no what the hell all right let's talk it's been like probably 45 minutes and i'm gonna tell you guys what i've never had an edible hit so like hard so fast before ever like ever in my life like these muffins have to be at least probably like [Music] 150 milligrams probably each like these are strong ass muffins um they taste absolutely horrible like no lie this was probably the worst tasting edible that i've had in a while like it was pretty bad like i did not enjoy the taste of it at all the feeling though is amazing like 10 out of 10 recommend for the feeling the only thing that i've ever made that i would recommend more than this would be the sugar cookies that i made at christmas time i think it was last year or the year before those those actually taste pretty good and they were like really effective these taste like crap but they they are really really effective so i'm not mad i'm not bad at all because like at the end of the day this is what we're searching for is like this feeling right here if i'm able to do that with like trim and like a little bit of shake that's amazing because that's just stuff that would have gotten thrown away anyway so thank you guys so much for watching this video if you like it give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below let me know what else you guys want me to make because i still have some peanut butter in this refrigerator over here like we still have three and a half sticks of can of butter over here to make stuff with and we're gonna make stuff with it so let me know what you want let me know what you guys want to see me make out of this canned butter i'm like having problems with my sentences now i'm gonna go check out my instagram page if you guys want to win a magical butter machine you can use cup buds and beards for 20 off at magicalbutter.com and i'll see you guys around for whatever sewing activity or video that i come up with for next time and i hope that like whatever we make is as effective as those muffins and i seriously think that it had something to do with this butter i think that that d-carve box really ensured that i was de-carving that cannabis properly because i feel like my oven was off not that i've made a bunch of edibles in this oven but i bet my other oven was off too and i wasn't de-carving it properly i think that that made all the difference in this butter which made all the difference in those muffins [Music] i'm like out of breath and i slightly have the giggles from the the um the muffin but anyways thank you guys so much for watching and i'll see you guys around for whatever show activity or video i come up with for next time bye guys [Music] you", "-CLQSorzBHQ": "hello everybody this is chef David it's my son Elijah forest hunter today is the Walmart pie challenge so we're gonna we have them here in the

are making homemade pie in a jar this is so much fun I'm so excited to do this we're gonna do this for Thanksgiving and have little pies on each of the plates for their pie after the yummy dinner so what I've done there's a couple things that you need to do to get ready for making pie ajar first I'm going to show you how to do the pie image art with using the making the pie crust so first of all what I did is I got on my apron and if you haven't taken a class yet this is a really fun class how to make aprons and you can find this in the take a class tab on my website how to craft and soak up the second thing you need to do is get out your supplies so one of the things that you will definitely need our jars I found these mason jars at Ace Hardware you can find them online maybe sometimes you can find this size at Walmart you might want to look online before you go but this is a half pint mason jar and you want the wide mouth and you want the half pint size this is absolutely perfect for your pie in a jar and to make the pie crust I just used pre-bought pie crust at the grocery store that I found so you can also do this with your own favorite pie crust recipe if you just can't stand to use store-bought stuff but I think this works great and it's just as easy so let's get started the first step I'm going to do is show you how to make the pie crust what you do is you unroll the pie crust just like so and I'm going to be making 12 so I have three pie crusts for the bottom and a couple extra pie crust to decorate with so what I'm going to do here look I've got this perfect square right here is I'm going to just cut this in force just like that and I'll put those over here for later then you don't want to work too much with your plate crest but you want to stretch it just a little bit like so you take your jar you just gently push the crank pipe rest in and you just pulled it and you work with it still be kind of gentle but then you have to kind of mush it into place like so and as you can see I'm just working the edges and I'm gently pushing in as I push and I'm pushing down at the bottom and I'm pushing and pulling up a little bit along the ridge just like so and I want it to come up over the top of the ridge like this so that we can do something cute on the ridge now I have a little tiny hole in there and all I did is mush it around it's okay if it's kind of layered like that so now that we have the dough pushed through our charge just like this and it coming over the top the next step we're going to do is to fill the jars and it's okay that they look like this again we're going to make them cute at the end what you want to do now is let these chill in the fridge so you can get the other items prepare to make the filling and let these just harder just a little bit okay so for the apple pie recipe it makes eight of these jars so I'm going to use about six apples I love the Fuji apple I think it bakes really well and I love the taste of it as well and when they're nice and ripe it's my favorite apple and what you're going to do is I've already washed the apples you're going to kill the apples okay now that we've got unpeeled accord we're going to slice them and I'm gonna slice them into thin strips and then I'm going to cut them like this so there are nice little tiny bite-size pieces like that you okay the next step is the filling and what you do is you go over to your stovetop and you are going to melt 1 cube plus 2 tablespoons of butter and I'm over here if you can pan in here and I'm just melting the butter now I'm going to add 1/3 cup of flour into this sauce and you're gonna whisk it quickly and get out all of the lumps I've got this on medium high heat and it's just super easy fun like this now I'm gonna let this cook while I stir it for just about two minutes because I want it to get nice and brown and bubbly okay now it's been two minutes and you can see it's turning into a lovely golden brown color I'm going to add in one cup of sugar just like so and keep stirring it around I'm going to add in a quarter cup brown sugar and keep stirring it back I'm going to turn this down to simmer right here I'm going to add in a teaspoon of cinnamon and a half a teaspoon of nutmeg we love that sometimes I even add in more cinnamon a pinch of salt about an eighth of the teaspoon stir that around and then a tablespoon of lemon juice all right stir that around and you just knead it for about another 30 seconds or so and simmer okay our next step is we're going to add this into the apples the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to add all of this yummy sugary sauce to the apples and whoops all right okay then I'm gonna stir this around okay so I just got these out of the fridge and the next thing you're going to do is fill them up just like so and you are going to press them into the pie your cute little pie okay this is the fun part we're going to top our pipes we've got our pipe restarick this is our extra pipe rest you're going to take the rim at the jar lid and you're going to just dig down on here just like so and we are going to put it on top of the jar just like this so I'm going to take again I'm going to show you again and dig in here like this and just cut around it like so and I'm going to take it on top of the chart then I'm going to show you how to do it I'll show you on this one you're going to push it in on top of them pipe and I'm combining the bottom and the top two together just like this I'm pinching them together and if you want you can take just a tiny tiny tiny bit of water and pinch them together - like that and you can see I've pushed it down just a little bit now what you're going to do is you're going to make your cute decoration on this side and I'm going to just pinch it like this and have it be kind of cute fluted up at the top pinch it together just like this and kind of bring it together there at the end so you can see I've got it like that then what I have is I have these really cute little extra these are leaf shapes cookie cutters and I'm going to cut out a couple leaf shape cookie cutters I'm going to use just a little tiny bit of water on them and put them in the middle and I've got this one just like this I'm gonna put it in the middle like that I'm gonna use one more cute one like this a little bit of water and I'm gonna just top it like so now you need to have a little tiny slit in here to let the air escape so I'm going to put some slits on it like this and this is going to be such a cute little pie decoration the next thing you do is you get an egg and you take a little pastry brush like this and you just top the very tops of the pie like this and this will give it a really nice finish okay I'm going to top the recipes and show you some more ideas so once you get all of your tops then we're gonna bake them at 350 for 50 minutes my apple pies are done in the oven so let's get those out check these out and here we have fresh homemade pie immature apple plain right from the oven", "Le0WnwJ_4t0": "hi I'm Laurie and this is Mary for Laurie and mary-jane a kitchen couch today we're making pumpkin pie using some of our infused cannabutter Thanksgiving is just a few days away so your menu must be set but there's nothing quite like ending a meal or begin with yeah so chew with a little piece of medicated pumpkin pie so what's the best way is medicated you can infuse the crust the filling or a little whipped cream topping or you could do what I do and infuse all three it's easy to do we have a recipe of the cannabis or use your favorite recipe adding cannabutter and adjusting the spices you don't want to replace all your butter with cannabutter that would be way too strong yeah and let you have a very nice island or you make a very weak down a better yes so our cannabutter is a sativa dominant hybrid which is great for combating your post Thanksgiving turkey nap if you want that nap I suggest going with an indica the U of R to rise for our cheese pumpkin pie we use 1 tablespoon in the crust 2 tablespoons in the filling and a teaspoon in the whipped cream topping a teaspoon is about right anymore and it will have too strong a weighty flavor we've already prepared the crust so now we're just finishing pour it in the filling and then we're going to put it in the oven so the filling effect so the pie is out of the oven we're going to let it cool for a little while before we slice it and top it with the can of whipped cream this is cool I'm going to top it with some of the little can of whipped cream and the most important part stepping yeah enjoy hmm", "u7KE2WOgoL8": "good evening happy st patrick's day happy singing projects day i'm amber and this is kelly and we're going to

kelly you want to grab the ice i think we'll put the ice in the there's a bottom full in there yep so we've had this shamrock shake a few different ways sometimes we add chocolate and make it chocolate mint but tonight we're just gonna stick with the traditional shamrock shake i can't see any hold on let's see if we can get our comments nope we can't see any comments and it's not really showing us anything tonight so we don't know if we're having a technical glitch or not but can you say hello just so we know that our comments are working we're going to do six ice here should we double this recipe do you think we should share with your brothers and your dad okay okay so let's maybe double it these shakes are always huge i think doubling it will still give us lots so say a quick hello if you can hear us because we can't seem to see the comments right now i'm not sure it doesn't seem to be working well so yeah let's do 12. let's do 12 cubes so we're doubling the recipe for the sandbox shake so this shamrock shake is the low carb mint milkshake from brianna thomas so you can find it on her website and we will um post a link in the card somewhere oh the comments are working hello nice to see you thanks for commenting three four five six seven and we're being very precise tonight eight okay i'm gonna get your spinach ready okay so we're gonna put in a whole bunch of spinach to make a green you're daydreaming while you're doing that do you have a tough day long day at school maybe zoning out all right so we are gonna get the spinach ready hi julia um so we are going to put in so it's supposed to be one cup of loosely packed spinach but we're going to put in enough for two so two cups do you want to grab a measuring cup i'll grab a measuring cup you throw the ice away how's that done oh dear okay so we're gonna do some loosely packed we get a little generous on our spinach and our cheeks we really like having spinach on our shakes like you don't even notice you don't even know what's there right we had a chocolate hazelnut shake last night with supper it was kind of a strange color because of the spinach but that's all right we didn't mind right oh no okay two cups of spinach callie do you want to grab the almond milk yep yeah grab it grab the open one yeah that sounds good is this a open one nope i got it how much do i need you're gonna need we're gonna double again so you're gonna need it says half a cup so you're gonna need one cold cup you wanna just use this one that we've got out you might as well keep rolling with it [Music] can't join um what's that we gotta use until we can't anymore did you give it a shake good job i shook the other one oh you shook this one i think you're gonna need both i think you need both we kind of have a weird angle going here tonight yeah there we go until we get the tripod how is everybody doing on this st patrick's day anybody having green food our kids had green lunches they had uh spinach in their waffles for their school lunch so they had green waffles and they had micro greens and they had celery and green peppers was a real green lunch for school today any more this one's really fully let me give you a hand yes okay so how much did i say we were going to need one cup right once it's pretty like much like three quarters it's pretty close we might have to add some more depending on how thick this ends up okay cali next up the cottage cheese cheese you want to grab that yep all right callie's getting the cottage cheese i love the cottage cheese in these shakes because it is the perfect way to imitate ice cream in this shake so this is like a milkshake this one so you need the cottage cheese the traditional shamrock shake is actually ice cream based if you look at like ones that are not tma to thm they are actually ice cream based usually so i'll need a cup of this are you gonna need a cup actually that says a third so you're gonna need two thirds of a cup sweetie okay all right you got it oh i'll get you a tablespoon it smells interesting so it smells interesting does it smell like cottage cheese hopefully it's not smelling funky okay so you're going to need two for this side if it smells like cottage cheese we're doing the smell test it smells perfectly like cottage cheese to me i don't know what you're smelling but so we're using low fat cottage cheese just because that's what i tend to have in the house did it really callie read further into the recipe than i did apparently well it called for the low fat but this is an s shake so you could go full fat if you have it but i think we just don't want to get too crazy on our calories here with this shake no no need for it we like this one this one um again we've mentioned before we are in canada and we have some phenomenal cottage cheese if you buy the land one percent it tastes excellent if you buy the other one percent brands they're terrible so this is the one that we go with sitter probably be generous we like the cottage cheese in there you want me to hold it up so you can scrape it in get this in view so people can see you in action [Music] how's everybody's wednesday going it's hump day we're almost through the halfway point it is hump day right oh yeah yeah it is wednesday oh boy it's been a long week it's been a long long week one tablespoon mm-hmm keep going all right i'm gonna get the next ingredient ready we're gonna need some heavy cream and we are gonna need again we're doubling the recipe so we're gonna need four tablespoons of the heavy whipping cream you're getting close we're getting it all over the counter i don't care keep going keep it up good it's like the whole container is it pretty much the whole container oh not quite not quite that's looking good okay how about i take this from you and you can scrape that in i'm gonna grab the lid go all right we're going to get this put away [Music] maybe i'm going to wipe up your counter there too uh i'll just put this over here yeah you might need it again we'll find out okay so we're going to need to put in some cream and then do you want to grab the next day you're going to call us oh there we go yeah it's gone that's okay we can't take a call right now anyway next ingredient i'm gonna do the whipping cream so why don't you do the collagen okay okay so going back to this we are gonna need four tablespoons of our heavy cream to give it that nice ice creamy taste you got that that's really a big thing of collagen we love to get that huge thing of collagen at costco sometimes it goes on sale for a really good deal and it's it's really nice i like this one because it dissolves completely whether you put it in hot or cold it's really good at dissolving [Music] it's the organica yeah it's a really good one so i need a two tablespoon you need two tablespoons see if i can find one we need to get some more measuring spoons i feel like every time we do a video we're like we need to get that we need to get that we need to make a list just what we need to do we need to make a profit i think we needed scoops in one video we need measuring spoons there's a few things our kitchen is kind of lacking or some things are just showing their age because they were wedding gifts almost 15 years ago my husband and i all right the kitchen stuff kind of got put on the back burner right replacing all of our gadgets okay it doesn't have to be super precise in a shake you don't have to be quite as precise when you're baking you got to be pretty pretty particular but in a shake it's more forgiving so don't worry too much all right where's everybody watching from tonight yeah we are yeah we want to know this is your first video watching us we are in saskatchewan canada and it's a beautiful day we finally have less temperatures that are significantly on the plus side the snow is almost all melted four teaspoons of this it's awesome today four teaspoons okay we're gonna use this super sweet do you say four teaspoons okay kelly's gonna measure in the fourth because it's normally two teaspoons i'm gonna go ahead with the extracts so we are gonna need vanilla extract and we're also gonna need now it did call this recipe actually calls for dried mint but we don't have dried mint in the house and we don't have a garden going yet in the backyard for fresh mint so we are going to go ahead and just use the pure peppermint extract too bad we didn't have like any mint leaves i know we've done mint before in our pots on our back deck and it's been awesome we did mojito mint the one time and we used that for our kombucha and it was so good newport richly oh nice from florida i bet the weather in florida is nice okay kelly i'm gonna go ahead with this and i'm just gonna i'm gonna do we're gonna start with two capfuls we'll see if that's pepperminty enough and if it's not minty enough for our shamrock shake then we'll increase it we can always increase it but i find the mint is pretty powerful can't take it away you can always put more in and i just got it all over myself it's a good thing it smells good okay i'm gonna wash my hands i'll keep this out because we'll need it do we need it again oh this is the super sweet maybe if it's not sweet enough i guess but i don't like i'm pretty sure we don't need it for our other recipe it's just for this one okay so then we're going to add some vanilla and we're going to go through the dash so we're going to add we're going to be generous i love it okay don't worry about that one right now kelly let's just do this one okay so do you want to do the salt it says pinch so maybe do a cup of cranks like i'm gonna do like one crank well it says a pinch so that would be like one pinch and you're doubling it right perfect okay now we have to add the glucky but we have to do it while it's whirling because otherwise we might get it lumpy this stuff as soon as it hits the anything moist anything wet um it clumps up so badly so we are gonna do that over the thing maybe i should bring it over and we can blend it right up here how's that sound okay okay you guys should check out our youtube channel oh you think everyone should go to youtube yes we do have a youtube channel now and we would love if you go over and you go ahead tell them what it's what it's called i'll get the blender donut and okra donut okra yeah and let's grab this people say ogre's a vegetable and it shows it's seeds so i wonder if it's like a frenchy a fruit or a veggie a fredjie as frenchy as a fruit and a veggie oh you mean because okra has seeds in the inside and cucumbers are a fruit because they have seeds on the inside i don't know we might have to google this whether okra is truly a vegetable or whether okra is a fruit or a veggie is it freddy a true thing yeah i figured this is a made up kelly thing a frenchie a thread or a vegetable whatever it is we love it you could put okra in this shake too but we're just going to stick with the way the recipe is written because the okra would probably be tasted in this recipe but it would certainly give it a really nice puddingy milkshake texture we love the texture of okra in our shakes okay do you want to get this started kelly it's going to be super thick so i'm going to get the plunger it's gonna be loud [Music] we want it to be green it's a shamrock shake it's the perfect green okay if you want to grab a scraper we'll scrape down the sides we have a few little tiny chunks of of cottage cheese and a spinach on the side and that's not going to be very nice yeah you want to scrape down those little pieces of cottage cheese and spinach we might actually have to add some more ice we kind of decreased the ice because our ice cubes are big but we might have to increase the ice we'll see we're going to put that glucky in glooky lucky i still haven't figured out if it's glooky or glucky i'd really like if somebody would tell me if it's glooky or glucky so we could be saying it right or lucky yeah i don't know we said glucky for like two years already so now it's hard for me to get that out of my head i want to call it glooky still you want to call it glooky like no lucky clucky gucky lucky and what we can call whatever we want i guess but i'd just like to know what it's really called it's like you scrape these down here we want those chunks of spinach to if you say if it's like if it's glooky can you say if the two o so we can tell it's like okay so cali wants to know if it's glooky or it's glucky or it's glucky like lucky lucky we really want to know somebody tell us somebody help us out okay so i'm going to sprinkle it in i think you just splashed me oh sorry well you'll smell minty you'll be very festive okay i'm gonna sprinkle it in how much did we need hon we need a quarter of a teaspoon for one recipe rounded and we're gonna do double so we're gonna need half a teaspoon around so we're gonna make some noise again and i'm going to sprinkle it in super slowly get it going anytime this hits the liquid it's going to start forming these little rubbery balls of clump it's not very appealing oh she thinks it's like lucky lucky that's what we were hoping lucky so were we saying it right for those two years what did we say before i can't even remember now i think we said we said lucky yeah we said right the whole time so baby we're saying it right well thanks for helping us out letting us know what we should be saying there brandi okay cali so let's add a couple more ice cubes do you want to grab the ice back out it's looking a little thin we want it nice and thick like a true shamrock shape it's gotta be thick perfect maybe add well originally it said we should add eight and you added six right six times two so go ahead add four more let's go the original amount we should have just followed the recipe and done the eight cubes like it said all right i said wrong not lucky oh not lucky oh oops so it isn't lucky it's glooky with two o's like that sound lukey no i'm just confused glooky we're gonna have to retrain our brains callie okay [Music] so now what it said to do is it said once you've got your glucky in there you're supposed to just like let it sit 30 seconds to a minute let that glue activate and then put it back on again and it's supposed to give it the best texture i don't know i'm not a very good rule follower i have a tendency to just throw it all in there why don't you get us some glasses and some straws so yeah i'm not really a rule follower when it comes to the shakes i know many of them say add the protein powder in the last 10 seconds and i'm not so good at following that we like a fluffy shape so we don't we just usually all throw it all in there all right can you reach out get rich our fridge is way too full considering it has nothing in it can you reach it do you need me to grab one yes i don't want a glass to fall on your head no that would have hurt you're going to use that one okay sure you can use that one i'll use this one these oh this looks good let's see look how nice and shamrock shape and it smells like i think we got it had a really minty maybe you could have cut it back we ended up doing half i did two capsules so probably closer to half a teaspoon and it probably definitely could have been more like one one and a half capfuls but we like minty so a shamrock shake should be minty right callie we said we were gonna make for the boys we should better save some hey uh-huh we better just you're having less sure i guess i'm having less it's all right i'll have more if there's enough for everybody to go around let's give it a try um it's really good oh it's really minty i really like it but i honestly i would like to add okra to this i think the texture would be even more milkshake like if you added okra so i think the next time we're going to add two cups of okra one cup per recipe um yeah um you know those um things that you can find at sweet and sprouted which things are we talking about those make your own ice cream package yes you could make some of those and then put it in you totally substitute some of the ice you totally could so kelly thinks next time we make the shamrock shake we should make some homemade sugar-free vanilla ice cream and plop it in there and that's a great idea it would taste even more like a true shamrock shake okay we're gonna hop to our next recipe another really quick one and this one is our strawberry lemon we're calling them lemon limeade because we're out of lemon juice and we do have the strawberry lemonade packets so we're going to use one of these you have the same brown as this for the yeah we normally buy the same brand so we're going to do the strawberry lemon limeade starburst superfood chews um so if you follow in the trim healthy book the superfood chews i believe are in the original trim healthy cookbook but there's not this recipe this recipe was just found on the page on the trim healthy main page so i will still link it in the comments so you can see it there so it's just somebody tweaked the original recipe which is normally a chocolate one and there's a few other variations and we're gonna do a strawberry lemonade hardly any of this stuff that's okay we won't quite have enough of the strawberry protein powder but we will add a little plain two and a half scoops scoops oh this scoop is what you just dropped off of there let me move this out of the way and then we can bring the food processor in and then you can get started on it i can tell you guys kelly is chomping at the she loves starburst if you have any like really good cheap fruit processors food processors yeah we talked about that last time our food processor is very sad when we do one of these videos with it one day it's just going to give us the ghost because it's very old that's okay hopefully it won't be today hopefully it's gonna it smells like strawberries it's a strawberry yeah don't dump it we don't have a lot especially strawberry starburst well that's the goal here we're trying to make something that tastes like strawberry starburst do you want me to just dump it in if you hold the scoop over we'll do it as teamwork okay okay so you're gonna need for these starburst fruit chews oh we've got glooky again oogie i think it says goofy yeah we have to start saying it right callie we're gonna embarrass ourselves saying lucky a hundred times i think i just like that it sounds like a lucky i don't know okay so we need to think that should you maybe we should just call it oh we could call it lucky good point cali okay so we need two and a half scoops of the strawberry trim healthy mama we're using their strawberry protein powder you could probably use a different strawberry one if you've got it use what you've got we're just using what we've got which is apparently not enough one and a half so don't dump that yet because we're gonna top it up we're gonna need two and a half all together so we're gonna need some plain we've just got the plain this is just the trim healthy mama plain protein powder we are in desperate need of going for a shopping trip kelly because that's all i've got left for protein powder in the house and that's like a tragedy okay so we're gonna need two and a half this stuff's fluffier i wonder if they're gonna turn out different with the plane in there oh well we're gonna find out so that's two and then we need another half well maybe the other one's not so fluffy because they don't have it the other one is less fluffy because of flavor i'm not sure why the flavored trim healthy protein powders are less fluffy than that do we need glucose we need no we don't no we need uh collagen you want to grab the collagen one more time and we did have this from our previous recipe that we used it for collagen let me get these other dishes out of the way callie one half see it isn't see me does it mean cup cup yes a c in a recipe would mean cup oh oh half a cup honey so not the table food what's that oh yes not the tablespoon i'm totally wrong you are right i think callie's reading the recipe we have a cup of collagen there's a lot of collagen hence what makes them super food chews there's the half cup cali get some of that in there this is almost like the strawberry really dip it in here turn this like that sideways i'll hang on to it for you this is almost like the strawberry what protein powder because it's like oh the texture the collagen yeah it's the same half cup yep we want to be kind of more exact on this recipe because we want them to turn out where they stick together okay perfect and then we need to see the star ingredients which is going to be floss tea lucy lucy lucy they say glooky they say everybody says something different apparently yeah that's all right i'm gonna call it lucky that is so so so minty next we're going to try it with the dried mint like the recipe calls for see if it makes a difference because i really like that that's the difference between her recipe so okay we're gonna use in this case the recipe calls are you okay you bump your almonds it called for these the true lemon lemonade don't be mistaken and just buy the true lemon that are just the crystallized lemon you need these to be the lemonade mix and there's all different flavors so you could change this recipe i got two more in my hand i need a cup so you can use whatever flavor you want and change the flavor of your starburst fruit shoes to be whatever flavor you buy there you are dear cali is on a mission tonight we are on mission make this video short nice and short we're gonna try and be quick tonight one it smells like strawberry night kelly's gotta head to the bath after this it's like a purple color it is um that smells good this is a real life school weeknight kind of video we gotta be fast right kelly gotta go chop chop so i'm excited if these are good we're gonna buy more of the true lemon packets and do different flavors and we're gonna make a whole like mixture so when we've got those cravings for something chewy and candy-like we can be chomping on these her it's really perfect no there's a good chance cali we'll test it before we completely decide we like the flavor but we used some plain protein powder so there is a chance this might not be just a second okay there's a chance this might not quite be sweet enough because we didn't use all strawberry protein powder we did have to sub some plain in there so we're gonna taste it when it's done and if we need to we'll either add some super sweet or we will add another packet of the lemonade so we're going to have to just be careful of that don't let me forget to try it isn't lemonade like sour yes but there's also sweetener in this this is already pre-sweetened this one it's got um well there's actually cane sugar in here but it's just such a minimal amount and there's stevia leaf extract in there okay callie so it said you're supposed to combine all of this first blitz it up a little bit just so it's all combined evenly so that you're not getting like some that just tastes like collagen pulse it um you just whizz it on low maybe give it a quick whiz go ahead smells like it's burning i don't smell burning i smell lemonade no like when it was whirling then it smelled like oh dear that's just because our food processor is dying okay so to this cali we have to add some lemon juice and then we're gonna process it a little more and then add our coconut oil oh yes the lime juice we're gonna do lime juice because we're out of lemon so two table two tablespoons you can use that tablespoon measure over there extra collagen no all right collagen for what because i have like a little less oh that'd be fine that little tiny bit in the spoon will be fine i'm gonna let callie do the cooking video and i'm just gonna drink the shade give it a good shake those things when they're kind of new you have to yep you're getting it keep going [Music] keep going you're able to see this one you want it to be a bit more precise so that they stick together good keep going keep going a little bit more perfect one okay go ahead with one more we need two tablespoons it's bubbly in there add the lime juice or you could use lemon juice and two tablespoons of coconut oil i'll get the coconut oil started cali okay i'll get it ready to go but i'll wait actually because i don't want to interrupt you and i need to have a measuring spoon excellent i'm just gonna grab a spoon for the coconut why is it bubbly in there in here it's probably reacting with the um the packet of the lemonade that'd be my guess okay i'm going to grab something like that and vinegar yeah sort of like that okay so you need to begin processing and it says says when you put the juice in you need to start processing it like online like on low what no lime juice it smells like really like lemonade oh it smells really good and it's a little crummy it's supposed to be crumbly at this point it's supposed to be crumbly that looks right i'm using kind of a one and a half tablespoon measure and then a half tablespoon because again that's all we have for measuring spoons around here is random random ones so we're gonna use this one is a half so that'll give us two tablespoons of coconut oil i don't think you want to use a coconut oil that has much flavor here we're using this one this one's our favorite you see it there um it's ideal for cooking the omega nutrition one it has no coconut taste whatsoever i just got a sugar so it's my favorite to use i like coconut but i don't want coconut starburst that's it oops it actually sounds sort of good coconut starburst well that'll be your next creation maybe kelly okay so that you want to whizz it up again and we'll check if it holds together okay now be careful for the blade we gotta check if it's gonna just be careful there's a blade in there we're just going to see if it holds together i think it's going to hold together it's very coconut oily but it seems to be holding together holding a nice little ball there it's like a little gumball yeah we want it to hold together taste it see if it needs anything that tastes really good it tastes like a strawberry starburst mm-hmm which is exactly like a strawberry lemonade starburst i don't think we need to add any more sweetener there is no such thing as strawberry lemon there's no strawberry lemonade starburst but that would taste like a strawberry one you know all the flavors i don't but i'll take your word for it okay so now you have a couple of options a person can either take just take your fingers like we just did and make little balls out of this or you can roll it into a log and slice it i think we should roll it in a log and slice it what do you think callie can i slice it sure you roll on too long okay i'm going to grab a cutting board to do this one because this looks like it might be pretty greasy from the coconut oil and we'll do it on a cutting board and then if you want to grab a knife there should be one check if there's one in that drip tray over there for doing the supper dishes okay so we're just gonna form this into a log it seems to be sticking together nice okay then you can grab one from this drawer but just let me roll this out first okay because you have to get in there a little bit of sausage it's very coconut oily like i feel like it kind of had a little less coconut oil it sounds very coconut oily anybody made this does it look right i think it's supposed to be like shiny i think it's just melting from my warm hands yeah but it's very very coconut oily you're not gonna wait hey no no you're eager i'll just use this you're gonna use that big chef's knife okay nobody can see you want to come on the other side of me yeah but i gotta roll this up a little bit this knife in the house be careful with it please kind of holding it dangerously there for a minute all right now we may have a problem because this is not really wanting to roll out nice and thin we may have to do some forming of it with our hands i think that's what we're going to do it looks honestly like all the coconut oil is coming out of this and that can't be right so we're going to try and improvise well if your hands are melting well we don't want to lose all the coconut oil in our recipe yeah right so if you want to cut in pieces they have to be kind of even pieces calisora they're somewhat the same size and then what maybe i'll do since this looks a little on the big side i'm just going to break that into two maybe we'll go ahead and just form these with our hands starburst yeah absolutely you cut them in or even you just cut some and then you can help me form them i think we should do them in little squares like starburst would look like little cute squares can you see that our lighting in our house in the evening is absolutely terrible so i apologize because it looks like we're in a cave right now yeah we have a light on the way so that the lighting will be a bit better because it still gets dark here really early it's only 7 30 and it's getting dark outside so we're gonna get something but can you see our little starburst fruit shoes aren't those the cutest we're gonna have very greasy fingers when this is done cali did you cut them into half again yeah they're gonna be pretty big i think kind of just make them form them into little cubes flat they're gonna be bigger than a starburst i feel like we could have even made these into half again oh my god well you make that one whatever size you want it but i think the rest will make them just like little tiny one bite poppers because these are super filling with all that collagen in there and that protein powder you know this is a one right one that looks like a huge bite one you'd be full after just having one really you don't want to slice it in half and make it smaller i can make it smaller that would fill me up with just one it would so i think it's fun to do these in different flavors i like i do like the chocolate ones they remind me of a tootsie roll so i do like those ones too although i do not remember them being so drippy with coconut oil so i don't know if that is something to do with the lemonade packets just not being quite the same as the original recipe there's less dry ingredients but i mean they're turning out they're just drippy with coconut oil do this over guys this is pretty small and try to make sure sure you do it whatever you however you like that looks great this one has to cut in half after i made it you're gonna make it a starfish mini sausage a mini sausage so i think these would be fun to do with the kids if your kids like to eat thm food my kids do you can like probably make these any shape you want these would be really fun to do as something the kids could get involved in doing it's like school safe they would be school safe we have a tough time finding school safe snacks that in our house is really important as well because we have a son with a peanut and a sesame allergy so it's really hard to find snacks that are safe for him that are both peanut free and sesame free sesame is the even harder one i think than peanuts these days is finding things that are sesame free so whenever we find something fun like this this would be a super cute little lunch box accompaniment are you trying it yeah you taste testing it no see if it's any good i think they'll be even better once they're cold we'll chill them and then all that coconut oil will firm up and then they will be super good because that's what i used to do with the traditional recipe they used to wrap them individually and then put them into the fridge so like you'd wrap them and then you put them in the fridge so yeah i don't want to chill these because i well we're not going to eat them all this is making a lot so we're going to keep forming these and enjoying them yeah right i'm not sure if we have too much else to show you guys tonight we want to keep this really short and sweet we just wanted to show you a fun shake for st patty's day so um if you're just starting to join us now go and watch the replay we'll post the recipes in the comments and enjoy yourself a shamrock shake for st patrick's day and

YouTube this is Steve Stevenson with Maryland marijuana review today we're going to be reviewing a product called cherry cream pie pre packaged flower from trilogy wellness before we get into the video on to give a quick disclaimer all products on this channel are in compliance with Maryland state law any viewers under 21 are advised to turn away now and all reviews our mind they're my personal opinion I'm in no way shape or form supported by any growers or any establishments their head shops or nothing just me doing me so the product in question here today is cherry cream pie from trilogy wellness it is a vibrant bud it doesn't have too many hairs that stick out of it let me see if I can get a little better view on that picture yeah we don't have too many hairs that necessarily protrude or doesn't look like you could trim a lot off of it it's pretty tightly packed it's got a little bit of dark runs through there with a little bit of a shine yeah the shine it's like a you know glistening kind of gaya' crystally shine it's very good bud though it's good and this is a $80 a quarter its ratings are 1.8 on the THC rating in 16.6 when the THC a rating not bad at all so let's give her a quick test see how she handles today we're going to be using this pipe right here this is a mushroom pipe I don't know where I got it or when okay yep yeah it's got a piney node it's definitely a little bit more pining it's got a little bit of a fruit in there too but it's definitely not an overpowering pine it's it's a mellow all-around bud yeah it doesn't have any a particular standout or anything and I would say is a you know super stellar about it but all around a good choice $80 a quarter is what I paid for it and I from trilogy wellness on route 40 in Howard County well thank you folks this is Steve Stevenson thank you all for joining me we'll catch you on the next one indeed peace", "Peis7KlMZtU": "this is Twin Cities adventures and in today's video I'm gonna teach you how to make this amazing sweet potato pie with homemade whipped cream Twin Cities adventures here and in today's video I'm gonna take this sweet potato and a couple more and turn it into a sweet potato pie okay let me show you how it's done I just baked three sweet potatoes I made them in the instant pot so it's a pressure cooker if you don't have that you can bake it in the oven you can look online how to do that so what you're gonna do is you're gonna take leave that take it and cut it in half and then you're gonna scoop all of the potato out like this and get all that yummy goodness out and we're gonna discard the shell or you could eat that if you want just set that aside I just don't want the outer casing in the pie so we'll do that to this one also so here we have four cups of sweet potatoes you can either boil those for 1 hour or you could bake that for about 50 minutes or you can use it in the pressure cooker for 45 minutes either way I did the pressure cooker for 45 minutes so and I took the skins off so we're gonna put that in the bowl and then we're gonna soften one stick of butter real quick there's our one stick of butter that's a half a cup 1 cup of white sugar 1/4 a cup of brown sugar a half a cup of milk 2 eggs 1/2 a teaspoon of nutmeg 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon 1 teaspoon of vanilla ok now we're gonna give that a really good mix until it's nice and creamy okay perfect that just took about a minute or two now the next thing you need to do is grab your pie pan and I'm a firm believer in a glass pie pan the reason is because any time you're baking with a crust whether it's a chicken pot pie beef pot pie or a pie you when you pull this out of the oven you're able to look underneath it and see if the crust is thoroughly cooked all the way through because sometimes you can't tell and there's nothing worse than pulling a pie out and serving it and having the crust rock that's disgusting so anywho I'll show you what that looks like when I pull it out of the oven and then there's the pie crust so I've made homemade crust for years and they're fine if you want to do that but if you don't want to do that the Betty Crocker or the Pillsbury pie crust or the cub food brand pie crust these are so delicious so I like you so much I pretty much only make pies with these now chicken pot pies any other kind of pie once in a while we'll make a homemade crust for the novelty of it but then I always go back to these they're great you're only gonna need one of these this is a 2-pack all right so there it is it's gonna roll and you're gonna open that up and roll that into the pie pan there we have it and now you're gonna want to take your sweet potato pie filling and you're gonna want to pour that into the pie crust when I get your spatula and get that all in there nice and neat okay there's our sweet potato pie in the pie crust in the pie pan and I like to bake that on a cookie sheet so any drippings don't ruin your oven one more thing I'm a firm believer in the pie crust shield so this goes on just like this and it prevents your crust from burning around the edges it gives you the perfect crust every time so we're gonna bake that at 350 degrees Fahrenheit there we go for 1 hour and 15 minutes there it is see the little Peaks are just starting to get a little bit round that is perfectly cooked now let me take that heat shield off look at that I am so excited about this but the only thing is now I have to let that cool and then we'll take another look at that after it's all cooled off all right I let this cool down first before I held it with my hand and showed you the crust but I did look at the crust before I decided to take it out of the oven and look at that the crust is completely cooked now that is the benefit of using a glass pie pan you can see the end result all right now give that a smell it smells amazing all right that's it that is our homemade sweet potato pie recipe I have done a lot of experimenting over the years and I tweak things and this is my own version my own recipe it kind of looks like a pumpkin pie but it's not it's sweet potato pie and this is just so unbelievable but it's kind of missing one thing just like pumpkin pie I'm gonna make homemade whipped cream and put it on top so let's do that real quick here's what we're gonna need we're gonna need 1 pint of whipping cream and we're gonna need 6 tablespoons of sugar bowl and a mixer so let's put that together so one pint of whipping cream and here's 6 tablespoons of sugar now we'll just take our mixer and we'll mix that until we have whipped cream there we have it homemade whipped cream there we go little dollop of homemade whipped cream little sprinkle of cinnamon powder now let's give that a taste mmm that is one of my all-time favorite pies if you've never had a sweet potato pie I really encourage you to make this one it is so good well thanks for watching twin cities adventures out you", "2NbxXVDElQk": "[Music] hey everybody steve ritter so i'm gonna get a little closer because i got some uh laundry going on right now hope everybody's doing great time for another smoothie with a story so i just uh got through with the gym again i'm gonna fire me up a smoothie today's smoothie is uh well a little bit of everything trying to get the fruit out of the fridge and using it up so none of it goes to waste and some of the the problem with the i think they picked their fruit a little closer to ripeness i know like in the states a lot of times they'll pick vegetables and fruit with the ideas is longevity and shelf life that's why like tomatoes you get in the store most times in the grocery store like don't have any taste vine ripened are always the best so i'm um so the fruit doesn't necessarily keep as long which i don't have a problem with that so i just need to hurry up use it up so today's is an apple red currant uh with some peanut butter smoothie that's my protein

got a zoom call planned with uh arlene and the kids um tomorrow morning um so i'm excited about that it'd be the first time we all been together on a zoom call in a while so i do miss them dearly but uh um i wanted to talk with you today uh just some camping stories that uh that that i remember and i grew up uh mom my dad and my mom when they were together um like to camp my dad always kind of fancied himself a mountain man that movie uh jeremiah johnson with robert redford from the 70s i think he always kind of envisioned himself that way and uh yeah he he uh he he like he grew to like his uh city comforts though so he wasn't much wasn't much of a mountain man uh you know but i i kind of grew up we'd go camping and we always always thought it was a lot of fun and i enjoyed it and uh and when mom and bucky got together um we did camp um we went camping one time i remember and the thing that i remember most about that um this was early on when they i think their first year they were married and uh the thing that i remember most about that was uh mom made this pineapple upside down cake and camping you know it's crazy and uh so she made that i remember we just went crazy over how cool that was and she i remember her being all excited about it she wanted to try it she did it and uh turned out real well um and i remember that um but um we got married it wasn't until um now arlene and i got married and we had nathan and will and then benjamin was was born that was all the way up at that time we hadn't done any camping at all so you know nathan and will were um like uh four and six and um maybe now it was like uh seven and and five and uh um they were old enough to go spend the night out in the woods with her dad and so got a tent and went then we went camping in oklahoma now it was um it was uh late spring as i recall um and it was hot so it was almost like you couldn't really enjoy the fire at all but they got a big kick out of that but uh um but it wasn't until we moved up to seattle and that was in 2008. we moved up there and uh of course the pacific northwest northwest is by far our favorite place to to camp i mean it's just it's just awesome and in the summertime the temperatures are real mild and cool in the evening so you can have fires and of course the woods are all open and park like and everything else it was just some of the parks we went to uh we really enjoyed it uh deception pass and uh uh that was the that was the big one and then there was a camp campground on the hood canal but we loved it we loved it and and the first time we went we went with some canadian friends of ours uh who who were he was we had met them in germany um and they and he was stationed in victoria going to school there and uh so they would just they would come down across the border and uh and we would uh we'd go camping and um so we had uh we'd meet up somewhere and go camping we went with them a couple times um there and then we went to banff once uh but arlene got to where she loved camping and and i think mostly she loved camping because i did a lot of the cooking and uh it's kind of funny because they we had a suburban at the time and uh of course suburbans man it you get real lazy with with uh with load planning uh with the suburban and packing because you just throw everything in there and and it's going to fit i mean you put anything in it and it'll fit so um but i would load up the whole back end with uh with all the cooking stuff it was like a chuck wagon that's why i started calling a chuck wagon i just backed that thing up close to the to the campsite open up the back tailgate and there's all my cooking stuff right there it was like kent rollins you know the chuck wagon um but we uh i loved it i love cooking i get up in the morning and get a fire going i love getting up before anybody else and i'd get the fire going and i had my little percolator coffee pot and i'd fill it full of water and put my coffee in there and get the coffee going and and uh and then once the fire kind of got going hot then i'd cook breakfast and everybody start kind of getting up and i'd make some biscuits and a dutch oven and and uh eggs and bacon and all that uh it was great i loved it and i was like the only one up and then you know eventually people start waking up and coming out and then you know hour later i'm you know putting breakfast out for them and it was those campfire eggs too which was you know you get that that skillet and it's hot and then you just you fry the bacon up and then you pour a lot of the grease off but not all of it you just cook the eggs and the grease and that's just oh it's good that's good but uh but then you're not finish and usually we'd have you know the kids on kp duty and they'd have to clean up the pots and everything else not kind of relax and eat and and then and then it was you know i'm already starting to think about lunch so for me it was it was just meal to meal to meal for me and i loved it i loved it again i because i love you know putting that into it and i would plan out the meals and have everything all bought and everything else but uh um we would do um you know steaks you know we do those we call them hobo meals with the uh with the aluminum foil and we put little meatballs and make them ahead of time and you get some [Music] mushroom soup cream of mushroom soup you put big big dollop of that in there with some carrots and potatoes and celery and uh and then just just wrap it up then you put it in the fire and the coals and let it sit in there for 10-15 minutes and take it out and eat it with rice and uh oh it was so good so we those are some of our favorites i did i did make a pineapple upside down cake in the dutch oven that was great turned out wonderful uh made all kind of stuff we would go camping with their our friends the canadian friends and we would have little uh cook-offs and uh you know canadians versus americans so it was i would cook and then um our friends the wife cindy would would cook for them and uh and then we'd we'd have a family voting um you know anonymous because you know you didn't want to not vote for your own family right you don't want that to be found out but uh yeah remember we would do that and we won uh well cindy won because nate misunderstood the voting so he he voted incorrectly well i meant to vote for you but i didn't understand what he was think it was this vote yes or no i mean simple back and forth and uh he was like you cost me the victory boy let america down just don't laugh about that oh but we would have uh i remember we went to banff camping with them uh beautiful beautiful place all you all you canadian folks up there you got it you got a treasure with banff national park there but uh we went into town and and made a grocery store run and uh arlene loved the the kids and the kids all loved too the the the flavors of lace potato chips that you can get up there was some of the ketchup flavored and arlene loved the uh the dill pickle chips at the time that i guess you couldn't get those in the states but but ketchup flavored and all this is just funny all the different flavors but we got some picked up some hot dogs we're like well we'll just have a weenie roast and whatever so cook cooking the hot dogs and we're eating them i'm like man these are real uh got a real snappy skin to them like yeah you know what i got probably three quarters of the way through my hot dog and i'm finally i'm like and it was the some it was a plastic wrap around them i think it was a cellulose i'm sure it was i think it was digestible i think it was i hope so i'm like there's plastic wrap on these things i mean who thought of that individually wrapping hot dogs i mean who who thought of that you know uh and those the the our friends the canadian friends just got oh they had a big laugh about that they thought that was pretty funny and i thought it was pretty funny too but what who who would think to individually wrap hot dogs like that i don't know never heard of it but uh um i remember uh we um we went uh now we'll say this we we did go back up a little bit because when again i was in altus oklahoma and my dad had come to visit and we're like hey we're going to go camping this was this was like september so it was just it was starting to cool down a little bit and make it nice outside and we went camping in um this there's a state park near near outs between altus and lawton oklahoma and uh it's um uh i can't remember the name of it but it it's it it recreates the grasslands like they used to be in in that part of the country and they have buffalo there so the the park it's a big open park so the buffalo can wander anywhere they want but they they keep it fenced in and then you know where you drive in they have the big open spaces so they the buffalo stay in the park but um it uh but there's buffalo there and you can drive through there and it's real nice park and sometimes we've gone through we used to cut through the wildlife refuge uh i guess that's what they called it but you we would come back from oklahoma city and you could cut through the wildlife refuge and it would shave you know 20 minutes off your trip back to altus and uh but you know sometimes you come through there and there'd be the herd of buffalo herd of 20 of them coming across the street then sometimes they get mingle in the the cars and everything it's really cool anyway they have a campground there and uh so we went there and of course i mean the buffalo could walk through the camp if they if they wanted to um you know it was buffalo patties around so you knew they had gone through there when there were no people but but we camped with dad and um we had steaks that night and i i know dad was kind of watching me you know i think he had his doubts and uh got the steaks i just wrap up a potato and throw it in the coals and let it sit in there for for half an hour and it was a baked potato it was good and and uh so it's steaks grilled on the open fire baked potatoes i think we had some salad too or something but uh dad was just like i think he had his doubts but uh i remember i just remember him that was real satisfying because dad's like son this is like really good like now dad thanks but that night it was me and my dad and uh nathan and william and benjamin um and uh we were sleeping in the tent and then we we had a little uh arlene and and bella she bella was just a little tiny thing she was in uh there was uh we got a little casita trailer for her in bed early she don't like the tents so much i'm kind of getting to where i'm i'm like i do like myself bed anyway um but we were in there and this big storm came through that night so it was shaking you know winds and all this and to top it all off is is uh the buffalo were nearby well the coyotes were getting after them so this just god-awful noise [Music] as this thunderstorm is going on at the same time and and it was just like it was like the depths of hell opened up or something like that and and and i could hear my dad and my dad's like he goes stephen yes sir and he goes what is that [Music] i think it's just it's just some buffalo's dad he's like it's just buffalo's on some coyotes after him or something dad it said this be all right there ain't gonna mess with us and uh but the next morning um it it rained so we kind of had breakfast and it was like not when it's not much fun when it's raining and you're camping but we ended up packing up early going back but i just just good memories of that but uh um yeah i would love to love the camping in the pacific northwest and also lots of camping stories funny camping stories um and uh i hope you enjoyed them uh i'm not done with my well i'm not done i haven't been drinking my smoothie at all been talking the whole time with you but love camping lots of memories i want to share those with our kids and grandkids and uh keep doing it so anyway hope you enjoyed it uh got some uh more on the way and and uh we'll talk to you later see you next time [Music]", "IPK8GTttsGA": "today kevin and i are going to be trying some cake bombs these were bought at critchfield meats so uh the title of the video will probably be like critchfield meat cake bombs because we bought those in a bottom in clear plastic packages there's no information on them um at all it just says safe handling instructions and keep them refrigerated or frozen that type of thing no calories no nothing on them so we're guessing they're just their bakery their bakery the crutchfield meat bakery so like i said they're called cake bombs i have the chocolate truffle and the strawberry and i have the key lob cake yes and so this is um i told kevin i said this is like trying um like a local place like we've done donut shops and stuff like that because uh really i don't have any information to give you other than they were 4.99 apiece 15 yes let's see what it looks like so um 15 here for the three soft so i'm wondering if it's just like a regular chocolate cake and they just no it's got like a movie no that's literally truffle so it said truffle oh my goodness i'm not just that's as far as i can go with it i don't want to go any further but that that's what it looks like it's got like a truffley kind of pudding like top on the top oh wow so we definitely want to try that so let's just turn that over like that yeah so we can see what we're getting here make sure we get it it's got like cake on the bottom yes so the chocolate cake i'm assuming it's just chocolate cake look at it has these little um crispy pieces of chocolate cake is not bad it doesn't taste like chop uh truffle it tastes like pudding yeah it's more like a devil's food kind of flavor a devil's food cake i don't know what the cat wants up here it um that's good though if you like more of a devil's food kind of cake i think you would like that i do too i like it a lot i think there's not anything bad about it but i wouldn't expect uh the richness of a truffle really it is a pudding okay so let's cut this one so i'll try to get a picture uh for you all up here inside of that yeah let's go and check that so that you can see the insides of them so i don't know the same thing if crutchfield meet is one of those that's a locally owned place i don't know if it's a chain i don't know oh okay so this just says strawberry cake balm yeah we'll just cut go ahead go for it i like the color of it so it's a vanilla cake on the bottom oh well all right oh okay like a savage that one's sweeter than the chocolate one i love the cake it's very very good the strawberry is very good that's good the cake's a little dry it has been on both of them but but it's still got a good flavor honestly that cake reminds me like a bakery cake i think that is very that to me it doesn't taste like your typical box cake mix it um your mind that's very nice you know the little strawberry um cake little cakes yes it reminds me that they've taken one of those and put up like a scoop of of a pudding on like on top of it and then dunked it or whatever they mira glazed it or whatever on top that's what it kind of reminds me it's nice it's very good strawberry it is very nice yeah it's a fresher strawberry flavor now this is let's take this one out key lime uh looks like they it has coconut coconut around the edge of the outside very soft now this cake fills moisture yeah where it might be i don't know if you can pick this one up it's a little wet i like to try the cake by itself first that's a really nice um limiting high flavor lemon lime kind of flavor it's very very good i like that one the best it's in the cake by the way is the first two i thought was a little drop this one's not at all no no no it um it's very zesty just like a a good key lime would be and the coconut to me the coconut on the outside is everything that's textured i have never in my life had a cake with coconut on it until kevin and i got married and his mother made one for easter she had this bunny cut out and so it's just a regular cake but she put a coconut shavings white frosting and coconut oh listen it was the best thing i've ever just put in that you wouldn't believe the difference that makes just to put that coconut on the outside it makes any regular cake incredible doing that and i like that one too quite a bit that's my favorite um after the three um yes i'm gonna pick the key lime as well for my favorite and then i would go for the strawberry yeah and the chocolate's good it's just a little darker than what i would choose to eat the chocolate for me was delicious but i was expecting truffle and not pudding and it truly does taste like pudding it just doesn't have the the thickness of a truffle or the richness of flavor of truffle it's just like chocolate pudding uh so yes these are all yes very good you could absolutely buy one of these for five dollars and split it between the two of you and so it could or have it one night half of it and then the next night have half of it so i hope you enjoyed the video let us know if you have critchfield meet in your area and thanks for watching [Music] so", "7j0OY3236jw": "Welcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation. I'm Betty White, and I think we're going to have a good time today! At least I know I am. I'm going to be reading you a book, okay. I love animals, all animals, but maybe dogs in particular. So today, I'm going to be reading you a story about Harry the Dirty Dog. It's by Gene Zion, pictures by Margaret Bloy Graham. Harry was a white dog with black spots who liked everything, except getting a bath. So, one day, when he heard the \nwater running in the tub, he took the scrubbing brush... and buried it in the backyard. Then he ran away from home. He played where they were fixing the street and got very dirty. He played at the railroad and got even dirtier. He played tag with other dogs and became dirtier still. He slid down a coal chute and got the dirtiest of all. In fact, he changed from a white dog with black spots to a black dog with white spots. Although there were many other things to do, Harry began to wonder if his family thought that he had really run away. He felt tired and hungry too, so without stopping on the way, he ran back home. When Harry got to his house, he crawled through the fence \nand sat looking at the back door. One of the family looked out and said, \"There's a strange dog in the backyard... By the way, has anyone seen Harry?\" When Harry heard this, he tried very hard to show them he was Harry. He started to do all his old, clever tricks. He flip-flopped and he flop-flipped. He rolled over and played dead. He danced and he sang. He did these tricks over and over again, but everyone shook their heads and said, \"Oh no, it couldn't be Harry.\" Harry gave up and walked slowly toward the gate, but suddenly he stopped. He ran to a corner of the garden and started to dig furiously. Soon he jumped away from the hole barking short, happy barks. He'd found the scrubbing brush! And carrying it in his mouth, he ran into the house. Up the stairs he dashed, \nwith the family following close behind. He jumped into the bathtub and sat up begging, with the scrubbing brush in his mouth, a trick he certainly had never done before. \"This little doggy wants a bath!\" cried the little girl, and her father said, \"Why don't you and your brother give him one?\" Harry's bath was the soapiest one he'd ever had. It worked like magic. As soon as the children started to scrub, they began shouting, \"Mummy! Daddy! Look, look! Come quick! It's Harry! It's Harry! It's Harry!\" they cried. Harry wagged his tail and was very, very happy. His family combed and brushed him lovingly, and he became once again a white dog with black spots. It was wonderful to be home. After dinner, Harry fell asleep in his favorite place, happily dreaming of how much fun it had been getting dirty. He slept so soundly, he didn't even feel the scrubbing brush he'd hidden under his pillow. Did you like that? \nWell you're going to like this even better. This is my friend Ringo. I just met him, but he's a shelter puppy who found a wonderful forever home, so he has a happy ending just as Harry the Dirty Dog had a happy ending.

so um you know those those two styles are pretty pretty similar sometimes they are you know also known as kind of stuff and today i have one from this brewery that i have never tried anything from them before they are out of idaho laughing dog brewery and i'm bringing you their pecan porter today check it out that's right pecan porter that sounds tasty and guess what i'm going to pour that on in to my nonic pine here which is the glass i recommend that you use when you're putting yourself a nice border whether it's a robust porter or an imperial porter or any other kind of powder and remember having the right glass for the beer that you are tasting is always an important piece of being a beer connoisseur so if you want to get your own set of beer concert tv glasses look in the description below check out the store and see how you can get your hands on a nice set of glasses now where do we always start appearance more importantly the three c's of appearance which are color clarity and carbonation that is right now the color it was or it is but you know you can be full and think that this is black it was very very dark brown color very clear actually it was clear when i poured it a nice carbonation yeah i would call that a very lots of action carbonation the head it's not as big a head of foam you know and it's dissipating somewhat quickly i mean you can see some of the lacing you've lost about half a finger already but it's still a nice still head there and it's nice green color head of foam so very very nice appearance all around now where do we go next aromas right well they're not trying to hide that pecan for sure it smells like caramelized pecans in there and all kinds of kind of like vanilla maybe even a hint of kind of like espresso or maybe even like a cappuccino scent uh smell there yeah very very nice sweet malty kind of aromas there it smells like dessert to be honest with you and i like pecan pie so maybe that's what i'm thinking about and now i'm going to taste it and let you know how it goes well slightly different than i expected i would say it's a lot it's a lot more bitter than i would have led to believe with such sweet aroma so tip of the tongue is very bitter actually the carbonation is nice throughout so you know if you're looking for something that cleanses your palate very nice carbonation and then that malt base with some of that sweet pecan caramelized pecan maybe burnt sugar and even a hint of like i said roasted coffee maybe like espresso all that comes through the middle then what lingers is a dry bitterness so it's and i'm still feeling kind of like a smoky even peppery dry bitterness there in the back of the palate that that kind of lingers so uh just keep that in mind but it's very very good i would call that light to medium body so again it was a lot more um it has a lot you know it was more bitter and a little bit heavier than i thought it was going to be from the appearance and the aromas but it's not a heavy beer at all it's maybe a little bit light to medium body there um that all comes important when we go to the next piece which is the part that you come to me for the part that makes you a concert the foot pairings right now porters you know they are bold beers with bold foods you want to pair them with foods that are equally bold so that the food can stand up to the beer and in this case we always look for you know meats grill meats smoked meats that have maybe sauces and stuff like that and in this case the first thing i'm going to say check it out honey pecan barbecue sauce chicken sliders yes it's a thing look it up if you don't believe me but that is going to be a great great pairing because a lot of those flavors are going to harmonize and like i said nice carbonation throughout by the way this is 8.1 alcohol by volume and i could barely barely uh taste some of that alcohol so they they do a nice nice job of you know kind of like balancing all the flavors there but because of the alcohol that's also going to help you enjoy some of those bold foods like the one i just i just um suggested also if you like thai food and if you're like you know noodles and stuff like that thai peanut noodles yes it's going to go great with the beer again it has that pecan flavor so a little bit of that nutty peppery peas part of the beer all those are going to really help you enjoy that thai food and it has enough malt to stand up to spicy food so go and enjoy your spicy foods with this beer because it's definitely going to to help you you know put down the fire when you need it when you need it to and um you know i rarely give any suggestion to vegetarians and i don't want to forget my vegetarian friends who love beer so a nice grilled portobello mushroom burger with some caramelized onions on top that will go great with this pecan powder that i have here so all those are my suggestions and as far as the cheese is smoke gruyere yes anything because what i have been learning and teaching you as i've been learning here is beers that have that long kind of smoky part of the taste they benefit from a smoky cheese to kind of pair and sound like it can almost like a rest it stops some of that smokiness from lingering way too much in the back there so i think a small gruyere would be a great great pairing with this beer now you know you can always trust me to leave you a great recommendation as far as a dessert pairing and today i think you're going to enjoy that again if you enjoy this kind of flavors here that's going to be a winning pairing there for you my friend now that concludes today's lesson but not before i ask you have you had laughing dog pecan porter before how have you enjoyed it have you enjoyed it with food have you drank it solo what are your impressions what are your comments leave me some comments below that's how we we all continue on this journey right so i hope i have helped you increase your beer knowledge as we all continue on this journey of becoming beer connoisseurs and i encourage you to be on the lookout over the next few days when i release my next beer review video and until then [Music] enjoy", "0v6VE4aNkN8": "what happens if a ship falls into a big whirlpool whirlpools how dangerous can they be how deadly are they for human beings how destructive are they for vessels can whirlpools suck ships boats or even barges in or do they pose a danger only for human beings who fall into them in these shots you can see how the rafter Steve Fisher got sucked in by a powerful current that the athlete had the bad luck to encounter when descending the Congo River as part of a red bull sponsored competition Fisher a world-class athlete had a run-in with the mighty rapids of this African River yet this was not among the most dangerous whirlpools that exist on our planet and far from the most dangerous whirlpools and that are theoretically possible don't try at home what one of the world's top drafting pros barely managed to escape from and that was even with the help of others there are whirlpools much more dangerous than along the Congo River some of these vortexes in the water pose a threat not only to people would even heavier objects a boat a yacht a ship a barge even giant vessels can face destruction if any of them separately or together are sucked into one of these real aquatic monsters but let's start by taking a look at whirlpools themselves at what they are how they arise and what real danger and destructive force they pose no not like that whirlpools are not specially stirred up by anyone rather they form in their own due to internal processes currents in a body of water collide and merge and thereby they create circular flows that are made stronger by the turbulence as if the waters being turned inward if there is a deep hole under the water and above this hole tons of water are flowing from opposite directions towards each other a vortex is created and this is what a world actually is let's try to helpfully illustrate this principle with oddly enough a clockwork mechanism as we explained you'll understand why we chose precisely this as an example you can see how the tirelessness appears in a clockwork mechanism drive one another on by rotating as they constantly grip on one another with their teeth each of these gears rotates only because the entire ensemble of rotates together they never slowed down by friction against one another but rather they work together in mutual movement now imagine that these are not little gears at all but water currents the flow of water when there is turbulence and currents moving towards each other will rotate from the impact just like these gears the principle of torque is basically analogous only water unlike the gears in a clockwork mechanism there's more than just rotate and if there's the necessary turbulence it'll form a funnel that sucks things in thus for a whirlpool to arise in nature we need the following a sufficient mass of moving water the presence of currents moving in opposite directions within this mass and a pit that's deep enough to generate a flow that swells inward generally the fastest whirlpools are those of mountain rivers that can sometimes reach speeds of several miles per hour however mountain rivers do not have an amount of water sufficient to suck truly large objects in people and animals often perish in these currents but larger objects for example ships are just too big for mountain rivers to affect for those big objects you need to bring out the heavy artillery the salt Stroman whirlpool norway today is perhaps the world's most powerful naturally forming well pool it arises four times per day precisely every six hours in a straight that is one point eight six miles long and 492 feet wide and connects to salt Jordan and the skier stat fought with the Barents Sea in this hellish funnel there are gigantic volumes of water that move at unimaginable speeds over a single cycle the salt straw Manuel pulled circulates billions of cubic feet of liquid all in a speed of up to 23 miles per hour if a person fell into such a whirlpool then sadly the chances for survive aslim and even if a whole boat fell in it's believed that the salt straw and whirlpool does not pose a risk to large vessels but to avoid any tragedy traffic in the Strait is scheduled to avoid the times when the dangerous Norwegian whirlpool comes to life the Maelstrom a well pulled famous from Edgar Allan Poe's short story a descent into the Maelstrom similar whirlpools are found in Norwegian waters in the Norwegian Sea these are less brutal than the salt Stroman whirlpool but much more unpredictable and sneaky and so they are no less dangerous indeed they can be even more dangerous Maelstrom flotation barely ever exceeds eight miles per hour but these whirlpools are dangerous because of how sudden they can appear the rocks the currents everything here is set up in a way that makes it impossible to predict when the vortex will arise and how fast it will spin and when water will begin to be sucked into it maelstroms just like the salt storm and whirlpool can form several times per day but there's no rhyme or reason to their formation they might appear two or three times a day they might appear five or six times in such cases are known infamously people have been killed or severely injured in maelstroms on a number of occasions maelstroms are capable of overturning even small fishing boats and such incidences have happened today ships prefer to give these Norwegian monsters a wide berth in order to avoid tragedy the Naruto whirlpools these come in at number three in their danger to life and limb and are rightly called the Japanese wonder nowhere else in the world is there such a large number of powerful whirlpools in such close vicinity to one another it's practically impossible to escape them if you break free from one you immediately fall into another these vortexes spend only in the Naruto Strait under a bridge close to the city of Naruto three or four whirlpools conform at the same time on average every six hours the average diameter of each of the Naruto whirlpools is 50 feet but the diameter constantly changes depending on the frequency and intensity of the Evan flow in the Strait the peak activity of the Naruto well pulls occurs during the spring flood at that time these whirlpools grow to a diameter of 65 feet in the speed at which they rotate reaches as high as 13 miles per hour the Naruto whirlpools are a magnificent sight but only at a safe distance getting up close and personal with these wonders of nature is not recommended the salt Stroman well pool maelstroms the Naruto whirlpools these are gigantic vortexes that exist under natural conditions but let's imagine how big a whirlpool can grow that's created artificially through technological means for this we need to make the strongest current that already exists on our planet and make it spin through powerful turbulence causing the current to become even more deadly the world's most powerful current is the Antarctic circumpolar current also known as the west wind drift it flows around Antarctica and is approximately three times more powerful than the Gulf Stream the length of the west wind drift is over eighteen thousand six hundred miles and its maximum width is around one thousand five hundred and fifty three miles over one second this monster of a current moves 200 million tons of water along and over just one minute 12 billion tons this unimaginably fast amount of water dozens or hundreds of thousands of billions of tons is swept along at a speed of 190 feet per second now if we exploded say a few 20 to 30 Megaton atomic bombs around the perimeter of the west wind drift under the tectonic plates then due to the holes that are formed in the oceanic crust a whirlpool will be created with five to ten times faster than the raging river current that swept Steve Fisher alone imagine that rushing at you with the speed of a car is an entire ocean this is what our artificially created whirlpool would be like with the amount of water that would be involved hundreds of billions of tons of only would ships yachts boats and barges disappear and so would entire fleets of many thousands of vessels oil rigs and any other structure that's in the path of this wild Antarctic current in addition as a result of such a catastrophic development currents and even the sea level could change all over the globe will return to artificially created whirlpool shortly but for now let's turn away from these horror stories and back to reality and to our champion athlete Steve Fisher do you see how hard this was on the extreme athlete Fisher later says that he nearly drowned and that it was a miracle that he's still among the living he was saved by the fact that he had an air cylinder with him underwater Fisher was able to continue breathing with it for about a minute and then he was pulled ashore fish's many years of experience in the sport and high level of qualification was still not enough to save him from a run-in with this fast-moving River current even a whirlpool that's not among the world's strongest and nevertheless be a mortal danger and now here's a real example of an artificially created giant whirlpool that turned out to be thousands of times more dangerous than that one in the Congo 7 a.m. on Friday November the 21st 1980 at eeeem of drillers from Wilson brothers corporation was prospecting for oil underneath the bottom of Louisiana's Lake Pena however under the lake bed was an old salt mine and the drillers did not take this minor detail into account during the drilling a hole was punched into a shaft in the old mine at a depth of around 1,300 feet what happened is something that no one could have imagined the water plunged down into the space that had opened up instantly demolishing the walls vaulting and supports of the mine shaft on the surface an enormous whirlpool formed 180 feet in diameter and it destroyed a tugboat a drilling rig 11 barges a whole island with a Botanical Garden on it dozens of trucks and even several houses luckily not a single human life was lost a whirlpool of such immense power could easily pull the legendary Titanic to the bottom as that ship's mass was several times smaller than the total mass that the artificially created Lake Pina well pool sucked in the most surprising thing about this incident is that the video of it has got a lot of likes on the internet and only because luckily not a single human life was lost is there any chance that a person aboard a ship could survive after being sucked into such a mega whirlpool to make it out alive you'd need a seriously strong capsule that could withstand the water pressure of many tons and in addition that'd have to be a large amount of air in the capsule take for example what happened when the tugboat Jass gone for was crushed the tug boat capsized and sank off Nigeria on May the 26th 2013 everyone on board died except the ship's cook Harrison Okene he was fortunate enough to lock himself in an airtight cabin and survived underwater for three days before being rescued when rescuers bought akkanee up to the surface it turned out that an air pocket formed in the space where the cooker sought refuge and that's why Harrison Okene was not crushed however the chance is that any other person on a sinking ship would be so lucky a slim so to survive a mega well pool you need to be in a capsule which is a hermetically sealed air bubble and of course rescuers have to arrive quickly as you might soon run out of oxygen otherwise if there is no hermetically sealed compartment with an air pocket then the many tons of water around you will do their work they will instantly crush the space itself and everyone inside of it secondly such a powerful whirlpool always forms when the depths reach hundreds of feet and it's impossible to escape from such a depth just on your own although if the depth is not great not 13 to 1,700 feet but just 50 to 65 feet the chances are still slim a person would have to have an incredible level of physical fitness to swim up from under fifty or sixty five feet of water for an ordinary person already at a depth of ten feet due to the water pressure the diaphragm is unable to expand enough for the lungs to fully fill with air all-in-all whirlpools are no joke it's best to avoid them even the smallest ones even gentle little whirlpools can grow stronger at any moment leaving even experienced pros unable to get out of them that's all for today we hope you liked the video don't forget to tell us your suggestions for future topics in the comments if we choose your suggestion we'll mention you in a future video thanks for watching [Music] you", "YbbxXwCcZkU": "well hidy-ho my peeps and welcome to another Dollar Tree recipe this is Anna dinner this is actually a dessert or something you would serve maybe at breakfast or if you had people coming over we're going to make a coffee cake using Dollar Tree cake mix Dollar Tree apple filling let's even Dollar Tree sugar right there and Dollar Tree flour right there the only thing that isn't Dollar Tree is the butter I did buy some butter at the Dollar Tree recently it was good but actually in our area Costco still has the best price on butter you have to buy 4 pounds at a time but you get a pretty good savings so these two ingredients plus a half a cup of melted butter instead of oil I'm going to juice it up using the melted butter this will form the cake and then the topping will be the sugar the flour and the butter I'm going to add in a little bit of cinnamon as well I've prepped up my kitchen by getting my stove preheated to 350 and then I have this a 9 by 12 casserole pan I sprayed a little bit of my beloved coconut oil that you can pick up at the Dollar Tree looks like that sprayed out on the bottom then I laid down a piece of parchment it just makes it so much easier to get pieces of cake out of then I sprayed a little bit more on the top so now what we're going to do is mix our cake mix as it's suggested on the back with the butter and I'm gonna do that by hand I'm not going to use a a mixer I'm going to use a whisk because you don't want when you're making this kind of a cake you don't want it to be real smooth a little bit lumpy is actually good so I'm not going to get out the hand mixer I'm just gonna mix it up by hand with this so I'm gonna go ahead and do that I don't have my tripod with me but I'll go ahead and do it and then show you what it looks like okay you will see that in addition to everything I just told you it also required three eggs I forgot to tell you about the three eggs those did not come for Dollar Tree although I've purchased eggs there again those eggs came from Costco which is where I find I get the best price on that kind of stuff so you can see this is still pretty lumpy I mean it's not I didn't beat it 300 times like you normally do I probably stirred this up maybe 20 good strokes and that's all you need to do so now it's time I'm gonna go ahead and transfer my batter into that pan I'm just going to scrape it in with a spatula and smooth it on the top and then we will get to the apple filling part okay so I took my spatula and I just dropped the Apple filling on the top of this battered to kind of you know give it a little bit of a coverage across the top now all I'm going to do is I'm going to take my spatula and I'm just going to sort of lightly drag the apple filling just kind of lightly drag it through here I'm kind of cutting up pieces of Apple as I go you can tell I'm not trying to you know mix this from in a homogenized way I just want to kind of get those Apple pieces and that that thick sort of a police off all sort of mixed up in there okay that's all there is to that now what we're going to do again I'm going to do this off camera because it's easy enough just to tell you how to do it doesn't that look yummy okay so all I'm going to do is I'm going to dump my flour and my sugar into into this stainless steel bowl here's my butter it's been softening to room temperature I'm going to cut it up into little pieces just cut them right into this bowl that I'm going to use a fork and I'm going to you know mash that around as they say until it comes up with a crumbly consistency you can even get in there with your hands after you've got the butter pretty well mixed in and you can kind of crumble it together with your hands so I'm going to go ahead and get that done and show you what it looks like okay I did manage to finish this darn thing I've already pulled out a piece I wanted to show you how nicely it cuts and comes out of the the pan with using the parchment paper here is the first piece and as he usual we are going to take this into mr. grant and see if he can see if he can give me his honest opinion I haven't tasted this yet I don't know if it's good better and different so here we go there you go honey thank you give that a little try see what you think you got to leave some crumbs in your beard for the cat to find well grant has a magnificent beard doesn't he good do you like it oh yeah ROK's good I'm so glad I'm so glad do you want me to flood it in half and half for you whenever you just like that okay once you hand that back to me I'll take them back into didn't give me the fork I'll come back with a spoon that will be long okay so I'm gonna grant likes a have is desserts floated in half and half okay honey and and are we still yeah we're still going so I'm gonna put a little half in half and here for him take it back to him and then I'm gonna try a piece myself so I'm gonna flip this around am I gonna flip it around yeah I'm gonna flip it around yeah so I messed that up obviously I'll be putting the actual recipe in the downbar so the places where I screwed up I'm gonna try to remember to put it on the screen too so you know I can catch that um sorry I missed all the good stuff where I showed you how to mix the the crumble I'll probably do this video to the show yeah thank you David I'll probably do this video again but I just wanted to jump back in the saddle do something dollar tree ish and and yeah so I will I'm gonna edit this thing together and upload I'll talk to you guys later bye well you guys I cannot believe I screwed this video up so badly I forgot to tell you that you were supposed to add water forgot about the eggs then I went and instead of using half a cube of butter which was the quarter cup required for the topping I used an entire stick a half a cup and I couldn't figure out why my butter wasn't like you know crumbling in the way it was supposed to it was staying off you know lumpy well it was because I had too much better so I had to sift out about half of the butter then you know incorporate it so I lost a bunch of footage you didn't see the topping when it was really finished you didn't see me put it on and you didn't see me put the cake in the oven god what an idiot well it has been close to an hour I pulled the cake out a few minutes ago I'm gonna let it cool then I'm gonna cut it up and we're gonna have grant test it like we always do yeah I am I'm rusty I have to get back in the saddle with my with my recipe video so sorry about that you guys I'll do better next time", "CWKmEsXNexo": "[Music] apple-pie could be really simple we have these crusts which are whole-grain butter crust that we showed you how to make in another video and once I got both of these rolled out here I can start putting this stuff together for the filling we're gonna just fold this puppy up yes and it'll be ready to go on top so this is my filling and these are very thinly sliced apples really really thin whew and it's important to taste the Apple because that's gonna tell you how much sweetener you need to put in there if they're really tart you're gonna need more if they're really sweet don't need less these are pretty sweet now I don't use an unrefined cane sugar and this has the molasses still in it which is good that's there's a lot of nutrients in there and it also has a lot of flavor because of that don't putting that in there I'm gonna put that under fine cane sugar in it's about a half a cup I'm also gonna put some cinnamon and some fresh nutmeg at your discretion how much you want and a little bit of salt it's important to put salt in that brings out the sweetness actually of the apples and everything and a little arrowroot powder this is a fairly natural thickener I'm just gonna put a little bit of that in and that also you you want to get a feel for how juicy your apples are because the more juicy they are the more thickener you'll need so I'm gonna toss this all together just with my hands here can I borrow your car keys well here's the thing here's the thing my car is in the shop and it won't be back for a couple of days Darryl and Steve have gone off to buy some stuff for the man room and so you want these to get all covered here like this and Jane is oh really oh thanks and then I'm just gonna put this in the pie crust here this here it comes this will look like it's way more apples then ever should go in there and that's exactly what it should look like you want to piled really high in there this was about five to seven apples where are they in my purse okay and don't be afraid of putting that kind of juice that is left over down here in the bottom of the bowl that's just all good it's all good stuff I can smell the cinnamon and the Nutmeg ah where's your purse yeah there we go it's all there it's all happening in the pie and I'm going to trim the edges my ovens preheated to 350 degrees and it'll bake for about an hour and everybody in my entire family is going to love me when I pull up fresh apple pie out of the oven you're out of gas doing this on the edge of a pie is not just for beauty although it is quite beautiful it also seals the top crust to the bottom crust so that everything stays in there and bakes very nice and I will also need to put a couple of little steam holes for those apples to steam as they're cooking right in the top of the pie and you can get really fancy with that or just make a little crisscross okay and this goes in the oven whoops got to open it first and I'm going to put the pie in the oven and then later I may put my head in the oven this is pie for anything [Music]", "13hAFV8Wt2I": "hello guys today we're going to make apple muffins that I know how it looks like a lot of ingredients but it's really okay so let's go ahead and get started I'm gonna go ahead and add the wet ingredients so I want to add an applesauce oops just took a piss off on me I hope you guys are doing well say it's a beautiful day outside so always love that okay so next we're going to go ahead and put in some maple syrup he used eight sir probably to you about to work we're using two sweeteners here we're putting in our maple syrup and then we're going to go in all the ingredients were in the description box don't worry rich natural sweetness these muffins I'm just going to stare all the back together here then I'm going to throw in some Apple of course we could be so I just shredded the Apple bring that in there and you really don't even need to try to add more than apple sauce will give you the flavor of Apple is just fun okay spices that's actually not manic here I never throw accessing throwing something out extract it also joins in lunch the rest as long as fast and that will work great a sprout don't mess if you written down you so I can follow along and make sure that I'm not missing anything since then I gotta be basil okay so let's go ahead and act dried beans I've got got a cut the whole flower and then I'm gonna do 3/4 cups of flour know you'd be all a plumber if you wanted to but I was the mixture of the south from Italy and spelt flour it's not gluten free but it does help you if you have digestive issues it helps you it digests better so that works great the other stuff so be careful if you keep this up we're working areas I'm going to go ahead guys that's why we're going to need about 1/4 of a cup of starts so tapioca starch corn starch whatever that you want to add in butter would work I'm gonna go ahead and get my corn starch I need to have on my apron but I decide about the railing today I might regret back roots might regret not wearing an apron but we're just gonna roll with it but just going to roll with it got my oven preheated over there nothing's are gonna bake about 25 20 or 25 minutes let's see if we're missing anything of course for missing their making higher see this is what I have everything right now I need to know how much I need to know what I'm missing no man baking powders and that is a price I told you it looks like a lot of ingredients and look like it's gonna be hard but it's not that hard it's really simple muffin Apple muffin recipe and you're gonna love it so let's go ahead and beat my muffin so all I have are these jumbo muffin huh so that's when we can use this see how that works so no today in about six because that I'm going to go ahead and click the message in here my favorite lipstick I don't know how this is going to work if these other things are like huge but let's be civil work and I've got an optional little topping you can put on these if you want to once I put everything myself let's try you're gonna be perfect look in my soul [Music] [Music] I'm having by the morning as you can see so take you some hippie surfer Bobby whatever you got it mixed actually shoot your hands you just want to mix it together it's gonna form a nice little to put on top of your muffins I'm only gonna put this on top of three of them [Music] then I'm gonna breweries nothing's in the other he's spitting it on really pretty it's okay to travel in these jailbroken so these are going to go in the oven at 350 for about 20 to 25 [Music] [Applause] [Music] right I've already eaten come home up in here hmm the whole house smells like apples and cinnamon and then the house gives me a deck so go ahead you know what you gotta do you go like this beating subscribe it more so you doesn't make this recipe it's like molasses apple muffins the molasses really come through okay guys I will see you later thank you so much for watching like I said it's a beautiful day the sun is shining the birds are singing so working on my side muffin see you later [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "JHj0hYRSH1U": "hey this is Cameron welcome back to the busy gardener Channel today we are gonna do something really exciting late June we're gonna harvest some boys and berries let's get busy [Music] boysenberries are one of these yummy berries they're really tasty as if you've had them before they like a blackberry but with a little bit more tartness to them gosh I think they're a mix between a blackberry and a Logan berry if I remember correctly and so the story goes Walter not of Knott's Berry Farm fame was on the the property of Rudolph poison and Rudolph poison he had this farm and he had these couple of just decrepit bushes sitting in the corner of his farm and Walter not saw these things and when implanted them propagated them and essentially put the boysenberry on the map these berries are incredible and they're very unique flavor - they're not like a standard blackberry I love making them into a jam or preserves that's another thing Knott's Berry Farm is really famous for as well as you know making action the reason I'm up here right now is to harvest a bunch to make into a boysenberry pie and so I'm gonna got my colander ready I'm gonna take this thing I'm gonna fill this up and see how we do on our boysenberry harvest let's look up close at some of these things these boys and berries you see a lot of them have just been as the temperatures have heated up are ripening and look just so incredible you know when you're picking boys and berries you'll notice that you've got some that are like a lighter red kind of a medium red then you've got these darker ones it looks like a wine color you're looking really ideally for something that's almost I'm I'm gonna try to get this in the Sun so you can see it something that's this color or even darker another way to tell if a boysenberry is ripe is to look and see if these little I don't even know what these call these little bubbles here the individual seeds you want these to be like very separated if they're very tight then regardless of the color they're probably not quite ripe so you notice that these here are very tight they're all really close together this one kind of also but let's find one that we think it is I think this one is probably really ripe another way you can tell is by they should come off with just a little bit of pulling pressure I was making the mistake before of taking and kind of popping them off this way and you can get them to pop off that way without breaking the stem but this is gonna be very immature unripe one compared to this beautiful one over here so even though it came off you want it to come off when you pulling straight down on it with very little pressure and that usually is an indicator that something is ripe but look at all of these I'm gonna get to harvesting oh my goodness this one if this isn't a perfect example of a ripe one I don't know what it is oh my goodness look at how separated those things are this is gonna be so yummy I'm gonna try all of these you're gonna see it so first I'm gonna try the medium one the one that I think is ripe but I'm not 100% sure about yeah that's good this would be a really good one in a good stage you put it in some sort of preserve because it's not quite there but any of those sugars well one it has pectin like a naturally occurring pectin in it so it's going to help to solidify and firm up a jelly or Jam but it's a little tart and so putting it in a preserve if you're gonna use sugar like you usually ought to that's gonna cover up for some of that so the flavors all they're just not entirely sweet here's one that I know is immature let me taste this one though which I just popped off not bad I mean if you're out here hunting for berries to put in to preserve her into some sort of pie that's okay eaten fresh it's not as good this one I'm expecting flavor I'm expecting sweetness fully developed flavor mmm that is what a boysenberry supposed to taste like sweet jammy fully developed flavor oh that's so yummy something that's been really difficult with these boys and berries is that I planted them and these are in most places in the country and invasive species now thankfully here we're pretty dry so they can't find purchase as easily as they do in the Pacific Northwest like Oregon Washington places like that where they just grow like crazy but they're totally invading my blueberries over here you'll notice here where I originally planted them by the fence we took him out of there and yet they still keep cropping up they're cropping up in the middle of our oranges and they're climbing and using our mandarins is a little scaffolding for themselves so these things really you plant them and make sure you got them in a place that you want them because they will run and crop up another places now truth be told even though these are growing wild right here and I don't really want them in this space when I see all the extra berries that are there I'm not entirely angry that it's there so once the berries come off then I'll rip them out until that I'm going to enjoy the berries [Music] something different that I've done this year compared to other years is I've really done a good job of putting and training these along the trellis the trellis wire and just wrapping it around so even if there are two or three berry plants coming up I'm just wrapping them all around and this has made it a lot easier to pick last year we had a ton of vegetative growth tons of thorns to even look at the berries we had to keep lifting up these things and you can see just these berries hanging in here like crazy I got this idea when I went berry picking up in Oregon last year I'm gonna go again this year it's gonna be good I'll do a video probably then two of these gorgeous gorgeous berry fields but doing this method where I just kind of looping along the wire exposes the fruit keeps you from having to wear gloves to come out here and harvest because all the berries are exposed gonna make it a lot easier this time now my trellis is split in half this half the first half that I've been showing you is all boys and berries these are ready to harvest right now but kind of using that successive ripening idea keeping that in mind here we have our triple crown blackberries and you can see that these are just flowering and have some very immature fruit on them that are gonna be ready probably I don't know and another month or so so it's nice to come out and have a couple of months a solid berry picking a lot of fun to come out here and do that hey Michelle yes what are we gonna do with all these berries what's the hook on Wednesday I'm hoping to make a homemade boysenberry pie on Wednesday I hope to eat homemade poison berry pie let's get pickin there's so much on here how are we doing over here so far probably two cups to go super awesome so good let me see what you have in your hand do you get a good one I put it in there hey thanks for tuning in to this episode of the busy gardener Channel still have a whole lot of berries yet to pick what are some things that you do with poison berries if you made any kind of pie maybe you've got a recipe you can put in the comments down below I'd love to check out

good that's very good", "iIpJ7O0ytBE": "hi everyone I'm frightened so I had a craving for apple pie and I thought well how about I make that once upon a time apple pie that I made that was snow white themed from right at the beginning I mean it was one of those pies actually was one of those first posts that kind of took off and people were starting to recognize and notice the blog I realized I hadn't actually made a video how to show you how to make the apple pie so to make this recipe you're going to need to make you go first so to make this you're going to need two and a quarter cups of flour mix it in a mixer with 185 grams of softened butter mix it in with one third of a cup of white sugar two eggs and a tablespoon of milk once that's mixed just wrap it in cling wrap and refrigerate that for half an hour you're also going to need eight granny apples 45 grams of butter half a cup of sugar 1 teaspoon of cinnamon quarter teaspoon of cloves and you're also going to need chipboard letters from a craft store that way you can write out your once upon a time or whatever letters or words that you want to say so I'm going to start by peeling these apples so give me a few minutes and I'll come back so in the saucepan we're going to pop in the 45 grams of butter and let that melt and then when the butter is melted pop in your half a cup of sugar and give that a stir pour in your Apple pieces sir to mix it all together I'm just going to pour juice a little bit of water in the bottom pop in about a teaspoon of cinnamon cloves and stir to mix that then we're going to cover this and just let it cook for 10 minutes until all the Apple is softened all right so we've got all these letters so what I'd like to do is lay them out first there we go we've got it laid out on all I need to do is just press them down so they really embed in and then take them off in cases where I've got small pieces here so grab a skewer that way you can press down now that those are all pressed in we just need to go in and this where I grab a skewer and just lift it that's what it looks like want to impress tin and all the pieces have come out now before I fill the pan with the Apple hi I'm just going to cut out my dough so I'm not having to do it once it's in the pan now the apples down we're going to pour that into a pan and what I'm gonna do with my little letters that are those could be reuse so just make sure you set them aside I'm going to top this up here alright so I'm going to do is I'm going to pull back all the edges victim paper some support was going on I'll roll back the paper underneath wait go now if you want to you can grab a knife now and just cut the rest of the excess I want to put this in the oven this is preheated to 180 degrees I'll just let this bake for 30 minutes", "cGU-Csw6-m8": "hi there my lovelies so I just absolutely love this mason jar trend that's been happening lately so I decided to show you how to make three amazing pies and mini mason jars I'm going to be making a cinnamon apple bourbon blackberry in the peach crumble pie first we're going to start by making our pie crust add in your flour sugar and salt to your mixer and give it a quick mix to mix all of your ingredients together next we're gonna add some cubed cold butter so you're gonna want to mix it for a few minutes until the butter has broken down you'll still see little clumps of butter but that's okay now I'm going to add in ice-cold water one tablespoon at a time to get the right consistency this is the texture you want we want to basically form even your hands but not stick if you accidently add too much water and it's sticky add a little more flour now that my dough is finish I'm gonna place it in some plastic wrap and let it chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes so I'm going to take my plastic wrap and with my hands push down on the dough so it all combines together and then with my rolling pin I'm going to lightly roll the dough into the plastic wrap help prevent drying out and cracking okay now into the fridge so I've peeled you slice an apple and peach and rinsed and drained a package of blackberries I'm going to add some sugar and brown sugar to each bowl just do you guys know the full recipes in the description below now I'm going to add a couple different flavors to each pie filling to give them unique flavors so to my blackberries I'm going to add some bourbon the alcohol will cook off in the oven so that's dessert and stay for anyone to eat - my apples I'm going to add some cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to my peaches I'm going to add in some vanilla extract make me a wife you could even add half a vanilla pod then we're just going to mix everything together when you're mixing your blackberries go ahead and mash up the berries to create a jammy texture so I have some water here I'm going to add some cornstarch to it to make a slurry once it's all mixed together I'm going to divide it evenly between my three pie fillings oh you can smell the Bourbon it smells so good there's just something about bourbon and blackberries that goes really well together mmm I'm just gonna let these hang out in the fridge until we're ready to use them so I think our pie crust is ready I'm going to pull it out of the refrigerator and roll it out I'm going to flour my working surface and my rolling pin you want your dough to be about a quarter of an inch thick once it's rolled out take a biscuit cutter and cut out a large circle and then carefully place it into your jar I'm just going to continue with the rest of my chart just use your fingers just to move everything out just like that have your scraps together and roll your dough out again to use for the top of your pies so for my apple pie I'm gonna make a crosshatch top you can use a pizza cutter or a regular knife to make your strips then take a bit cutter the same size of the top of your jar and cut out your dough and there you have it the perfect crosshatch top crust you're just gonna add your apples about 3/4 of the way full and then place your crust right on top gently pressing down on the edges for my blackberry pie is I'm going to do a simple X top crust so again roll out your dough scraps cut out your top crust circles and with a small knife cut an X in the center then place it on top of your filling and gently push down on the edges now for a peach pies I'm going to do something a little different for the crust I'm going to use the same crumble topping that I use for my peaches and cream crumble video I'll link that video at the end if you want to learn how to make this super simple topping this recipe can actually make up to four of each pie depending on what size jar you use so the last step before we bake these is to brush some egg whites on top and sprinkle them with sugar now we're going to place these in the oven at 375 degrees for thirty minutes and then they're ready to eat add a scoop of vanilla at chromel ice cream for an extra little touch I hope you'd give at least one of these pies a try and let me know in the comments below what's your favorite kind of pie I want to know and also don't forget to subscribe it's free bye my lovely you see you next Saturday", "UFZyDK4w884": "yeah I think the guy who drew the artwork for these games used to work for Walt Disney so not surprised Reagan's lair play as the heroic Dirk the daring the valiant knight on a rescue to the fairway from the clutches of evil great Prince's name is Daphne and we learned how to pronounce that name last night [Music] all right [Music] yeah we need a substance Eddington Oh close like a drawing time oh yo fresh we'll watch the intro this this is the art original arcade intro when the cabinet was idle Dragon's Lair look bad as the adventure will you become a valiant light on a quest to rescue the fair princess from the clutches of an evil dragon you control the actions of a daring adventurer finding his way through the castle of a dark wizard I love the staticky noise on the screen to make VHS 83 baby so the thing about drink is lair is you guys have to understand when you walk into an arcade and you're surrounded by games like Tetris Galaga [ __ ] pac-man space invaders okay a guerra like that and then all of a sudden you see this machine that literally has a [ __ ] cartoon plane and you control the character it was mind-blowing it was like how could they possibly do this in that time in 1983 this machine was like this game was like so ahead of its time you just didn't comprehend in right it was kind of like the equivalent of when when what's it called Donkey Kong [Music] but Donkey Kong Country first came though for the Super Nintendo yeah I see what you're saying calls and you know they had all this pre-rendered [ __ ] so it was really clever what they did with this of course it's all cutscenes that's how I worked around it but back in the arcade days like this machine was [ __ ] expensive for me I think around the time where everything was like 25 to 50 cents this machine was like a dollar so when I was a kid I did not have the ball to play this game and it looked [ __ ] hard I saw all the adults play it I didn't know what the hell they were doing because I'm just watching it and like mesmerized and not understanding like what the controls because there's nothing on the screen that tells you what to do and they're just controlling the cutscenes so I thought it was like mind boggling and I didn't understand how like different capture scenes worked like that back then so it was it was [ __ ] madness bro so yeah like this these games laserdisc games or art are really really sick ok see if I can fix the video sighs my cat will just fullscreen it it's not a big deal you the research I think Enzo put it too put it - what's a coal hey we'll just fullscreen this [ __ ] we'll just fullscreen like re3 Louise the re3 over there No you it should have a good change all right let's play ok so I was looking at some of the settings and I don't really know which settings we should use definitely should max out the last [ __ ] here's the way to get infinite logic to do that move beeps we'll keep on moved I definitely have on then the original arcade version it showed you nothing on the [ __ ] screen the controls are literally up-down left-right and attack and it's just I guess I'd cancer our cake at with the phone off so the arcade version play the original scene order from the arcade cabinet easy [Music] the homers is the original laser this version of the game third must pass through each scene before I think we should do the home version just so we see all the cutscenes and difficulty easy we'll have more time to react for certain scenes some difficult moves have been removed [Music] we should pipe it on hard and see how that goes oh we should play on the hardest setting first alright alright let's do this you if it's too hard then [ __ ] it we'll play on easy [Music] in the arcade version I haven't even have that scene for something oh I think I [ __ ] I see how spoons press right twice dude in the arcade version it wouldn't tell you anything you just have to know you lose your [ __ ] dollar right there like this game is hard as balls if we match this can I go show you guys there is an arcade version man I'll show you all [ __ ] stupidest to at least a shoal something there but still I think you guys going to see the screen a lot by the way man you're gonna be fast dude who's like Oh [Music] [Music] but his screams are so funny dude no [Music] [Music] I [ __ ] press right oh no Rapids okay how am I supposed to kill the press up here how the [ __ ] would you figure that out oh god okay this is obvious dude you be screaming too if you're in this [ __ ] situation [Applause] okay good let's let's continue thank god this is just scary bro what this whole castle is a Disney [Music] revitalize Daphne that's sound effect [Music] once again I'll have to remind you guys that the original arcade version had no prompts on the [ __ ] screen you literally just had to figure it out and you would go broke trying to beat this [ __ ] English is he stabbed in the back bro you this game is designed to eat your money exactly it was oh [ __ ] holy [ __ ] down [Music] [Music] [Music] and there you can choose different hats too in this game which is really sick but we're playing so we see all the customs Oh God holy [ __ ] oh my god okay that seemed looked impossible like without the prompts you would be dead there's no way do don't get my ass kicked that I do have prompts like I said after this I want to show you guys the original arcade version I want to show you guys how impossible [Music] Oh God oh my god I like ice cream damn it I think that chad has counted how many how many ladies have spent on the game how many times have I [ __ ] up guys 14 dude that's not even enough for a for a [ __ ] apex gun skin I can't even buy anything apex legends with that apex gun skin is $20 oh [ __ ] like sometimes the game has mercy on you and shows you at him man up for days [ __ ] [Music] this sounds e makes or so I thought we just did this [ __ ] oh it's another way to try to trick me dude reusing accents what'd you say oh [ __ ] what'd you say no [Music] Jesus bounce if you actually saw come on [ __ ] I didn't let three times bro if you're in the medieval times and you went down the elevator that's looking faster you [ __ ] your pants oh [ __ ] I remember this [ __ ] I remember people swearing at the arcade arcade cab during this [ __ ] cutscene this is notorious this is cancer [Music] - it was cancer this dude is on my ass slice them holy Kate how are you supposed to figure this out in the arcade I just wanted him five times you're telling me someone figured that out on their own what I didn't see a prompt hold the [ __ ] weapon rack what the [ __ ] fifty dollars deep at this point bro I'd be [ __ ] broke-ass by here and dude I'm talking about one with the swing six times that's GG there's no way to get past that scene oh my god [Music] no not the [ __ ] marbles again slice it Oh God reuse assets Oh hopefully doesn't trick me drink me okay so it requires you to memorize certain scenes and if you have it in the reverse you gotta remember the opposite directions that's crazy Google is over [Music] what whoops dude the time it is so fast [Music] okay oh no not this [ __ ] again [Music] [Music] [Music] what [Music] [Music] this is fine this is the status tree Firefly right now this is fine [Music] [Music] [Music] what what this was supposed to do there [Music] okay that shake hand fall oh [ __ ] what there's a different time guys it was a different time a better time [ __ ] don't weigh all the way back here [ __ ] impossible [Music] [ __ ] it's hard to see the damn arrows because the [ __ ] goal is the same color [Music] [Music] save me the cage is locked was the key the dragon keeps it around his neck to slay the dragon use the magic sword run run nice no come on I pressed it so [ __ ] fast okay it's three swings in a row it's three swings in a row god damn it you guys are understand this is explosively difficult difficult yeah this is this final boss [ __ ] you just the Regal bro yeah this game separates men boys clothes almost [ __ ] up there the damn sword okay three swings [Music] nice [ __ ] the tacky we win no consent they'll consent [Music] so how many tries that take us while technically chinking not changing what am I saying cheating I was gonna say thinking and she at the same time [Music] 29 that's with the arrows that's with the air if I had no arrows would be impossible especially that one scene where you got to swim like five [ __ ] times but it gives you the mood yeah that's what I'm saying that's worth cheating basically 29 death so how much in our case do it be like in the arcades when I played it was like a dollar each and that was back then when games were like 25 cents to 50 cents that's why when I was a kid dude I was I was like way too poor and way too afraid to play this game it looked so insanely hard and it is hard it's basically memorization yeah here I'm gonna show you guys the actual actual arcade machine and I'll show you guys the ridiculousness of it a second I'm good oops Kevin gonna set up for us here the actual actual arcade version - version brain-dead for laserdisc games I got pretty much all of them [Music] you dragons lair of fantasy adventure - a as the actual cancer at least to tell you some stuff on the screen there's nothing on the screen there is nothing on the screen you literally just have to know definitely boys to men this is boys them into the extreme sometimes the screen will give you hints just to show mercy on you and believe it or not there is no pink in you there is no continue you will start from the beginning of the [ __ ] game if you lose all your lives [Music] boys the men I was boys the men honey lives per dollar it's between three and five four it depends on what the arcade owner is sets it to right but it's usually like three lives it's too oh it's too long for me to remember as a kid but like like I said like this kind of game was kind of like it was so pristine back then because like I say you stepped the arcade you see all these [ __ ] games like space invaders and Tetris and pac-man is [ __ ] and then you see this game here like wow like this game is amazing you know it is just so expensive and so difficult right but it was a very amazing game yeah so if you--if you had the game of completely memorized I mean I guess you can show off to people and show them the whole thing but yeah okay uh we're gonna jump ahead now to 1984 we're gonna play time go and then we're gonna bounce back to space ace so let me a sort of time go here you [Music] so I showed you guys a little preview of time go on the Sega Saturn but like I said most laserdisc games the ports of laserdisc games are most of them are pretty bad the only good ones are ones that came I reported to PlayStation 1 or higher or PC but for the most thing you gotta use that emulation you should just do straight image because anything that's poured over two Sega CD or Sega Saturn right is most of it is garbage there are really bad ports how did you play laserdisc games there's a there's a laser the specific laser discs emulate emulator called Daphne you got to use that okay you before we get picture okay good we're good so this is the actual arcade version we're playing right now but it does have on-screen prompts so this is the actual arcade version come on make sure the volume is good for this [Music] start by blasting your ears [Music] so this will be tough because once again I don't think we have continues in this but at least we have on-screen prompts guys it was a different time it was a different time a different time [Music] it was 1984 those 1984 guys [Music] Oh [ __ ] it was an action but he knows an action button [Applause] [Music] take that go up shoot the enemy go down [Music] [Laughter] [Laughter] [Applause] good tired I love this D oh [ __ ] it changes directions it tricked me no that's the chat that's laughing right now the action one throws me off go down [ __ ] it [Music] we had a 33% chance of getting that right the chat told me to go down so I blame that on you guys didn't see anything come on nice I'll share in the future 2001 2001 baby [Applause] goddamn [Music] [Applause] [Music]

crash I'm gonna die you're gonna get me [ __ ] killed that makes no sense [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right we'll see you guys know what you're talking about you [ __ ] idiot [Music] [Music] [Applause] okay well obviously not to do now [Applause] [Music] we're all gonna see the enemy best you guys were to next level for this game all right go straight Oh No Ice Age oh that one was

these games man [Music] your back and we'll play space [Music] [Music] [Music] all right [Music] a heroic ace who must stop the evil commander Worf from taking over the earth more plans to reduce all humankind to infants and take over the planet only two people have the courage and strength to stop dwarf and save earth the beautiful Kimberly and the heroic ace as they approach bore stronghold ace

[Music] is in your hand Oh regain his manhood I will boys all right this is 98 before Matt guys they're [ __ ] kick-ass games in 1984 kick ass all right all right well it's floating the same pretty much the same options as last time I mean I guess we turn the boobs off and the bees are annoying move guys definitely on arcade cadet our captain or ace there's three difficulty settings I mean we already know what we're gonna pick [Music] there we go there's worship oh I love the music already oh [ __ ] [Music] energize their Rashid Oh ah [Music] I like how you still I was like when he's the kid he's like still like super hardcore you know [Music] holy [ __ ] look at the sequence aha boy is here [Music] [Music] I thought money was ease [Music] No [Music] dude I have a fraction of a second in confession get ready and ready what you want to hold it down or something I think at the hold it down or there might be another button that I don't know about what the [ __ ] I'm gonna mash it [Music] what okay it must be a different key or something left am i pressing left's you got you guys see a left arrow I just see energized that's all I see cuz the left is lining up oh maybe you're right no don't know I don't see you left I just see the gun that's it maybe it's a different key we don't know about athos spacebar though because it's left on the animation oh right it didn't tell us though that's odd maybe the game [ __ ] up there and it gave us the wrong command yeah we'll just remember that for next time good I though it seems like every time it says energized we can't use the gun if maybe it's like only if we have it we can skip a cutscene yeah because I didn't use it I just press it up instead there it's hard for me to read the chat score very hard OC house really use my gun there [Music] Oh Wow and it has a different button maybe if control I'm going to guess this controller okay so if it just shows the gun its spacebar and if it says energized I think it's control I press spacebar backs and there we go we get lots of the funds control doesn't work I don't know the controls are we can't get further if we don't figure out what the damn control is for this unless we don't fire and it's one of those things again where we have to wear the right lights up okay thanks I was just about to say unless be at the Dodge [Music] you [Music] Wow wait wait holy [ __ ] I can't imagine what the arcade version of this game is like [Music] [Music] [Music] No [Music] just check the PC version guys if you can help you find the controls for the energizer it's not control I try control could be alter something or shared [Music] [Music] nice Jesus this is such a long cutscene look at this this is [ __ ] crazy what's going on Oh No don't timing the game is frozen that's the end like this you you die Gigi you you see vertices kind of bugged we always have the original arcade version would you like to exit no continue you and inserts coin it's not a [ __ ] arcade port I see the pause symbol that just brings up the options I think it's [ __ ] guys you guys find out what the other control was No Oh No there's that tons of controls [Music] / let me try relaunching again real quick just in case if it doesn't work then we could try the arcade version but it would be impossible it would be virtually impossible without knowing the directions because you [ __ ] impossible [Music] Oh Oh you could continue maybe this will work where is the same this is yeah this is seen before see if it goes further yeah this week this scene is so [ __ ] long I couldn't imagine spending a dollar on this [ __ ] [Music] please work it's thought it's actually [ __ ] dude no this port sucks what should we do what should we do there's a million parts of this game though I'm sure I can

Rock and drink is layer two but tomorrow we're gonna play 1984 is I want to get to the golden era of gaming those play some 1984 games tomorrow and then at some point we will play some more laserdisc games I hope you guys enjoyed those allege of this games we're gonna do some our e3 speedruns now and yeah man thanks for showing up guys all right time to do some runs", "tMcZkCCEJag": "hi everybody and welcome back so today we're going to be taking a look at two flavor well we're going to be testing out two flavors from the glass basic lime the first one is going to be the banana cream pie and the next one is going to be the sugar cookie um if you don't know my favorite all-time favorite blueberry flavor is actually their blueberry cake absolutely loved it i haven't really gotten any other ones somebody i think sent me that or i got it because somebody recommended it the blueberry one fell in love with it i even made a dupe on my diy um on elr for my diy flavors and i vape it all the time because i like it that much so we're gonna go ahead and take a look at these i do have mine in three milligrams of nicotine they do come in 60 ml bottles these are actually 70 30 vgpg and the banana cream pie is described as a banana cream pie so original so this is what it looks like so that's the banana cream pie again 70 30 vgpg and they do come in 60 ml bottles the next one that i have is the sugar cookie and the sugar cookie also comes in 60 ml bottle and 3 milligrams of nicotine is my preferred with um 60 ml bottle 70 30 vgpg so let me see the description of this one we already got the description of this one is actually cinnamon glaze sugar cookies i am so excited i love sugar cookies i love banana and banana cream pie and banana pudding and everything bananas so i'm really really excited so let's go ahead and do this now i do have a fresh wick right here which of course i do because i always have a fresh wig and let's go ahead and shake that up and i'm so excited you have no idea okay i'm not smelling it yet let me turn this up okay fresh wig and i'm dripping and i'm pulsing and i'm dripping and i'm posting oh i'm smelling it i'm smelling it oh my god i'm so excited this is like one of the these are definitely like on my top list to try because of that blueberry just because of the blueberry that's what's getting me to try this so here we go banana cream pie again that's what the bottle looks like and let's give it a big this is definitely like a banana cream pie on a graham cracker crust that's what it tastes like to me it's got definitely that graham cracker crust it's giving me a natural not a candy banana um it's not a heavy banana but the mixture it just works really really well together i like that a lot that graham crust really really gives it more flavor i thought that it was going to be like i'm getting so vaped out in here i thought that it was going to be more of just like a regular crust but it's a graham crust that makes it makes the flavor even better i really like this they did it to me again this is really really good yum yum okay so now on to the sugar cookie and again 70 30 vgpg and i have my three milligrams of nicotine and i have a fresh wig excited i've been dying to try this sugar cookie as a matter of fact i wanted to try to diy it before i even got it because i love sugar cookies now the only thing is is that depending on the amount of cinnamon in it is if i can actually vape it because for a long period of time usually with cinnamon vapes i can't really vape cinnamon vapes often because i actually have an allergic reaction in my mouth from cinnamon vapes but i found that if i just take a little by little like you know i'll have a little bit today just like a few puffs and then maybe tomorrow i didn't do it that way but i can't vape it all day because that's when i get the reaction so i worked around it so here we go i'm gonna go ahead and drip on here of course another fresh wick i smell cookie oh my god you don't understand when i see cookies i smell cookies i'm like i'm your best friend like if you want me you want to get to my heart just give me cookies so there we go i'm gonna go ahead and put the cap on okay got the cap on got that turned up and let's have a vape this tastes like a warm cookie that just came out of the oven fresh and buttery and just oh so the cinnamon is very light on it but it is there you can tell that it's got cinnamon but it's not an overwhelming cinnamon that cookie comes through so buttery so warm so almost crispy i can imagine it being crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside absolute glass never let me i'm telling you i wish i had stock in the company and that's all i'm saying that is a really really good sugar cookie it's a cinnamon sugar or cinnamon glazed sugar cookie it just tastes so good it really does that is a good sugar cookie if you like sugar cookie and you can vape cinnamon i guarantee you you will like this definitely definitely a must try along with our blueberry cake just saying but anyway just for this for this review it's just the sugar cookie and it's the banana cream pie and both of them literally blew my my mind they really did oh my god if i was to tell you which one's my favorite just out of these two i would probably go with the sugar cookie first i love the banana cream pie but like if i had to grab one i'd probably grab the sugar cookie before that especially if i could vape cinnamon all day long this would be my all day vape absolutely amazing this one i like a little bit better because i can literally envision a warm cookie coming out of the oven and i love love love warm cookies i really do and you can taste like the butteriness and you can taste the sugar on it and you can taste the cinnamon i'm not really getting a glaze i'm getting more of a sugar um like sweet sugar but it's lingering it's lingering it's really really good so yeah so that was the glass basics sugar cookie and um banana cream pie let me know your thoughts down below have you tried either of these and if you have which was your favorite and if you haven't and tried both have you tried either one of them let me know down in the comments and also tell me what your favorite e-liquid is like favorite brand and name of it i would love to know your thoughts down below and i will see you in the next one bye",

you guys have a very happy holidays for this French apple pie you'll need sugar baking powder about 5 to 6 medium to small sized apples a stick of softened butter 1 egg salt vanilla extract cinnamon and flour don't forget all ingredients and directions will be in a recipe which I have posted in the description box below we're gonna start out with our apples peeled cored and sliced and I've already added 3/4 a cup of sugar and 2 teaspoons of flour here so next that was 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon 1/4 a teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract I added 1/4 a cup of water and 1 tablespoon of butter we're gonna mix all of that together until everything is completely mixed making sure that all apples are coated with our cinnamon sugar flour mixture [Music] now that we're done with our mixture we're gonna set it to the side and get working on our topping so here I am sifting a half a cup of flour this is gonna make sure that your topping is nice and fluffy if you don't have a sifter if you have a kitchen strainer that has a small mesh that will work as well running it through that but once we get all our flour in there I've got a half a cup of sugar 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder and 1/4 of teaspoon of salt next I'm gonna add one egg and 2 tablespoons of butter and we're gonna mix this up and it's gonna give us the consistency of a thick batter once we're completely done and just to make sure everything is smooth I'm adding a couple of drops of water so that I can make sure I get all my dry and ian's mixed in [Music] now I have oiled this splash pie dish I'm adding our apple pie filling and adding everything that's a net Bowl so including any of the liquids which you're gonna give this pie some great flavor and they're definitely gonna thicken up because of the use of our flour so don't worry about having a running back [Music] I'm just gonna add a couple of Pat's of butter to the top before we begin to add our batter on top of our apple pie filling now we're gonna add this batter for our topping and little drops on top of the pie so I'm doing about nine to ten drops here fairly close together but once it bakes it's gonna spread and there's going to be more of that crust like topping then there is just it's those apples it's gonna brown perfectly and just tastes delicious putting my pie in a 375 degree fahrenheit oven we're gonna cook it for about 35 to 40 minutes and these are our final results perfect golden brown and delicious now if you have some vanilla ice cream you can take this up to a whole nother level and in my personal opinion if I must taste on myself apple pie is great for breakfast lunch and dinner so I hope you guys enjoy if you have not subscribed to my channel please do so now and also check out some

complete without enjoying delicious homemade peach cobbler and I must admit that it is one of my mom's special keys I don't think anyone can make peach cobbler quite like her included food but today I'm gonna give it my best try because I love peach cobbler and I love peaches and I can't wait to show you this great recipe so let's get started okay so to make our peach cobbler first and foremost they started by peeling my peaches and then I slice them up into thin slices so now what I'm going to do is just a little saucepan add my spices right in and to make the cobbler I mean I always start with fresh peaches but it's not peach season I totally avoided because the freshness trust me on this menu was definitely deputies different so Chinese start with fresh just across go to my fresh peaches I'm going to add the sugar and it really just depends on how sweet your edges are they're already really sweet then you know maybe lay back on the sugars but if they are not so sweeping you can add some extra sugar and then to that I'm gonna spice it up with a little bit of cinnamon and make and corn add some butter to but the butter is gonna really add a nice texture to you beautiful so now I'm just going to take this to the stove let it lightly simmer just until the sugar and cinnamon sugar and butter melt in just are just about there and then I'm gonna add a little bit cornstarch to thicken it up so good okay so my absolutely divine right now I'm just going to give it a quick taste just to make sure that we are on point before I oh my gosh just like I remember a bomb making it's so delicious I need it Phoebe makes such a big difference to use fresh peaches you just taste all the fresh naturalness in there seal it stop what I have done is I've taken just a baking dish and I greased it with a little bit of butter and then I'm not going to miss a drop I'm gonna get the spatula in there all right so now what I've done is I'm pre premiering a homemade crust now you can only use for web cos it's no problem with that but I made a homemade crust if you don't know how to bake one definitely check out maybe different how to make homemade pie crust but what are you dining a chilled it rolled it out today ruled it out plastic wrap to training for myself to transfer you know so what I'm going to do is just literally take it and cover my delicious cobbler right so then I can lift my plastic wrap up just like that look that works well so now I'm just going to top again the edges of my cobbler I'm just gonna press down kind of like being up high the cobbler is pretty similar to a pie so if there's only one crust right side only has and then I'm just going to come around and change my edges don't want too much Christ and the press is gonna be nice lady and right it's made with butter and sorry I definitely had a nice little you know extra additional calorie content on it but you know when you're making a cobbler it's really not a light dessert so you're concerned about calories they save this one for everybody but I mean just took me to raise the excess yeah you can still totally use this dough so don't throw it out but we just want to cut it off okay and then what I want to do is actually cut a slit in it or even portable hook hold it in with a fork I don't like to you don't try and do something festive so I'm just going to go old-fashioned with it and make a nice little cross shape beautiful and this is going to give our cobbler room to breathe while it's pink don't the peach juices they're gonna fill the air of your kitchen so now it's great to go into our oven and I'm jonesing for higher tuition table so good okay so my peach cobbler has been baking and smell amazing oh my god you take it out of the oven check that out our delicious fresh peach cobbler right out of the oven so nice and golden-brown crust mmm it's so good but of course I just can take a little bit of butter and just gently spread it right on top and this is just yeah because it tastes so delicious with the cobbler Oh beautiful and then there we have it our delicious homemade southern fresh peach cobbler homemade from scratch including a goat cheese crust so thank you so much for checking out this video for how to make homemade peach cobbler I hope did you enjoyed it and I hope to give it a try please hope in the next video and there's no the next time thanks for watching and again we've seen it", "Ha8Eej6E7i8": "hey guys and welcome back to the channel today on this redline vlog style video i've got the newest member of the volkswagen suv family that's right that is the 2020 volkswagen atlas cross sport now the last time i drove this thing i was in vancouver it was about earlier this year right before the pandemic started as you can see this is an sel with the r line sport appearance package designed to be a competitor to things like the ford edge a jeep grand cherokee a honda passport the upcoming toyota venza it essentially takes the very successful 303 row atlas and shortens it creating a two-row version and kind of gives it a cupified look to kind of make it resemble like an audi q8 or a lamborghini earth so the big question i want to answer is the new atlas cross sport the perfect family vehicle for today's modern family that's over here to find out [Music] so just like the regular three row atlas the cross sport has the newer front fascia which actually volkswagen just put this new fascia on the 2021 atlas so stay tuned for my full review on that video called a later date but as you can see compared to the last one that i drove in vancouver which was a boring silver color this is a very pretty shade of kind of like a greenish blue tint this is the sel with the r line package it's not the full sel premium but you get full led headlights no led fog lights instead you kind of have this sculpted front fascia with a deeper uh blacked out painted lower air dam and you get more of that chrome trim this kind of very subtle r-line badge and this is a very big vehicle remember it goes head-to-head with cars like the honda passport the ford edge the chevrolet blazer and compared to the regular atlas this is about three inches shorter but at 195 inches long overall this is still on the bigger end it's about five inches longer than something like the honda passport now because this one has the r-line sport package you get these 21 inch wheels wrapped in two 65 with tires these are one of the largest wheels that you can get in the industry and just like the regular atlas you still get a fairly decent amount of ground clearance around eight inches total and it shares the same 117 inch long wheelbase obviously when you get back here you can see it's got that sloping coupe like look kind of reminds you of an audi q8 or a porsche cayenne coupe which is also a really stylish looking vehicle now the tail light modules just like the regular atlas are kind of an led combination but they do look slightly different this is the most differentiating angle between this and the regular atlas you have these fake chrome exhaust trim pieces vw and audi have been very guilty of that as well this particular one here also has the towing package which can tell a maximum of 5000 pounds and because it's an suv the trunk capacity is huge you can see with the seats up which this doesn't offer a third row my dog cedar happily kind of jumped right in you get 40.1 cubic feet of space and if you fold down everything you get around 78 cubic feet of space and you also get a very happy puppy now of course on the inside of the atlas cross sport if you guys are pretty familiar with the atlas interior and a lot of other newer volkswagen interiors it's going to look very familiar now first things first as you can see this is the sel with the r-line package it's got this really nice tan interior with the two-tone the seats are just heated if you want cooled seats you have to go for the sel premium which my tester is one notch below it shutting the door it has a relatively solid thunk that you associate with other german cars and this interior at a glance looks fairly nice however if i'm going to be honest here vw really needs to do something about the design of their interiors they just don't really have that wow factor that they used to have a few years ago i mean sure you've got the digital cockpit display over here which is very close to what you find in a lot of audis with their virtual cockpit you have an eight inch touchscreen over here that includes things like android auto and apple carplay it is a very nice easy to use system the screen is bright although i think that at eight inches it's starting to look a little bit small especially considering how expansive and large the dashboard is of this vehicle the materials here have some of that faux stitching with the leatherette there on the upper portion here the door panel here is also a soft touch injection molded plastic you've got some silver painted plastic and some imitation plastic which tries to look like carbon fiber the door handle here is metal at least and it's also slightly padded over here the window controls are one touch up and down for all four so that's all very nice stuff in here really the newest thing that you're gonna notice in the interior is this steering wheel it's the new volkswagen steering wheel with the new volkswagen emblem it definitely looks a lot slimmer a lot more modern it looks a little bit more luxury oriented as well i really like the emblem this is what you're going to start seeing trickle down into other volkswagen products the steering wheel itself tilts and telescopes offers a lot of adjustability and range which is very nice and then over here you can see the dashboard layout design is pretty similar to every other volkswagen that i've seen and i kind of think that's where vw could have done more to differentiate this car from other vehicles i like this little shelf over here where you can store stuff you've got dual zone climate control just heated seats no cooled seats on this particular one here there's a couple of empty buttons over there and then over here down here you can see there is a wireless phone charger two usb ports and then lots of controls over here for your drive mode selector this controls the eight speed automatic which by the way because i don't have the premium package i only have just a standard backup camera if you guys go for the sel premium package um you'll get the full 360 camera with the top down views your cup holders over here electronic parking brake and then of course nice big center core storage over here with a nice padded lid the lid itself however doesn't slide forward and back that's always typically been a volkswagen thing so that's weird to see it missing here the seats are also a little bit boring to look at but i do like the color i wish they were cooled on this trim but you got to step up one more notch and then they feel relatively good this is not a real leather this is the synthetic leather leather that volkswagen offers on the lower trims the premium package gives you a real leather and then the glove compartment here you can see there's two us sd card slots there for the gps it's not lined with felt but it is damped and then above me you can see panoramic roof is included on this trim which lets in a lot of light the back seats as you can see are huge let me show you guys that real quick and as you can see the back seat of the cross sport is actually larger versus the three row atlas because volkswagen said when they took out the third row in this vehicle they were able to kind of push the second row a little bit further back to give passengers more space vw says you get around 40 inches of legroom back here 40 inches and you have a nearly completely flat floor surprise there's actually a little shelf here where there should be something here maybe for like your climate control settings in other parts of the of the world two usb ports over there a household power outlet and then when you shut the door you can see it sounds pretty similar to the front this is a hard touch plastic material here on the upper door panels of the rear door so a little bit of cost cutting there two map pockets which is nice the seats themselves you can see they don't actually slide forward and back which would have been nice but they do offer a little bit of adjustability so you can kind of fold them forward or you can also recline them slightly which is good but i'm surprised that vw didn't allow me to actually slide the seat forward which would have been nice to uh to include on the two-row version so overall if you're looking for one of the largest back scenes in the segment the atlas cross sport definitely will satisfy that and really this is about as big as what you're going to find in the honda passport so the atlas cross sport is volkswagen's entry into the continuously growing two-row mid-size crossover second remember this is a segment for vehicle for people who think that the compact crossover like a tiguan or a rav4 or crv is too small because you want something with more space in the second row and the trunk and you potentially want a six cylinder engine most vehicles a lot of entries in this segment have a six cylinder a v6 or vr6 like this one and honestly when i first drove this car back in british columbia when i was in vancouver i was pretty impressed with it it's a relatively solid entry in the segment it's not the sportiest it's not the most luxurious it's not the sleekest looking but it covers a very nice middle ground volkswagen has priced it well and it also looks relatively handsome on the outside now the one that i tested in vancouver was a very boring silver with black interior but this one here in tourmaline blue with this beige interior combination is really nice this is how i would i would buy this car if i was going to look at one of these and the outside like i said um for 2021 vw is adjusting the regular atlas to have the same front fascia as this but unlike you know the passport and the pilot which have basically just a different grille and slightly different tail lights they look like exactly the same vehicle this however looks you know slightly more different to me i also think that the vw did a good job with the proportions of the rear even though i hate this sloping coupe design i think this particular one looks good at the back now regarding the interior vw has been heavily criticized by consumers and myself for being a little bit too safe on the interior and the cross sport is technically no exception to that rule either so the inside may not be super luxurious or full of all the latest tech it doesn't really wow you but it is comfortable it's easy to use it's also very quiet in here and this car has a really good ride quality despite the fact that it's on 21-inch wheels now a 2-liter turbo engine is the standard engine in the cross sport i actually haven't driven the 2-liter turbo i would probably skip it just because i don't like that engine in the tiguan but it is tuned to make 235 horsepower in this most people who buy a cross sport will probably go for the vr6 and this is vw's 3.6 liter unit with 276 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque it goes out through an 8-speed automatic transmission this one has their hall decks based four motion all-wheel drive system and when you put the vehicle into its sport setting here and put your foot down this definitely has the grunt that i'm expecting for a vehicle that's in the midsize crossover segment i mean the tiguan um which is pretty big for a compact car is just ridiculously sluggish with the two liter this 3.6 has a very nice snarl to it it's very smooth it's very refined it's not the quickest in the segment cars like the honda passport will be faster the subaru outback turbo will be faster the chevrolet blazer with its 3.6 is faster this feels pretty comparable to the last grand cherokee with the 3.6 liter pentastar engine that i drove i also like this has a traditional stepped automatic so for those of you who hate cvts this is going to be a really nice option for you it feels like it gets to 60 in the mid 7 second range which is adequate performance um it's got plenty of power for most people i actually thought it felt underpowered when i was in vancouver now that i have the car back at home at sea level where it's not we're not at elevation i find the power to be adequate um do i wish it had a little bit more power sure do i wish that the crossbar was a little sportier to drive sure absolutely i mean this car feels big and heavy it's very wide you really notice the width of this car which translates to a lot of interior space in the front you know between the two passengers at the back or the front here it's a very smooth refined car but there's a reason obviously why you know the audi q8 gets the turbocharged v6 because it has way more low end torque it feels a little bit more effortless this engine you know you kind of have to rev it out to feel a little bit of power but it's a good engine that you want to rev out that you know is very smooth and quiet so i don't really have a problem doing that the 8-speed automatic in this car also is very smooth it shifts perfectly fine it's very competitive with the segment it's not you know one of the best transmissions in the business but it's a transmission that will just kind of you know fade and fade into the background as you drive this thing daily so i think that's really important uh when you're talking about a daily driver really the cross sport is so middle of the road just good at everything that i have trouble finding faults with this thing i mean sure i could complain about it being boring on uh to drive i can complain about the interior not having that wow factor but really volkswagen knows you know their target audience with this thing and for the people who are looking for a family car that has way more space than most of the competition this is going to do very nicely in that regard now if you guys were planning to actually tow use that 5000 pound towing capacity i would be concerned that this v6 doesn't quite have the grunt but like i said for most everyday usages you get it up to highway speeds it has a very soft controlled ride quality it's very quiet in here this would be a really excellent road trip car just from the sheer amount of space that it has really where i think vw needs to work on is the fuel efficiency for this engine it is rated at 16 in the city and 22 on the highway which in my week's worth of testing i have been averaging around 17 mpg which is not great um on the highway i did get this up to about 23 mpg so it will do a little bit better than the actual epa numbers which seems a little bit conservative to me but you know with the turbocharged engines that everyone's going to in the competition set vw does need to work on the fuel economy and make this thing better it is a product of the fact that this is a heavy car this weighs you know a little over 4 500 pounds so it is pretty heavy and it feels heavy when you're driving it but that heft translates into you know feeling of safety a feeling of quality so i think there's a reason why uh vw did that so overall if you like the way the atlas drives this drives the same way it doesn't feel any smaller to me or any sportier but it's just as every bit as comfortable it's just as quiet it's every bit as smooth and it's also different you don't see you know that many of these on the road like you would see at an edge or in grand cherokee and let's be honest here i don't really particularly like the way the current edge drives i also don't really like the way the grand cherokee drives with the v6 you got to go for the v8 if you want the grand cherokee and then there's the passport of course which i think the passport has a transmission that i don't love the nine-speed auto is not good and then of course the nissan murano is another option which the murano is a very smooth driving car but a lot of you you know hate the cvt and i also am not fans of the looks of the current generation so the crossport definitely has enough high points in here to warrant a look if you guys are looking for something like this size so the 2020 volkswagen atlas crossport may not be the sportiest vehicle in the segment to drive that's not its mission of this car you can't deny how ridiculously practical the atlas cross sport is just like the three row atlas the cross sport offers a lot of space in the second row and the cargo area and the front seats because it's the same width and rides on the same wheelbase it being three inches shorter does give this car a slightly different look in fact unlike the honda passport which always constantly reminds you that it's a pilot uh the crossboard definitely has a unique look at the rear now of course the front will remind you of the regular three row atlas but i think that vw did a good job with making this thing look a little bit more standoutish especially the r-line package that gives you the 21-inch wheels this tourmaline blue exterior color and just the sloping rear roof line of the rear area it reminds me a lot of the lamborghini eras and the audi q8 and keep in mind this is about half the price of something like the audi q8 now of course the cross sport isn't perfect i wish that the interior looked a little bit more special to kind of match the premium look on the outside and i also think that this one here at 46 000 should be the fully loaded version i don't like how i have to go to a premium package to get things like the real leather and the ventilated seats which will push the price a little over 50 000 but this car starts at around 31 550 which is about a thousand dollars more versus the three-row atlas it represents a good deal and it's going to be less expensive versus cars like the jeep grand cherokee and the ford edge but keep in mind that the hyundai santa fe and subaru outback which are smaller vehicles will be less expensive versus this fully loaded atlas but with all that said i hope you guys have enjoyed my full overview on this 2020 atlas cross board with the six cylinder engine if you're also looking to see the latest cars i'm testing be sure to follow me on instagram redline

crisp on the outside and gooey tender on the inside so let's get baking it's very easy to make these cookies you're just going to use some old-fashioned oats and raisins brown sugar regular sugar flour baking soda salt ground cinnamon and egg pure vanilla extract and corn starch and i think that's about it so oh can't forget the butter all right so i have some room temperature butter going on right here you can see you can press into it so that's a good temperature and we're going to preheat the oven to 375 degrees i'm going to use my silicone baking mat and let's start mixing the dry ingredients in one bowl and the wet ingredients in another bowl so in a medium sized bowl we're going to add one cup of flour and it's just regular all-purpose flour and we want a half a teaspoon of baking soda one teaspoon of cornstarch [Music] a half a teaspoon of cinnamon and we're just going to mix this together so that we incorporate all the dry ingredients [Music] the complete recipe will be down below in the descriptions now we're going to set the dry ingredients aside and work on our wet ingredients and i have one stick of butter which is half a cup we're going to take that and we're going to add the sugar we're going to add 1 3 cup of regular sugar and then a half a cup of packed brown sugar we're going to take our hand mixer and we're going to mix this on medium speed for a minute or two after you've mixed this and you have it light and fluffy we're going to add the other ingredients which is one egg [Music] we're going to add half a teaspoon of salt [Music] one and a half teaspoon of vanilla extract [Music] and then we'll mix this on low speed for about a minute now we're going to take the wet mixture and the dry and mix them together so just go ahead and scrape out the wet mixture and put it in let that dry and just go ahead and mix this using your spatula [Music] make sure you scrape down the bottom of the bowl to get all the flour mixture incorporated with the wet ingredients next we're going to mix in one and a half cups of the oatmeal [Music] next we're going to add one cup of raisins and then just mix all this together you can add walnuts with this if you like and have oatmeal and walnuts or raisin cookies or macadamia nuts you know just anything that you'd like also you could use other dried fruits like currant and but we're just gonna make just a good old-fashioned raisin oatmeal cookie and you see how adding the oats in kind of thickens the uh the dough up [Music] and you just want to make sure you mix this really well so that you have oats incorporated throughout the dough as well as the raisins because you don't want to have a cookie without any of the raisins in it [Music] now that we have this mixed pretty well we can now start to put them on the cookie sheets and we'll be right back now we can scoop the cookies onto our baking sheet i have an aluminum baking sheet and i love using the silicon baking mats they're wonderful awesome i find the cookies come out just perfect whatever i bake on here and then i've got my little cookie scoop and we're just gonna scoop up some cookie dough and it's super easy you want to place them on the sheet about two inches apart again the oven is at 3.75 and we're going to bake them to about 8 to 10 minutes we want to make sure the center is still soft and you'll see the the edges just kind of browning [Music] and there we go we have our first pan ready to go in the oven i'm going to let them sit a little bit on the mat before i transfer them over to the cooling rack now we're just going to transfer these nice warm oatmeal raisin cookies over onto the cooling rack [Music] this recipe said it made 24 cookies but i actually think i got 28 out of them the recipe and that was using the cookie scoop so they're nice sized cookies and i bet they're going to be so yummy can't wait i'm surprised hubby's not in here already going um i smell something good [Music] okay now this has cooled off a little and it just smell the cinnamon and the raisins and the oats yeah you can smell the oats too so let's break into it and taste this wonderful luscious yummy it's soft in the center oh my goodness [Music] nice chewy raisins um the brown sugar it is just your traditional old-fashioned oatmeal raisin cookie which is just i don't know just wonderful it's got a nice little crisp on the outside and around the edges but the middle is nice and moist and soft it's really good [Music] so sorry about this i need to stop eating them i hope you like this video and you check out this recipe make these cookies your family is going to love them so give me a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe down below and click on that little bell so you get notification of my next video thank

Leslie Apgar today I'm joined with my girls we got Tracy Scott's flower and we've got two vana Austin both from grassroots so everybody waved hi so thanks you guys for coming and hanging out all right now Devon I just met you today I think I might have met you way back when we way back in the summer was my girl Tracy and I go way back and we are so grateful for you guys to come back thank you for having so first Tracy you get to go first tell us how you got to be in this role what is your role at crossroads so I am basically what you would call a relationship its manager which is basically sale if you want to be honest you're the one who tells us I'm the one that oh you're your failure dispensary and help you with your products awesome but I I basically fell into this okay I mean I did this kind of job back in the day sales okay but a friend had told me that they were looking for a person that was good at selling basically and and I went and I talked to him and I was like this is an amazing industry and I'm so passionate about healing and helping you know and that's how it happened I love it yeah about two davana so I started smoking weed in college and I was also following the industry because I thought it was interesting and I decided to write my thesis on the growth of the cannabis industry oh wow and at the same time Maryland's program was getting started so I found Danny Cohen our owner and met with him periodically over the summer after graduation and now I'm here I do marketing and outreach for grassroots so getting hard exactly so you guys may see these people out in the community well again we really appreciate you guys coming by today so let's talk a little bit about what makes grassroots different like why should our patients be purchasing from grassroots over any of the other grows that are out there well first and foremost you know the one thing that I love about this company is its passion for helping and serving me serving my dispensaries us serving the patients and and even our motto is to serve advance and respect them you guys you guys always say that you do we people joining washtech join the movement right right and we have actually been to their grow just beautiful and obviously you guys put your money where your mouth is because we have just received a very large shipment this is RSO for those of you who are wondering it says so right on the container are as Oh which we love that you guys are making that a priority and also making it affordable for the patient yes Aurra so I would say is probably our most medical product out of you know the many that we will have and that we do have now as you know it's helps with cancer tumor so much I mean there's been tons of studies all different ailments and our processor loves making it he says it's fun mm-hmm and I said great because I know they're already so them and Sierra and I have talked about this in the past but are so is really good for patients who are fighting cancer patients who have chronic medical illnesses and planetory disorders so it's got a lot of uses and we're so thrilled that we have a big supply so that we can really help our patients yes we just have to say a heartfelt thank you for doing that and thank you for helping you know that patients know we talked to Matt earlier who was Matt except Matt garbowski who is our head of processing the processing okay in our company though Matt actually gave us some pretty interesting feedback and I wanted to pass that on to our patients who are watching and that is to please respect grassroots RSO because not all RSO is created equal and this is incredibly strong incredibly he doesn't actually expect anybody with any kind of tolerance to be able to tolerate a full syringe daily he wants us to start off just as 1/10 the syringe to begin with and then to work our way up but he's not thinking that we would actually be able to get a full syringe and daily even after a month of trying to increase our tolerance yes I mean I guess it depends on every you know everyone is different every ailment you know every you have to listen to your body and that's you know we always talk about micro dosing right but yeah you know it is so apparently so potent I've never tried it but it's so potent that he wants you to take it easy whereas there might be other products that were less potent or for whatever reason was may different that you can maybe and have a little bit more he also had mentioned that when you ingest rather than this is both edible and smokeable so when you ingest it it's like 10 times more powerful a longer right so it really it's dependent upon that and the way that we ingest it correct or take it in yeah and then also just to clarify that we have two strains we have khaleesi and we have dead cherries and look to him in his estimation there's really essentially no difference between the two and I've looked at these and kind of you know evaluated the terpene profiles they don't look to be any different to me so I think they'll be fairly interchangeable for the patient's yeah it'll be nice okay so that's great information for the patients so yes we have it guys we've got lots of RSO so come and get it that's amazing yes some of the other things that we are carrying that we have in stock because I know we sell out of your stuff a lot I guess we'll start with your favorite this is my favorite a beautiful nightmare it's just a great product I happen to sometimes get heart palpitations when I use a sativa as you lean toward anxiety is that true my friend sometime I have a little anxiety right now that's some time but so I but I like a sativa because I'm and I like birthday and I like right I have a lot to do and this is just a great ride if L it does their main it doesn't upset your hurt no it doesn't it doesn't you might wanna mention about the CBD with that too or no oh yes yes yes because one of the tricks to being able to tolerate this a little bit better is to take CBD as well which we appreciate and the reason why I thought about that at the same time is because sometimes when you do have that that kind of heart-fluttering publication you just you know take a little CBD and it'll that works really well yeah yeah all right here's another real popular crowd-pleaser the Pelle Roja yeah I love that job this is something that sells very well very uplifting and then we have three as your favorite so actually he likes oh you like so Mambo sauce is my favorite so a lot of people like they're really skunky smell or cheesy this one's sweet it's no sweet and so I really enjoy it it burns nice and then what else do we have and then there's sweet D yeah it was named after me my name is Donna I was on that they also did name beautiful nightmare too laughter you just kidding that's just nightmare faceoff is also apparently great for like locations Wow it was just a no it was the pain yeah we're like if you have cramping is that do we talk about Sossamon area painful cramps yeah yeah these patients love the face off for the pain component totally and the one that you're missing is our blue sticker which is our hybrids and some of them lean sativa some of them lean hybrid I mean indica you know but our grower will say there's no such thing our poor patients have heard me talk about that but it's really important to educate the public because you know you see people are maybe not the old for all patients but you know a lot of people are like I need the most THC most THC it's not about the to you it's not it's about the plant and the breakdown all of it and how it's going to be wrong that's correct and it's not just about you know explaining the plant it's about removing that stigma and bringing legitimacy to the industry you know right as part of outreach we speak to anyone who will listen you know we go into hospitals and you know old-age home exactly assess elevating churches temples we try anywhere I'm sit on this conversation right if you show them it's not that scary you know people are curious yeah they know the guy helpful hear about it humans have been using this planet for thousands and thousands of years so now it's just time for the studies to you know watch a street yeah exactly how those of you were watching Dateline last night I know that I'm saying lovely little taste of what's to come so yeah finally we are catching up yeah so and so this is some of the stuff that we have available right now at greenhouse what are some of the things that you guys have in the works for us so actually we just spoke about it today more processing products we have disposable pens that are coming out within a week or two they're called torches they're 500 they are at a nice price point gorgeous it's just you know if you especially for somebody who's not looking to smoke weed but maybe wants to just be able to start off and is new to this type of introduced and we also have chatter coming and waxes and even though you know you wouldn't think that you know somebody who might be older or is is some kind of you know there's a stigma I feel like sure that a lot of people like that a lot of it you know a lot of people like life as well we love libraries and I mean that I like that yeah and it really it can helpful it can help a lot too I really have a medical anodized makes sense to me that you take that whole plant master rs7 exactly higher plan know about everything it gives you every benefit right you know the substrate totally I mean it's just it's a really incredibly we're talking about off camera I used to self-medicate and then I became a patient and it's wild for me to you know know the back stories and know the terpenes and know everything and I'm like oh and might have some crayons or you know whatever it might be and I know that if I take a certain strain it's gonna help me and it does it's pretty and it's wonderful you know your your stomach relaxes you maybe aren't nauseous like it's just amazing fruits balance right it does and it's just wild to me that something like this would have a stigma and we need to be doing community outreach that compared to other but this was filled with oxycontin it would be okay saying and it's just it's crazy it is a little silly yeah you've never heard one person died of an overdose not one nope it's impossible possible but if you take all of this you're gonna be in your areas especially if you eat it because I'll stay in your system for yeah all right well what else did you guys want at the public to know about grassroots is there any last little pearl or anything you want anybody to know well they can always reach out to us if I don't have any questions concerns we are truly here to serve our community and this industry and you guys and we just really believe in this product you're passionate it's not about you know uhyou it's hard to not read things on Facebook it's hard to not be affected by oh this sucks that sucks this is a very young industry right we're there's growing pains but I can promise you from the bottom of our hearts we're in it to help people and make people feel better and you know just how it not be such a not be illegal and I just you know be able to feel better well we have I finger questions we have a question from Blake he wants to know what you guys have thoughts are on oil color you see sometimes an amber color versus good dark which I've seen yeah and what causes the difference in color when processing well I was told and again I'm no chemist by any means okay but what I was told by our head processer Matt garbowski that you know I again I saw him Facebook bleep that there you know somebody said that's not RSO it's too light it's supposed to be tar it's chlorophyll right there's all different processes but Matt believe if he will tell you that it when you put it on something and you rub it out it should be like a golden color it should not be at our it should not be I think those are the impurities quite a yes is that what it is so yeah but I haven't have Reds on and and people just need to be educated right so thanks for the question Blake yeah that's a great question all right guys well I think that about wraps it up for our motivating wasn't that they hardly needed any CBD to get through this just all right guys well thank you so much for joining us you'll see us again next Monday for our next Medical Monday [Music]", "hhTPYdjGxP0": "oh my god you guys all wanna be in my video hey guys welcome back to another video if you're new here I am Judith and today I do have an audience hello yeah but anyways today I am going to be eating or trying to eat a 500 milligram edible that I did find at a lab that I recently went to it was the first time that I had gone there and I just had to pick these up for you guys because I've never seen them ever in my life and once I figured out that these existed I saw a video on YouTube and there was comments saying that they really didn't hear so I'm not sure if I should eat the whole thing or eat a hundred milligrams of it because the other time if you guys haven't seen my if you guys haven't seen my last video I did eat a moon edible 100 milligrams and that edible like totally hit you guys I Loki freaked out so yeah I know that 100 milligrams will do me justice when it comes to properly hitting me right but yeah I had to pick this up for you guys 500 milligrams you guys enough to make me feel like I'm dying I'm not even kidding but I don't think I am gonna eat the whole thing or the whole string but I am gonna offer some people some of the edible its if you want it you want it and if you don't then you don't know pressure let me go ahead and set this camera up for you guys I am going to open and eat this in front of you guys you guys already know the deal so yeah if you guys haven't checked out my last edible video go ahead and check that out and let's do this okay I am literally on my knees for you guys but let's do this okay so this is the edible again you guys look at this cute new packaging I've never seen this type of edible ever I just had to pick it up for you guys I have to I have to this one unfortunately is not really like childproof it does have that starting cut there so it can easily be open unlike the other edibles I've said that it's a great idea not to suggest an opening just because young adults and kids can be around as for me I do have a baby around so you know not good for that but other than that it is cute I love it yeah they're medicated nerds 500 milligrams that's just tripping me out like I don't really believe it but I don't know I mean it just say it on the packaging so it says total dosage is 500 milligrams of THC and the rope has eight servings so let's see I don't know I mean that's you so it's saying one-eighth of the rope is 50 milligrams so we can calculate that by cutting it in half and then cutting it in half again and then cutting it in half again so that's pretty much a small ass piece like literally this is 50 milligrams and then another 50 and like it's just I don't know it's pretty crazy to me it just say that it's 60 minute activation time right there so I guess it's gonna take about an hour just like the other edible that I did consume for you guys so it does have this California warning sign that everyone always looks for on packaging but yeah I mean I wouldn't honestly you guys I wouldn't really trust this because I did buy it and an underground type of lab I've never even heard of this lab I was invited I wasn't even gonna buy anything so these are kind of like products that I'm iffy about so I don't know I guess you have to do your research I didn't do much research but I did see a video online yeah that was it that was pretty much it if you guys do want to have more research on this go ahead and look up videos because I'm pretty sure these are getting more known out there but yeah enough talking I'm just super talking talking maybe because I'm so nervous I don't know but let me go get some scissors actually no it has the tear there um and then let's do this so let me do a quick thumbnail and then we'll get back to it it is so hot in here you guys I'm really trying to just do this so let's do it okay yeah ready or not here we go so it says teryn share which I do plan on doing I am going as my uncle probably if he wants to try some hey baby baby okay I'm doing a video let's do it so I'm gonna open it sorry my babies in the background you guys okay look at this you guys what the heck so I had this in the refrigerator and my mom was just like freaking out telling everyone this is not a candy that this is marijuana and Dada Dada and I mean yeah precautions you guys so I'm gonna have 1/8 of the rope okay so 1/8 of the rope that's what it looks like you guys and it does say on the packaging it is 15 milligrams so here goes nothing not a soul bomb maybe you wanna try some it's so bomb you guys this is dangerous oh my gosh you guys okay two eights of the rope so this is gonna be a total of 100 milligrams why is that so bhama if you guys hear little parts as my sister's baby they just want to be cheese massage they want to be here and watch me the film for you guys these are so so bomb he says that it has a super potent formula okay I think I should keep it like that cuz I don't want to freak out you guys but okay I'll have a little more so I can have half of it which is gonna be 250 here's another one so it should be about 250 milligrams if not maybe a little less a little more nice learn can't film here you guys it is so hot in here mom like I ate a little less or a little more of 250 milligrams you guys I'm gonna feel like I'm dying but I'm yeah let me go see if anybody else wants to have a little piece of it maybe just 50 milligrams or a little more I don't mind sharing this it's whatever I did post this on snap so if you do follow me on snap you know that I did post this and I asked you guys if you guys have ever tried these and some of you guys said that they smack which is why I'm kind of scared because I don't want them to smack me so hard but some of you guys said that they don't so I guess it's just our personal experience and yeah I hope that they don't super smack but if they do a Plus let's go see who else wants to try some of these so we are gonna go outside and I am so hot here because I closed all the windows and doors so that no noise could come in but yeah your girls ready to go outside and just breathe but I will be checking up when this [ __ ] starts to hit and let you guys know what I feel so yeah let's go outside [Music] do you want to chase up it's a 500 milligram nerd okay you guys my uncle is down so go ahead and open it and then 1/8 of the rope is gonna be 50 milligrams so right there it does okay getting eighth you know what anything I know how an ape looks and we know candy no a little more a little more this would be good in them yeah I mean if there's a 500 milligram rope come with me yeah cheers Cheers you have to let us know how you feel okay I am back and I am definitely feeling this edible more of like a body high I feel yeah like maybe more of a body higher than anything else I'm like slowly freaking out like I can just feel it creeping up right now we are watching a movie so yeah I can definitely feel it while I'm watching the movie and yeah I'm pretty good right now but you guys I can definitely feel it just like it's gonna hit me like I know it's gonna hit me super hard and I just I hope that I don't freak out but yeah this is an update this is probably almost an hour after I ate the edible so keep in mind I ate about 250 milligrams this is about an hour later which yeah like the packaging said that it would hit me 16 minutes later and it's about that and I can definitely feel it creeping up right now so yeah this isn't even this isn't even the full-blown like faded moment but I will be back for that I hope that I am not freaking out or anything but yeah my mom is making carnitas and I just cut onion and cilantro and yeah I helped her in the kitchen and I'm gonna show you guys what we're eating because it just looks so bomb you guys that goes everyday bomb like super bomb and they make the best that Anita's so shout out to them but anyways let me get back to you guys and then if anything when I start to really feel it I will also ask how my uncle is feeling because he did take about 50 milligrams so he isn't really gonna feel as much but he'll definitely be feeling something if this rope is potent like it's saying it is but yeah I'll be back I already ate a taco and it was so so bomb but this is what they look like ooh ooh they look so bomb the airplane the baby I totally forgot to record I am still a little faded I honestly thought I was gonna hit harder but it didn't the day is still going the days are going so I'll be back to let you guys know the update so I thought the Edible was going to hit a little harder after the last video that I did make but no incident I was probably peaking right there and it didn't go any further than that but um yeah I was expecting it to hit a little harder just because I did consume a 250 milligrams and it just wasn't that heart of a high or a faded moment but yeah I mean would I buy them again I probably wouldn't maybe for the flavor and the taste because it tastes so bomb but for it to like actually hit and make me feel super faded mmm I don't know I'm gonna have to think about that one but yeah it was pretty good I enjoyed it I still have a little bit left and yeah I'm pretty sure it did hit my feel not as much but yeah he's knocked out after a while I thought it was gonna hit a little harder but it didn't so that's kind of a shame because other edibles that I have tried they've hit pretty hard so yeah when I buy this again sorry I'm in the kitchen and everyone's eating and I just decided the wrong time let you guys know the update but yeah it didn't hit that hard would I buy it again maybe not maybe for the flavor and taste but for it to hit me hard no I'll probably do a moon because with a moon edible eye it got me so good with just one hundred milligrams I did check up on my uncle he is totally asleep so yeah I guess I'm gonna ask him later how he felt after the edible but yeah it was a good run I did enjoy the edible it was really fun eating it I was pretty excited and yeah I've never seen an edible like that and I'm glad that I tried it for you guys like a rating out of 10 probably like I don't know a 7 just because it peaked and then that was it like I didn't really feel like super faded or anything maybe I was more of a body high but yeah other than that it was good I hope they get like the video I'm gonna show you guys a bit of what my sister is making and then that's the end of the video or

in the last clip chance to say bye you guys Nuala by my okay yeah so bye see you guys in the next video and Cheers", "i61u5dzrkUM": "all right i did the pancake hack with the martha white blueberry muffin mix got another idea because it's a blueberry muffin mix two try and make a blueberry cobbler with it so what i think is because you get a real fluid consistency with the half a cup of milk thinking about doing a quarter cup of milk so that's a little more clumpy putting the blueberries in adding this and baking it at the 400 degrees to see if you can make a blueberry cobbler out of the blueberry muffin mix so for the pie filling that's what you would use you're gonna cook it and then mix it in with the blueberry muffin mix let's see how this goes start by melting that tablespoon of butter and you're gonna add in a quarter cup of water a tablespoon of cornstarch a teaspoon of lemon juice and the blueberries which is one to two cups of blueberries butter is melted we're gonna add the other stocks blueberries and that's on a medium high and preheat your oven to 400 that's a quarter cup of water teaspoon of lemon juice a tablespoon of corn starch half a cup of sugar i use the organic cane sugar and you're going to cook that down let it thicken so for the muffin mix it calls for half a cup half a cup of milk so i'm gonna do a quarter cup of milk in the mixture i want it to be thick for the cobbles definitely more pasty we'll see how it looks on top of the blueberries i'm not sure if that's enough like one packet's enough for the two cups of blueberries we'll see when i put it in the cast iron skillet to bake it if not i'll just add another package and another quarter cup of milk it's all an experiment we're talking about life hacks here people all right blueberries are thick thickened up i think they're ready take them off the heat let them cool down and then we're going to put them in the cast iron skillet and put the muffin mix over it and see what happens let's pour that in oh that is nice and thick and it smells wonderful oh my goodness see how pasty that looks that's good because i want it to be thick and i just want to kind of drop it in there [Music] all right i left it at one packet so we'll see how it bakes up it should work let's see in the oven it goes at 400. oh my goodness wow oh that looks amazing that smells like a cobbler looks like a cobbler so i stayed with the one package of the muffin mix let's see what it looks like when you oh my gosh oh my gosh it looks just like cobbler [Music] plugging up the camera oh my goodness looks amazing i think it worked gotta let it cool off and then i'm going to taste it let me know how does it taste like cobbler yes i wouldn't even wait for it to cool off you could smell it all the way through the house huh so look guys that's a life hack if you're in a hurry two cups of blueberries and i'll put them uh down below and then one muffin mix blueberry muffin mix and you use half the milk you don't use the half a cup use a quarter cup and then i just put it in my cast iron skillet and covered the blueberries with the uh muffin mix somebody's eaten a lot of it how about with ice cream it'd probably be good huh it's a hit", "wKX0mVfsrKo": "hello my old school soulful family chef jeffrey back with another video hey y'all today i'm gonna do a quick video i had nothing to do with birthday month had nothing to do with my favorites but something i wouldn't been wanting to try i want to try a mixed berry cobbler here i've seen these before i've never made them before so here i'm going to give it a try here uh the berries here i got is strawberries blueberries blackberries and raspberries so i see i want to give it a try and see how this will come out so we're going to give it a shot here because i love blackberry cobbler i love blueberry cobbler i love raspberries so we're going to see how it is so i already added my and my sugar to this i've added my my pineapple juice that's the secret of my cobblers if y'all been following me long enough y'all probably have seen me make so many couples so i'm just putting this in here let go and i'll let you know what's in it put my butt in here vanilla and this is my cobbler pot y'all a little vanilla here y'all been following me long enough when i make this when i bring this pot out it means it's cobbler nutmeg little cinnamon and i'm gonna put the description of the video here i'm gonna put the recipe in the description of the video y'all and i'm making this just like i do every other couple the same ingredients and everything the only thing i'm changing is the type of fruit it's going to be the same amount as i do with every other every other cobbler so we're going to let this come to a boil like every cobbler once it come to a boil i'm going to tighten it up with some uh cornstarch and then we'll pour it in the pan put the crust on there and we'll have with some cobbler and i do like everything i'll do others i got half the berries in here and i'm gonna leave half and put in there right in directly into the bacon dish that way these berries get mushy i still have some berries that's uh holy shape that's not in actual in the uh in the actual cobbler so we'll be right back once this gets the boiling i'm gonna get my i'm gonna get my dough and gone put the bottom crust into my y'all know i use uh y'all know i don't make potato i don't have time i'm not gonna waste time making pie dough y'all follow me long enough y'all know i use the peel berry rollout crust so easy so simple uh it's a it's a game changer so anyway i'm gonna put the bottom crust in there and i'm gonna come back like in a few minutes and tighten this up with a cornstarch and we'll go from there we'll be right back okay y'all we back here okay y'all i i like for my uh cobbler to come to a complete bar before i add the cornstarch so it doesn't take us too much longer for it to to take effect before they thicken up but you know cornstarch to really get the full activation out of it your liquid needs to be boiling so we're gonna put the cornstarch in here thicken it up see see how quick it got thick if there hadn't been boiling it would have took longer for a little bit more because i'm gonna make it a little extra thicker because i got the frozen berries over here remember that i took some frozen berries and put in here so that that liquid from the frozen berry is going to thin this out a little as is in the oven so let this cook just a second here see how pretty that feeling is and that's why i took some of the frozen berries out y'all and put in there and not in here because see how it broke it up but it did give it a nice pretty color you got the blueberries in here blackberries raspberries and strawberries okay now what i'm gonna do now how quick that was i'm gonna ladle this in here i would pour it but i think i'll make a mess today so i'm gonna take this let me make sure y'all can see what i'm doing here just a little here okay take this and ladle the juice in here y'all make sure you get most of the berries there see that's why i made it so thick because i know when this started cooking and mixing with the other berries it's going to thin out a lot a little bit more and that's it now over here out of the way now all i'm gonna do now i'm gonna put the top crust on here and we'll be ready to put it in the oven the crop crust is very easy very simple move it over here y'all can see and all i did let me hear you you know the recipe is description of the video i took frozen berries pineapple juice butter like every cobbler cinnamon nutmeg vanilla i make the same way every cobbler y'all no difference no matter what fruit i'm using so now all i'm gonna do is just nothing fancy here just put the topping on there like i told people you don't have to be fancy with this just get it on there get it on there any way you can some people try to be fancy with the lattice cut that ain't me that's not me y'all go there we go and you could put it also just cover it up completely with the dough you don't have to make the little strings like i do i just do this kind of give it like my buddy uh jack chaplin you know of uh daddy jax y'all watch his cooking channel like he say i appeal is half the meal i remember that same time he watched his video he said that sometime i appeal is half the meal meaning presentation very important okay now i'm gonna put some butter on here a little butter i had left over i use a little butter y'all see i got some cornbread sitting there i made some homemade butter beans from my neighbor i've already did rest i already did a video on that i didn't show a video but they want some homemade butter beans and and ham hocks today so i made them that with some cornbread about neighbor got seven people seven a family of seven big ol pot of butter beans and ham hawks can't go wrong for that okay now i got the butter on there now i'm gonna sprinkle it with a little sugar a little sugar on there and then that nice crystallization when it come out and that's it i'm gonna put it over 350 degrees by 30 to 35 minutes and this cobbler will be complete and we'll check it out we'll be right back all right y'all we are back here the cobbler is fresh out of the oven and y'all i'm gonna let this thing sit for like three hours i'm never definitely gonna let it set up and cool off so when i do scoop it it's not uh running all over the place a lot of times i do that and people say oh it's too loose too no it's once it cool off believe me it thickens up so i'm gonna come back in about three hours and we're gonna uh taste a little this the rest of this going to my neighbor like i say tonight i'm cooking them some butter beans and ham hawks and cornbread and this dessert is uh old school mixed berry cobbler i'm gonna take a bowl out of this and give them the rest and let them enjoy so anyway uh we'll be back in about about uh three hours we'll check this out and we'll see how good it is we'll be right back okay y'all we back it's been about a couple hours i let this thing kind of set up and cool off now we're going to cut into this thing it makes a big difference when you let it set up see that man look at all that fruit in there it's also easy to eat easier to eat y'all okay now let's try this out see how this tastes here oh wow the berries they work so well together you got you can taste the blackberries coming through i think that's the dominant fruit in it blackberry and then the raspberry the blueberry custardy the blueberries and the strawberries didn't break down but the raspberry and the blackberry definitely breaks down and definitely the dominant uh flavor coming through but it's awesome my neighbors gonna love this cause i'm gonna get a good melon scoop here and i'm gonna let them have it but yeah try this recipe first time i ever did the fort berry cobbler i did every bird cobbler separately but i never did the four berry cobbler so try this out try this recipe and i'm gonna close this recipe out now like i always say please follow me please like share comment subscribe to my channel please

this video I'm gonna show you how to open the Korova Saturday morning cookie so one other thing that this offers is childproof packaging when I first got this I didn't really realize that it was childproof packaging and I was kind of ripping and tearing at it and getting frustrated because I couldn't quite open it you know and every time I would I would kind of just I would have to fight it but after a little bit of research I figured out that on the package here it has the instructions for the childproof packaging so there is a technique to opening these things and I'm gonna show you how to do that in the video so here's the packaging and it has a little tear tab on here you can see I've already open this up so you just basically just tear it peel this off once you get this open you look inside and you'll see okay it looks kind of like a normal ziplock bag and you kind of want to you know just open it thinking that that'll pull it but that's not really the case and then if you're trying to peel this apart you'll notice that it is like you know seriously stuck to the packaging itself and then once you get down to this portion right here you notice that there's this part right here that's open and that's actually the part that you need to stick your thumb in so what you do oh and by the way the oil from the cookie sometimes makes it makes this bag a little bit slippery so just be aware of that and that's kind of what I was thinking is it's a it's it's a little bit frustrating I know I'm all for Children's packaging you know child packaging and stuff like that but this is a little it's a little bit difficult especially if it's a little bit oily from the cookie but what you do is you put your thumb down in here and what yours what you're trying to do is you're trying to separate right there you can see how it separates this little ziploc thing here and then once you get that open you're supposed to do something like that and like I said it's a little bit difficult you can see I've already taken in my sighting one cookie here but you know to reclose it you just kind of you know like a normal ziploc bag pinch it down and then just go across and and this thing is like heavy-duty ziplock so no kids are gonna get in there I can guarantee that and I think some you know serious like adults are not going to get in there either because this thing is a little bit difficult but let me try it one more time so you just pop your thumb in there and then separate it out all right let's try that one more time so go ahead open this up this way once you get inside be sure to find the portion where you're supposed to stick your thumb which is separated from the packaging and then you can go ahead and stick your thumb down in there and you can figure out your own technique that I like to do this and then pinch it here once you get your thumb in there just pinch it like that and then you pinch hold and pull and I wouldn't really try to force it because it feels like when you try to force it it almost feels like it it doesn't want to open so that's where the frustration can come in from this packaging I think because it's really there's not a lot to work with at least I don't know cuz my hands a little bigger maybe if you had smaller hands it might be better but once you get the hang of it it's not so bad so one of the things well I can already tell this is been out for a little while but you definitely want to put this in the refrigerator you can see the cookie itself it this has been out of the refrigerator for about I don't know maybe 30 minutes 40 minutes and you can already see how this is starting to like you can see how like kind of I don't even want to say it's a moist it almost it's almost like succulent it's weird but this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much inside and unfortunately I started this video before I should have shown you the whole cookie but I'll show you what's left I'm gonna go ahead and eat this now let me show you how big this cookie really is so it's a decent size I've already eaten almost half of it as you can see excuse me while I finish it kind of has a coconut birthday cake flavor to it and as you can see it's fairly thick and I kind of want to break this off just to show you I mean you can see that this cookie is really really moist I don't want to break it all the way but this to me is almost it's it's it needs to go back in the fridge so definitely store your thing in the fridge like I said since this is a video about childproof packaging you know I just would like to say if you have little ones try to stash it in the best place possible but I'm pretty certain that even if your little one was to find something like this because it's got you know cool graphics on it you know there's a cookie on it or at least something that looks like a cookie it's you know it's enticing so I do think that if your little one did find this I think that would have a very hard time getting into this thing they would have to get very lucky you know their little small fingers might be able to find their way into that but you know the other thing is if your bag is a little bit oily maybe that's a better thing because then you know little fingers will slip off of this thing but anyways hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the Korova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "Jq1xU1G918o": "so today we're going to do apple crumble ice cream it's super easy all you're going to do is melt butter to this and then add some ingredients and then put it on the ice cream it's very simple you want to save me i think [Applause] [Music] in this case i didn't wait for it to cook i don't care for it to cool down for a little bit before putting it on um it's a weird mixture of like cold and hot if you do that it still tastes the same because regardless of ice cream's liquid or solids same thing um so i don't know i'd say it's like an eight out of ten um this is something you could definitely put on anything like you could put this on top of a pie put this on top of i don't know something baked good tea i guess i don't know it's like a liquid bowl liquid now so definitely wait for it to cool down", "y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "eee7AaG_kRE": "uh-huh what a funny meme that was oh hello there and welcome to beer review today we're doing waterloo pineapple radler yep that's right blue", "8od3FujuyPg": "hi stay in a wallet how are you today today we're making a delicious blueberry cobbler and I'm going to show you how to make it take one of these pants here and butter it lightly butter it I got a disposal once and make it easy and I'm following a recipe I saw this on the internet supposed to to be the very best blueberry cobbler alright so first we grease the pan preheat the oven to 375 degrees now it's 2 and 1/2 cups of fresh blueberry put over here going right in there so go quick the mall in here you know July is blueberry month and that's what I'm making a nice cobbler here and then we have vanilla put the vanilla on top I'll give you the recipe bottom of the video the lemon juice half a lemon pour that in there cup of sugar that's so that'll be sweet because the berries are tart [Music] come out delicious therefore cup 1/2 of a teaspoon of flour that all in there got everything already so you can do it quickly and tablespoon of melted butter very easy not gonna mix it just everything together now now we're going to make the toppings and tell you what how I made it you have to get a ball ten minutes let it rest there it is right here this is what you put on top of that now it's um it's 1/3 cups of all-purpose flour four teaspoons of baking powder six tablespoons of sugar five tablespoons of butter a cup of milk and it has to rest which I did and what you're going to do is you're going to take this and you're going to put it right on top of the berries so probably any of the berries you don't see the berries it's gonna be like a topping they're all in there well by little and then we're gonna bake it 375 for about 25 minutes totally on the knife comes out clean Russell's got to have very blueberry juice on it but this should be done but the roll up as best you can come out delicious because berries a right to really really ripen July they're delicious New Jersey is the blueberry capital of the world but I don't know if I have any New Jersey blueberries I have Driscoll blueberries I know where they come from don't look a little bit like a little cake batter you know okay and we'll be back for the second video once is all done it's just I never wash my hands here and on top you put a little dash of cinnamon here sprinkle of cinnamon too much a little bit more sugar [Music] that's Hollywood call all right I want to show you what kind of blueberries I have in here just one minute refrigerator blueberries only the finest berries and part of the USA but when and where it comes from here does me tell you let me tell you what stata comes from so I don't know but anyway it's good alright anyway we're gonna put this in here right now hot like hell for 25 minutes after this is all done and it cools I'm gonna come back and we're gonna try it and see how we came out so I'll see you back in about 30 minutes with another video and we'll taste this delicious blueberry cobbler bye bye", "-Yn9dXRFT4Y": "the Joe Rogan experience what was the last second ellic trip you had any I did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today was even on any I was like I was just like oh this room looks like cooler yeah I just feel so oh yeah I ate that little piece yeah you just feel a little better and you're like what is all I took mushrooms yeah I forgot [Applause]", "5VPDLaxuRqc": "FURTHER FURTHER THAN FURTHER THAN MR.

is a dissolvable medication that can be made with a gelatin or wax base to use your trophies first you'll want to wash your hands with warm soapy water before getting started it comes in a prescription container like this so you'll want to take the prescription cover off and then this plastic packaging to make it a little bit easier to work with you can actually twist and kind of select the packaging to loosen it and one side comes with the lid so you can open that lid up and then you'll see that they're pretty easy to separate and if you want to make make it a little bit easier you can flip it and kind of push one out so that would be one method of dispensing and you can see that's easily flexing out or you can flip it back around and then kind of play around with the pieces until you get them out but they should easily kind of separate once you play around with ink come out as a clean piece if the doctor prescribed less than a full trophy it is scored and easy to cut with a knife in 2/4 or 1/2 if needed the trophy should be used as directed by your physician it can be placed either between the teeth and the gums the side of your teeth or under the tongue allow it to fully dissolve for complete absorption of the medication this can take up to fifteen to thirty minutes the goal is to have the medication enter your system through the oral mucosal membrane layer through your skin rather than being swallowed do not eat drink or brush your teeth for 30 minutes after using the medication it is best practice to rotate the location where you place the troche to prevent any irritation these medications can be sweetened or flavored upon request due to the sweetness or flavor of this medication be sure to keep it out of reach from children most trophies do not need to be kept refrigerated they can be stored in a cool dry location or at room temperature do not leave them in your car in direct sunlight or warm places because they can melt if you have any further questions feel free to call our pharmacy at seven one four four six five nine three three four or visit us on the web at blue coast pharmacy com [Music]", "aLG8dlxPbls": "yes yes guys [ __ ] the [ __ ] Hanks and we have the chuckles as you can see I've been going on to make these for a little while these are the the 400 milligram Pat so peaked rings yes yes so if you can read that the air infused THC 400 milligrams 50 milligrams per piece so yeah here we go we're going to do it guys we're going to do it so if you've got some edibles join it with me by all means join in with me I've been looking forward to this one I've saved it for them all in the reason being is obviously because you guys know that my tolerance to cannabis is quite high so I thought well you jump saying we'll do it in the morning when I've had not had anything to eat I am gonna have a smoke here as well I'm gonna smoke through today but we're gonna take these and I'm going to come back on roughly and then I was time when the star when the effects stop taking obviously I look a little bit tired as its first thing in the morning guys so I'm really looking forward to these these chuckles yeah so we're looking at 20 calories per serving so I guess a serving is a sweet though so yeah but I don't really care about that ingredients are calories oil sugar glucose fructose syrup wheat flour are seared dextrose palm oil nice nice nice guys so yeah very very very nice there is a nice warning on there as well so warning me intoxicate intoxicating effects of this product may be delayed by up to two hours may cause drowsiness the product may impair the ability to drive or operate machinery please use extreme caution now I'm still got a ninja with me today ninjas going to take the car off me now she's going shopping so I do not have a car I am NOT gonna be using a car I'm not gonna be operating any machinery as much as probably a toaster as much as I'm gonna do right so not gonna do anything guys so stop talking just let's get the [ __ ] chuckles on oh oh look at that nice nice gonna get my stuff go he's gonna get matched up oh look at these oh there are there are look at them guys what do you think of those see if we can see that see that I can't do the crack ah Sh the snap arch but that's what we're looking at Oh beautiful guys right stop talking just alright girls what's the time right 10:30 10:30 6 9 cheers guys [Music] that's like everyone the sugars seems to be infused nice I do like peach beautiful guys just watching me eat sweets yeah [Music] so you can't take the Congress here there is a distinct flavor of cannabis in that we are [Music] 400 milligrams there guys how much can you guys take to stick it in the comment how much it's going to take you guys to really feel their backs [Music] mm-hmm best for second as the 721 so they got a long a lot of date or love so much sugar in the morning man mmm-hmm I feel like feeling like I'm rushing off the sugar more than here people I'm getting a [ __ ] a bit of a sugar rush [ __ ] going on here my god the things I do to experiment knowing the things I do for this channel then you guys like that boy [Music] someone that guys when I meet my sweet hope you having a good day you been lucky enough to try any of this or anything like that stick in the comments again really into a interested to know what other people's experiences on with them - I mean I'm nailing with vegetables now obviously I do need a slightly higher dosage in mouth but I know also to take a little bit too much whew you can go the other way so you have got be careful [Music] sugaring the more advanced hearsay yeah too much so yeah to explain from last last night's live Bob snake we've got Lana here and we've got ninja here a little robbing in the room basically so my son's in Greece so just to move around a bit of a family night where a few drinks got on the live last night but that's why they're here in this review obviously off screen but yeah they're in the studio like they're in studio oh I mean I can't really normally eat that makes through that then one go but again it's an experiment do like sweets but I just have a couple normalling yeah and then I give it to the girls but not the sweets last one here oh if we should look at that one it's ridiculous to my sugar I need the pack we're gonna have to have as well what can I say guys Silurian sweets at bloody hour past 10:00 in the morning 114 [ __ ] years old but it's for a good cause Bottoms Up boy bottoms up let's see how interesting this get Sam lots of sugar and now secrets of use got every last bit [ __ ] right mmm well gotta say they went that pretty easy although I do feel like I'm having a real mud sugar rush right now won't run smoothly my sugar on them it seems to be more sugar on them but whether that's where the THC is whether it's infuse sugar or if you sweets I don't know I don't know how to make so some people will accuse the sweets as well as the sugar and some people would just put sugar on it so I don't know I don't know animate I will do once I come up on that because I do really really feel it then it's probably all the way through it I would say yeah as I say I need a dose I need a dose so you have four milligrams Bob's up got sugar all by my side by that guy's normal you see smoking videos to me but you've seen any in video me but I'll say it's a good good cause but suppose if you don't need a lot and you had a pack of those and they're like 50 milligrams a sweet you could probably carry them about stab a couple of sweets at a time and just sort of go along your day we as a nice do it mean put in a hundred milligrams into your body every couple of hours or something like that just gives you that little bit of pain relief and stuff like that I bet so good from that point of view that their portions you don't mean I like the fact they are portion in a way so you can do that I'm still I'm mad I just eat all of them all it won't go basically right long time guys so still on the black cheese but I'm still loving life guys 1190 so please join me peace wonder have a bomb and we'll all get along it's one of those I'll be back in roughly about an hour's time and I'll stick the camera on and I'll do another 10 15 minutes with a couple of thongs of snake oh my god I might not be able to smoke anything I don't really know that but we'll see from there yeah so cheers noise [Music] very tasty I did like them I do like Peter sweet son Peter sweets is the one that'll wake you up in the morning yes yes so guys mmm hope you have a good day today if you're watching this video and then you happen to watch the other one like that and yeah I just want to say have a good day by all means be a look out for the pot two of this where you see the effects all right my mighty would jump on a live stream at some point as well so have a good day I'll see you really really soon peace would love guys see you in an hour whoop-whoop", "CX9CI-cQilY": "[Music] wait Samba team and a cartridge because the one video is awakened she push in the best thankful that my life has always been a mess always been attached so one thankful that I never pressed thankful for my family thankful for the herb thankful for the Mac Miller raps on big jar thankful for the dumb and no effect that my idols set down for me for like the chosen one there's nothing in this world I'd rather be I speed the priests and last see the GD lady be the G won't with so you couldn't tell from the title actually on this new channel I haven't had like a week and think or video dedicated to me waking baking yeah basically just waking baking and I decided to why not do one with my favorite that's disorder way to medicate in the morning or just my favorite way to medicate at all it is with cartridge you will see it at the Royal Garden with the raw garden cartridge but I mean you guys most of you guys already know that my favorite way of consuming and oils or cannabis in any way is mainly through cartridges because it's such a convenient way to medicate just it's just easier for me and the battery just makes it a lot better because it has a smart chip in it that basically works around your cartridge and basically finds the right voltage to white wattage to match your cartridge so you don't get burnt taste so you just get like a smooth eating experience and that's what you can get with the pocket but this is just the week in bacon with the cartridge today I haven't like I said I haven't had one of these on this channel I have like saved wake and bakes from those other from my other channel but I just feel like I should record a new wakin bacon not just reupload waking base from past days you know it's it's another thing when it - like reviews and like vlogs and stuff those things I really want to be on YouTube but these other waiting bakes they're more specific for that era or not era that time that I uploaded so let's just say I uploaded one in May I'm not gonna re-up load a way to make me mate is what I'm trying to get it basically I just wants to do we can be have like a little session with you guys in the comfort of my clear things up with the plug in place people are saying look you can have creme plugin please they don't have that whatever these things or whatever in here and I just like to clear it up now just because they didn't have you here they're all fake ones without these but this is from the people themselves this is from plug-and-play themselves okay if I have to show you I have to show you yes I mean you think so on what this would get fake you seriously think someone you think you're gonna send me box and everything we're saying because I have a video that's my second most viewed video on this channel so choose a plug in play versus walk garden and in that video I have a half grab cartridge which I know a lot of these a lot of plugging plays are not half grams okay they're all full grams I know that okay but they from content creators they give us amperes because we already had all I've had all the flavors already imploding play we check back to all my other videos awakening my all deleted but needless to say these may look fake but these are from the source these are what they give to to content creators as samples okay even though they say full grab on there the it's a half gram but yeah I just thought clear that out of the way because some people they just think they know everything just a half gram that's fake and I feel it you know I feel it but I feel like I have to explain myself to you know I have never smoked any of the fake cartridges of any sorts of brands ever okay I'm not gonna start with plug-and-play so I just gotta clear my name is I don't want to be accused of promoting fake [ __ ] is what I had was actually from the source okay hopefully you guys have been enjoying my videos last week today is the 3rd of December but about last week guys like five minute video so hopefully you guys enjoyed that I am still planning on videos I kind of stopped uploading on my other two channels for now just because I kind of want to focus on on the main one for now but don't get me wrong I still care about those out GT 401 and the music ones I still have two videos on each channel to be uploaded I just I just been slacking mainly because I've just been going to focus more on my main channel first and then the secondary and third channels they will get next they all get dealt with so with this you could press the button or you can not press the button and when you press the butter we hold the button instead of not hitting our holding it basically gives you a fatter here this one's more enjoyable and you can also tell by the hello so if you just hit it it's gonna be white like you hold the button it's gonna be like a rainbow flashing color [Music] [Music] raw garden cartridge man just I'll let you guys know this is a full Ram I pay thirty-six bucks and I know that's like very cheap for a raw garden I've seen it as much as 70 and I am located in the Central Valley Modesto 209 so like that's why the price is like that and I'm not saying that just because I find the price like that over here it's gonna be the same price where you're at because even in Modesto different dispensaries will be selling it for different prices and that's not even seen location of a city no likely time Cisco's definitely gonna be way more expensive than here so just keep that in mind when you watch my videos you know I am showcasing the price around my area and not your area unless you are in my area that yes other than that wake and makes usually get you in the morning says the first time you smoking within like dumb and nine hours [Music] so that's probably gonna be the last hitting that I'm actually pretty high you guys you guys moderate yourself you know you got to know that you can't resist me and everybody I don't need to waste any more actually want to guess like I feel it grateful the other than that when but it's near really high there's no use wasting it and so building up in higher tolerance than them sorry once you're high enjoy what you're gonna do no you don't need to focus on getting behind minutes every now and then you know when you want to relax just like when people want to drink so much that they just want to forget things I feel it you know smoke a lot do you think in the long run save yourself some money to save yourself some tolerance you know I'm saying because I just talked to my friend Blake apparently he smokes five grams a week that's a hundred to about a hundred and fifty a week times that by four that's four hundred to six hundred a month that's crazy but flour users would definitely will definitely use more money because an eighth of weed won't last even a day I feel like so I feel like people that just smoke flour with high tolerances are gonna spend a lot more than people that just look back so you know pick your pick your vice you know I'm saying pick the way you want to get higher Medicaid so other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this little rant waken Baken session cartridge well I'm going to be calling it but somewhere along the lines of that turn it up a little bit yeah hopefully you guys enjoyed the video I can't even think of gay thankful for my friends thankful that my dad isn't Lucy pushing offense thankful that my life has always been a mess always been the test so one thankful that I never pressed thankful for my family thankful for the herb for the Mac Miller raps on big jar thankful for the dumb and no effect that my idols sat down for me for like the chosen one there's nothing in this world I'd rather be SP de prisa nice to see the chief deal lately BG while we change [Music]", "BVeNyeJ2f5s": "direct connection is made by MPT to serve all of our diverse communities and is made possible by the generous support of our members thank you live from Maryland public television this is direct connection with Jeff Salkin welcome to direct connection we are live tonight from the state's largest grower of medical marijuana these plants which it would be illegal to have outside of this building are the beginning of the growing process here at curio wellness joining us is Michael Braun fine curio CEO thanks for having us nice to come in Jeff first question is why am I wearing the bunny suit because this is a plant where we grow raw material to create medicine and so under FDA regimes it has to be hygienic we don't use any type of pesticides insecticides or any other crop control agent except or law of water and fertigation and people may hear this is a noisy environment it's the air purification it's bright LED lights tell me about the business this has been live for over a year now what's happened in that here it's been an exciting time and candidly a lot of time of great learning when you undertake a new disruptive industry you build a theoretical model about what you think it's going to be and then you create an actual operating plan and then you learn you've made plenty of mistakes and I've played it wrong in substance but you had some good ones also and and so we have evolved literally 180 degrees over this first year through a lean management system and some other techniques we use to the point where this is a very well oiled machine now where we're delivering large quantities a product every week with no defects and great customer satisfaction globally we got beyond your company what's happened to medical cannabis in over the last year or two I think it's become more more accepted as a true medicinal product and I think some of the historical negatives or things that people thought they were probably aided by the government with your Falls are starting to clear way so it's kind of dark clouds going away and interestingly the largest cohort of growth for us has been baby boomers and I suspect first of all they probably had some castle experience back in college but more importantly they got a lot of aches and pains and traditional medicines can sometimes be interactive in a way that's not very good and the medicinal cannabis plan is very safe it has very low interaction tolerance so it allows you to use it with many other things at low levels in a very effective way let's explain how the system works in Maryland designed by the legislature there are licenses for growers and retailers essentially and somebody in the middle what what do you have so there are three different licenses there is a cultivation license to grow the plants there is a processing or manufacturing license to create the product that is in some other form you extract the oil from the plant and then you turn it into other pills capsules like and then there's a retail distribution network those are the dispensaries we're fortunate to be one of seven companies that has all three licenses but our primary business is to enable the success of the dispensers across the state by giving them our products on a very regular and consistent basis you're a business guy trail of successful healthcare businesses private equity businesses so you didn't come into this I don't believe as a marijuana expert you've learned something about these plants the things behind us the big ones it looks like a topiary a sort of thing and then we have these little cuttings yes sir these came from that that's correct these are called mother plants we use a cloning process so that we could get the genetics from a particular strain exactly the same from crop the crop plant the plant so we have a proprietary process for picking seeds turning them into the best by winning out the weaker genetics through both growing and testing we have a lab here and then once we get to the prime prop if you will will use one of these mother plants for approximately four months the first thing we do with the new mother is we take cuttings and start creating the new baby that's going to become the next mother because these mothers have a useful life where the quality of the plant is determined by how many cuttings you click that as it gets older they diminish in quality so we focus on measuring certain cannabinoid content and other markers of health and yield and we try to maximize the life of the plant to optimize that yield let me remind our viewers if you have a question about medical cannabis shortly we're going to be talking to the head of the pharmacy the dispensing operation you can send us an email no phone calls tonight but send an email to live questions at mptv.org and we'll try to get your question answered during the program what's your competition like and and how do you do things differently than the rest of the market well one of a very few that are only dedicated to medicinal cannabis we are not in favor of nor do we want adult use because we think Maryland is a place where we can build an ecosystem in an industry that creates exportable intellectual property and products and we'd like to see that happen in fact we've just worked with the legislature on a new bill to allow for academic research here in Maryland and so most of the companies haven't made the investment in the pharmaceutical grade environment and equipment that we've had and they don't have people from big pharma like we have we're working with chemistry and drug discovery and such things there are some very fine companies out there and then there's some companies that really just want to grow cannabis because they think it's a good thing and they think they can make money doing it but they're not dedicated to the investment research and development that we are the trend is moving in the direction as you said of varying degrees of legalization whether recreational becomes law in Maryland at some point or not but federal law has changed Congress passed President signed a bill and I think it was a side item in the bill but it makes CBD and I get that letters mixed up that's correct but it basically legalizes CBD and hemp is that right it legalizes the CBD that's derived from him CBD could come from hemp or it could come from the cannabis plant they're both derivative of an original plant the hemp plant has very very low acid less than 0.03 percent THC the psychoactive agent that's in cannabis in if it were to qualify for his half and so now because of the farm bill which what you're referring to people will be able to on a state-by-state basis decide what level of participation the Hef market they want so they've kind of maybe the state's Rights Act but with a pure go-ahead from the federal government CBD is the stuff that gets all the press lately does it affect your business model if somebody without all of this investment overhead it can grow acres of hemp and refined CBD out of it less expensively potentially yes and no it really doesn't because in our case we could grow at very low costs and in addition we have to have certain levels of purity and we don't know yet if hemp can deliver that because we've never work with it but we know we can get it from cannabis so we now a full flower or hygienic cultivation chambers we call them that's filled with a 18 to 1 CBD to THC ratio plant which we use for our CBD products ultimately I think if it is available and it's pure we'll buy it as a raw material just like we buy other raw materials that we don't create on our own first question in my email how can somebody invest in this industry your privately held but not everybody is there is a about 30 or 40 new newly minted canadian public stocks to which actually trade on american exchanges and so you can pick through one of those one of our local competitors here we happen to think a lot of is a company called GTI they've recently went public so you know there's a lot of companies out there that we think are very good but their public this is a family-owned business we have outside investors but we're going to continue to just build it and grow it and keep it i have a bunch of emails on some of the more technical questions about prescribing so what we're going to do is take a break and we will come back with your clinical director as direct connection continues on MPT got an unused vehicle going

explore we believed in the capacity for goodness and the potential for greatness [Music] CBS CBS CBS [Music] back live at curieux wellness at an undisclosed location in Baltimore County I'm joined by Brian sanderoff who runs the side of the business that sells things to people how do you describe what you do over there so on the general manager and the clinical director of the dispensary so my job is to make sure that one we're helping patients making sure that they're getting the right products the right way counsel patients all day long also make sure that we're living up to all of the regulatory requirements that we don't do anything wrong what's the last year they've been like for you it's been a whirlwind it's just unbelievable so our dispensary has been open for about 10 months 11 months now and it's just been fantastic surprise after surprise every day I get up excited to go to work seeing what I'm going to learn let me ask you a slightly skeptical question which is what I do I mean clearly a lot of people are being helped by this but you also read increasingly about people smoking this stuff psychoses impaired driving how do you think about the balance between taking the good stuff and and people maybe not knowing what to do with the dangerous parts so the way that I approach to this is that I want people to be able to use this in a guided way and using it in an unguided way it's much more likely to cause problems than if you're using it guided properly so that plant contains hundreds of bioactive compounds and matching the right ones to the right person with the right condition is how you eliminate or real you know lower the chance of having problems the intermediate step that Michael was talking about between grow these things and sell this stuff which we'll talk about right describe the functionality there how does it work and and how is it evolving it's amazing the way it's evolving and especially the way that we occur you go after it making sure that what we're making is reliable it's repeatable we know it's going to be effective for people more like a pharmaceutical than it is an herb more the science than the art of using this medicine we we mind the research we do some research on our own we put together products that we think are going to be effective we test them alright we haven't we haven't talked about this stuff before but but I'll ask it in terms of the most common complaints that people walk in the door with and and how some of this may be able to help me Payne definitely I can't tell you how many patients I have who are no longer on opioids where they were six months ago a year ago sleep is a big issue a lot of autoimmune diseases things like ms neurological problems like Parkinson's or ALS anxiety all right so what might you yeah a whole variety of products that are available here in all sorts of different forms so this is a container that would actually contain the flour the raw flour that someone would grind down and then either smoke or consume with the vaporizer these are packages for the actual vapes that we have and so this is an oil that someone would attach to a battery and vaporize that there are pre-rolled cannabis products I'm sorry we used to call these joints now they're called free rolls right or there's all sorts of ways to consume the medicine in a different way so this is a tincture that somebody would put underneath their tongue and it would absorb through the mucosa in their mouth there's some advantages to doing it that way one of the things as a pharmacist I love about that is that I can be very very specific with the dosage that I'm giving somebody there are topicals there are all sorts of concoctions that people use viewer writes in and says you mentioned not being completely supportive of recreational abuse can you elaborate on that so as I said I want people and it's funny because I don't even think in terms of adult use versus medical anymore I just think in terms of guided versus unguided and what I want to do is make sure that people are using this medicine in the most appropriate way for them and there could be lots of ways that it may be used inappropriately maybe there's interactions with prescription medicines that they're on maybe the combination of cannabinoids that someone uses isn't really good for someone that has anxiety and so I just want people to use it in a guided way how good is the data that the guidance is based on it gets to this email from a viewer for adults over 50 who need to manage pain are there long-term studies concerning short and long term memory loss so yes there are although I have to say that a lot of the studies don't come from the United States because of the constraints that have been put on cannabis here in the in the United States it's been difficult for institutions to do the kind of studies that we're used to but we can look to Israel we can look to Europe we can look to Canada where they've been doing studies and there are the short-term memory thing is completely manageable if we're using the right combination of medicine and if it were to happen to somebody when they stopped using the medicine that problem has a tendency to go away but I can tell you with 11 months of clinical experience I have not seen that problem how does it work in Maryland the nuts and bolts of it somebody can't just walk in off the street to your office and walk out with something correct so the step one is they have to become registered they do that online they go to the MMC C which is the Maryland medical cannabis commission website click on the button for patients and you upload some information and then you become registered that process right now is taking somewhere between two and four weeks assuming all those things are correct you'll get a 16 digit number that starts with the letter P for patient step two is then to become a certified patient which means you have to go to a prescriber or a recommender who will certify that you are a valid patient for using cannabis once that done then you can go into a dispensary and get medicine there was a pretty liberal definition of who the prescribers can be here right you don't have to be an MD well so you could be an MD you can be a nurse practitioner you could be a podiatrist or a dentist if I if I had that correct they all have to be able to prescribe controlled substances right now so you have to have a c.d.s license to be able to recommend this okay viewer wants to know can medical cabinet cannabis alleviate pain from Lyme disease have you seen Lyman I've had several patients that I can think of right away that have had success with that so it's not necessarily the Lyme that it's treating it's the pain part of that cannabis has shown to be has been shown to be anti-inflammatory very very helpful for pain well let's see the question about him and I asked Michael about this this earlier the federal government basically legalizing CBD through the hemp channel that's on that we use it we sell it to our patients they don't have to be members or registered within the Commission to be able to use it basically you can get it over the counter okay see so you can sell some stuff to people who are not registered that's correct so hemp Durai of CBD doesn't really have THC in it and can be very effective although I'll tell you that clinically most of us feel that CBD with at least a little bit of THC is more effective than CBD by itself okay all those letters confuse me a little bit THC is the stuff that people who are into recreationally that's the that's the one where you can feel some euphoria from where has CBD been tested I mean what do we actually know about it other than it's hot at the moment well it has been tested and we do see results with pain for anxiety for energy helping with sleep if that sleep problem is related more to anxiety and pain muscle relaxation seizures immune function all of those issues or conditions have been shown to be helped by CBD CBD from hemp hemp is sort of like a cousin of cannabis so it supplies the CBD which is another can happen I didn't by the way there's I think they've discovered over a hundred different cannabinoids now and so when you and I have this discussion in a year and then another year we'll we'll know so much more how often do people consult dr. Google before they they come see you in other words how much how much research are our people doing how accurate is the stuff that people find online about these products I'd say the accuracy is about the same as in regular medicine when people consult doctor Google you can find some good information and some bad information that's why people come to us that's why I'd like to see people use it in a guided way and use it that guidance from a health professional who understands biochemistry potential interactions with other medicines that someone might be using I would say that a lot of my patients especially the sort of cannabis naive patients they haven't done any research they've heard about it either from their doctor or from a neighbor they get certified and then they come in and then they rely on us to help educate them what's happening in the medical community so you were a long-term licensed pharmacist do you think the establishment the medical establishment is becoming more favorable not to what degree what do you think what do you see yeah there's sort of three camps out there and there's the ones who are the adopters who understand it who see results with their patients and like it there's that camp that says I'm not sure I don't know about it and then there's a camp that says no you can't use it or you shouldn't use it and so I'd say it's changing and it's it's shifting and probably this shift is most responsible for that shift is patients coming in telling their doctors that they're getting results very good Brian sanderoff curio Wellness thank you for

curio wellness Michael Braun fine is the CEO here how many are standing next to a lovely plant by the way how many how many folks have you hired in starting this up so far we've had 105 people and I'm proud to say that over the course of the first 18 months 18 of them have been promoted from an entry-level job to a mid manager from amid to a higher level and we instituted once we passed over break-even a living wage so our minimum wage in this building is $15 what are most of those folks doing I know there's a big production operation here yes what are most of the jobs like so there's really kind of semi skilled and highly skilled so 70 school would be people that do horticulture preparation pruning planning all the things required to tender to the plants and then the trimming curing and packaging lumber those take various levels the skill sets that we've developed trading programs and best practices around all those on the manufacturing side we have chemists we have pharmacologists we have people who are involved in analytical work and so there's a number of advanced degree people who are doing drug discovery formulation and then we have a manufacturing team who takes the oil that we create they purify they separate it and then they create recipes and we create products where do you think there might be misconceptions among regulators among your fellow business people among members of the public about just what has happened since this might live in Maryland and and what the business is all about I think probably the first misconception is that people don't appreciate the level of quality the maryland program has we have an excellent testing protocol here so the public is getting very safe product no medals no pesticides no contaminants of all and and all of us all the growers in this state have to abide by a very very strict regulatory regime for hygienic quality so we're providing cannabis and cannabis derived products that are highly pure where can people get more information well they can go to our website curie wellness.com they can go to the maryland medical cannabis commissioner by the way we call it cannabis not marijuana it's its proper name so well I say can I say marijuana sometimes so people understand what I'm talking about we're trying to change the conversation that's a lot of part of what our strategy's about it talking about science and facts as opposed to other things so but the the Maryland medical cannabis commission website is also a good spot very good Michael Brown find CEO here thanks for the time thanks for making us sort of look funny and appreciate it thank you for joining us for direct connection we're back Thursday with your money & business and I joined this Friday for state circle and a full wrap-up on the week's news from Annapolis please follow us on Twitter at MPT News Now for all of us at MPT thanks for watching and have a good night [Music] [Music] this program was made by MPT to serve all of our diverse communities", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "9C5X4KQQZlM": "caramel apple bars first start off with 14 ounce bag of caramels which is about 55 of them or something to that effect put them in unwrap them put them in a saucepan and add a little bit of water about a tablespoon to the bottom and then just melt these over a little heat while you're waiting for those to melt in a large bowl put a cup of brown sugar half a cup of butter or margarine and a quarter cup of shortening half a teaspoon of salt and a half a teaspoon of baking soda and then just stir those things together using a wooden spoon or an electric mixer it's up to you until those are nicely creamed together if you're using salted butter you can leave that salt right out you're not going to miss it one little bit then one and three-quarter cups of all-purpose flour and one and a half cups of quick cooking oats and you stir this together until you get a kind of a crumbly mixture it's going to be a little bit dry so don't worry about that and you're gonna take out two cups of it because that's going to be put on as a topping so I'll put take out two cups and set that aside and then you're gonna chop up four and a half cups of apples and that's a boat of three large ones and add three tablespoons of flour and then just toss the apples in the three tablespoons of flour then in a 9 in 9 by 13 inch baking dish it's been greased you're gonna put the rest of the crumb mixture in the bottom spread it around press it down put your apples on top and there's the caramels all melted you can just eat that with a spoon so good and then simply spread or pour the caramels melted caramels over top of the apples and then top it with the two cups of the topping mix that you set aside then you're going to bake this at 400 degrees 25 to 30 minutes until it's golden brown I actually ended up reducing the heat to 350 cuz I found that was browning too quickly in the apples weren't cooking so I recommend at 350 for about 35 minutes and there it is just under the oven golden brown you can see the caramel bubbling up along the edges while this is still warm if you cut it into bars cuz the caramel has a tendency to get a little bit a little bit crunchy along the edges when when it's cool and stored in the fridge this tastes a lot like apple crisp a little bit like apple pie you can definitely taste the caramel it is really good very very sweet so you kind of eat it in small pieces but it is a nice quick dessert and everyone loved it to give it a try", "5-o1BEb8eek": "now speaking of getting high yeah you know not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "tMTECZXNahA": "hi I'm Megan girls from bluestem restaurant in Kansas City Missouri and today I'm going to make our stone fruit cobbler from bluestem the cookbooks in our summer section and it features a variety of fresh summer stone fruits typically so nectarines and peaches are featured in the recipe we also asked for assorted berries so we're going to use today some blueberries blackberries and strawberries and our peaches and nectarines have been peeled and sliced to be all kind of the same size because you want your fruit about the same so it'll work well together when it bakes our spices which is pardon nutmeg cinnamon a little cornstarch for thickening fresh sugar vanilla extract we're going to use fresh grated ginger and orange zest and then we're gonna top it off with some sugar cookie dough that's in the freezer chilling so to assemble the cobbler it's very very easy we're just gonna take our fresh fruits and combine it all in a bowl and we're just gonna mix it by hand there's really no wrong way to do this recipe you can mix out the fruits as well if you don't care for strawberries you can omit them if you would rather use just all peaches or nectarines or all berries you can certainly do that as well we're gonna add a good amount of sugar to it this is about two tablespoons roughly it's measured out precisely in the cookbook but I do have a note in there that just says to remember to taste your fruit and adjust your seasonings and your sugar as needed our seasonings like I said this is just cinnamon cardamon nutmeg and we're just gonna give it a little bit of a touch on there our peaches are really really juicy but our fruit is pretty firm so I think about two tablespoons of cornstarch would work just fine with that and what I like to do is mix it by hand at this point once you've got the fruit tossed in your season your sugar and your cornstarch then you want to use a fresh orange tangerine or any kind of citrus really works lemon is also nice and you just want to give a nice fresh grate that of zest into the fruits I also like to add some fresh ginger as well and we're just gonna zest some of that in there as well you can really make this recipe your own I love nutmeg it's one of my favorite spices so I almost always include that in things but you don't have to laughter the zest is added toss in your vanilla extract what you want to do with the dishes is we want to sugar and butter them so of course we're using blue of our butter which is amazing and we're just gonna butter them by hand the butter will help add a little bit of creaminess to it and look at it a little bit of fat that I think is needed and overall it just kind of helps to buy into that sugar that we're gonna put in the molds as well to the ramekins it kind of gives a nice crust to the side once you have your benefits buttered and sugared you're going to spoon in the fruit just until it mounds you want a nice mound of fruits on top  you have all of your fruit mounded nicely in your ramekins you want to pull your sugar cookie dough out of the freezer this has been sitting in the freezer overnight so it's nice and hard it just makes it easier to cut so what I do is just cut off strips of the dough so that they're about the same size about a half inch or so and they don't have to be perfect again you're making cobbler so it can be a little bit rustic and you're just gonna cube it up slightly and we're just gonna dot the fruit like you would with butter when you're making a pie and I kind of take it and flatten it just slightly with my hands so that it will actually kind of sit flat on the on the fruit and you know anywhere from about three to four pieces a little bit of a balancing act at first to get them to get them stuck on there but once they bake they're all gonna bake down together and remember your fruit will shrink slightly so they won't be as tall as you see here after they come out of the oven the last thing you want to do is also dot a little bit of butter in the dish as well just like we did because we sugar and butter didn't sugared the dish you also want to add just a touch more butter into the actual cobbler again you're gonna add a little bit of that milky creaminess that butter butter gives when it melts and bakes into things just like a pie you want to just dab a little bit of fresh cream over the tops of your and then lastly we do a little bit of cinnamon sugar on the top so again you're adding just a little bit more sugar on the top which is why you want to go careful with your fruit not to over sugar it because you have it in the ramekins you have it on top as well and those are your cobblers they should be kind of big and mounted and lots of goodness inside and then you're gonna bake them at about 350 degrees you want to go a little bit hotter than you normally would just to give it a nice blast of heat to them you want to bake them till they're golden brown on top until the fruit is bubbling inside kind of like a pie with liquidus when it's getting out of the oven this is Meghan garel from bluestem restaurant in Kansas City Missouri", "hebvgdlyzYQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] good morning so I finally made it and I am now in drum roll made as a candidate I got here last night around like I want to say three four in the morning I would have blogged like me driving stuff but that's kind of boring and I would have did customs but customs is not name playing no games at that border she was not only I was some little friendly stuff she was not only and I pulled up somebody come on radio off I said he gets he'll be twice miss lady turned it off and she asked me five thousand questions literally questions I don't even understand why you need to know the answer to well how much money do you have on you why do you need to know that everything is just so nice here like it's just generally just nice the view is nice the Sun feels nice low you can see the Sun reflecting off my skin right now but I will say last night when I got here there was snow on the ground not like three inches of snow heavy snow but really I was driving around through some of the neighborhoods and stuff and they were powerless no yards full of snow and now I wake up this morning to sunnysean it and there are people downstairs swimming in the pool so our regions don't know how things work at Toronto it's clearly they just do it different here apparently you can snow one day and then you wake up and go swim in the next so hey I'm not gonna complain I'm gonna go put my swim trunks and I'm gonna go get in that pool later today but for now I'm just get my day started on the shower get dressed for today and then I'm gonna go explore some of the smoke shops because weed is legal in Canada so I'm gonna go see what's that's like I see if they got a gasser another thing I know gasps I'm gonna clown the whole store because you just cannot have a weed shop used to finish smelling rage now after that I'm gonna get some lunch or something and then I'll probably go I don't know today I'm in like a relaxing move so maybe I should go do some chilled stuff like our own little Museum or something go get a massage go spicy a little bit see what I can get myself into see if I can find a place to take pictures at and then after that I'll probably try to get some more food well let you see what we get let's just see where the day takes me I fell to the small shop that's my first mission smoke shops cuz I have to go see this is gas or not cause if it's not gas listen all right to get ready and we gonna air through the smoke shops okay so the hard part is now finished I got already did everything I had to do have my little pre-party turned up in my hotel room now the first stop is to go get lunch so I was looking online and the first thing God that popped up for like good food places he was plantain and it's supposed to be like this vegan place and I'm like have vegan have ice to eat chicken tenders whatever is not that it's not important but we're gonna try a plan to see if it's any good and then what you don't see what a day takes us hopefully Fanta is good because honestly I'm very hungry like very very hungry and I just don't have time for my foods to not be good because if my food is not good it's just gonna be a bad time all around for everybody involved all parties the waiter the manager the doorman the security guard at the parking lot everybody's gonna have a bad day if this food is bad but it is cross no bad vibes we gon expect this to be good let's hit the planter and dad so I just left plants on not too long ago the food is actually really good it fills you up really fast I wasn't able to finish my whole meal but I got the general gist of it and it was actually really good um I had an energizer shot the orange drink that was an energizer shot and it had like ginger in it that was actually to me nasty but it's only because I don't like ginger not because of anything else the lemonade was good fries are good they had some like dipping sauce I don't know what it was she said it was like dijon or something but I didn't hear what she said so now I am on my way to the smoke shop that is on the corner it's either this tree that I'm walking towards or the other Street but I'll figure that out after I start walking I guess I'm gonna go see what the smoke job is about hopefully they got good guess so that okay no you have seen but somebody will see what that's about hopefully I let me record in there if they don't then I'll try to like sneak a couple get a couple videos or something for ya everybody can see what's going on in the smoke shop because I'm curious as to how they do this here in how they I'm curious to how they go about the we stuff here too because it's legal here but it's not legal in the state so I'm wondering we don't see how they um how do you operate with the whole week [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I'm back from the smoke shop back in my hotel room and I got some food on the way to the smoke shop was crazy it's like a whole like personal shopper in it like somebody follows you around a store but I don't follow you but like you can go up to somebody and ask them like oh can I get some help and then they have like this little tablet thing where they walk around the store with you basically and tell you about each turn each other disposable pens the pre-rolls all type of stuff while you were on tell you about everything the name she rang you up on the thing and he goes at the front and check out they do ID you at the door though because I think in Canada you have to be 19 in order to buy legal marijuana but yeah that was super dope and then food was I just went to the bottom the floor level in my hotel and got a turkey burger from the little cafe down there but let me show you what I got from the hallway story so this is the bag it comes in I spent honestly I could not tell you how much I spend was in Canadian dollars and not a US so I don't know I spend a hundred twenty Canadian dollars it you know either convert that to us okay this is afraid it's already open don't don't only or nothing this is a disposable DAP in whoa there's disposable with THC pen it's tangerine dream innocence sativa him and it actually tastes just like oranges like its Lily just like oranges I don't really like it because I don't like oranges blood is what is the actual pin looks like it's already at the box because I was ripping it in a car I poured it like 20 times so there's that that was the disposable pan was 38 Canadian dollars again if you know how to convert it you got it okay this is the good supply Royal Highness pre-rolled blowing that's what it looks like it's not open yet because I didn't phone my readers need to bless yet that was 14 canadian dollars and as you can buy them one for you come bottom as singles or you can buy them in like some of them come in packs how about when it's a pack this is a single so it was one for one gram but then some of them say like five four five minutes which means that there's five blunts in there well five four one gram so it'll be five blunts in there at each dunno one gram this is an indica THC pyro blunt this is oh it's called Soleil oh this is there were new strands it's a reduced rate this is the one that grows only about its carbon new it's an indica and this is a female but it's 10 Canadian dollars and it's 14.5 so this is 0.5 Grambling also I'm not at telling nobody to smoke I'm not advocating nobody to go smoke out their smoke I'm just saying this is what I do she's known to get her money on me but I'm not very smart this is the houndstooth hybrid notice it's a sativa help sooth sativa one gram this is the actual flower here they call them flowers this is the actual like look you gotta roll up it you know this person got explaining this off this is the five things I was talking about so there's five pre-roll blessing here and there each one gram this is the the boss it's called the Boston Tea Party yeah and that is 31 Canadian dollars and these are it doesn't say but I'm trying to remember where I picked them up at in a store I want to say it's a sativa yeah it definitely is yes is this even yeah so that's pretty much I don't like to see what the rest of this stuff just all these products hitting like again I'm sure yeah that's pretty much it for today I just pick up tomorrow I started doing more stuff but let's taking the view one last time before a game for the day [Music] [Music]", "wYX_zhlTDr8": "you tried these new berries and cream starburst pardon me what could have stopped busters you just say very Larry's better than what else and cream Oh berries and cream berries and creams I'm a little out of those berries and cream there is a grave there is a pretty mom with a lot of those berries cream [Music]", "8UPEnqQdY5A": "if you missed studio 10 last week we teased blueberry cobbler this week and we're excited that this week is here and so is the blueberry cobbler it's here we tell nothing but truth here on lucy grier we are so excited to have lucy here with us from greers working on a sweet treat today tell the folks about this blueberry cobbler recipe the truth is this is the easiest cobbler recipe you will ever make and of course we're using blueberries today because they have been looking so pretty they're so um nice and huge wow look at that they're gorgeous so i'm using blueberries today but i like to do the same thing with blackberries or any um any fruit that is in season or whatever is your favorite so we're going to start with an 8x8 baking dish i'm just going to give it a little spray or you could um you know of course grease it with butter and then i'm just going to put these blueberries directly in here and the good thing like i said is this is just the simplest recipe and what i kind of like about this too is i'm just picking out any stems that are on the blueberries sure what i like about this too is it's not um like a super super super sweet cobbler it has a little bit of tartness to it yeah because we're about to put half of a lemon the juice of half of a lemon on these blueberries so the crust is nice and sweet but the whole thing isn't too over sweet well i like a lot of that so so i like that because things that are too sweet for me personally not a huge fan and then second of all you're talking about how simple this is sometimes the best things you can cook are very simple it doesn't take a whole lot to make a delicious dish that is so true and you know i love my little thing right there that i use to catch all the um all the seeds from the lemons so i'm just going to toss the lemon juice in here and then we only have a few other ingredients to make the crust so it'll come together really quick all right sounds great we'll tell you all about the rest of this recipe and what you need to know about the latest at griers when we come back in just a little bit with more of this blueberry cobbler you may have heard the microphone right there it's close to my stomach and it's grumbling it's wednesday and our good friend lucy greer is with us now on a wednesday sometimes you just need something sweet right that is so true middle of the week you just gotta get to the weekend you gotta get to the weekend that's right and then you can eat something sweet on the weekend yeah yeah and if you only eat sweets on the weekend you can prepare it on wednesday and that way it's just ready like friday five o'clock yeah that's like ready to go in the oven so good we're talking blueberry cobbler you guys this looks absolutely amazing for folks who are just now tuning in you were saying your cobbler is a little bit more tart yeah and that's kind of what's nice about it it's a little bit different and and really i'm saying cobbler but it's a little bit of a cross between a cobbler and really a crumble um because we're not gonna do um a traditional pie crust um which is you know of course what you would find with the cobbler so maybe i should be saying crumble but either way whatever you call it is delicious so what we already did was in our 8x8 baking dish uh put in about four cups of blueberries and of course use whatever whatever fruit you like the same recipe will work for strawberries or blackberries or peaches or anything so um and i tossed them in the juice of half of a lemon so that's what chelsea was talking about that it's going to be a little bit of a sweet and tart and now mixing up the the top is so simple what i have in the bowl is a cup of sugar and a cup of flour and i'm going to add a quarter teaspoon of salt and a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon i'm just going to mix these up real quick i don't add the cinnamon in mine that's enough what um what do you do i follow the and you know it's not sometimes it works out sometimes it doesn't so i think i'm gonna adopt your recipe yeah the one cup rule i think it's one one cup of milk and one cup of sugar yeah i think that's it um but like i said i'm not the best cook um and sometimes it's a little too like juicy the crust and then sometimes there's like no crust at all yeah no i know what you're saying i know exactly what recipe you're talking about never made that but it's so good um but yeah no just like depending on the fruit and the season and all that kind of stuff it can be um you know a little finicky um when you're dealing with it sure but this one's easy yeah this one's super easy so and i just cracked an egg in here um so we're just gonna stir this up and it's gonna be um you know like it is right here crumbly and um and it's going to look kind of like wet sand and you know kind of dry so we just get this all mixed up and we're going to sprinkle it over the top and then the last step a little bit later will be we're going to melt half a stick of butter and we're just going to drizzle that over the top and it's ready to go in the oven oh my god see it just comes together so quick and this would be a really good one for kids to help out doing because we're not on the stove you know we don't have anything sharp going on and it's nice because there's a lot of things that they can measure and they can stir and it's just something really good for kids yeah super easy so we're going to pour that over here if you at home haven't downloaded the greers app it is absolutely amazing whether you want to do pickup delivery they can do it all of course you can find all of these great ingredients very affordable too so when we come back lucy we're melting the butter we're going to pop this in the oven for about how long it is going to take about an hour 45 to 55 minutes which is kind of hard to believe and then this is going to be wonderful served over ice cream or on its own or you know even over um some pound cake or something i am starving some blueberry whatever we're calling this crumble cobbler it's all deliciousness so i'll have the rest of the recipe coming up on studio 10. happy wednesday we're back in the studio 10 kitchen with our good friend lucy finishing up this blueberry cobbler such an easy recipe yes it just took no time for us to put this together we have an 8 dish and we put about 4 cups of blueberries in here they were just gorgeous so i just knew i had to do something with the blueberries it's so nice we just our produce buyers do such a good job buying you know what's in season what's local and what we can get an amazing deal on so they are constantly putting out um we talked about our fresh picks before some meat and produce deals every week online so we started out with four cups of those and then we just mixed up a cup of sugar a cup of flour and an egg and we also did a little bit of cinnamon and some salt we mixed that all together and just sprinkled it over the top and now the final touch is we just have half a stick of butter that i melted in the microwave we're just going to drizzle this over it and i'll be ready for the oven it's going to take about 45 to 55 minutes just at 350 to cook and then you can eat it by itself or you can put it over ice cream or whatever you want to do with it this sounds absolutely amazing you guys it looks so good the finished product i was just telling you there's so many blueberries a lot of the times in a crumble or a cobbler most of it is kind of that that delicious goodness on top but your recipe has so many of the blueberries in it that is so true and when i was younger um at my grandparents house posey and papa we could always pick what we wanted for supper because he was the cook and then what we wanted for dessert um because she did all the baking and i would always

and they actually played a little trick on me and it worked so I'm actually gonna do a live demonstration with somebody a complete stranger they don't know they've never seen this product before but they brought up a problem and I had a solution for them which is this and I'm gonna show their hands in this video and they're gonna try to try to figure this thing out okay so this is the e pack I think that's a company name but it's basically it's a childproof bag okay so here it goes alright opening I think I would name sensory remember this is a complete stranger this is not this is not a setup okay okay I'm gonna give you some more time anything you want except scissors okay I wouldn't do that all right can you try it okay hold this camera like this like that all right so it's a child it's a child safety lock there you can try that right there bring it down okay all right can we turn this thing around no okay so here it goes okay it's child lock you got a pull back that's how it opens okay so you pulled the back with the lever with the front gear now I think that was like kind of a kind of a genius idea you know I was on the show like these like yeah this is childproof like

journey there's some kind of plan being made okay do michael clarify the two of wands for gemini march 18th oh my gosh a wedding marriage some kind of higher commitment maybe schooling maybe there's something you're learning maybe somebody's learning a higher way of being so they can handle the lower when it comes around this is being able to handle anything that's being thrown at you it could be something that you do for work there may be a blockage in communication in the near future gemini you might be put at a standstill to kind of find out more or learn more something might have been exposed for you maybe you might have your very own intuitive gifts yourself but yeah you're really focused on this two and two could be a twin flame situation it could be a wedding for sure something that could have gone the distance but it makes me feel like that like i said i could have is there there's something here with the lovers in reverse archangel michael clarified the lovers in reverse four of wands in reverse look at that like i was just saying two of swords two of wands equals the four of wands but with the lovers in a verse there's something a little fishy going on up in her uh up in here my goodness why did i say that way goodness gracious okay well we got nine of swords on the bottom of the deck releasing your fears anxieties ace of swords reverse there could be some deep things that are sharp um might be needed to take a little bit more time to yourself to regain boundaries in your situation archangel michael clarify the nine of pentacles in reverse four particles

there's some kind of okay i got to decide something now what do i do with the commitment or with the masculine or whatever there's a chord here you're potentially focusing on coins this time archangel michael clarified of pentacles well interesting there's some kind of trinity situation going on here that's quite in alignment with that it makes me feel like that there's a challenge here in regards to trying to disconnect with something archangel michael can help you have strength at this time to cut any cords that you may need to cut are going to michael clarify the devil the emperor reverse there's some kind of manipulation or toxic energy happening here for yourself and this connection and i feel like you might be sensing that but you might not be speaking it yet you could be sensing it's being exposed it's causing you to really withdraw and have to really rethink things go back to the drawing board for whatever reason there's things in the forefront things in the background that are going on there's things you can see it's things underneath the surface and i feel like you're doing a lot of work underneath the surface but there's still so much that's like so open blatant to see i feel like there's maybe someone's trying to not try to see it trying to turn a blind eye to that or did michael clarify that there's competition it's it would be it makes you feel like someone would feel really out of place to do that so you have to see the positive in this situation you may want to reach out and give some kind of advice to someone i feel like it won't be accepted very well so it's best to keep words to yourself and let this person potentially figure themselves out for themselves also arguing to michael the outcome for gemini is the truth so you may have to cut the cord from someone who you can be feeling is very deceitful it is up for your discretion and up to debate if you so wish but i do feel like this is something that you may be planning to do okay archangel michael advice for general thank you there's something you're really excited about in regards to maybe something you're planning maybe you're really excited about these big changes coming or moving forward yep wow major message someone could be receiving a message from someone here and it might be a little bit upsetting to someone because they feel like maybe they're going to go in another direction and follow their dreams chase their dreams whatever that may be this makes me feel like although you could be cutting a court to someone who could be feeling very deceiving or deceitful this person is going to do whatever they want with or without you interesting so you have opinions they have um their way of doing their life and you guys are just going to have to agree to disagree i

Here is a plant in front of us that is known in Central America by the Spanish speaking Indian they call the Sauco, is a plant that in the berries we find that the mineral of iron is found, iron phosphate iron phosphate is found in these berries and these berries are responsible for us reversing a lot of diseases that sits in the blood they contain iron phosphate. This plant the Sauco when it sends its roots into the ground it converts that oxide mineral into a liquid digestible substance, known,  the process is known as iontopherosis or the conversion from a solid to a liquid and here Mother Nature has converted iron which is solid into a berry for you to enjoy. And over here we find now that the flower, unlike the berries that contain iron phosphate the flower now is a different chemistry here we have potassium phosphate when the children here in Central America has fever rest assured that the mother would come here and ask me to give them some of the flower of the Sauco to remove the fever because it means that inflammation is sitting some place in the body and this is extremely effective because of its high content of iron and potassium phosphate the SAUCO  ", "xwYU9gIqYk0": "Tender and tasty pie in 15 minutes you need:  1 apple,   120 ml of milk,   60 ml of oil,  10 g of  baking powder,   2  eggs peel the apple and cut the apple into slices put baking paper and a little sugar on the pan  put the apple slices in the pan sprinkle sugar on top 2 tsp pour 2 eggs into a bowl, beat with sugar. add milk  add oil  add flour with baking powder add vanilla add salt pour the whole mixture over the apples cover and put on a very small fire turn over after 10 minutes and leave for another 3 minutes your pie is ready! delicious, soft and teder! Bon appetite!", "7OZbAcBKoF8": "Whee!  Whee! Whee! Whee! Whee! Whee! Whee! [Purring sounds] Hello, I'm Nat and welcome back to COOKING plus\u00a0ALCOHOL. Where you put the drinks IN the food and not just WITH the food. So today I've been making\u00a0brandy apple pie. So we have some pre-baked shells here, we have some some toppings we'll put on. We have,\u00a0of course, peas - different color split peas - that are really useful for making pie. Believe it or not. I've got some apples that we've been marinating in brandy overnight and got a little bit of the\u00a0juice that evolved off that. So we're gonna go ahead and work on the pie in a moment but right\u00a0now let's take a look at where we started on this... I used six granny smith green apples. They're not\u00a0the best eating apple, but for pies they're very highly ranked. They're tart, they're not too\u00a0sweet and one thing is you can always get hold of them. So you can always make this pie with\u00a0granny smith apples just about. But don't get the teeny tiny ones because then you need more\u00a0and I couldn't tell you how many you need. We're gonna marinate that in the lemon juice and\u00a0the idea is the lemon juice stops the oxidation. And then we're gonna cook it. We're\u00a0gonna put that in the microwave for about 10 minutes, maybe 10 and\u00a0a half minutes, in my microwave. And the idea is that you want to cook\u00a0\nthe apples before you put them in the pie. And then you can soak them in brandy and then\u00a0that soak brandy won't come out when you cook it. So we're gonna add the one and a half cup brandy to the cooked apples now. Very important: you want the apples to be cooked JUST like you want them\u00a0in the pie so they should cut easily with a spoon. Now for the pie dough: we're gonna start\u00a0with two pre-made pie crusts. We're gonna cut cookies, essentially cookies, the first one\u00a0and these are gonna be on the top of the pie. And we're putting peas on the top to keep\u00a0them compressed so they don't swell up and get all fragile and fall apart later. Now the top of the pie: we're just going to put it right on top of our 9-inch pie pan. We're\u00a0going to press it in so it doesn't have much to expand into later when it cooks, and no, you don't\u00a0want to do the fluting the first time like I did because I should have waited and used the\u00a0extra from when I made the little pie dough cookies before.  So you're going to put those\u00a0on top to reinforce that edge. And don't try to punch holes in the parchment paper like I did. Because you to see those little notches in the bottom? Yeah, that was what was left.  So the pie shell survived. Again, you're going to cover it with parchment\u00a0paper and you're going to put your peas in it\u00a0to keep it weighed down. The parchment\u00a0paper covers the entire of the pie so all the edges of the crust\u00a0are now protected from that heat. And give it a little bake - you're gonna follow the\u00a0instructions on the pie shell itself. Or if you're making your own pie shell - however you normally\u00a0do that. And I like to take it out when it's the maximum time, so if it's 10 to 12 minutes they\u00a0\nrecommend, take it out at 12 minutes. Take the peas off, and put it back in the oven for another\u00a0three minutes. That's gonna finish it cooking. And there we go - they look good, just about right,\u00a0and you can see the pie shell a little golden on the edges. It's not burned. The bottom is well\u00a0\ndone. Now the apples we were marinating in brandy overnight, remember? So we're gonna dump those in\u00a0a colander to strain out the brandy. Now all those good drippings, all that good brandy drippings,\u00a0we're now going to cook down and the idea is that we need a really thick sauce to glue those\u00a0apples together.  Those apples now have lots of\u00a0\u00a0brandy in them so we want to use all the sugar,\u00a0and the marmalade, and we also are going to make a butter and flour roux. We're going to mix that\u00a0all together, make it really thick and then that is what is going to be mixed in with the apples,\u00a0 that's going to glue the apples together after a few hours.  If you haven't made a roux before, they're\u00a0wonderful!  You have to keep stirring the roux when that's going. If it's cooking at all, It needs\u00a0to be watched constantly. So for butter and flour, you just need to cook the butter with the flour\u00a0for maybe two minutes. You'll need to stir constantly. You don't want it to brown. If it starts to darken very slightly you know that it's done.\u00a0\u00a0 And then when you're combining it, you want to\u00a0combine it with a hot liquid. And that's going to thicken it.  If you cool the roux down, it is\u00a0going to get all lumpy and nasty so keep stirring. Now we're going to keep going and keep going and\u00a0keep stirring and that's about 10 minutes. It'll take a little while. You're trying to boil\u00a0off all the liquid, trying to boil off the\u00a0alcohol, trying to boil off the water. And it's\u00a0\ngoing to be really thick and goopy like that. Now we're going to mix that thick, rich\u00a0\nsweet mixture in with all the apples, stir it up real well, make sure it's well\u00a0\nmixed and dump that into our pie shell.\u00a0\u00a0 Make sure it's flat on top. First time I made this full pie, I used eight apples and it overflowed. So six apples for that pie crust works perfectly. If you have little smaller apples maybe use a few more. I just happened to find cookie cutters\u00a0\nthat just perfectly fit around the edges here. You can use different ones, you don't\u00a0\nhave to take up all the space. It's just for decoration, it gives a little\u00a0\nmore crunch to it and it tastes better. Here we have it. We're going to give it a couple\u00a0hours and taste it. And one thing: you look and it's slumping at the top and the bottom - it's about to\u00a0fall off!  I lost the cookie there the first time I tried to pose it like that! So don't hold it\u00a0vertically like that right after you make it. Hmm...definitely some brandy and it's holding\u00a0together. That's good - I was afraid it would be like a stew and come all over the place! And for\u00a0some reason, the crust really goes well with the alcohol taste. And its\u00a0sweetness - it's not too sweet. M?   Do you wanna try some?  M? M SPEAKING: Can you bring two forks? NAT SPEAKING: Okay So thanks for joining me. I hope you had a good\u00a0time, I hope your pie turns out as well as mine. Remember it's kind of strong -  sort of like\u00a0taking a shot of brandy with a slice of apple pie. And I'll see you maybe in a couple of weeks with\u00a0a recipe for absinthe salad. This apple pie rocks. Works really well, but I haven't made that many\u00a0pies myself. Maybe I've made four in my entire life. So this pie is good, but don't ask me about\u00a0like...cheese croquette pie or anything like that - I've never done it.

cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk oh it's gonna be good super easy y'all here we go eight ounces of delicious cream cheese a can of sweetened condensed milk this is 14 ounces yes this milk does have sugar in it it is like syrup so many of y'all asked that question many of you love sweetened condensed milk and cream cheese together of course all right the difference in this pineal lemon icebox pie is that mama used raw eggs raw egg yellows in her lemonade spock's and she did not use cream cheese and so that's the main difference in the pies if you want to know that but with both pies we're going to use the lemon juice and i'm also going to add in a couple of teaspoons of lemon jello but we're going to mix this first so it's [Music] creamy [Music] [Music] so now i'm going to put in about a half cup of lemon juice and a couple of teaspoons of lemon jello i want to make sure it's good and lemony be good [Music] and now we're going to put in a little cool whip [Music] i'm going to use part of this on the top of the pie and i'm going to use half of it inside the pie and i think i will just fluff it some [Music] and i put my pie crust in the freezer to cool down because you definitely don't want to put this filling on a crust that is hot so we're going to put this on our crust and i really did get my crust a little bit too um dark but that's all right that's and i got a little extra so i'm not putting it all in there because it's pretty full already now i'm going to take my cool whip and put it in a bag and just decorate up the top a little bit i'm gonna put a little bit of lemon zest on the top of it when i'm done and we're gonna let it set up and cut it in a couple of hours a little bit tonight's dessert so this is an eight ounce container of kuwait oh yeah i meant to tell y'all that this is a homemade vanilla crust it's a vanilla wafer crust so we'll put the recipe on the end of the description post for it for you pretty now i'm going to take the lemon zest that i zested off the lemon and i'm just going to lightly sprinkle the top of the pie with it some of it stick together let me see if i can get it apart and i couldn't save my lumen because and zest it on top because i didn't have extra lemon in other words i didn't i couldn't zest the lemon on the top of this nail because i used all my lemons so i had to zest them before i made my pie filling okay all right we're going to do another wafer crust which is one of my favorites so you're going to need about four cups of vanilla wafers and it's really easy to measure them when you've got a when you got the little mini ones and if you're using the larger ones i don't know what to tell you look google it or look it up but it's equivalent to about four cups of the mini ones okay you lay them out in the bottom of your pie shell and really about need to double them and use that many if you want to as many ones because they're easier to crush up i buy them a lot in the summer for treats for my puppies believe it or not and i also uh have them around for a snack as well so and they're really good in puddings and pudding cups and stuff like that okay so i'm going to take my mallet my meat ballot and the flat side and i'm going to smash these now you can use a rolling pin it just takes a little more effort and you want to be pretty small so smash them good now i'm gonna put them in a bowl and we're going to put in a quarter cup of sugar so just smash it mash them smoosh them into the butter and then we're going to place them in the pie dish we're going to bake it at 350 degrees for 10 minutes and you can go 12 minutes if you want to because you are going to want to be able to cut this and it does need to cook a little bit it's a setup and this is gonna be a thick crust which is the way i like it so just pour it into your pie plate spread it around get it nice and thick on the sides and [Music] bottom a little bit more right here and put it right here that'll be good good that's pretty thick so i'm going to bake it about 12 to 14 minutes all right we're going to get in the oven for about 14 to 15 minutes okay all right we're going to squeeze some lemons this uh lemon squeezer has a section that you can use it for limes or you can flip that over and use it for lemons so it's got two different sizes which is nice because sometimes you do get fruit that's really big and we're gonna squeeze about um at least a half cup of lemon juice and when you squeeze a lemon and a lemon squeezer the manufacturer recommends that you flip it upside down just like i'm doing these are really good all out there so if you've got some lemons in the refrigerator and you need to use them grab them things get them out and make you a delicious refreshing lemon pie today delicious lemon cream yummy holy smoke oh was is it good and the crust is amazing just know that it's kind of messy to get it out of a pan but oh my gosh it's a delicious whoa this one's good y'all thanks for

are really soft i don't know if you can see this but these are the dates they're really small soft that's what we want and we're just going to keep stirring because fruit is naturally sweet we don't need any additives okay we want to aim for a sugar-free diet and what we the goal is for my goal is to you know supplement my sugar cravings for naturally sweet fruit okay me continue to go ahead and you know all my blueberries to be nice and dark and fully cooked guys so we're gonna let this simmer until it begins to boil a little bit and then we'll add a little bit of flour this is what we want to see you want it to boil you see that the ball it's alive it's the light got it okay so we're just gonna go ahead and pour that in smells great guys evenly distributed so i can get nectarine and blueberry in every bite go ahead and fill it out okay okay see right here you start right here you see that line that ended can you see it see the line end it that's where you start to remember you have to find it so that's where you start to unravel okay go ahead and put this over the top and this over the top okay i'll take an egg wash and brush the top and then put little splits in the middle go ahead and do a design just take both sides let's go ahead and make a little design on the sides just go around the crust it doesn't have to be super fancy guys it's your own style we're just basically pinching it together okay got my melted butter here use unsalted butter guys for all my baking stuff go ahead and brush it on okay we'll pop this in the airfryer for 45 minutes i went ahead and pressed the cake i did 400 degrees", "ZRXSssOelPw": "[Music] [Music] hey guys welcome to our channel or welcome back i hope you are doing good my name is jessica and today i am sharing a simple breakfast lunch and dinner meal idea with you plus a snack and a dessert so if any of this looks good to you keep on watching [Music] [Music] for breakfast i made a simple and delicious smoothie bowl here is what i use for one bowl one cup of vanilla greek yogurt a half cup of frozen triple berry blend i also sometimes just use the mixed berries 1 4 cup of granola 1 teaspoon of chia seeds 1 4 cup of blueberries 4 strawberries sliced and i am using my little personal blender back there in my blender i am adding the yogurt and frozen fruit together and i am going to blend them until smooth next i am pouring the mixture into a bowl and i am going to top it with sliced strawberries blueberries granola and chia seeds for lunch i made another simple bowl and that is a cottage cheese bowl with tomatoes and avocados here is what i use a half cup of cottage cheese five cherry tomatoes half of an avocado one teaspoon of chia seeds salt and pepper first i slice my tomatoes in half and then i dice my avocado then i just add everything into a bowl here i have the cottage cheese then i am topping it with the tomatoes and avocado now i am adding on salt and pepper and then chia seeds for a snack i made this really quick and easy peanut butter fruit dip this is one of my favorite fruit dips to make and it is seriously so good here is what i use one cup of vanilla greek yogurt 1 3 cup of creamy peanut butter 1 tablespoon of honey and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract in a medium sized bowl i am adding all of the ingredients together and i am going to whisk them until smooth and here it is i paired our dip with apple slices for dinner i made slow cooker pizza casserole here is what i use eight ounces of paneer half of a large yellow onion diced two cloves of garlic minced three 14 ounce jars of pizza sauce two teaspoons of italian seasoning nonstick cooking spray 16 ounces of shredded cheese i usually just use mozzarella but today i am using this blend of mozzarella and provolone six ounces of pepperoni and i did not show it here but i also use one pound of ground beef the first thing that i do is cut my pepperonis in half you do not have to do this you can leave them whole if you'd like then i dice the onion and mince the [Music] garlic [Music] here i'm going to start cooking my pasta i've added in a little salt into my water i am not going to let these noodles cook completely just for about six to seven minutes then i'm going to drain them and set them aside next i am going to cook and drain the ground beef [Music] i know i have showed this before but this is how i drain my ground beef i just put aluminum foil in my sink drain drain the grease into that and then once that hardens i just pick it up and toss it in the trash in my large bowl i am mixing together the pasta pizza sauce cooked ground beef pepperoni onion garlic and italian seasoning [Music] now i am going to layer it in my slow cooker i have sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray and i'm adding in the pasta and then a layer of cheese i am going to repeat this until i have three layers [Music] i am going to cover this and cook it on low for three and a half to four hours and here is what my plate looked like and i paired ours with texas toast cheese bread for dessert i threw something really quick together and in our house we like to call this oreo fluff you will need eight oreos crushed plus more for the topping and one eight ounce container of whipped topping or cool whip so i put my 8 oreos into a ziploc bag and then i crush them [Music] then i just mix the crushed oreos into the whipped topping [Music] [Music] [Music] once i have it in the bowls that i'm serving it in i top each one with an oreo all right guys that is it for this week's all day cook with me i really hope that you enjoyed it and you got some ideas out of it thank you guys so much for watching and we hope to see you next time bye [Music] you", "BFk1XluFeBA": "hi everyone welcome to gloria splatter today we're gonna make a dessert it's called pistachio lush and let's look at the ingredients so we need graham cracker crumbs and i used 16 full sheets of graham crackers then we have butter um it's melted and i used one for our stick melted then we have sugar which i have powdered that's the white sugar and then we also have brown sugar you may use granulated sugar i also have cool whip whipped topping which you uh could substitute with whipped cream then i'm using pistachio pudding packets and also cream cheese at room temperature i have measured three cups of milk in here and finally we have slivered almonds i'm gonna mix the graham cracker crumbs the butter and the brown sugar together this mixture you can press firmly into the bottom of a 9 by 13 inch pan and bake or no bake it's up to you if you're baking uh it's at 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes but i have a different idea i am going to fill these cups and refrigerate for an hour i don't know how many cups this will fill let's see i was able to fill 12 cups like this i got them from the dollar tree 12 for a dollar even the cashier asked me when i was buying some stuff if we were having a party i said yeah a youtube party now i'm gonna cover these up and refrigerate for an hour see you soon so in a separate bowl let's mix the cool whip cream cheese and the powdered sugar together let's combine the pudding mix with the milk and whisk it [Music] oh look at the color so let's leave this for about 10 minutes to thicken okay let's fill these up want to have the green on top so let's go with the white then the nuts [Music] the green [Music] this we need to cover and cool for about two hours before we eat now in case you're wondering why i'm using almonds in the pistachio lush you could use any nut you want and then we already have pistachios in the pudding so when i went to buy some pistachios i accidentally bought the salted version so when i came home i was like okay now how do you unsalt a salted pistachio so i decided to stick with the almonds okay guys so my pistachio lash is ready and i want to show you why it's called a lush blush is a dessert that has layers you can see the layers maybe we will decorate this thank you for watching the video please subscribe if you haven't comment like and share have a good day bye for now [Music] you", "1BviwB6i-RM": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel I'm dr. Phil via a general practitioner and writer and this is Africa where health where we provide you with direction and clarity about everything medical the measures to manage cycle cell anemia the inherited condition that affects hemoglobin in the blood which can cause significant illness have evolved over several years in this video we're looking at the current that is the most recent updates for potential cures we have available in 2020 now for several years a cure for sickle cell anemia has been largely elusive in places like Nigeria and West Africa the country that has the highest burden for sickle cell anemia people hardly talk about a cure for the disease and people who suffer with sickle cell anemia resigned themselves with prevention as much as they can sickle cell crisis and taking treatments that can promote their health as much as possible however for some years now there has been a cure but it has been mostly available in high-income countries where there are adequate facilities and effective health came from structure to manage the process of delivering the cure and maintaining people's health afterwards what kyoto called stem cell transplant has developed challenges in terms of its use and administration and so a lot more recently within the last six months a new alternative has developed known as gene therapy we're going to talk about both of them but start with stem cell therapy stem cell therapy in sickle cell anemia requires that the individual with sickle cell anemia who is going to undergo treatment has a healthy brother or sister from whom stem cells can be taken or harvested in order for the procedure to be carried out now stem cells are particular types of human cells that can develop into many other types of human cells for example muscle cells or brain cells or bone cells how do we get them cells there are two main sources first human embryos some human stem cells are produced from the embryos that is immature fetuses during in-vitro fertilization and donated to science other stem cells can be formed from fully developed adult cells the critical thing about stem cell is their ability to develop into other types of cells inside the body so essentially in stem cell therapy for sickle cell anemia it is thought that the healthy cells taken from the donors bone marrow will be transplanted into the recipient and developed into non sickle cells red cells within the recipient the person who's suffering from sickle cell anemia the like I mentioned earlier there are some challenges with stem cell therapy one of the problems is that many people with sickle cell anemia do not have a healthy relative or healthy sibling brother sister who can act as a donor for normal or healthy stem cells to be harvested from the other problem that could happen is that they may develop serious complications following the transplant assuming they're able to get his sibling donor there may be serious complications after the chance but all the transplants may fail and the finished stem cells stem cell science is still evolving is still developing they still in lots for scientists to learn about techniques which with which the stem cells can be controlled and used appropriately the way you want to for the benefits of of science of medicine and there's also also the issue that some people find it troubling use stem cells obtained from embryos that are not used after cycles of IVF but an alternative solution has come up and this is gene therapy in gene therapy for sickle cell anemia it is the patient the person who suffers from sickle cell anemia it's their own stem cell that I used so removing the need for a compatible donor now to understand how this works we need to digress a little bit and talk about the role of fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell disease now fetal hemoglobin or hemoglobin efforts we also call it is unique for quite a few reasons number one it appears to be very well-suited for supporting or maintaining the baby within the wounds low oxygen environment compared to normal or healthy adult hemoglobin researchers have also found that the presence of fetal hemoglobin prevents the formation of the cold red blood cells now after birth and as they developed infants or young babies gradually stop producing this fetal hemoglobin and instead start to develop what is MV an adult hemoglobin the hemoglobin that they will eventually continue with us and all the children and as adults for the rest of their lives now this process where they stop producing hemoglobin fetal hemoglobin starts or tends to happen from about four to six months age so what you find is that from about forty six months of age in children with normal immigrating genotype the hemoglobin F will be replaced by hemoglobin a but in a child with the SS genotype the hemoglobin F is going to be replaced by hemoglobin s that causes the cleaner of the red blood cells now the crux of gene therapy and this is research that's still ongoing with clinical trials that are presently going on at the Boston Children's Hospital in the United States this research has shown that the production of fetal hemoglobin can be reactivated which in the case of an individual with sickle-cell disease will be first the condition now the scientists working on this belief that this process can be reversed by the activity or or suppressing or preventing the activity of the of a protein called be the L 11a and so what they do is they use an inactive virus to deliver instructions genetic instructions to the RNA of the red blood cell of the person the individual with sickle-cell disease and these instructions are meant to drastically reduce the production of this protein bcl11a in the individuals red blood cells and this is what allows the reversal from the adult hemoglobin in that individual to the feats of hemoglobin okay so it's a lot more complicated than what I've just said and clinical trials are going on the process is underway there are if they're described as promising they're individuals who have received these treatments and they're promising resource and if you want to read more about sage and find out more details I will put a link to the Pape and E and research studies in the description box below so please are the measures available for people who ask what is they care is their care for sickle cell anemia these are the measures available to consider in terms of cost accessibility availability they are technical highly specialized procedures that have still been looked into in high-income countries and the United States so the feasibility of having them performed in lower middle-income countries of course can be quite challenging but they are fair as an option and possibly in the next decade or less maybe more available to other parts of the world so let's watch this faith now if you are interested in a 7-point checklist for what people with the a s genetic short considered when the ancient relationship is all generally should be aware of about their health care status make sure you check the link in the description below because I got a free II leaflets on that particular topic now next time in this series are going to be looking at the treatment available for sickle cell anemia understanding the treatment of sickle cell anemia so what drugs to people the sickle cell anemia need and when they are having a crisis or just to maintain their health generally and why do they need this medication so make sure you check out that video could put the link
