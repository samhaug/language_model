some of the finest of the 20th century but life wasn't always easy for the maestro of love this is barry white's tragic real life story barry white was born in texas on september 12th 1944. he spent a large part of his childhood in los angeles however and saw some tough times as a kid according to his 1999 autobiography the musician grew up in a small home with his mother and siblings in their youth white and his brother became involved in local gangs and often found themselves in trouble in an interview with rolling stone white said i'm an ex-gang banger i come from southeast la i didn't only hear about the 1965 riot i was in it i understand the disappointment the anger that people have i had the same my brother had the same until he died in 1983 he was my best friend and my life till he died he was night and i was day white added that his brother was so caught up in the world of crime that it was comparable to the way barry himself grew to love music later in life the singer chose to be open with fans about his past he explained so i tell young people the truth and a lot of them listen they know i've been to jail i've never hid my past and i never will i don't want no young person to think he's stuck in that misery even as a child barry white was fascinated by music he was a member of his church choir and closely followed his local music scene hoping to explore more about the world of music white would constantly listen to the radio and figure out ways to make his favorite songs a part of his life in his autobiography the singer writes ever since i was a little boy whenever i heard a song on the radio i liked i made it my song if i was alone i immediately formed an attachment to it a touchstone to the time and place i first heard it if i was with a lady it became a clear reminder to me of whom i was with how i felt about her and how she felt about me unsurprisingly music also played a major part in white's romantic experiences and when he finally started making his own music he consciously tried to write his songs to be an inspiration to lovers all around the world arguably the most instantly iconic aspect of barry white's career is his uniquely recognizable bass baritone voice white actually remembered the day he found that voice during his youth white's voice had been fairly squeaky but out of nowhere it suddenly deepened a change that both scared and intrigued him the change took him totally by surprise seeming to happen almost overnight in 1990 he explained to ebony magazine that the change was the cause of some excitement in the white household he said it scared me and my mother when i spoke that morning it was totally unexpected my chest rattled i mean vibrations my mother was staring at me and i was staring at her the next thing i knew her straight face broke into a beautiful smile tears came down her face and she said my son's a man now after his rough childhood barry white's journey to redemption was not an easy one still he knew he needed to change his ways and give up his gang life as he explains in his autobiography white decided to transform himself after spending time in jail he writes after two months on the inside it finally started kicking in i have to change my ways because if i don't i'm going to end up in jail the rest of my life fighting partying low riding but you learn as you get older you must become a man one day and put away childish things white knew he'd have a hard time changing his bad habits but he didn't see any other way out a few days after he left jail however he received an offer from friends to join a band and sing bass until then white had never thought of music as a solid career option but he agreed white later credited that opportunity as the moment that changed the course of his life of course simply deciding to pursue music wasn't enough and he spent almost a decade trying to get noticed and make a mark in the industry along the way white worked on a number of collaborations and slowly but surely found his way to the top it wasn't until the 1970s that white finally started seeing the fruits of his labor in 1969 he founded the girl group love unlimited and began his career as a producer which marked a significant moment in his career through a friend he also met a businessman named larry nunes who helped him with the finances for his album the album was titled from a girl's point of view we give to you love unlimited in his memoir white explains that he knew that meeting nunes would be a godsend for him he writes i couldn't believe it here i was without a dime to my name with a group i couldn't afford to record with nothing but my knowledge of music and over there was larry nunes a millionaire offering me not just a way to make a decent living but the opportunity to make my musical life the 1970s were kind to white who released one of his most popular tracks in 1972 walking in the rain with the one i love it was his first major hit and catapulted him into stardom around this time white also started the love unlimited orchestra with whom he found even greater success in 1970 white released a solo album i've got so much to give which became popular for his hit track i'm gonna love you just a little more baby white longed for more however and he eventually founded his own label unlimited gold with cbs columbia records in 1979. over the course of the 1970s white would release an impressive 10 records unfortunately the 1980s had loss and failure in store for the singer in the late 80s he attempted and failed to replicate his earlier triumphs with albums such as the right knight and barry white and the man is back things proved tough until the 1990s when he managed a career resurgence with his 1994 album the icon is love he also went on to rack up two grammy awards in 1999 for his song staying power sadly barry white wasn't always understood by the wider public and often found himself the target of mockery in the press the media looked down on white because of his steamy lyrics and often portrayed him as a musician who only made trashy music luckily white himself was more than willing to shrug off this image though he also embraced it on occasion mr white can we borrow you for a minute anything for a lady in an interview with rolling stone white was asked about his thoughts on being a generation defining sex symbol the singer explained in his own unique way it never gets in my way i'm none of that i'm barry white calling me different nicknames doesn't bother me one bit i'm barry white have a sip of champagne women are not into fish eggs they have a different nature men love it while white racked up several honors and successes in the course of his career there was one dream he never got the chance to see come true in his autobiography he writes about having missed the opportunity to work with one of his favorite musicians ever marvin gaye sadder still they were actually discussing a project together when the singer unexpectedly passed away white rites his passing hit me so hard and deep it broke my heart he was looking to make an even bolder leap to stretch to work himself to a new level now he is gone forever it is everybody's loss the loss was particularly personal for white however who had spoken to gay just days before he died when gay had asked the musician to produce his next album white had told gay that he didn't need a producer to make a great album adding that he'd nonetheless happily brainstorm with him white explains i can never produce marvin gaye marvin is the only one that can produce marvin sadly the duo never got to put out their project together despite being known for his smooth love songs white's own love life was fraught with difficulty none of his romances had happy endings and both of his marriages ended in divorce white's first wife was a childhood friend who was identified only as mary in his autobiography the pair had four kids together before they decided to go their separate ways in 1969. his next wife was glodeen james a member of love unlimited they married in 1974 and worked together over the next decade or so even putting out the 1981 album barry and glodin you make very special music why all of a sudden did you decide to release an album with clodine dick that's been in the works since 1974. ultimately however they divorced in 1988. fortunately on the surface white didn't seem too distraught about all this in 1995 he was asked about his love life for an interview with rolling stone white simply said i'm relaxing i'm enjoying my life and i let things do what they do i've already got one lady music barry white's health was never stellar and he suffered from his fair share of problems over the course of his life in the docu-series autopsy barry white the singer's half-sister sandra elaborated on some of his health concerns he experienced during the later years of his life she explained the last concert that i saw of barry's he could barely stand up he managed to get through it and then i understand he almost collapsed after he walked off stage she added that despite the scare white was not keen on the idea of seeking help white had dealt with weight issues for most of his life and he suffered a stroke in 2003 that affected his speech he'd also been dealing with a failing kidney and had acute blood pressure issues facts which had forced him to back out of many live shows unfortunately barry white's health issues became worse over time and he was unable to recover during his final days he was even unable to stand white passed away in july 2003 at the age of 58. as his health waned during his final days white faced ridicule from the audiences at his concerts during these performances he was struggling to stay animated as he fought ever worsening exhaustion ned shankman white's manager revealed an autopsy barry white that people didn't take kindly to the singer's physical struggles shankman said he had to perform sitting down it infuriated the crowds they wanted barry playing the piano and moving around this thought was echoed by white's biographer mark elliott who said the show was in the round and he wouldn't turn so half the audience saw only his back and they booed him white's son felt that his father was doing the best he could considering the circumstances explaining he wasn't able to stand up he was trying he was struggling but he was trying and god bless him for that ultimately barry white left behind a rich but painful legacy for his fans there was a lot more that he'd wanted to do with his career and he left behind much unfinished work and unrealized plans white's death left fans heartbroken and friends and fans alike paid tribute to him in the following days one of white's friends mohammed mubarak remembered his old friend saying he truly was the maestro of love and in his own words during one interview white himself said i sleep music i eat music i'm never without it i'm never without music that's my first lady check out one of our newest videos right here plus even more grunge videos about your favorite stuff

i mean by cheap strains is uh not that it's not good um it's actually really good and it sells out really fast it's really hard to actually get this strain by caliber because it sells out so quick usually what what i found was two days after they get a stock it was gone people know people know about it it's really good and it's an inspiration screen after barry white so more of a reason but uh it's like 17 bucks for a half quarter it was really cheap was like 14.99 plus tax um overall the smoke for the price was definitely a five i i can't i cannot say that this wasn't the best value i've

founding forefathers used to say what the thing I'd rather have a bottle in front of me then I have to have a frontal lobotomy no I got to two bald guys eat stuff and talk about it so just in time for a lot of patriotic holidays coming up we have two new drinks from Smirnoff I have to sprint off ice red white and berry and I have the smirnoff vodka red wagon berry all right so we got two drinks one a malt beverage and one of course the vodka you can mix a whole bunch of different stuff today we're gonna try limonade with it and see how it tastes awesome so Smirnoff traditionally known for a great tasting vodka as well as their malt beverages which are crystal clear and crisp yeah so what we hear from these as far as people who have tried this before says a really refreshing taste while adding a little bit of flavor with the berry it sounds like perfect for summer so first we're gonna try the malt beverage just comes in a six pack nice cool blue color you can smell them mm-hmm the berries holy cow that's good with most malt beverages the fear is that it's gonna be too sugary this one is not that sweet no it bounces off your tongue when you first drink it you get their crisp citrus and the tanning mist from the bubbles but then after you swallow you get a little bit of the is a Bradbury blueberry blue raspberry cherry and citrus so blue raspberry blue raspberry this is dangerous some of other malt beverages that we tried like Arnold Palmer where you don't really get the alcohol content this one that has no aftertaste whatsoever this is like a really good kool-aid mix mm-hmm so don't put this around kids make sure we have an else round whenever you got this blue drink around because it is that delicious where you can hardly taste the alcohol whatever and comes in a six pack I don't know if I cherry yeah it is 4.5% ABV so just like a normal beer is right around that range out of five on that one four and a half yeah especially for a summer drink it's gonna be hard to beat that as far as refreshing and the taste yeah it's one of those where I would like to maybe have a beer and then one of the and something else and the next step we're going to try the patriotic punch so again a lot of summer holidays revolving around the USDA and the report red white and berry and red white and blue colors on the bottle so you got one part of the smirnoff vodka and two parts eliminating the fair make you could even garnish this with some strawberries and blueberries yeah and citrus it up a little bit yeah once again very dangerous and I think this is even better than the malt beverages so the lemonade paired together with the vodka man that's really refreshing it is it's good silence I don't know what to say about this it's so good so patriotic punch it tastes just like eliminated I mean I hate to say that you do get a hint of the berry flavor yeah man it goes great with that lemonade yeah so it takes away the tartness of the lemonade and again it's not too sweet no so unless your lemonade has extra sugar in it the vodka doesn't do anything extra to sweeten it I definitely win that sugar I had a bunch of ice to it and right to the blender or make a kind of a margarita when you meet a slushy rushed right so out of five on the vodka especially with the patriotic punch that we just had if I gave that a four and a half this has to be a five gonna be a five yeah it's one of the most perfect summertime drinks that I can think of as vodka lemonade add the red white and berry into it it's even better at a garnish to make it pretty yeah two bald guys eat stuff and talk about it", "InqR116LT2s": "time but this next plant is brand new today but i know we've had things similar to it and this is a color changing hydrangea it is gorgeous we call it barry white our are you know barry white is well anyway this starts out ivory or really white and then goes to pink goes to this beautiful deep rich kind of like a raspberry red by the end of the summer you get one of these for 26 32 and this is gorgeous absolutely gorgeous court we're going to be talking with you about this one you've got to tell us about barry white i love barry white and i know my niece loves barry white in the bedroom and that's what you can do you can cut those flowers you can dry them you can put them in any room of your house living room bedroom bathrooms they're just gorgeous this is probably the most perfect hydrangea that you would ever want they're the large flowers on a tree that doesn't grow too too big they're just perfect they'll take temperatures down to minus 30 degrees and they're color changing mary beth and it does not matter what your soil ph is because this will change colors automatically it will go from pure white in early spring to a flush of berry at the bottom to a full um red in the summertime in the late in the season wow there you go look at that beautiful plant tell me about the size is this about the size the first year second year that's the second season most of the plants that we're showing you is the second season yeah but i want to tell you that you're getting a one gallon potted plant wow growing right out of the box so this is the largest size pot that we sell on qvc and if you ask me court am i going to get flowers the first season i'll say yes absolutely you are with these one growing uh one gallon growing plants now court i got another quick question for you so a lot of hydrangeas have you know the big balls on them and they tend to always flop over these i would assume these are standing more upright is that right yes very bad they are upright and they're on strong stem so you're not going to get that floppiness and these are not the type like the beautiful limelight that can sometimes grow up to your roof line and they're not the smaller borderline this is the perfect middle ground sized plant and that's the second season pick up several of these they're grown and bred by a company called bailey's in minnesota oh minnesota that must mean they're hardy are they hearty yeah yes they're winter hardy or hydrating and they grow so beautifully so easily they come with their growing guide and our gotta grow guarantee and again they're my first my last my everything in the garden like very white sod and you're gonna love these cut and dry them uh to bring in the home i have one here that we can go back and show you but look at the beautiful colors notice what you're getting there it starts out pure white and then at the base of your flower panicle it starts turning very pink and then by the end of the season it's a solid beautiful red pink flower wow do these tell me about sun shade what do they want or need yes so for uh the uh growing 101 on hydrangeas is they do like the sun and uh they can take a little bit of shade but they love their sun-loving plants and once they're established in the garden uh mother nature will take care of them get them uh well watered when you're starting in the beginning of the season but you know all of our plants come with our gotta grow guarantees very bad so you can grow wrong yeah yeah and feed your plants if you like pick up the roberta's bounty food here's the these change colors all on their own anywhere in the country yeah there's about 60 gallons highly recommended 60 gallons this one bag will make for about 22 dollars and you all get the guide but here's the thing i'm going to just tell you right now these are flying out of here and people are ordering more than one i have seen these i mean this is brand new opportunity but i've seen similar ones like this fly out of here and then that's it that's well maybe all we can get right now i want to let you know 900 have already been ordered it works in any part of the country because these are hardy for winter so plant them in the ground enjoy them i'll tell you honestly if you can get two or three of these and put them all side by side you are going to have that right there in your yard wouldn't that be amazing between your neighbors put that along a fence line we have them at the corners of our townhouse here it just softens the corner and this is what you're gonna get in mid-season what you're looking at is the white flowers that are starting their blush of berry again they're called berry white and everybody loves the nose berry white because they start out white and then they turn into the berry color and then by the end of the season you can go ahead and you can plant the uh cut these and use them as a cut flower here you go let me tilt that for you i've had these for two years in my home oh my goodness yeah seriously because you just dried them and they've stayed there yes you just dried them i spray them with a little bit of hairspray that was two years ago and they'll stay there so i so this is what i mean you can put barry white in the bedroom yeah you know just put this bouquet right next to you that's right um court i gotta quickly just say this you know i i hear from people who say hey you know i don't have a yard i live in a condo i live in an apartment i've got a little deck if you buy one of these you're getting one and you put it in a pot as long as your deck is getting sunshine you could enjoy this on your own deck if that's all you've got because you may not have yard so don't worry about it it's like if you have a lot of yard buy a few of these but if you've just got a deck buy one put it in a pot and enjoy because that's the beauty of flowers and summer time and it goes back to roberta's bringing you hard to get flowers but easy to grow thank you and so many of our customers do just that they love these in containers on their deck and if you do have a yard if you have a a huge farmstead you know pick up a row of these plant them along your driveway wow how beautiful that would be if you have a smaller area like we do in our town home here we plant them along the corners of our home and they're very easy easy to grow you can count on them coming back every season year after year season after season and these are big huge pots the largest size potted plant that we offer on qvc a full one gallon already growing ready to bloom the very first year look at the colors yeah look at the colors here i want to go back to the fertilizer because most hydrangeas have to have certain fertilizer you're saying these don't that's right so you're going to use roberta's all-purpose plant food it's not a special plant food that with a special ph that you have to you know go get soil tested and all this no you're going to get these beautiful color changing uh hydrangeas anywhere and now you're looking at late season where you see that all berry color that 100 wow so i do recommend feeding your plants but no special plant food our bird is bounty the perfect plant food for these so pick up several sets you'll have no regrets okay so two thousand two hundred of these already ordered just reminding you when you see something buy it if you really want it because i don't know how long they'll be around the other thing i just have to say about these hydrangeas is they have such beautiful foliage it's this rich green beautiful foliage but wait till you get the flowers i'm telling you from summer through fall you're going to get these blooms and you're going to watch them

to the actual parking lot oh they're gonna yeah that's what those parking lots are gonna be for the wood storage of those Amazon cards oh so they never have to leave the [ __ ] parking lot so just whoa I'll just do it all and be out there and cause pretty convenient yeah GPS got all the more so those eight cars right there right you buy the show but it's what we do the drills - okay that's not really food yeah the idea is that they always start doing it in a couple of states yeah doing the park Jones all right look up the drugs when you get a real good you gotta take it to the when you have up so high the [ __ ] can see it like crabs look so hot even that though they are quiet when you're quite a real super expensive yeah the regular ones did you buy it but you are not [ __ ] spying on

see it knew yours it was done because you know you got to uh the cat camera has a little TV and the controller thing do you see mr. druthers here that's cool though that's sweet [ __ ] ah but I think

this yeah they like camp like 50 percent they have a ton of [ __ ] nicotine yeah oh yeah like a puzzle on jewel yeah that's why they're so addictive my people they work what's up dude that's definitely not fact everybody wanna go first on this one I'll go first always I gave it a [ __ ] three I couldn't hit it a second time it doesn't taste like [ __ ] hot crappy I miss hot mess cut I gave you the three as well no it's not about like cuz five is it sweet yeah yeah like you do oh yeah half of it so as a very taste you get anything any subtleties out of it yeah so like it's a berry so it's obviously some kind of blueberry cross with something some so much shadow your fruity she told me it was so it's gotta be zade's is it hey it tastes like yeah yeah hey to me it tastes like yeah yeah like there's nothing at the earthy taste of us I don't get the earth at all I do it's like 30 yeah I haven't - no that's a bad dirt I don't like it anyways yeah it's just not flavorful enough yes I don't know yeah no I mean let's say something odd you know if I if I could grab this for like a 150 or so comedy you kick me roll-ups and ya know all right that's it", "zOMjlJJvLlA": "alrighty what up guys and welcome back to cush class tv this 18 and over channel design for people of marijuana music and sports and today's episode we're actually going to be doing a strain review on some berry white so i actually didn't go out to the recreational pot shop had someone else go out for me because the pot shop that happens to carry this drain is a little further out than uh essentially i can get to so it's kind of too far for me to actually go so i had somebody else go out to the recreational pot shop and actually pick this up here for me now like i said this here is a berry white and like i said we went to a or should say went to a different recreational pot shop now if you guys seen the og kim uh strain review that i did on new year's eve we actually got that og kim from uh a recreational pot shop called satorium and like i said that's a little bit too far for me to actually go to it so i had someone else pick it up for me and this stuff here happens to be uh also from that same pot shop where we got the og kim from so this stuff here actually costs thirty dollars real quickly it's thirty dollars for three and a half grams or an eighth of this very white here so we're going to go ahead and show you the uh the packaging and the labels and [ __ ] like that so like i said i had somebody else go out there uh to a recreational pot shop called sartorium it was just a couple you know it's like about maybe 15 20 miles from where i live it's it's really far out let somebody else go out there and get it for me but i like the og kim that i got there last time so i asked him you know hey could you go out there and you know pick me up some other stuff and this is what he got here this here is a 30.8 that's right 30 bucks for three and a half grams of this berry white here now of course we don't have three and a half grams in here of course you know like i tell you guys i always put a [ __ ] ton away for the weekend and keep a little bit for the show here to show you guys but like i said here's the packaging this here is packaged by fat panda and this is actually grown by the frost factory and if you guys saw in the og kim strain review i didn't know if the frost factory was the name of the recreational pot shop or if it was actually the grower and this here is actually the name of the grower so a little update on that and then of course it's packaged by fat panda here and i definitely like their packaging here if i can get it back as you can see there got the berry white and stuff and then let's go ahead and show you the stats here of this berry white now like i said this was thirty dollars for three and a half grams which is a really good deal so hopefully you guys can see the stats there but of course we'll also tell you the sas and everything so obviously if you guys are new to coach class tv essentially on my stream reviews we start off with the price then we get into the smell test then we go into the bud like the manicure job the density as well as is it too fresh is it too dry or is it right in the middle then we get into the grease taste test the after greens taste test the high and then at the end we do our official review of this strain here so first up 30 30 for three and a half grams we have to give that price a five out of five that is a great [ __ ] deal for an eighth of marijuana and like i tell you guys anytime you get more grams or more marijuana for your buck that's always a great deal and when that happens we have to give that a five out of five for the price so 30 bucks for three and a half grams a five out of five for that great price so next up we're going to open this up we're going to take a couple big whips we're going to actually get the smell of this and essentially tell you guys what it smells like and then rate the smell as well so let's go ahead and open up this berry white oh and before we do that let's go ahead and read off the stats real quick off to the side here so potency analyst has a thcas is 23 thc is it looks like 34 and then cbds it says 2 and then total is 20 so very low on the cbds but very high on the thc thc is 34 and the thca is 23.1 percent and this is three and a half grams and this was harvested on 11 7 or i'm sorry this was harvested on 10 20 of 2015 and then it was packaged on 11 7 of 2015. so that right there is the stats of this barry white so let's go and open this up and do the smell test now so when i open this up i get a very strong pine mixed with uh a strong earth tone so kind of like some organic piney weed but very strong pine with that really hint of organic kind of like dirt uh earthy tones excuse me there but yeah just very very strong pine with almost kind of like a like not like you know spicy like hot but like some kind of like spices like oregano or something but just kind of a very piney little bit of spicy but very uh earthy kind of a organic smelling weed so the smell i definitely probably have to give it a three out of five it's definitely very strong very loud package [ __ ] it's definitely something that people will definitely smell around you when you open it up it'll fill up your room with some uh with that uh skunky smell but me personally i don't really like that kind of like bitter pine i like the sweet pine more than the bitter pine and this is kind of a bitter pine so i really don't like the smell too much but it is very strong it is very loud package and it's not the worst smelling wheat so i definitely have to give the smell a three out of five like i said very strong just don't like the that type of smell to it so next up we are going to go ahead and get into the bud itself so we're going to get into the density and then of course on the scale too fresh to too dry and the manicure drop so we're going to put one butt out here and then we're going to give you guys a close-up shot of this berry white so here is a big fat nug of this berry white here and as i'm looking at it you know it's very light green and essentially every bud or essentially all the marijuana that i get from recreational pot shops they're always covered with trichromes they're always covered with crystal and keef so i really never if you guys have noticed i really never talk about the trichrone production on recreational pot just because here in spokane the trichroma production is always perfect but straight up when i'm looking at this bud the manicure drop this is a five out of 5 manicure job look at this this is what i like to call a professional manicure drop is a very very good looking butt if you want to call it beautiful definitely a very beautiful bud there is no leaf on it at all whatsoever as you guys can see just a perfect [ __ ] bud so the manicure drop a five out of five definitely perfectly manicured weed one of probably the best uh manicure jobs i've seen at a recreational pot shop in a while so a five out of five for the manicure drop then for density yeah it's it's kind of dense it's not as you know like uh our normal indica so we'll have to probably give it a 3.5 out of 5 for the density it's denser than average weed but it's not as dense as some regular indica or even you know regular rock card nugs that we get here in washington so 3.5 out of 5 for the density and then on a scale too fresh to too dry this is perfect this is not too fresh this is not too dry this is right in the middle and it is a little bit sticky as well and as i kind of you know sit here and take the butt out and kind of mess with it a little bit it just it's really starting to get a really strong skunk smell so i'll throw that butt in there show you guys that but definitely some really good looking stuff here so we happen to actually have a bowl of this very white load it up into green or i should say bubbles aka the green bastard our thick ass glass fritted disc here", "Pj5rF6QfUfE": "all right everybody welcome to nine weeks of flower that's right for zone whoop it's got some very nice large giant buds here going on today's harvest day as well so I'm trying to get some up close shots yet a show just how beautiful these titties are looking right now really really came out quite nicely got beautiful coloration happening there we are going slightly earlier than we typically will on some things in terms of attack chrome coloration but that is done on purpose for this time why if it's not working boom I mean focus there we go for some weird reason this thing just does not work very well I'm struggling with that maybe it's the low light today I don't know but that's alright we're still getting the shots for you really really excited to get all of this drying and going I mean really the camera's not doing these justice in terms of their size like they're quite large you know I'm sang so it'll be a good time what I'm thinking though will be fun in terms of that first we'll do recaps we've been flush for the last two weeks we're at nine weeks the flower now on these I think I'm gonna shoot this as a hyperlapse just to the fun the reason why I don't have sown cues lights on is one keeps the ambient light down while I'm doing harvest but also those plants grew a couple inches overnight in with the lights so once we get the harvest done we're gonna be resetting up this room and it's sort of expanding Zone two out into Zone one and probably playing around with the light so I'll make a video on that too we won't include that in this video but get ready for the - [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] alright everybody who got that [ __ ] [ __ ] there and you all I'm saying turn on my little air filter here having a little air movement in the room is not a bad thing all right so we've got all these plants down now some of them I did the plug on I was lazy didn't do the plug on some of the other ones so for example that one had a nice pluck done to it not a perfect one but a nice pluck done which one there's another one I did it too as well this one here had a decent pluck except for near the bottom so why do we hang the whole plant well the reason why were hanging the whole plant okay is all these stalks are filled with cannabinoids so we're leaving the whole plant all those cannabinoids are gonna sink slowly down into your buds okay by keeping the plant intact or as much as we can we had to take the super tall girl in two pieces it was over seven feet we had to just not enough room in here okay and at the end of the day that will help the plant just to dry as slow as possible why is this a beneficial thing well because one the slower we can drive the medicine without having an issue of molding etc it is going to be greater benefit to our terpenes to a flavonoids to cannabinoids alright leaving all those beautiful ladies intact typically we're gonna dry in the dark obviously put the light on in here just to help the little video clip it's not going to be like a pitch-black darkness in here but it's gonna be alright in terms of relative humidity for drying I like to dry it around 55 to 60 at absolute maximum cooler temperatures are always positive this room in and of itself is actually fairly cool on its own alright but really happy with the way things are coming out here got lots of beautiful big sexy chunky monkey nugs you know trying to keep them away from the cat he won't really [ __ ] with him too much but at the same time this is kind of his room too I gave it a bit of a vacuum in here just make sure there's no hair going on but basically we're trying to have the plants dry as slow as possible we leave them intact maximize cannabinoids in the medicine all right and then we're gonna do a dry trim why do we dry trim well dry trimming is the only true way my humble to sounds wet trim injustice just doesn't work a dry trim is vastly easier it slows the rate of drying it allows to preserve the terpenes and cannabinoids flavonoids as we've already said and at the end of the day once you once you try dry trimming and doing it in this style it's vastly superior at least most of the people that I know that grow would agree with me and at the end of the day what you can do too is is when you break them down when they are dry you can kind of clean the plants up a bit jar them and then work your way through the jars in terms of your final trim that way you're going to nail that perfect ambient moisture level left in terms of the plant material to have a really nice cure and have a really nice tasting final product all right well anyway everybody thank you for tuning into this video thank you for supporting this channel taking for everyone in your wonderful birthday wishes on the Facebook group and on the channel thank you for

Squatch family these squat racks anyway everybody I actually won whoops sorry cat watch out [ __ ] [ __ ] as you can tell I didn't really clean up the plants in terms of a lot of these big families I am gonna remove those that's gonna be something would you have to the videos are gonna go through I just kind of put a pot below your plant and just start to clean that up a bit you can do that over a couple of days if you're in a bit of a rush or have a lot of stuff to do I gotta get in the grow room clean everything and get it reset up because got another video to shoot and to show you what we're gonna do to really maximize the finishing of those pink pushes we've got going on all right everybody seven plants down shitload of titties let's get them dry and then we'll show you the trim and once they're ready and eight to twelve days okay peace everybody", "bRn0nq0hSUw": "what's crackin y'all this is your man Barry white Jesus coming to you from the d'\u00eatre foundation hotel studio in downtown Detroit I am here with the man the unbelievably young legend mr. Brandon Cooper cousin a Bradley Cooper we're probably distant relative but you're in there we are here with you we're so excited to talk about artificial intelligence to talk about a myriad of other things that are happening in your life let's just get right to it let's get to the fruit and the root tell us where you're from and how you got to where you are now yeah from here Detroit west side of Detroit so sir Stade Rosedale Park talked about eight and then probably barely seven mile but had a pretty okay so mom reppin seven mile mouth too so there you go that's right well we are coming from America's pan pan its Maginot ass so they used to called the mitten but not an issue right yeah yeah but from the air born and raised and I really just found my way in tech background in music I love music my music I was 11 okay it's kind of switch gears and in music what were you doing more intricate instrument based stuff like production or was it more like the artistry of it artists are artists okay a distribution deal at Universal Music Group okay and that was great great time down in Atlanta sure I'm taking serious yeah most creatives always play music Basquiat sure death always have you here's the music totally you know yeah I just had a love for it but I put it to the back burner at a bigger love for tech that's where I am now okay and so you grew up in Detroit the major way down to Atlanta through music avenues and then you major out your way out to LA kind of bring us through that yeah like what was the the causing force to bring you out to LA from from Atlanta yeah so I went down to Atlanta for music and I was doing a home-based business at the time so I was kind of doing different things at the time but in Atlanta I I was oh I was doing about two or three shows a week okay which was pretty exciting for me you have this earn different projects yeah a couple of mixtapes and you know and can we still find the album is that's like a lot of stuff it's like 80% of my stuff now really yeah why is that uh it's not a nada identity change but it's just more so we want to be known for business and not for my music sure you know once you get bigger and since you know right born in America [ __ ] and they're like remember when you were on you did that drop for that you know lawyer firm in Atlanta and they were like I've been hit by a car you ready my car you been hit by a car it's a big part of me really big part of me is not something that 180 race it's really just uh where my focus is but music in general is math right so you're already kind of you computer like you know all musicians have some sort of you know complex mathematics going on in the brain how to yep you know frame versus and how to compose songs and all that sort of thing so even you know listening to music is going to give you a certain edge you know that's why they let children listen to like Bach and stuff and they write they have like classical music playing in schools before a large test just like to call me and nature of it you know synchronicity all that kind of harmonies so you go out to a light and you're doing what they're when I hear from my company I'll protect my company anything to do an a fade working on a thing and that's a pH ID ID written after the insect for those who don't know what an Avett is basically the insect that reproduces at a very very fast rate to the point of where an ethic can be pregnant and it will have a baby inside of its parlor so the nymph the baby ain't it it's in the stomach and already been pregnant so 1/8 akin to reproduce yourself by cloning itself through a sexual reproduction meaning it doesn't need a mate and it can have about 50 babies a week they drive farmers crazy they suck on plants right there in invasive species probably yes yeah the EO through mm-hmm so that's interesting you know you and that's really what your platform does is trying to clone businesses and other and soon individuals to help ultimately in for I from what I grasped and you're in a pre-interview is that it's trying to help you not work 40 hours a week okay so can you bring us a little bit through that whole process like how does someone go from working 40 hours a week to working what you said what 2% of that right so eliminating 98% of your work correct all right well I want to [ __ ] hear about that [ __ ] yeah according to a Gallup poll 85% of people a good job and I knew that because I mean I was working myself costs in my house every day in the entire to shade I mean it's really polish slavery right sure it is if you don't love what you do I mean if you're supporting your kids and hats off to you but if you're getting up every single day I mean died a long time ago I just got it you have no purpose absolutely my opinion but yeah so with the plateau were doing on the platform is we're allowing you to basically burn yourself into a bot and the bot will actually do things that you would do manually over and over so if you need to both meetings scheduling you want to do chat support for business we're gonna help these people check out on our platform for products so you want to buy the external hard drive or buy a computer it'll say okay shree by Barry but it'll say hey welcome to the site and you'll get a commission for it so when it works you get paid okay our goal is to allow you to work with one to and the bot is simulating your behavior everything that you're telling it to do to respond in terms of maybe your business's policies and private arms and all that standards of practices and all that sort of stuff yeah and is Preet that the bot will be pre training for non-technical people so if you don't know how to create a dialogue we can do it for you or you can you'll be able to download that information from our marketplace ok cool yeah it's really one of the biggest breakthroughs I think this whole and is there any you know intellectual property on your side of this artificial intelligence I mean are those have to own what it's pretty now and then you're providing that to other folks right yes kids and artificial intelligence but the process right how can have but hadn't really sought really [ __ ] sacrimoni takes well and you know as as everyone knows who listens to the very white Jesus show us your room or as always we are recorded in front of a lies to the audience at the Detroit Foundation Hotel in downtown Detroit and if you do listen to the show all of our future desk get a bottle of never age hashtag no water needed if you got that Stewie on your a you woman in the back door you got some [ __ ] on your pants use that never aged it will restore it like new it is restoration in a bottle you will get it back on your back or your feet or whatever that may be them sheets they be clean no worries mommy got a no pup ain't got it no so go over to Bob's classic cakes in Midtown's and get a bottle of never age hashtag no water needed and or look up Nara Detroit calm that's Narn a Detroit calm for more information on how to give yourself a bottle so let's say even our sponsor wants to get into a fits technology and so forth how would they approach you and what with that conversation and are they going to be talking to about as well like how does that go yeah so we do it for enterprise as well because its business the business at this point right right right now it's business the business we haven't opened it up for business to consumer which is the everyday person but that's what's on the way that will be coming to but for businesses if you have a website and you need to automate yourselves whether you need to generate needs or do a lot of things that take up a lot of your time sure just pounding the pavement sort of spit yeah I think we can increase that by 50 to 70 percent I'm okay right now the the second level of this intelligence and going from you know the the person who's trying to create a business and going to a consumer right okay so let's say I'm at a start-up and I sell like group gluten-free organic juices made from you know llamas and [ __ ] or something like that right they it's a dough product but I just can't get to market Wow but then I approach a business like yours to help me as an individual grow my small and small or startup business well we'll take our data even micro levels right right right so we'll take our data Sciences we'll take your industry if you need the cleanest to and they can pretty much grow that or throw the brain at that by over time according to what you needed to say okay because you don't know what you wanted to say right and that's how you increase your sales that's that's coming in the later phase okay now just to kind of give our listeners an idea of you know where you've come from with this business and some of the exposure that you've gotten and maybe where they can check some of this information out you've been on The Steve Harvey Show correct correct and what when was that like and how they that go down even those two go okay out in LA and really cool guy yeah every day is a good day yeah yeah just there's some future people and got there particularly and I'm talking alright but yeah we have Fox Business coming up I'll be on Fox really really so I'm talking about 80 along with some of the people that are our team okay me but yeah you can we have our website on Twitter or Facebook or all social media I've been on the Nicki rich show in a bear show Wall Street Network okay well yeah just just google my yeah it's kind of like yeah now the whole premise of this service is just you know Gallup poll saying that people aren't happy about their jobs also other polls saying that you know rob of robots are taking our jobs care and so forth so you're trying to bat the robot age by breaking robots into your own fold to then promote people individually and other small businesses right right every everyone's afraid that robots are taking their job they should that's the only way we're gonna get off work right but we pay you for it okay we pay you as a controller for it all right so you're then the mastermind behind like the Wizard of Oz so to speak pulling the strings to get operations done automatically and automated correct right correct just kind of give me a little bit more on what goes in to creating something like avid and how can somebody take advantage of its it's true have fun listening to this program and I say oh I have this great idea and I make the best [ __ ] pull for damage in the world okay how can I help myself by reducing my human resource need and/or dependence on human resources I might be cranking out those [ __ ] you know pulled pork sandwiches as quick quick as I can but then how do I get them to market it so you know what I mean crunch get into the minutiae of how someone can really bring their idea to market by using a service like yours yeah so initially the way that our business model is set up is to most people are starving artists or starving vision earrings right we just want to take the workload off first and you know later phase we'll start to integrate your individualized services so that's not the initial or to market strategy but that will occur in the very very near future but basically what that would look like is as we mentioned before you would basically just take the resources in your industry and download it to your pot okay so but there will range it from everywhere from real estate agents to restaurants and where are you in terms of the business are you in the ran are you in the black are you are you turning profit is it something to where you're scaling up and all these artificial intelligences are helping you do that scale up you explain that process for us yes so our b2b model we live last month only 10x okay in our first Wow which is pretty awesome and in terms of like finance and that's where they kind of explain to our listeners what 10x means ten times you know basically from where you started you went up ten times to so it's ten thousand a hundred thousand so you're in the black you're you're with the surplus your reinvestment and we did it all that is by the way from strapping Oh God no I mean me a tiny small investors highly appreciated but the bootstrap right or no big investors anything like that everything came from our blogs right and those people on that ground floor are gonna reap the benefits I assume for making that you know we're taking that risk and you know making a decision based on what they saw in you and the product and the team and so forth know therefore from the early days of Facebook short yeah now some people really hooked up so to speak just one guy because they were still green Mark Zuckerberg profit for you right they call it the billion dollar mistake sure yeah yeah I mean even like Shaquille O'Neal was Starbucks brought an idea to Shaquille O'Neal basketball player you know millionare etc and they they said hey we want to start selling Starbucks in lower socio-economic communities like urban communities and he was like no [ __ ] way I've never seen a black person drink coffee we drink tea and so they took that same idea to Magic Johnson he got on board so he was like you know I'll make that [ __ ] money with you you know what I'm saying and we have Sharia more in studios you just got in hey guys hey what's up word so she's gonna get her headset on and get in get into it with us and I just want to mention that Sharia Moore is not only co-host but the

to Atlanta for music and then kind of wiped out all that you know information basically was like yeah I'm going into business I don't want to be may be perceived as someone who isn't serious about business because I was doing music before right so strip that all the way kind of like wipe that social media slate clean and then went in to have it now talk to me I think maybe even a little bit about business cultures from different regions you know Detroit is in particular to this region as Atlanta is two hits as LA is to get so how have you been able to transition as not only a go-getter creative musician businessperson how have you been able to navigate those different landscapes and what is maybe the difference between those landscapes respectively yeah a lot of them have the same where people there are a lot of people that work in silos there's a lot more power and strength in numbers there's you know two companies doing the same thing and biggest sure you can say jackets fine long dick style Detroit has a lot of that in common with Atlanta there's more money in LA there's a lot of statistics sure yeah who doesn't oh my god I love the beach I wish I was at the beach right

safe state which is the HBCU and where's that North Carolina thank you where would we be without you and they were at another HBC HBCU school and they were just trying to you know promote the programs

future will open up org have a lot of resources for ABC News pitch competitions oh cool a lot of stem stuff right out of alternative yeah not not a mission we want to check up but absolutely I mean just off inspiration as well if I can make young boys I you know I I remember just even through like television and you know just seeing not necessarily necessarily folks that look like me but people that were different than me I think is what propelled me to go beyond my box and my neighborhood and living abroad and that's what a finger is saying for me you know just watching different people on television gave me a different outlook on life you know we're not just seeing the the growing pains and the [ __ ] and you know Alex bikinis and [ __ ] you know I didn't relate to how expensive asbestos I did JJ for good times you know I was more like a funny person than you know some piping ass Republican you know so I found my maybe even inspirations and or beams of light from watching diversity come on television rather than seeing the monotonous [ __ ] like with Leave It to Beaver what do you not I mean yeah but you know what that's so interesting that you say that because yeah they they give us more colorful rows you know you nanami and yeah but it is more entertaining house for people we do enjoy it because he'll I want Isis to watch good times growing up but maybe I but

a tradition and a lot of people have this whole way of thinking in the system we're putting our kids through the same system that didn't work for us dynamic for generations you know I think that's so interesting I was gonna mention that but I didn't know how deep you wanted to get into the interview you know I mean that's like what I'm on I love that type of stuff so well you share stuff like that we'll meet this guy I'm telling you he is on another level like this is just the beginning for you and I'm just proud that people are finally getting to see you because like you were working on music

have even but you know I'm not allowed to but just know that some underground it's like game changer ya know for sure right [ __ ] game changer just my futuristic game if you can reduce your workload by 98% yeah good enough that sounds ridiculous but we were talking a little bit earlier it's like maybe that's the plausibility of it yeah is that when you have you know Gallup polls and all these other things and I think what's most interesting about all that [ __ ] is that it's not about maybe even the job that they're worried about it not being able to live so rambley and that's Joe yeah yeah get off work and get off work you're planning for the already and kids to look at husband wife time but even all you want to do is go home in the [ __ ] Washington heat and try to get that we on

steps back and I watched and I said yeah I mean just did you bury endings are you getting back to the states and living here for about two years now since I left it was an incredible adaptation for me you know even be in the supermarket someone will you know have their back turn turn around I'm three and a half maybe four feet from that person and then they're saying oh [ __ ] I'm sorry like how are you are you doing you know don't say sorry to me you've done nothing wrong you're not in my personal space like let's just have a interesting conversation cuz we bumped into each other right you know laws of attraction and so forth and yeah I think that was the biggest difficulty that I had was just trying to reintegrate into my own culture because where I was living it was so touchy-feely and you know men walked each other down the street holding each other's hands and you know there's all this really close personal interactivity you know where human-computer interaction is becoming more and more the necessity to get through life but even getting back to where you can work 98% less and then work on your personal relationship so that's most important right our motto is free society that's better okay so a fit free society it's in your hands hey boys your hands-free then you need somebody never you so I'm telling you get messy we're gonna take a quick segment break and then we're gonna get back with another musician we're gonna talk a little bit about gospel music please hang out if you can I would like maybe even have a little dialogue between you two let me get back okay this is very white Jesus with the lovely co-host Rhea more on the very white Jesus show at the Detroit Foundation Motel studio in downtown Detroit as always we are brought to you by never

varieties but none evokes such fascination as his iceberg white blackberry was there ever in nature a berry just like this a visitor to Burbank farm once asked him probably not their big road but there was a small white berry and a large luscious black one and I have brought the best qualities of each together in a new combination Burbank was a disciple of Charles Darwin and his approach to plant breeding reflected his belief in the theory of natural selection he crossed the lawton blackberry a berry he revered for its brawny size sweet flavor and genetic stability with a so-called white blackberry discovered growing wild in New Jersey and marketed as a garden novelty the crystal white berry was actually a brownish yellow color and Burbank seemed thoroughly unimpressed with it writing that it had as little pretensions of beauty as to size or excellence of flavor nonetheless it provided him with the genetic material he needed to perfect a white blackberry in the mid 19th century white blackberry seemed to be a catch-all phrase for any blackberry lacking its characteristic blue black pigment and there were several other varieties for sale in 1852 New England farmer made note of Needham's white blackberry described as having large amber colored fruit and a sweet taste Illinois nurserymen John be orange introduced several white blackberries including an oblong pink berry he called the Albion after his hometown he also raised a cream color berry he called the Colonel Wilder in honor of marshal P Wilder a president of the American Pama logical Association and the crystal white also known as oranges crystal which shares its name with the berry Burbank used to make his iceberg it's a Burbank many tries to create a strain that would bear the translucent white fruit consistently but in 1894 he offered it in his new creations in fruits and flowers and the price was steep $2,500 for a large Bush and 300 strong plant cuttings the equivalent of about 73 thousand dollars today after its initial introduction hundreds of nurseries and catalogs offered the iceberg Fitzer and manda of Short Hills New Jersey began selling it in 1897 teasing customers with ads in its catalog the previous year Meyer and Sun hailed it as an anomalous specialty a white black berry that is really good in 1900 JW Ramsey called it the paradox of the fruit world in 1916 Burbank released the snowbank which he created by crossing the iceberg with the crystal white but by the 1930s white blackberries had all but disappeared from catalogs at Baker Creek we kept hearing tales of white blackberries from old-timers around our farm in the Missouri Ozarks a few years ago photographer Brian Dunn found a patch on his land and Jerr get all started his quest to find this variety for sale in the early 1990s the Luther Burbank gardens acquired snowbank plants from a donor who wanted to make sure the variety was preserved but the plants were infected with a virus and it took years of research and cleanup to make the snowbank disease free and available to the public once again we are amazed by the Berry's sweet almost tropical flavor it's like a typical blackberry even sweeter

exciting pretty cheap it's cool gram oh you know I forget so Harvest House of cannabis is the only one I've seen so far that actually like seals their pre rolls and I would bet that that makes for the freshest rules will secret already smoked one of these Grand Prix rolls the Barry White when I first got him a little tough to get into the container so where do the waters if you're getting it for arthritis are painting my trouble getting in and out of the pre-roll containers so it is one of the more better smelling murals that I've had before definitely even compared to other full Grand Prix rolls this is definitely super delicious moment and I always love when their machine packs like this and they give you that little extended but in meinem like cigars Harvest definitely has the easiest lighting pre-rolls for sure it's cuz with their but she packed like they are with a whatever product they use a machine they use it gives a little small invention at the end and leaves like a ridge for you to light and create the heat source for you to then pull to the center of your joint like that Bernie like afroman said honestly I don't know if he has an afro that was probably an assumption nice bad as I remember though much better pretty smooth compared ibly especially when that's the first thing I wake up in smoke usually it's very harsh there's mocha this is rather smooth pretty well that's very white doesn't have a lot of berry flavor like I would have thought I bet it's cross with me white by the gas so medicinally again this very white is super awesome I feel super relaxed I feel completely comfortable all over my body granted I've just woken up I don't feel too so with that Harvest House of cannabis pre-roll that's only 12 bucks it was pretty awesome for the program I have to say putting it all down wasn't that bad compared to some of the other four grams of smoke such as like your leaves that keep saying that was just not that great it was totally tough thanks again for watching Florida medical", "FFFwQ5j79-M": "hey guys and welcome back to another video so today i'm bringing you moon's makeover as you all know i will be starting not so very extended very soon if you did watch my recent video which was the screenshot episode featuring screenshots from mint up until blue generation if you haven't seen that definitely go check that out i was actually surprised on the positive comments on that because not that i was expecting anything negative it was just positive feedback that you guys did enjoy seeing it which was crazy to me because i was so worried that oh my god it's gonna be such a long video and everything but it made sense because there were so many pictures there throughout you know three a little over three years worth of playing so i'm glad that you guys enjoyed that it really does mean a lot to me because i recorded that video a couple times but i used the first piece of footage that i recorded like my initial look at them from december 31st so it was basically almost a month later that i uploaded it but thank you again to twitch chat for like reassuring me that you guys wanted to see it it just kind of pushed me so it was a late video but i'm glad that you guys still enjoyed it regardless so anyways back to nasa very extended of course moon is our next generation and i'm super excited to get started i also went ahead and not only did his makeover but i don't show the makeovers i just kind of briefly show the other family members at the end so you guys can see what they look like now i was gonna do like a whole video doing everybody but it would have been so long so i was like whatever i'm just gonna do moon primarily since he's the main focus next but i decided to give them the kind of new style that i do now which is a little bit like a maxis match skin but maybe some of it might be a little bit more realistic and then more realistic eyes it's kind of been what i've been doing lately so i felt like i should make everybody look the way that i style sims now i mean i'm sure you guys can tell from my creative sims and stuff as of late how my sims look compared to what they looked like maybe a few months back all i will say is it's really fun seeing like the evolution of my sims especially even looking back throughout the nozzle berry challenge screenshots like seeing how my sims have changed like even if you look at my mail sims like my significant others that i made for my main sims like you can tell the difference if you look at tony to let's say beck or atlas there's a big difference there as to how i made my mails not to mention i used to be really obsessed with giving every single sim like this really heavy blush with a little nose shine or whatever it was which thank god i dropped that although you guys know that the booboo blush is my baby and i still use that pretty much on every sim as long as there isn't a skin detail that i want to use for them but boo boo blush just kind of gives like a little bit more warmth or like color to the skin which i love so i basically use that on almost every single sim it's just it's my go-to so i'm glad that it's not that crazy like it used to be but overall it was just really nice to see like how everything has changed even like building wise so i love that but anyways back to moon so with moons outfits i kind of didn't know what to give him honestly now of course his color scheme is white so i was trying to find some white pieces and like i don't know why i was struggling with his outfits i thought i had this down pack but it was i was just having a rough time now the thing is is like of course this generation again is revolving around the color white so i was thinking that when i do end up releasing you know the challenge rules which will be during his first episode so hold your horses i still need to finalize that and i'm still like figuring out what i want to do for the next two generations because i don't know if i said this i know i said it on stream which by the way if you guys don't follow me on twitch definitely should go follow me there link is always in the description but anyways i did mention on twitch how i think i'm only going to do three more generations of not so berry because i don't want to like only do not very all the time obviously this challenge is gonna have to come to an end at some point and i feel like three more generations will be perfect we'll see maybe three or four like around there i don't know i haven't fully decided but right now i'm thinking three more because we have white black and brown i don't know if it's gonna be in the order that i set it in so i'm kind of basing it off the colors that we have for hair in the sims 4. now i know we don't have white but i was thinking that if you don't have access to custom content then you can use the silver hair instead of the gray hair because you know you always had gray gen and i doubt people were using the silver hairs for gray gin so you could use silver but instead just dress your sims in white if that makes sense so i don't think it really matters that much but of course custom content you can get your white hair i had to actually recolor the hairs for moon and i ended up recoloring the hair for um ivory and also dove's hair because i was not about to go hunting for a recolors so i just did it myself i don't know if there's any other colors that i'd want to really do like there's the auburn kind of color between like the red and the brunette so i don't know if i would do that i'm basing the next generations on stuff that i haven't really done in the sims so like this is why moon's generation is the acting skill because even though i had a get famous series i really didn't do much if that makes sense i don't know i wasn't really i lost interest really quickly and i wanted to give it a shot one more time because the acting career looks really fun and i feel like i've barely got into it so that is something that i definitely want to get into so that's why i'm like trying to make sure with the next gens like i want to kind of do a little bit more research into like what i haven't really done so that's basically why i'm not going to have like the entire challenge written out because maybe there's a pack that's going to come out and i want to incorporate that into the upcoming challenges which is why i don't want to rush it i want to take my time so the rules are going to be coming out generation by generation so i don't want to rush through everything and just kind of play things out and see obviously i'm going to have probably like a gist of what i want to do for the upcoming generation just so that if you know moon has a kid we know like what route to go with but another reason why i don't want to like write a whole ten generation uh not so very extended or five gen whatever is because i also have been wanting to write my own challenge and dedicate my heart and soul into that i've started writing one actually about two years ago or so i don't know what i did with the rules and the document that i had i probably have it somewhere i literally have not looked back on it and so actually now i think about it it might be on my ipad now that i think about it i think that's why i started writing it but i just had this concept for a challenge for so long and i just haven't taken the time to write it and i don't know why i just can't sit down to write that like this is why it's so hard for me to even write up not so barry but i was so adamant in wanting to do my own version of the extended one because i just want to be able to play with the things that i want to and want to experience throughout the sims which is why i didn't really want to go and do somebody else's version of not so very extended even though i'm sure like they're really good challenges it's just there's other things in the sims that i haven't done yet that i would like to accomplish but that's pretty much it for this video sorry for being so rambly i just sometimes i like being able to just talk to you guys with that being said i'm going to go ahead and go thank you guys so much for watching i hope you guys enjoyed if you did don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe if you haven't already and i'll talk to you guys in a new video very soon bye

peace", "d4Kdn4_trwg": "good afternoon it's officially afternoon it's 1207 p.m. I just thought I'd let you guys see the kind of tea me and Ernie not only drink coffee but we also drink tea mostly we drink tea is a treat or something different but i thought i'd let you see these teeth we have this one that comes in a little tube like thing it has a package sealable package in there and the tea bag freed is round and that is a green tea we get that at the asian store where we shocked and the next one we have here is this pinwick wild raspberry rose tea and it comes in an individual package and it's it's good we like that one then we have the traditional Lipton tea green tea with ASEA I don't know if that's how you pronounce that or not dragon fruit and melon that teeth pretty good and of course we do have the sweet dreams the no caffeine chamomile hibiscus tea that's supposed to put you to sleep it doesn't at least not me and then we have our pantry green tea here with blueberry and I fear I say a cat I'm not sure how you pronounce that but see now it's a hundred percent natural and it comes in the individual little things here so it helps keep it fresh and then we have a decaf raspberry and white tee and it comes in the little individual packages and of course in this old coffee can we have the traditional everyday regular tea so now I like this plain green tea I really do and I really like this this one right here this green tea with blueberry but they're all good and what I suggest you do is you go out and you find you some of these specialties now something I want to tell you about is try to make sure now see this regular tea it comes in just the paper let me get this get my right hand going here it comes in just the paper that is folded over the tea doesn't stay is fresh the same with this the tea is just in this folded over paper package the teas that stay the freshest are like this one here which has inside package that you can roll up and then they have the individual tea bags or the t's like this one here that comes in the plastic so try to see when you do buy your tea try to get the kind that is not in these paper packages because they will stay a lot fresher a lot longer if they're individually wrapped like this one or like this one here because it's in plastic so try some teas keep some on hand for those of you who think that a coffee pot is not worth it because you don't drink coffee you drink tea well here's a little tip make your hot water in your coffee pot and then you've got hot water all day long to make your tea then what you can also do and what a lot of people do is your coffee pot most of the coffee pot slow the regular size coffee pots come with 12 cup craft well put 12 tea bags in there and then you've got hot tea you can just refill refill like coffee drinkers refill their coffee it's really good and if you do it that way it encourages you to drink more tea which is what some people say better for you than drinking so much coffee but do whatever you do do your research there is some research about green tea that you shouldn't drink more than so many cups per day is that true I don't know I'm going to let you decide for yourself but I have read some reports that you should only have so many cups of green tea per day you need to do your own research and you need to figure that out for yourself I'm not going to tell you whether you should or you shouldn't but normally when I have my green tea I only have two cups and it's not like I have two cups every day usually when I drink tea I will drink more like this raspberry white tea you know if I'm going to have a lot of tea in one day or I might have just a regular tea and notice too that like on this one here this is artificially flavored herbal tea okay read your ingredients just like you do on your other items read your ingredients this one with the super fruit it says flavor noise you know well what is that do you research just like any other item that do go out and buy yourself a bunch of tea because we're having a little cold spell here today and in the morning and in the afternoon and there's nothing as much as I love my coffee there is nothing like a good cup of tea so enjoy your tea guys bye", "GE6YYUsX6tU": "you like that yeah so obviously the bud real quickly I'm gonna have to probably give the butt a 4 out of 5 it's you know easy yeah it's perfect manicure job it's not too fresh it's not too dry it's perfect the only thing it lacks is density is just a little bit fluffy it's denser than your average regular weed but it's not as dense as either you know some indicas are just most of those dense weed around here so not a rock yet or not a rock garden ugh but not you know essentially some fluffy wheat or you know fluffy like average wheat so the butt itself we'll have to give it a 4 out of 5 definitely really good bud and the manicured job which is [ __ ] perfect a five out of five for that so hopefully you guys at home have your smoking device alone hope you guys are may join the urban honey all your watcher hash or keep your shadow whatever you're smoking on Kennedy sighs hope you guys gonna be joining with me and as always the hit for hit challenge a little game like we like to play on the show here every time I take a hit and marriage or one on once you guys at home to go ahead and take a hit with me every time I take it so enough talking let's get into the greens taste hate the greens taste a stew after greens taste has the higher than the official review of this barrier wall art so enough talking hopefully you guys are having a good day or not at night and if you're not definitely go ahead and load up a bowl spark one up with me hopefully we'll make it a little bit better with some good herb but enough of that toast guys and here we go Wow holy [ __ ] whoa what the [ __ ] is this weed there's this hash Oh alrighty so the greens taste test it tastes just like hash like just some straight-up [ __ ] hash like that pure THC that pure [ __ ] like keep that pure hash putting some honey all on top of the bowl of weed that first head of hash that's what it tastes like this pure hash pure THC just pure [ __ ] goodness and it has that kick like hash to like if you guys have ever took them that hit of like a hit of hash or whatever kind of has that little after kickback you know but straight up the greens taste test 5 out of 5 it tastes just like hash so running keep on smoking on this and see if it essentially has those flavors after the cut well you know on the third and fourth hit and of course getting into high in the official review but enough talking once get to smoking or get back to smoking and toast guys goddamn some [ __ ] strong [ __ ] wheat here okay [ __ ] a I'm [ __ ] stoned holy [ __ ] guys holy [ __ ] that's something else there holy [ __ ] hopefully we're doing good on time alright we're at 11 minutes so let's go ahead and get into this reficul review of this barry white so first off $30 for three and a half grams that's a great deal any time like essentially three knife grams any time the price is 35 bucks and less for an 8 that's always a great deal we'll have to give that a 5 out of 5 for the price that's just ridiculous a great deal recreational medically or black-market $30 three and a half friends across the world nope all around that is a great meal so five out of five for the price and then next up the smell test I have to give the small test of three out of five just because I really don't like that bitter pint I like more of a sweet pine instead of the bitter pine so I really don't like the way it smells but it's definitely very strong very loud package stuff some people might actually like the smell of that kind of like bitter pine or organic kind smell but me personally have to give it a three out of five I don't personally like the smell but it does get it 3 out of 5 just because it's very strong a very loud package and it's you know not horrible smelling weak so 3 out of 5 for the small test so next up we get into the bud itself the but I'm gonna have to probably give it a 4.5 out of 5 perfect manicure job perfect on a scale of to fresh the to dry pad [ __ ] great trichrome production great frosted you know like it says the frost factory great frosty but the only thing that it lacked was the density and even though it isn't that dense I'd notice that taking those couple of hits there it still you know they're still about essentially half a bowl left in here like a I didn't look that much up in there I loaded like maybe a little point three in there and there's still a half a bowl in there easily after taking those four or five big bong rips so definitely even though it's not that dense it still last very long like a den snug so straight up I have to give it a 4.5 out of 5 if it was a rock-hard nug able to get a perfect score but this since it is a little fluffy it kind of takes it away from being a perfect score but have to give the butt a 4.5 out of 5 best manicured job I've seen at a recreational pot shop in the past two years of buying weed out of recreational pot shops here so I guess at 4.5 out of 5 for the bud itself and then the greens taste test it tasted like pure hash it tasted like you I was smoking straight-up some hash or maybe smoking some honey all on top of some weed like it has that pure hash that pure THC taste so the greens taste tests have to give it a 5 out of 5 very great tasting stuff I love hash like if I had a choice of hash weed or honey oil I'd smoke hash for you know all day long I love hash I love to taste the patch so me personally I have to give it a 5 out of 5 very good tasting stuff and it's very strong tasting as well something that lasts on your palate like right now I still have that hash taste on my palate so don't have to give it a 5 out of 5 for the greens taste test and then the after greens taste test on the fourth and irreal third and fourth hit I did taste a little bit of burnt weed but it still holds those hash flavors that really good pure THC so I'm gonna have to give it a 4 out of 5 I do taste a little bit of burnt miss a little bit of I guess combust tasting but you still have those so holds those flavors of a good hash essentially what you get on the greens taste test so I have to go to four out of five definitely some really good stuff on that after greens taste test and then the high this is a very very strong you fork head high because like I said this here is 34% THC and I definitely feel the effects of the THC probably so much to where I'm actually kind of having a hard time talking now but definitely have a really good euphoric head high I really don't have any body high at all it does have a couple percent of CBDs so maybe in about 15-20 minutes I might start filling it I do feel a little Highness on the back of my eyes like kind of like a little indica high but definitely a very strong euphoric head high so I have to give that a five about a 5 definitely some really good [ __ ] here I took a couple hits I got stoned I'm happy with it 5 out of 5 for the high so my official review of this very white straight up the strain and this stuff that we got here this personal batch I have to give both of them a 5 out of 5 this is great stuff here and definitely a great strain across I definitely recommend anyone go to their black-market recreational or medicinal shop wherever you go to get your marijuana or your cannabis I definitely recommend you guys going and try to get yourself some Barry White this is some really [ __ ] good [ __ ] here so hopefully we didn't take up too much of your time and holy [ __ ] [ __ ] we did so I guess this is gonna end up being another two-part episode and I apologize about the two-part episodes anytime the [ __ ] [ __ ] goes over 15 minutes out to do it in a two-part but that's okay though because since it is a two-part episode I don't have to leave right away now so I guess we'll finish this off with one more big fat Barry white cloud so hopefully you guys are how are you know hopefully you guys have a good day or night all around 24 hours definitely stay high stay medicated stay lifted and always enjoy your herb peace and see you guys next time on curse Klaus TV like I said with one more very white clown [ __ ] Pope alright guys peace - see you guys next time we'll crush clouds - give me a [ __ ] name", "X-sukgWh64Y": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] don't watch this video over 18 don't smoke my personal information I hey what's up guys Ronnie ray back at you so this video I have another card review for you guys and I actually picked this car door for only $10 $10 and I actually got off my license medical marijuana dispensary so I didn't get it off the street so it's not one of those like bootleg cards going around you know what I mean so it's actually from like at this bench recently I was gonna say I'm like and I actually already smoked one of these already so I kind of know a little bit how like I didn't know what to expect you know what I mean kind of somewhat but but I wanted to get a couple to make videos on for you guys because I tend to orders and if the medical dispensary you know I mean that's kind of like crazy you know I mean and it's actually from the brand dream scheme they're actually they actually have some fire products yeah I actually tried some of their products before um they had some fire products um I seem that they had these for $10 I was I had to pick him up to see what the [ __ ] was good with them you know I mean like what's that was them one thing that's like interesting about them as test it out 40% so that's a little weird you know but I got two strains right here so I'm gonna make two videos on these I got Barry White and Lemon Haze it's for you I'm gonna be baby white I just go over the packaging real quick for you guys just has a dream Steam and then it has this little sticker thing I think this is so like they don't make fakes or something I don't we know what this is for but they each each card comes I get different serial number or whatever you want to call it I don't know I don't know really know why they do that maybe help prevent fakes going around on the bottom assist me and this little bit so side just has the Arizona Department of Health Service for me that's it really other side just has the test results and that's really um that's really all that's on the package of an off so um besides for that you open it up it's games team I believe they use co2 to extract this little it from its Lowry and I mean so it comes in like these like little co2 container I always think it's like dope one parts come in these I don't know why I just think it's cool so it says a premium disloyal dream steam right now yeah dream steam feet calm got so want to look up some more information on them so then just pop this open the one thing that's really [ __ ] weird about these is I'm guessing because it's tested at 40% let me show you maybe read all the ingredients real quick so fertilizer part a no idea what any of that [ __ ] is I don't know just a lot of were [ __ ] and this you guys probably know better than me because a lot of big words you know I mean tell me down below in the comments what you guys think about this I'm not a [ __ ] scientist I don't know what a lot of that [ __ ] is its from harvest of Arizona dot-com right here harvest of AZ up or it'll be somewhere heart it'll be somewhere maybe that's on the description or right here I don't know about to do but harvest of az.com it's like a really big license like professional medical marijuana dispensary in Arizona so that's the reason why I really thought they would sell us some bootleg like we're some [ __ ] [ __ ] oil okay I think they would get sued real fast yes it's a it's a medical dispensary it's not a recreational shop so the thing I found really interesting about these cards is the [ __ ] of consistency of them this [ __ ] is like like almost like water like now it's thicker than water but obviously but like let me show you guys a little bit weird [Music] you see what I'm saying that [ __ ] it's super liquidy but it's just tested at 40% so I mean I don't really expect it to be like not moving and I mean it's 140 percent well I already smoked one of these but like I'm low-key like scare this one more she's like what the [ __ ] is the other 60% like I don't know that [ __ ] is weird it better be something safe coming down below in the comments what you guys think of these because they're selling them at the medical marijuana [Music] it also has them give you call these tips so I'm just gonna put this on my basic pen they like make many of these different what I mean this is actually can dispense we call it sky and I don't know I like to spend a lot even though it's kind of generic so on the pen this is what it looks like very white that's the strain or flavor what I want to call it obviously it's not me would like at least I don't think it'd be made with like some quality Terps since probably me wasn't she church it's just something for this price but um I don't know it's just going for the first hit kind of scary pray for me because I smoke along I hope you smoking some better [ __ ] than I am and it's off the bat like it has a really weird flavor to it like definitely doesn't a sexist ran Barry White oh I don't know just tastes like that I mean it's only forty percent THC and then sixty percent whatever so obviously less sixty percent is gonna overload that forty percent in immunity so I kind of just tastes like a bunch like mix it like a bunch of chemicals to be honest what kind of with a little bit of marijuana in there like not the worst flavor because I've had this taste in ugly parts before that I don't buy cars from the street I only buy my cards from dispensaries I think there was only one two times I bought two carts I bought off the street I think um it was the off worth car and the bank's cart I have two videos on those and I mean I pretty much bought them just to make the videos on and they don't pretty good so I don't regret it so these $10 carts are a little [ __ ] weirdos like I just really want to know just like your guys's opinion okay I got this at the medical shop like I say so very white it's been the [ __ ] beer though but it's put the clarity perfect taste is not the price point though ten bucks want the work they were ranked there originally twenty bucks I wouldn't pay 20 bucks for these [ __ ] no I'm not paying a 20 bucks for this but they had like a sale 50% off so they're ten bucks that's the only reason I bought them ten bucks I mean I could see that I could see people buying these for ten bucks to get rid of those eight cards off the street you know what I mean I'll grab the smoke one of these and those fake cards but this is still [ __ ] weird like I wouldn't pay 20 bucks or ten bucks I'm still like kinda iffy about it you know what I mean but it's ten dollars and something to smoke on all day you know what I mean ten bucks you bought weed it's gonna make like one blunt that's one size you know what I mean this is something like you can literally hit all day I just want to know if it was owned other chemicals I don't know none of that [ __ ] is so if you guys just tell me what you guys think of it down below in the comments I'm really curious to know what you guys think of it I made this a couple more times real quick now these hearts are definitely strange they definitely blow clouds or as you can see they don't taste the best in the cart that I smoked before I opened this one was actually better white to society so I'm definitely interested to see what this Lemon Haze one tastes like I'm gonna make the video right after I'm done recording this video so look out for that video it's pretty much the same thing test it at 40% but yeah if you guys want to see that video beaten the lookout for that definitely have some more fire cards to review for you guys um so yeah I got some more select parts to review for you guys I got real rule number for strawberry cheesecake and great white shark and to be honest I only got this one just present name or chart what that [ __ ] kind of name is that for I don't know you know what I mean so these are actually seventy [ __ ] dollars for a car which is ridiculous but they're [ __ ] fire so I have a couple reviews up on them like pineapple Express wedding cake I think I might have one more I forget you can go check those out if you want and look out for those this card sorry I kind of like it a lot of talking right there in the middle but this quarter like I don't know I don't know what I think about it but it's alright but it's not the best I honestly don't even feel like I'm any higher like the one I started making this video when I hit it a million times yeah I don't know on a scale of one to five fi the rate this cargo taste the flavor let me give it up I really don't want to give it a one someone to give the to the flavors the flavors not there at all but it's not the worst taste and maybe not a - yeah maybe like a two and a half because this definitely has to be some more like worst tasting cars out there than this I'll make it like a two and a half it just tastes kind of weird you know what I mean I don't know you're not explaining it yet just taste it for yourself the high two out of five again it's not there the way it smokes the ways I'm going cloud five out of five [Music] it's like a ten-dollar cars to smoke all day long you know what I mean can't really complain her coat wrong with that that's gonna dope so something the smoke on puffs on all day long my overall score on the [ __ ] dogs in the background going crazy I don't know if he hear that my grandma but my overall score in this I'm gonna give it like oh I'm gonna go to three out of five just because the price point I got on for 10 bucks I would not pay 20 bucks for them but 10 bucks for this car it's something to smoke on all day long but for you guys out there that know what those other chemicals are that in there and we don't blow in the comments with the artists oh I know I'm smoking um be on the lookout for those other videos like I said um yeah so time we don't blow in the comments you guys have any other like video ideas or complet anything doesn't gonna tell me I'll read every single comment and I guess besides for that you guys like the videos were the big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] you know what to do and it's been around already so", "JhCOISECy-w": "nowhere nowhere", "Uh9rTUvOnTo": "hello ladies and gentlemen welcome to eight weeks of flower yes things are going quite well give me a moment just to finish my beer and we will tell you about everything oh right so as you can tell we've got some different in some really thrilling buds they're starting to fall over obviously we're staying on top of them at eight weeks right now we've been flushing them very hard all week we did use the flushing agent two or three times this week and then for the final week we will just be doing a water flush but really nice swelling going on there beautiful trichrome action going on see if we can get some really nice up-close shots for you here just to show you the beauty of what's going on on this samang go here absolutely gorgeous she's got a beautiful earthen sweet kind of a smell to her with some secondary funky Munky action if you know what I'm saying here's the other samang go here that's the sort of the short Bush one there there we go just beautiful try crumbs really erupting all over our fruit as it were why don't you focus egg focus sorry everybody just a moment there we go and at the end of the day let's talk about with the trichrome colorations on the some angle right now probably about a good 10 to 15% ambering on there that's probably gonna go up another five to ten percent by the time she's done in terms of hitting that nine weeks a flower on the flush show you the other big Sam mango here got some nice big buds going on this is just a solid but all through and through some really nice try Chrome's coming on on this one as well there we are little bit of fog still grow from some of the tips on that one not a big deal I'm not personally concerned about it I've decided that I'm quite sure that this one is in fact a samang go beautiful try Chrome's developing on this one as well see if I'd actually get a proper shot of it for you really coming together nicely probably in the next day or so we are going to do a bit of a flush or not a flush sorry we've been flushing all we will be continuing flushing all week but we're gonna do what kind of a plot can kind of get in there I've definitely have had some light stress for sure on this Barry White as you can tell with all this curling but again not worried about it giant massive nubs being produced on that like I mean just really giant beautiful mugs coming out on that one this is in fact the Barry White phenotype we've decided to keep I just really like all these giant buds it produces it's really proving itself quite nicely so one more week left on all of these for the Barry White trichrome colorations I would say that there's very little ambering there's some ambering but it's a hundred percent milky trikes right now so that given sort of the sativa nature of the the plant in and of itself will be the perfect time in a week to take those down for our liking there some really really strong punch at Barry fruity notes going on with that Barry White always so nice when we had that weird kind of one that was kind of on its own doing the autoflowering thing even though it wasn't supposed to when we took that one down we actually made it into a bunch of rosin and so the Barry White has proven to be quite an amazing rosin producer so at the end of the day that is going to go very nicely I think sorry everybody just had a phone call coming through sorry Zach can't talk right now but really all together to come to whether I've got a little baby spider over there that's what's floating there I have no issues with a little spider setting up a little web there though just in case yard fungus gnat or fly comes on in it'll do a good job to protect our little weed webs but yes we'll probably come through and do a pluck in the next couple of days if we do do a pluck on those plants we will do some hyper lapses and come through and show you that but really all in all I'm really excited - for bringing this down the samang goes have all turned out amazingly well and you know the berry wipes I mean just big giant buds especially for the blood I know phenotype over there as I'm calling if I'm looking forward to kind of getting those going and keeping that alive for future Bruins for us to play with not really a lot of talked about really all we've been really doing is flushing hard every single day and just keeping an odd sort of a watchful eye on the buds to make sure they're not collapsing or falling over ah check out Wednesday when we bring you the zone to upgrade and also zone three we'll be firing up in a week or

beer tubers and welcome to yet another Elgar you with me Peter the master profits they joined by me yes and this is really [ __ ] special because we splurged and got the entire Barry White set from a super system you so this is this is pretty crazy this was not cheap but this is some of the highly rated meat in the world which is you know is amazing I've had a couple of them at MVCC and I have two blueberry variant at its once a day last year down in Stuttgart and I think I've also had to bury Grand Cru but these are the 2019 vintages they were released last year and they still had one set left at mitla Buttershaw booze or did that - they had two until I bought this one and yes as far as I could understand they would use that I said 420 version and yeah and also we did a cuvette we blended them all to try and see how they like it very white Kermes and yeah it was a cheap it was like like $280 was it but you also got a class google who paid them a little but actually thinking about it for four bottles half liter bottles on the highest rated meat in the world okay but but but it's the same great wine and honey is really said to be more expensive okay well but I think so far what I've had from them has been worth it I think substitution and strains are like my favorite meat producers but let's just get into it we have a low to try so we're gonna start on the number one with it which is very white but I don't know if it's the first version of what it is since it's the one that's just called very white but I talked to Jeff from the from the meter II and he told me like they're all made with vanilla beans and loads of these different fruits and then a secret ingredient of a chocolaty flavor - is it white chocolatey I think it's white chocolate buddy's a polka names or whatever it's if you read it's very white with a white chocolate so that white chocolate theme so but yeah the first one Barry White is raspberries so let's start over number one and they all look the same it's red oh you're red let's check out there's some small variance according to the queen of baby yeah it's not his specialty but he can tell there's a color difference yes Wow let's smell it dude I want to smell it wow there's a lot of raspberry it smells like you mix port wine and like a raspberry compote yeah yeah that one and I definitely got to get loads of vanilla and it is white chocolate yes maybe not we use sweeter and I can see that and they say bite enemy from like fruit skin like almost okey I don't get a lot of that a little bit I think we're more into many others like maybe the blueberry will have more thing but there's no making it of course we poured wines tobacco very nice sweet honey nuances yeah baby Schubert dark candy sugar you want track it's so decadent this reminds me of holy [ __ ] this reminds me of having pips metering it was the same ballpark like it's really decadent this is the first thing I thought is like you know wow the sacrament what's the prob it's like cordial and you mix with water - yeah and without the it gets very very intense but sweet and bit sound at the same time bitterness lots of raspberry lots of sweet fudgy like honey character and they like paint building candy sugar or something I'm getting and then what sometimes I think the the flavor has the list chocolatey vibes in the aroma but there's definitely like a generic chocolate s thing going on but yeah it is really good it's really remarking negative it is like you have super Drive you're heavier to like sweet stuff to like this if you do that like well it's also meat but it's it's almost every of you my mouth is sticking together yeah it reminds me of course we know raspberries yeah I'm a dessert wine yes like if you mix like port wine with raspberry compote and and Mead with some vanilla beans of stuff in there sides like just like really really decadent it's really really good maybe we actually Brecht got water glasses for us I think it's a very good so two number two number two which is blueberries I love me too but I think okay let's take out the boob everyone it looks you know almost the same it's that I can't see different maybe you can spot the difference of some of them are on the top yeah but it might also just be the glass but this I'm down to smell it let's do it it was much more panic in like booty like definitely man it's not less sweet yeah that's sweet more soft in if you can say that definitely more tobacco maybe like more like money is nose not me little mommy but like robust and rich smells like my tobacco and it smells like if you have an old tobacco can't was who has contained sweet tobacco and you just yeah yeah smells I know type sweet pipe today the vanilla and all but man's most decadent as well a bit more boo-boo the smell I don't think so they're all we forgot to mean to maybe be but 13 and a half percent let's try a blueberry white wow what a difference much more like mellow and tanning and dark fruity and like but also blueberries compared to raspberries they don't have as much light no yes I agree this was much more flavorful but because this is much more balanced yeah yes I taste like again like building candy sugar I taste vanilla I think I almost ate a more of a chocolate thing on this too and then I get has loads of this like fruit it tobacco as we put the chocolate more chocolate taste it's a good thing is what you say when the fruit is not so powerful tested the chocolate it's crabtastic no give it some weight yeah it's really nice I love that like again candy sugar honey flavor it's almost like a candy honey with the ordem I think yeah the honey and Chuck that shines here yeah and a bit of a mellow blueberry and I yeah and the tenant kind of blueberries games I mean like almost like okay I think it's a bit like more dry really good yeah good so we're actually doing this quite fast but it's also actually the first review of the day well you've had a couple beers well yeah but next one is blackberry white so blackberries instead Oh blueberries and vice versa tea number three so this is this one and again it's you know color is dark ruby red yeah whatever it looks a little more brownish no than this one oh wow haha that might be my favorite so far it's reminds of the government like poison bear marmalade boysenberry it's almost like boysenberry like I was thinking this is more acidic but it smells like this one is like the most tart and bright and this is like mellow and this almost smells like a mix of the two I think this will be the most charred berries maybe it smells like really deep black various like almost it reminds me of having like but like a black bear I said Blackburn marmalade on pancakes connect very pleased to meet Ben here you will grasp from these two people will shine more but this lack burgers after also a little less taste in the raspberry do you think so yeah if you change the Blackbird oh yeah raspberry yeah I'm hosting it's a blackberries more sour and not so flavorful as a raspberry my opinion let's try it man Cheers mmm oh it's really good it's like sharper detail yeah more sure it's like it's got more depth than the regular Barry white because it's blackberry I feel like and I like that it's got a little bit of this sharp tartness I think this is my favorite so far because a lightly acidity to cut the sweetness yeah it's got a really nice kick of acidity and it has the same kind of tobacco vibes in like vanilla and like again all I miss like fruity tobacco it also has like a little bit of a almost like oxidized sherry port thing on all of them as well this one includes the conclusive but it's more like missile city is it combination like singing bright but also like darker and richer yeah again this had like these two mix I think this has some great notes the grant will like grapes grapes cube yeah lieutenant yeah I'm also getting maple syrup on this one yeah may provide them a little yeah wine red wine yeah range note that's really good [ __ ] they're all really there's so there's so so far this is my favorite thing surprising yeah I thought it would be one of my favorites so let's move on to the strawberry white state fresh daily strawberries gonna be the season Jam it's awesome so it's a palest of the bunch I think this is also the Brahmas Brown I think maybe all that Brown dark color I'm not sure because I know I mean a lot of them easy also use building candy sugar to give it a bit more den so I'm not sure if they doing this one but yeah won't you know whatever might misspelling you remember as a kid it have you ever had of course you have my mom would often get us that for dessert but the pecs you could buy a premade it reminds me so much of that because it has like this dense you know what strawberry if you have fresh berries in the summer put them up and then sugar and then in the bulb Bajada no water they have a strawberry sugar water yeah exactly it smells so Danish actually smells like Danish summer in a glass but it has some notes beside that I mean it's just strawberries I think though this one might be the most like plain very forward of the bunny hop I think there's other other complexities but this is one is probably the most forward in terms of strawberries yeah kind of like the same level of raspberry or maybe even more but yeah I could see that too that was one of the queen of babies nose or brick have an oasis but yeah it's really good not so much of the tobacco tobacco wah-hoo mommy oh no it's actually quite different than the other it's more simian bright but it smells great let's get some strawberry action going Cheers oh yeah that's like one pure work was without milk Wow it has some musty notes yes slightly it's almost like the seeds of the strawberry yeah that's right it's really rich it's sweeter than I expected but narrowly but on the back end it has some technican sums yeah it's some of these guys I actually I didn't expect to like this one as much as the others Britt says it's dry yes yeah that's right it's I think it's the driest of the bunch he's a dry fruit yeah I don't think it's much as I cook like that I'd like a good amount of like dark food I I agree I think it's the best one I really like this one too but the BlackBerry just read it I think mine is blackberry raspberry strawberry blueberry mine is blackberry blueberry strawberry raspberry to see from raspberries favorite it's just because I prefer their other berries over my cherries I like raspberries with genders but we got a bonus we made the Barry White Grand Cru is it from the beginning hmm so this is an equal blend of all four Barry White's from 2019 if it's gonna be a mishmash or if it's gonna be amazing we'll find out right now the smelling oh it's so maple syrup yelling like really maybe have some maple syrup spike really maple surcharge but I'm not so Sydney - no it's more just like you did a forest berry compote it's most like Scoville I think it's not like as distinct throws all the other of course because it's a blend [Music] it's actually really good but it's more like middle yeah because everything is mixed I feel like it tastes like skull Bell forest Berry but it's a bit subdued because nothing really gets to shine no but I think it's fine because as an equal blend cuz I think if we did a blend where there'd be a little bit more strawberry than the others for example the strawberry would dominate Tony says they are so pronounced on the fruit flavors I think you need if you want to do the cuvette equal parts of all I think the cuvette is nice but I think that might prefer them on their own yeah so yeah it's really nice too though but it's just more of a generic as far as berry flavor where's the other I like to pronounce mess up the others it also has like the dark for it has loads of maple that one but far this is like diabeetus town but it's stronger I mean I'm trying to decide which one you like the most of it yeah I mean for me it's obviously the difference the difference your English language lover good today I don't know why are you turning tomorrow hmm oh yeah I love the blackberry that is that's almost like a cinnamon vibe on the blackberry too for me I think actually the strawberry one it's the least one I like the least it has support filled for me I don't know what it is actually the blueberry yeah it's still go with the blackberry and then blueberry raspberry and strawberry I think I will impair the strawberry is yeah there's some some off note for me I think it's some kind of dusty don't like it it's just reminding a childhood having yeah reminded but while they're big but fantastic muskiness jacketed stuff decadent stuff I mean if you you need to be in the mood for like something yeah if you drink all these five on your own you're you're gonna have diabetes like Spears we do almost drinking a bottle each today but yeah it's it's really nice for me as I say I said the blackberry the blueberries and strawberries in raspberry and my DS favorite is the Grand Cru even though it's all really nice as for grades I think we're gonna go to 98 on blackberry white and like 97 on blueberry 96 on yeah I'll do a 96 on both strawberry white and very white and then 95 for the kool-aid because I don't want to go below 95 or any of them because I think this is [ __ ] world class me they are world class and this one again 98 from the highest grade I've ever given to me I'll agree no chance for it was really good and number two was the blueberry one for me I think I'll go 90 and the raspberry one yeah also 97 95 for the what did you say 400 for the strawberry one we're gonna try to make their own version with dingleberries loads of earthiness even if offers we can make it right now I'm sure but this is yeah this is an amazing set if you want like a really fun decadent media experience you should really try and give some some Barry White some of the best meat I've had yeah I haven't had that much compared to good craft beer of course but it's just for me really really high up there and we're not the only people who think it so I mean online and people rave about this but yeah the winner from firfer just Michael and I is definitely yeah and we did this in 20 minutes I'm pretty impressed actually you're Michael in from pants no okay so yeah the winner definitely would like Barry White really good stuff if you guys had a chance to try any of the variants lives when we saw them especially also the grand cru that was pre blended it's been like barely seen everything be fun to hear thoughts on that as always we've got scribed over the Facebook fan page and Twitter and Instagram in terms of you enjoyed admitted noon a special review this is just a random Elko review but hey that is so they were gonna say cheers in our favorite yes numbers to reading for you and you

a call to action but a love is more than just the sum of his parts it's an energy we all have straight from our hearts and radiates from everything you'll fit in on picked flowers April showers sunrises sunsets even over something greater than the power of just one it's a force of nature so magical so enveloping so empowering that it knocks you to your knees or back up onto your feet that has the power to make lasting change in all who come into contact with it radiating from within and throughout plaza with no deals unconditional no ifs no buts encircling human I'm physically undable spring you got this I got you and I will love you with all my heart [Music] the second poem was about laughs in the 21st century so love as a as a marketable product basically a mass-produced product it's called don't screw up don't throw it away screw it up throw it away clear the dance next like mass-produced fashion replaceable and straight off the rack calling for fast love after midnight you know I'll never call you back screw it up thread away clear the decks next plastic fantastic reality bites on the dating conveyor belt sure seems like a numbers game with so many party tricks you think I'll change my mind by sending me your dick pics what happened to those lovers of New Balances of alms not this styrofoam plastic lidded take away those that leaves me feeling cold screw it up throw it away clear the decks next so many the same so here's the game never shot when hungry for eating never fall in love when your heart's taken a beating some of the best advice that I have heard like actions speak louder than a remarketing repackaged and regurgitated wouldn't screw it up throw it away three days next [Music] wait on the last poem and it's called an ode to an I'm sure you've all met an in your life I'm not saying that all men that are some women are too but this was written about Abbot's inner from that haven't failed romance last summer [Music] may your genitals itch like wildfire may the heat for the day Jenny too much like the last rotten melon in the garden it may every deceitful deceptive word you say turn to dust on your tongue may you be too stupid to see that it's actually you behind the dramas the mirrors and the a huge 80 pus-filled boils sprout up mopping and fizzing and elephants may you have the breath of a camel and body fungus in there many of them are hard to its place [Music] may your teeth ache so badly that is so hard for you to think may it turn you to drink in your rising fetid stink may your words have no power and turn to dust now

here um I got some good news for all you subscribers of mine today is Saturday I'm bored I just got back home with some good flour so I thought I would do Chris stabs one of the official reasons I did this channel is the strain reviews I'm gonna do a Barry White strain review I purchased this lovely product at my local friends at the pot shop in Cambridge so yes he hooked me up good time he is a killer person I love my cat the pot shop he is awesome he sponsored my YouTube channel he was one of the first sponsors of Chris dads he is the first sponsor Girl Scout cookies sovereign extracts yes so thanks to my cat the pot shop for that and thanks to him for this lovely flower I don't know man that [ __ ] the window in my video it's like right directly behind me I hate that so sorry guys bear with me so I always watch my other friends on YouTube the people who I get my ideas from and stuff and I always have nice big fat Cola buds to do the reviews on the couple weed reviews I did do they're on little tiny nugs I didn't have a lot of it so I went out and I purchased a quarter of two climbs a week 3.5 13.5 the other I'm doing my review on this I chose the one kind to do my review on because ten tenten I have a nice cold bud of very white is so beautiful guys I wish you guys were here to check it out with me so we're gonna do this review like always in four categories looks smell taste effects or hi and then we'll give it a couple of minutes and we'll go back and we'll give it a overall 1 out of 10 rating so to dive right in ever since I purchased this I could just smell it as soon as it came out just thinking I usually like to bring my jar oh my jars got other weed in it usually I put it in that and I smell it right I'm gonna break the snug a chunk off of it oh it's the smell the look is what I'm looking at the look to me it looks really good now it could have been trimmed a little tiny bit better but because them leaves are purple they chose to leave them in you guys can't really see the leaves they're purple like that one right there anyways but the hairs are like crazy the the weed itself is a a green and then it's got a lighter green with purple on the leaves and the hairs are red it's big nubs the whole ounce he had was awful nugs like this so and it's super dry there's no moisture in it so but it doesn't have that strong of a smell huh that's weird so for looks I'm going to have to give it a 8 out of 10 so [ __ ] like there's trichomes everywhere so looks 8 out of 10 so then the smell so it's not quite a hundred percent the smell that I was like I was hoping when I researched it it said it was a stinky strain but I broke a piece off there it smells good smells a little bit skunky you do get that it's a does smell a little bit like hey well finding a little I don't know if it's pine or like berry tint oh man I can't wait to try this with you guys so I gave it a 8 out of 10 on looks I gave it I'll give it a 7 out of 10 on smell because it really doesn't smell that much so before I break that up and we roll a little joint when we smoke it together I'm gonna quickly let you know what Leafly says about Barry White spare with me for 10 seconds here Barry White is a hybrid strain that is the offspring of parents of near celebratory status in the cannabis world blueberry and white widow Berry is a famous in its own rights for even for berry is famous in its own right for its Eve whatever the [ __ ] that means for its even in balanced effect that offers relaxation from stress and anxiety along with a sense of euphoria this stress is this strain is perfected for in springing and upbeat moods in May to conservation and creativity the plant flower has a light sour berry and point smell and a fresh taste similar to their scent they generally have a strong blue coloring contrasts by orange hairs so so so relaxed happy euphoric uplifting hungry easy to grow I don't know what to tell you guys but there it is wasn't much on there usually there's a lot more so Barry White is made from the genetics parents of Barry White is blueberry cush and white widow so with that being said let's cut up a little nug and roll a little joint and see how it tastes go along with the next part so we got an eight and a seven now the long reason they gave it a seven is because it kind of looks like the weed that me and my buddy had that tasted like mold and then it doesn't if it I really hope it doesn't taste like mold well there you go low battery I knew something was gonna happen my first weed video and mom didn't even have the tablet charts but quickly cutting this up I don't like to use scissors but I haven't yet got a grinder I know they're not that expensive I got a plug-in Zing's in my column but I find they kill your crystal and blah blah blah so with I like collecting Keith though so maybe I will start using the zing zing just to have some Keef maybe someday we'll do a Keef review Keef is the crystal he powder substance that collects off your plant people call it crystal it's actually called Keith key \u00ebif so enrolling this Barry White I do notice some of the purple or blue hairs through your knocking you can't really see this camera sucks I'm sorry guys hope you guys can bear with me and know that Chris tabs is going to get eventually better camera and better you know edit my videos and put the links instead of holding piece of paper out and instead of telling you I really don't like using player's papers but that's all I have so without further ado cheers baptize it and I'm gonna like this Barry White and see if we can explain the taste to you guys oh man right off the bat first thing you taste and I'm not joking blueberries taste sometimes the first taste I got you think that's a good saw you don't that's a fatty so one of my subscribers asked me if I could smoke a whole joint in one lung fall so maybe that will be my first Chris dabs challenge because I'm not ever doing a gram dab because that's a waste I'm not rich if somebody sponsors the gram and gives it to me I'll do it oh my gracious you do taste pauline but it's more of a berry and a citrusy taste that tastes really good guys very white a hybrid blueberry and white widow man that's phenomenal the taste that it almost it's very tasteless like it's you can barely taste anything which is weird like I like this we know what there's like a little bit of berry taste when I first lit it when you first suck but on exhaling it's not ours it's not pungent it's not earthy it's just a little bit piney a little bit of berry and that's about it now like I said it's really hard to review weed with just smoking it in a joint you got to like have a bomb I got a bomb I'm cleaning it out now I'll have a weed bong-soon and I'm sorry guys I promised you guys that I would buy my bongs and stuff the money I just spent was supposed to go for my bongs and then but I'm just going to take the money out of my check in April at the end of the month in April I'm just gonna take 50 bucks and get my bongs in my torch so that way I can give a better taste I got a weed pipe a little glass one but it's so hard to get going and get lit and it's higher so it tastes the oil and stuff right oh the we like all you taste is arsonists through a pipe so I don't like smoking me through a pipe a handheld pipe this joint though I like it's great but the flavor like there's this it's it's very which is kind of good like it's not a very strong odor it's not a very strong taste it's more like a mild taste I'm not saying it's not gonna get you cooked I'm already feeling it right I'm three-quarters way into this joint well I will be honest with you guys I will give you an honest review of what I think but really I shouldn't be doing my weed reviews its unless it's first thing in the morning or after supper because Chris dabs why do you think I'm called Chris dabs I do dabs a lot so therefore when I smoke flour in the middle part of the day I don't get [ __ ] in the morning and at the end I get baked I don't get a lot of high and now so if I smoke it and I get high now I'll know it's really good hence why I'm doing it I just promised you guys I'd do more videos and it's like I want to I get these good products and then they're gone right so stay tuned again later today I will be doing another review on the pot shop and the solver and pen I have a new tip today so I thought I'd do another video a collab kind of like I'll put my t-shirt on the pot shop I'll have my pot shop coffee mug it's kind of like you know saying thanks to them for hooking me up with stuff to review on my channel you know what I mean like if it wasn't for them guys I wouldn't have as much as I do oh he gave me some cool posters a gear PO like a banner to put on my wall for my studio I still got a lot to go I got to get my own place and I gotta find other banners and posters weed related I'm a movie freak so there's all kinds of movies and stuff nowadays shows and stuff that I would really like to have posters and stuff up so a few months of collecting and I will have a studio my own place I'll be back with you guys would be able to finally meet mrs. dabs my wife well my fiancee who I love very much and my two boys so yeah I'm booked on this joint and I have to say for to be honest I gave it a an 8 for looks I gave it a 7 4 smell I gave it a 4 taste I gave it a 7 and for how I'm gonna give it the effect hi I'm gonna give it I'm not giving an 8 and then that will take it all the way to 8 out of 10 overall I know I said I'd give you a few minutes and feel the effect but I don't know how long I'm gonna be able to record this video for it's going 15 minutes strong but I did like five minutes ago get the 15 minute warning so I don't know what to tell you guys I really was looking forward to [ __ ] tank stinky big huge bad like that but hey maybe it's a creeper you know I'm baked I gave a native of 10 you're not gonna find stuff like that on the street but like Chris stabs to spoil he smokes primo gear I pay $60 for seven grams like who does that mean because I want good [ __ ] so this is phenomenal I will keep buying it but I need to get different ways to smoke it I'm cooked right so it is what it is it would have probably got a 9 out of 10 or more but you can't give it a 9 out of 10 because I have a point system right so I'd rather go right by the book so for only smoking the tire like a normal little joint that's a nice [ __ ] bud that's a nice bud know if you guys can tell her or not but I would definitely say I smoked for Grandma shatter in a day so if I can roll a little tiny pin like a 0.3 joint come out here point three point for joint nice joint if I can roll that I can get cooked like this it is creeping up and you know what I mean if I can get cooked like this you guys out there who don't smoke the [ __ ] out of shatter if you just smoking weed you're crazy like I thought my sponsor only had two types of weed currently it's got four or five they look good oh yes speaking of which that was very white I can show you what just what the gummy bear cost looks like now I find this as stuff is a little bit better I'm gonna do a couple quick close-ups with my phone take some snapshots and post them on Facebook later for you guys to see that's gummy bear push phenomenal man so there's gummy bear Kush there's white with no gummy bear course blackberry Kush Barry White and tuna og or super tuna the pot shop five 909 highway one Cambridge there Chris tabs

fire it's an indica and it has 87% of THC very white and I already say why and it talks about very white basically it says another powerful indica dominant strain very white certainly does not disappoint he offers a classic indica profile that is complemented with a slight hint of berry and other fruity notes overall the effects are well balanced and excellent for easing anxiety and stress or for inspiring creativity and mood and I already have hid this and I can honestly say like it's like it has me very relaxed very relaxed it can definitely taste the berry like ah like overpowering

big big advocate for that and the rumor is that the reason and it's a it's pretty much straight from Coach darlings rumor is the reason he actually quit coaching was John Moore if I will them ever lost John Martin cry for three days and that right there if that don't if I don't touch you heart that's that was the biggest fan ever that's it really was they said that at the Bear Bryant museum that he actually the people would come to see John Mark there that he could actually tell stories of the different setups they had at the at the Museum and you that because they said the tenants at the Museum just significantly higher he knew how to draw a crowd I was like to watch him with the sidelines when his dad was was out there on the field it was just oh and it was just so much fun

my videos thank you for taking the time to watch them I also want to welcome all the new YouTube subscribers Twitter followers and Instagram followers to the family let's get right to it in this video I'm gonna tell you about the very white stream that I picked up from harvest and Tallahassee I paid $50 for this 8th and it came in at 20 point 24 percent THC green and purple buds with orange hairs and decent amount of trichomes this 8th weighed 3 point 59 grams this strange flavor and smell was pretty much the same on both that was a combination of berry pine and arable I'll do the effects I had extremely high hopes for this training Whitewood was one of my top five all-time favorite strains so when I saw it in this strange linear I literally just order it right away way to Fred and tried it then it turns out to be great flavor with supplement effects yeah sup man I didn't feel completely relaxed from the effects kicked in calm my excit went away but stress was able to trigger my mood swings it did know my pain from about a 6 to 5 but that's it that's why I called it something ethics plus they weren't in your face effect either I don't know with white wood on the zinnias and after trying gingerbread man and I was expecting more so i dubbed this one the strain that could but then can i work on this train yes but I wasn't supposed to this is a strain I picked for last week's sleep in into work relaxation which ended up being quickly replaced by different dispensaries are so I will not be getting this train again so I will not be using this train anytime of the day or

Barry White got me high [Music]", "bIKO3xCveFE": "hey sugar geeks lives here again today we're making a berry Chantilly cake my copycat recipe from Whole Foods sorry Whole Foods but I need to have this all year round coming up next on the sugar geek show alright so I have about a 1/2 cup of my berry filling you can also use raspberry filling whatever whatever filling you like I'm gonna add about a teaspoon maybe 1/2 a teaspoon of orange extract or you can use a teaspoon of Grand Marnier just gives it a little extra flavor mmm smells good okay so let's go ahead and make our frosting I've got some cream cheese and some butter and mascarpone cheese so good at room temperature if you didn't remember to bring this to room temperature then you can cut them into chunks and just like leave them underneath a warm bowl for five minutes and they will be at room temperature so I'm just gonna blend this together until it's nice and smooth and then I'm gonna add in my powdered sugar so I probably shoulda did this in a bigger bowl but you know I'm just gonna live my life I added a little bit of powdered sugar if you find that your frosting is like not coming together and it's curdling you could have over mixed it so that's why I'm doing it with the hand mixer it just feel like it's a little less intense of a mixing process and once you add the powdered sugar in and it's creamy just stop so we added our vanilla in just get that mixed together and we're done and just to answer those inevitable questions of is this frosting good to use in the heat the answer is no no you cannot put cream cheese and mascarpone cheese in the heat it's just just don't okay so now I have my beautiful cream cheese frosting here I'm going to add that to my whipped cream Oh and then we're just gonna fold so folding is just running your spatula like underneath and then folding it over that's literally why it's called folding and what this does is it just makes sure that you don't totally deflate your whipped cream because it's delicate it doesn't have to be completely completely folded just because the more you mix whipped cream the you know stiffer it gets oh that looks beautiful actually so this is the southern Chantilly cream version Chantilly cake and that's not what we're doing we're not doing that right now we're stacking a cake so I've got my vanilla cake here that's freshly baked super soft like mmm so good you can get my vanilla cake recipe are on sugar geek show.com slash recipes it's the vanilla cake recipe from scratch EO all right thin layer of our berry jam oh yeah then a nice big scoop of the mez car pony cheese filling mm-hmm seriously it's so excited to eat this cake this is just like my life now making things that I want to eat yeah a pregnancy so now I'm gonna layer up some berries in here and really you want to kind of leave them whole because when you cut berries they start to drip and get gooey but if you have really big berries like really big strawberries you might have to just cut them in half cut the little top off here and then slice it straight in half and then put the cut side down so it's kind of like being secured by the cream all the doors in there put this guy on top and I like to tort my layers which means to just literally slice in half lengthwise I do it on the turntable but you could definitely do it off the turntable I just kind of eyeball my knife going you know in the halfway mark and we're just going to keep going until it cuts all the way through don't force it let the knife do the work oh yeah all right some more of our berry filling [Music] [Music] laughs lair [Music] okay so now I'm gonna frost the outside of this guy with some more of this supersoft frosting that's funny when I was researching and Chantilly a cake I was like what is this Chantilly cake tastes like like is it some sort of fancy you know French term Chantilly turns out that Chantilly is just the place that the cream was invented and Chantilly cream is literally just whipped cream sorry to burst your bubbles it sounds fancier if you say Chantilly though Sean today I nailed it I know it I'm just gonna basically do a crumb coat and then I'm gonna put this into the freezer for maybe 30 minutes or so because I just really want this to kind of almost half freeze before I try to cut this otherwise it's gonna be a mess so same process probably not necessary unless you're like super anal like I am the slices must be perfect okay so this has been chilling for about an hour in the fridge because the freezer was not big enough but it's fine it's still perfectly chilled and nice and firm so now we're going to cover this and our final layer of the mezcal pone a cream cheese frosting mmm we're just going for a rustic look I don't think this is the type of cake that you really worry about getting super sharp edges that's just for eating and just enjoying so none of those comments like I put all that work into that cake you're just gonna eat it just can't stand the sides not to be strict it bugs me okay you guys like how I have arguments with myself I'm like you just have to be rustic and then I just like don't make it rustic this is what it's like to be in Liz Marik's brain all right one more smooth I'm not gonna worry about the top oh all right so now we're going to just decorate with some fresh berries you could go all the way around but you know typically it's just sort of like half so I'm just starting with my like large berries this is like true bakery style cake decorating right here guys when I was learning to bake in pastry school we weren't even allowed to use food coloring that was like not natural so you could never color anything like super bright neon colors because everything that you put on the outside of the cake was supposed to reflect what was on the inside of the cake so it's kind of fun to just sort of like do something that's kind of classic like that dee-licious hmm put a couple mint sprigs in there okay can we eat this so far my favorite part I get to eat the cake so that's it guys that's everything you need to know about making a delicious berry Chantilly cake go forth make one eat one thank me later I'll see you guys next week five oh yeah", "9TBaWwhWpq0": "how do you pronounce Lafley you talks laughs Lee mmm slackly look like a little lazy sailor trying to

Louis Missouri not too far away from here our County Market stores are lucky enough to carry some of the seasonal varieties yeah now if you don't see one of these located in your local County mark you always go to the customer service desk and request it but I've seen this white lager and a lot of different stores as well as the pale ale those are two pretty standard ones this one is pretty exciting so we got the maryberry ale which I haven't tried before but I love berry beers so I'm kind of excited to try these very raspberry and Blackberry mm-hmm so we'll start up for this one since yeah let's do it at the Troy Oh inspired by the sweet flavors of a French pastry okay good st. Louis's French whatever its beer yeah but is red we're getting the light Dale the bubbles off the bottom mmm almost looks like champagne ooh it's got a lot of berry flavors too and really good it's really crisp even a little bit citrus coming into it balances really well with the hops so you're getting that the tart from the berries and that richness from the hops and yeah now on most burials that have had it's really really light mmm this one is like bold it's cool I would call it thick mm-hmm thick with flavor so yeah that's really what robust that's awesome Oh what I'm drinking around the Christmas tree so Mary vary a lot about of 5 mm-hmm I'm gonna give that a four and a half yeah I'm looking for an Afghan that's that's special release beer again you can only get it during a little bit of time so grab it while you can it really talks to me cuz I would pick up a whole lot of beers that have blueberry and raspberry and Blackberry mm-hmm awesome six percent alcohol did you get pastry out of it I'm sure we'll try the modernist up now this is supposed to be your standard unfiltered white lager mm-hmm which is what we like you'd see how cloudy it is [Music] I'm a minister Leslie be right in the flame oh wow it's just some a tad more bitter yeah it's it's an awesome beer so golden is kind of like the flavor that would give to it like use RIT sweet and it's not too hoppy yeah golden now the merry burial I noticed was 15 on the IBU and the white lager is 20 so it's just a step up not the pale ale we're gonna try that's 25 yeah so many different isn't - yeah that's an easy everyday beer yeah so out of five again four and a half yeah I'm surprised by those so I like lagers but normally I would drink something flavored above it but this has a really really good rich taste it's clean and it's well done all right last up The Pale Ale smooth balanced and copper-colored with a mild mildly spiced I've had two glasses of beer now in tradition I don't like my beer spicy yeah so if you had to describe a beer as a spiced I don't know tend to stay away from it not to Piney though no matter I don't like Pale Ales or any pills or any of those this listens not not bad no I get rounded it's it's well rounded words would you use balanced mm-hmm made with love no off-putting flavors and couldn't drink a lot of them I think they get heavy right out of five what do you think on this one this one I would just go for I'm gonna drop it probably down into a three and a half again the more happiness and the less likely I am to drink it so those three that we tried today I would say for something different I would say the merry very ill yeah for a beer that would drink say five or six seven and nine three probably the lager easily I agree to ball guys eat stuff and talk about it", "V6NVnKFyY24": "[Music] the night away here right here [Music] do not do this stole music straw then I'll play all [Music] [Music] what [Music] Oh little blue [Music] a true Oh [Music] Oh but the news [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] music by the way [Music] Oh little boy [Music] [Music] Oh Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music]", "fagk_N9xIEs": "[Music] little [ __ ] [Music] [Music] bugs [Music] i almost smoke nothing but white fries [Music] you", "MGNZ5st5fhs": "dr. chica Aris tickets her pram Cannizzaro Barry White medical school did you missed Omaha doctor home at dr.

Powerade ultra beverages these were a dollar each it Kroger I have the white cherry the mixed berry and citrus blast so what makes these ultra as we got a cool bottle white cherry it's is flavored with other natural flavors zero sugar sports drink it has 50% more electrolytes I think that's what makes it ultra it's a BCAAs creatine zero calorie with vitamins b3 b6 and b12 it's made by the coca-cola company and so I guess the 50% more electrolytes is because we need electrolytes I'm assuming people who work out that sweat over look at working out as well so this is a white cherry the sit around sweating whatever you might do your sweat a lot like a Reaper though flavors though like a beard it's white cherry yeah maybe a little bit you get it but it's for salty yeah it's different it's a very light very very light cherry and yeah it's just it's light it's not like your full cherry beverages maybe the other parents ain't saving as strong as all the time and I love to read well I like the white cherry yeah the white chair yeah we did a review on the white cherry power right I think it wasn't zero but just it's just not very strong this is on that I would get again I don't remember what we said on that video it may not have been strong either about but this is just if you're comparing this to a different I guess a sugary drink or most of the sports drinks yeah it just doesn't have a lot of flavor but it doesn't a lot of saltiness to it this is the mixed berry same ingredients as the other one do you get the salting - no but I'm not bothered by us all I don't know whether but you just taste it now that is that yes the the mixed berry it has it tastes more like I am like a boy raspberry I like this little sucker freeze pops away yeah it's like a boy freeze yeah kind of tastes like that it's image destroyed right it's nice strong or sweet but out of the two I would ten times that's actually at least that has some flavor at least that has something that you can taste yeah this is just a disappointing muscles about you Jay this is the citrus blast I just barely I like that one I think that would be I think on a hot day I really can see that being good I think even with a I know you're supposed to get them cold and they've been in the refrigerator but I think that really really really go I see going crazy I yeah I can imagine this is like an icy flavor that's what it does seems like you would be very good in like a slushy Tibor yes pleasure this type thing go out on a really hot day I think that would be delicious I don't really care for cause it's got tartness to it though well it reminds me of lemonade it reminds me of the old woman old original gate array oh except it's not a shop I'm happy reminds me of the old school come through the gate rig oh yes I loved it okay take that gum and scalp about about ten times I can see that yeah but see I loved like yo man I used to buy that game all the time I liked it I liked that strong flavor out of these three though I think the mixed berry is gonna be your best bet like I said the citrus for me is not bad I didn't used to it yeah I don't think that's bad at all but I do like the mix bearing the best and I would skip the white cherry it's just if you're looking for a strong cherry flavor this is not where you want to go but for zero calorie drinks I think these are very very good yeah more on the try for a dollar those are eggs better it's 20 ounces and it was a dollar that's still like they're just the original zero power it's better you J okay yeah I think that I think these are worth a try absolutely true especially if you care about your electrolytes if you're watching stuff like that then this will probably really appeal to you so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "K6hFqTccHdM": "hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to five weeks of flower sorry the videos a bit late but well getting it up to you anyway as you can tell things have been going well on the sativa a ladies especially the super tall lady she's gonna be taking a little bit longer for sure in terms of getting her action on I compared to her sisters we've got some very nice large buds beginning to for him on some of these Barry White's over here a lot of work to be done I haven't really done anything cleaning out on the plants I have not cleaned out the bottoms I have not really done a lot of defoliation on these it's been a kind of crazy couple of weeks and I just haven't really had a time to get to the chores at least in that regard for doing them especially with you know breaking down some of the other plants in zone 2 but starting tomorrow we're gonna get in here I'm actually thinking I'm gonna make an update video there I'm doing some of the choice that we're gonna do in the garden tomorrow we're gonna clean out some of the bottoms obviously come through we're gonna do some reinforcing of certain branches using some of our new handy dandy twist tag crap a little bit of selective defoliation I mean obviously some of these big leaves in here we'll take some of those out to open up stuff within the plant like that you see what I'm saying keep the things to keep it a real you know I'm very very but not bad for five weeks though these some angles are looking very nice very very nice indeed nice lovely buds starting to stack in terms of what we're seeing on there these could easily be nine or ten week runners we will see our Barry White's or our Santi ladies as it were definitely gonna be running may be maybe 10 or 11 but we're again we're gonna wait till we get a little bit later on in order to judge some of those track chrome colors just to see sort of really what's going on there so this will be the biggest in terms of update videos but we will be showing you all the different toys we're going to come through and do tomorrow we've been kind of letting the plants to a hardcore dry out slowly but surely they're getting there they should be nice and bone dry by tomorrow and then we'll come back in and do a nice heavy feed there as you can see we've got some natural draw happening on there we could have fed a little heavier earlier on on some of the plants she is just such a sturdy tall lady it's intense she towers over me ladies and gentlemen but again having these natural Zappos happen not a big deal some of the SAP boats that were happening earlier on on the other plants were caused by the fact that we were doing our experiment of trying to go right into soil we had just flushed it's proven doable and all right obviously not desirable at the end of the day but it's what's happening on Wednesday of this week we're gonna be getting sown - all set up and fired back up there and that's gonna begin the pink push experiment every one that's right we're gonna be rocking and rolling those sexy super rooting pink pushes so that'll be fun - let's see if we can get you some good shots here these berry whites are showing you this to make the ladies it's obviously another some angle lady over here doing our thing I've got to still play with this light and kind of get it more like that that'll be on the to-do list tomorrow we position a few the lights their butts get some really nice big chunky funking buds going on on here there's the odd cat hair floating through here hey it's a side effect of having a little cat that I love we definitely got some leaf curling happening on this one here I'm not overly worried about us one of the things I have noticed with these Barry White's especially is that they do not seem to like how cold I've been letting it get at night so that's gonna be something going forward we're going to be watching there the relative humidity on its own was maintaining fairly well with the AC but it was getting a little bit too cold especially at night so we're switching over to at lights out firing up the dehumidifier keeping those temperatures up a little bit at night the samang goes haven't really been having an issue with it but the Barry White's well they are not ladies who are seeming to live that chill factor it's been two days now since we've been watching the temps at night and making sure that they're not going super crazy on us and well my gloomy thief working very nicely now they're really starting to kind of change and show a greater bulk ability being built within the reach it ease themselves but anyway everybody thank you for tuning in to this channel really enjoyed the Sunday night livestream with everybody last Sunday there yesterday it was

got a little bit of feed there that we're gonna vacuum up there with a little shop batch remember all those of you out there the shop vac is your friend getting a little shot back there wet vac is gonna make your life a thousand times easier since a couple of days ago we made the video talk about the chores I still haven't cleared out the bottoms yet so that's still left to do but we'll get around to that but as you can tell though we're getting some really nice swelling starting to happen and on a lot of these nugs this gorgeous gorgeous big sexy buds going on these Sam angles are looking really really nice oh yes and then DeBary whites are doing really well this is a really big tall berry white here then Wow well go over to the other side of show you some other ones I'm that one plan that for a long time as I go it must have been a very white game the way it's growing it's hard to tell I mean the pistil colors on the two plants are fairly similar and I'm trying to smell them to compare them this doesn't smell like Barry White it actually smells more like the samang goes so this actually may have just been more of a sat Dom phenotype of the samang go in the end we're gonna watch and see how it finishes out in comparison to these girls and then in comparison to the Barry White's but Mike will need three guys on beat both going on on beat Barry laughs to tell you tons of curling a lot of that is typically caused just from whites for us I'm not really worried about it some people would freak out I don't personally care it's going just fine and we're getting some nice big buds going on and then this tall lady my goodness you know I'm saying but yeah in terms of chores that we need to do in terms of these plants one I've pretty much decided which ones I'm going to take some monster crop clones up so we're gonna do that definitely gonna reinforce some more buds and do a little bit more tying up with our little sort of twist tack crap but overall it's just kind of you know continuously feeding in terms of trichrome coloration right now these could very well go to about 10 weeks it's hard to say whether we'll go nine ten he'll the Barry White some of those might even go to eleven given the sativa based nature of their genetics but simply put it's going really well just a few little chores here to do obviously being at six weeks if we're going nine we've got another week left to feed before we start flushing but like I said they very well may go ten we'll see what happens I mean I haven't actually checked the trichrome colors and the samang goes so that's another thing we got to go and do to sort of check that out but as you can tell though definitely got some nice trichrome actions going on definitely starting to get that classical swell and they're swelling like this at six weeks holy [ __ ] wait till you see them at the time they're done but yeah long story short short little update video not really a lot to share with you at the moment other than the fact that the titties are looking really good and I'm really happy with we're seeing beautiful kind of a berry smell kind of coming out of those Barry White's the samang goes have this kind of funky ass gunk a monkey bear a funky I don't even know quite how to describe it it'll be interesting to see how the nose on these samang goes takes by the time they're done but it's going really well I'm happy with it just lots of tying up to do basically in repositioning weed titties is the main thing there other than that though we're pretty much ready to rock and roll yeah overall though titties are looking good T's going will we're gonna be getting zone too fired up today and planted we're gonna do another video on that one so keep your eyes open for that one thank you

let's get started it's time for Oh okay everybody relax today is Scott Disick's 34th birthday happy birthday Scott he's spending his birthday time with his 19 year old girlfriend you recognize Bella Thorne if you what maybe you don't because when your kids watched her when she was on Disney you know remember she was going to shake it up with zendaya uh-huh uh-huh but all of a sudden she decides she wants to be bad and provocative and so now here she goes uh-huh that's 19 and like I said Scott is now 34 he's so dead wrong it's ridiculous they were all over each other at the pool in Kong if you're from Jersey they can look at them 19 father of three father of three he and Courtney never got married but certainly their boot up enough where something needs to be established so we divorce somebody gather like what are we doing and then even if you finish doing your divorce scooby-doo you don't get with a 19 year old when you're 34 there's something about that and yeah Courtney is 38 she was also in con if you're from Long Island you say can too flaunting her newest boyfriend don't call the cops he's hot he's 23 his name is the unit oh no I need you to see more of Eunice I mean you know when you're 38 years old mother of three like Courtney and you're seeing a model named Eunice he's something to snack on you know what I mean like you don't keep him and bring him around the kids and stuff but certainly there's nothing there's nothing wrong with a snack Courtney says she's just having fun so she's taking it in the spirit that I'm talking to you about it she's just having fun what's wrong with that at 38 why and for the guys watching I know what you're saying well Wendy why are you judging Scott he's 34 with a 19 year old but you're not judging Courtney in the same vein she's 38 with a 23 year old I don't know I'm a woman I'm allowed to be fickle that's it Eastside Scott has admitted that he's addicted to sex and drinking you know I I can't believe she's only 19 that's a hard 19 right Suzanne yeah so she definitely looks older yeah yeah that's all night yeah all day shake it up anyway look Bella is now starring in a show for ABC Family it's called famous and famous in love for the ABC Family Network is she very family-like trotting around the world with a 34 year old him grabbing her breasts by pull them luxuriating in one another's company Bella you want to be careful girl because it might be exciting for you wonder how 19 was you know the four year old man hit on you you know whether you jump and leap or not it's still like hmm I can see what my future is going to be if I can only escape this deadbeat town as a young Wendy I feel like this girl might be putting her job in jeopardy ABC Family it's a family show there's something a little Suzanne you're Jack and paint our ABC Family yes yes okay I don't know how but you're a little loose you work here yeah yeah what ad what picture if you still work someplace else yeah yeah it's like I used to work for Martha Stewart right who's my friend yes who's your friend Oh what my gosh the episode doesn't air until September but I was on their shelves Martha and Snoop best time ever they gave me the fake weed I showed you Oh what yeah no here my kids know I'm a little bit looser Martha is a bit more tight exactly but it's looser here and so I'm a little bit looser with my kids but I don't want them to watch any you know loose TV is she jeopardizing her job you're a TV executive you've been around I don't know I don't know I know I think she'll be okay maybe this one's not like after him maybe it's not going to last and then she got me she got to get it together I don't like it I didn't know well I'm just saying she's jeopardizing her job oh all right that's okay all right well let's talk about Barry White son Oh oh please it's going down his name is Darryl Oh and Darryl is suing his stepmom glodean with the nails yeah that's Darrell all right there glovies Oh Jimmy I need you're the first to the last to my everything on Zack as soon as we go to commercials I want everybody to our opinion audio so yes yes madam and happy birthday you cute with this she is so the back story is when Barry died back in 2003 and he died suddenly his money went to his second wife glodean glodean was so beyond said before Beyonce that glodean had her own but she was a background singer for Barry but she got so hot you know just for being buried main girl that she had her own background dances it was fabulous Barry White and what do you call the love unlimited rock yeah okay all right even though the boy Darryl and the stepmom have been estranged for years glodean allegedly promised Darryl to get to give him a fair share of the money and he agreed not to challenge the court system well all this given of the money lasted until 2015 and now Darryl saying glodean hasn't given him a dime and now he's nearly homeless he says and he's also claiming that glodean is using Barry's money to support her lavish lifestyle well I couldn't find ages on anybody as a matter of fact when you google very white the computer looks at you like [Music] mmm-hmm what you think you're gonna find honestly I have no idea how old glodean is I have no idea how old Darrell is Barry does have eight children though with two or possibly three women because the computer was like you need two or possibly three women but one of these women was definitely glodean and I don't know how many of Barry's children that she birthed but Barry died suddenly and you know yeah he should have updated his will but what the Alan Thicke of everything is going on but people die suddenly prince in the elevator at his own mansion people die suddenly and it's real easy to say you know update update update but it's real hard to do when you're in between meetings to pay for all this crap I can appreciate a woman taking care of herself when she gets older because I must tell you I love a man [Laughter] the way they smell the way they see I love a man button however I would not rely on anybody but me to take care of me at the end of the day you know and that's the way I was taught by my own mother and my mother loves my father they've been married for 65 thousand years you know there's only three of us kids and whatnot they still hold hands and all that mess but even my own mom that's where I learned it from aha and Betty Ford Ann those are the kinds of people and and shirley Chisholm and you know like growing up as a girl so men I am NOT a hater how all y'all doing so gloating is 71 well we did find her yeah we found her 871 new one they may just share yeah okay gloating is 71 that's not old but it's old enough now perhaps the money got funny in 2015 which is why that was the last check that the Darrel and the kids saw you know but I'm 71 years old I'm going to write a check for what I think I can afford to give to you a one time and one time only check and then please get to step in I mean no I take that back wait Darrell's her son right I don't even know if he's her son probably not her son but he's Barry son so she's a stepmom well a step is different from being a real mom sorry and Daryl get a job okay one of my favorite books is coming to TV I could not wait remember I talked to you about a summer reading I forgot what we went as a family but it was someplace where there was no TV so then you know you have to bring your books it takes you look three months to select them because you're looking to this big hey look I need it I need a TV what the Kevins don't care all that makes me start crazy so one of the books I've brought along on this particular vacation with Star Jones fictional book Satan's sisters the drama going on behind the scenes at the view Oh I mean a fictional talk so that you know that she's made up in her head so I am very excited because star came here if you watched our show enough then you know she was here maybe two years ago and she talked about how this book was being made into a TV series and I'm like drooling and salivating what the Barbara Walters played by Vanessa Williams is going on I can't breathe it's called daytime divas I have your sneak peak luxurious in this moment we're not i watch my back if I were you look girl I don't have a sitter ladies who don't play by the rules they get the ex consider yourself warned giveaways Miami dress was so tight you could see the stick up my ass I love daytime and they go low I go low [Music] okay I am done I think that I finally found this show that might replace for me Desperate Housewives I'll tell you I have not been as invested in a series since Desperate Housewives went up here oh sure you know I watch a scandal and I watch it you

"jWMOzoi6Unw": "yeah probably one of the most beautiful plants you can grow um another showpiece in your yard you will love it um it's it's got this intoxicating sort of aroma this look uh i love the multicolored flowers they have a they get frosty white on top and then they graduate down to a light pink and then a deeper pink they are a long-lived perennial year after year after year come back they have sturdy stems which are great if you want to do cut flowers they're ideal for that they make very impressive border plants but they are beautiful when you order today this is what you will get right here and this before time will become this amazing amazing hydrangea uh rochelle i mean it's gorgeous it's i it's just unbelievable when you look at it in person how beautiful it is yeah no they really really are um this is a paniculata variety of hydrangeas so there's a few different major groups of hydrangeas this one paniculata is um i love them because they don't have the trouble that some people have with some of the other varieties these are woodier stems so they're a little bit tougher and they always bloom because they're blooming on that new wood they you really are never gonna have the problem you hear people ask a lot of times like why aren't my hydrangeas blooming these ones never have that problem because they're throwing out that new wood and they bloom on that new wood whereas other ones you know sometimes they'll lie on a second two-year-old wood and then that gets damaged and then it doesn't bloom so look at those they start out when you first see them blooming they go through this color change so they start out really pretty white as they age by the way these blooms last for weeks so as they age on the plant they start to um flush to a pink a light pink and then as they get older the blooms age even more they turn to this deeper red red pinky red similarly if you cut these i love to cut these they're beautiful in arrangements but even after the arrangement they were literally dry in your arrangement and as they're drawing they're going to go to that red they're gorgeous as dry flowers i have bouquets of them they're stunning and they're so easy you have to do essentially nothing and by the way they'll also dry on the on the shrub so even if you don't pick them and you leave them in through the winter you'll have those beautiful dark um dried blooms on the plant late into the season so i mean this is just such a winner of a plant they bloom like that where you have blooms everywhere they're just covered in the blooms it's not like you have one or two they they'll get about um about four to five feet in both directions so you want to plan for that these are definitely a substantial shrub put it at the back of the border put it you know in a place where a hedge this is these are great hedges i have a similar one not this exact one right outside the door here a whole hedge of them i couldn't love them more they're so easy yeah and they they have these pretty easy there's a there's like an ethereal quality to them you know what i mean they don't they look like clouds they almost look like puffy clouds they do of color they're gonna stand out amongst all your other plants i mean so beautifully because they're texturally different they just have a whole different look they have that nice deep green foliage and you can see just like little puffs of little clouds of great color 26.95 or 96 on sale free shipping and handling we'll ship it right out if you live in the southern part of our country we'll get you

holistic health sabine holistic health is a non-profit that helps medical cannabis patients with medicine costs medical marijuana is a heavy financial burden for patients who need this safe effective medicine our goal is to help medical marijuana patients with the most serious conditions afford the medicine they need today i'm discussing three medical marijuana hybrid strains of each type that all have berry in their names durbin berry a sativa dominant hybrid shish kabari an indigo dominant hybrid and barry white a 50 50 hybrid hybrids provide a good balance of the best qualities of indica and sativa strains so let's look at the effects and conditions commonly treated with these berry marijuana strains finding the best strain for you requires knowledge of strain types thc and cbd ratios and the medical applications of all cannabinoids and terpenes and cannabis use the links in the description including some free downloads to aid you in having this knowledge and using medical marijuana successfully the strains discussed today demonstrate the typical effects of indica dominant sativa dominant and 50 50 hybrid strains it is always important to look at the individuality of strains in their unique cannabinoid and terpene profiles the effects of any strain could vary slightly by individual due to our unique bodies medical needs and endocannabinoid systems these are the effects most users feel when using these strains these strains could also treat more conditions than just those described these are just the conditions that patients have reported successfully using these strains for the first strain is a sativa dominant hybrid durbin berry durbin berry is a cross of durban poison and rocky mountain blueberry it is an energizing strain that still provides calming effects durbin berry is said to be like its parent the well-known pure sativa durbin poison but with less intense energizing effects durbin berry is still an uplifting strain best suited for daytime relief of symptoms durbin berry smells like lemon and blueberries with a citrus taste it has twenty one percent thc and less than one percent cbd with this twenty one to one thc to cbd ratio it would produce euphuria like a typical sativa dominant hybrid durbin berry is an invigorating strain with mild body relaxation good for medical relief when you need to be active and focused it promotes energy focus positive moods and creativity patients have had success in treating stress depression nausea and fatigue with durban berry but it could treat other symptoms durbin berry would benefit anyone who needs daytime relief focus and energy or improved mood and appetite the next berry strain is more calming as an indica dominant hybrid strain shishkaberi shishkaberi is related to blueberry and red cannabis as an 80 20 indica dominant hybrid 80 indica twenty percent sativa shikhaberi is an award-winning strain known for its calming relaxing properties that are not sedative like a typical indica dominant hybrid it is best used for times of relaxation and nighttime or evening relief of medical symptoms shish kaberi has 26 percent thc and less than 1 percent cbd making this a 26 to 1 thc to cbd ratio that would produce euphuria it offers body and muscle relaxation with a clear head and improves moods and appetite patients have noted shishkabari effective in treating chemotherapy and hiv aids treatment side effects shingles anxiety migraines headaches multiple sclerosis parkinson's disease pain nausea and decreased appetite but it could certainly treat other conditions as well shishkaberi would benefit anyone who needs improved mood sleep or appetite calming effects without sedation nighttime relief or body and muscle relaxation the final strain is a 50 50 sativa indica hybrid strain berry white berry white is also known as blue widow white berry and blue venom it could go by any of these names barry white has fruity berry tastes and smells that contribute to its name it is a good balance of uplifting sativa effects and calming indica properties berry white could be used for either day or night time relief of symptoms but probably will not induce sleep barry white has 16 thc and less than one percent cbd with this 16 to 1 thc to cbd ratio it will produce euphuria however this may be less intense than strains with higher percentages of thc such as upwards of 20 percent thc as seen in the previous two strains patients have reported effectively treating pain stress decreased appetite nausea and muscle spasms with berry white but it could treat other conditions as well berry white would benefit anyone who needs balanced effects body relaxation with uplifting effects and improved mood or appetite these strains demonstrate the typical effects of hybrid strains of each type but it is always important to consider the individuality of strains as these typical effects could vary in any strain use the links below for resources and free downloads to aid you in using

little edge cross anyway we need more so this is supposed to be the perfect pairing but we've never and we've really done pairings on no no this show but I went to one time I went to a slap Lea beer pairing had a chocolate like a high-end chocolate plates yeah and that was cool because it was all chocolate truffles and Schlafly beer paired it's really good well what is the proper way to get all the senses and have the proper like you know is it to eat first and then take a drink or I don't know that matters hmm oh but that's pretty damn good mm-hmm yeah it's better than a beer oh wow that is that's fun it use it that's good it almost makes the beer tart like it gives it more tart yeah tart flavor that's not normal gooey butter cake I know Nate it's got like a brownie yeah face the crowd a silk crust is wrong word but the the base is thicker on this than a normal gooey butter cake I yeah those are usually a yellow cake I'm not a gooey um yeah and it this is a chocolate chocolate gooey butter cake before did you talk about the he has four hands chocolate milks out from four hands that's really good that's a good that's a good cookie butter that is really good um so the beer what do you guys think about very white I didn't have it before I had a bite of food I really like it the pairing a lot I think it goes pretty well it it's kind of a contrast yeah like like you said it's kind of sweet and then tired sweet and tart sweet tart I would have rather had a stout the realtor comes now that would go good but that would just kind of I mean I guess that would yeah that was complimented in a different way I mean it'd be more of a chocolate on shell tape raspberries Chuck compliment chocolate because you have raspberries with a lot of chocolate yeah white a Moose's and stuff what kind of strawberries any berries but I think it's top would be ridiculous with this yeah so yeah it's really really good yeah that's very good so beer wise what do you grade this a - a - yeah oh I say hey yeah I feel like it holiday I don't really like it it's good beer good beer thanks a lot Greg you really treat us well then this is new room work that you got this the snug so the schnooks I go to or well it's not near it it's down the road but you can they have taps they can fill crawlers like this they can fill growlers it's kind of nice defense because it's not reusable right to me the growler is reusable yeah crowler's usually are - yes they have that right the little spinning top yes really I said crawler I mean probably my turn is wrong they just call it 32 ounce in variants and 64 hours they really don't say hot boy anyway yeah this is a good good cake here good beer so try and look for this beer also check out our other videos go to youtube.com beer-thirty

to me curry a couple of months ago on our vacation to hang out with them Bruce Omid and drink tons of reading and sounder works the drinks which is a Swedish Jupiter and online portal where and and they started talking and agreed that they were to bring in superstition to Sweden which is amazing I'm not going to take too much except for like introduced superstition it then you will get to try the first meet which is fair what Blackburn Rovers were very Luber and after that depend on time it is it will all get a glass of grog to bury the drunk cranberry which is their most exclusive product

put in fundamental observation buttons and that's product from barrel logic down since there's a limited amount of time before we open for the public any questions obviously for Magnus but mostly Magnus containing the meats are very welcome we continue somewhere along the way the bakers will send out some very wide pizzas I had the joy of experimenting with the flavours white chocolate and

out", "L1WoNpoxDkc": "hey what's up guys many comfort here I just want to make a harvest video for the garden that I did day 42 night shots of didn't really update do any update videos in the garden just short some night shots I had some new strains in there and I want to show them finish now at this point everything's been pretty much everything's dry and has been caring for about five days and now I'm kind of while I'm pulling it out and I'm sorting buds and like greeting them and also a couple some buds aren't quite dried they harvest a few plants like six plants a little late but what this girl was is almost all blue rhino there's 8,000 walks you can see this is all the blue rhino it's been sitting out well for a couple hours now you know it just wasn't it still had like a tiny bit of moisture left in it after a few days in the jars so now I just let it sit out for a couple hours and it's all perfectly dried now and we'll just go long-term into jars but I'm going through and sorting it you can see I have some smaller buds down here you know that are just like great be buds I'd say still it's still nice obviously the small stuff I run into oil but these are like the be great buds and that's what's going in the box down there and then the top shelf butts or the best of the boats are going into this box here and it's gonna take me quite a long time because this is all I've got done so far you know I have it's about a pound there there's about a pound there maybe 3/4 week on there and I've only gotten just this one little section on the table and this is a 4 foot by 8 foot piece of plywood so that's how bigness says and it's not like thinly spread out I mean some of this is you know pretty thick and that's all blue rhino and then here's some more blue Rhino I have down here these plants got harvested later than the rest they I cut them off the stalks say I Drive my plans whole hanging upside down and kind of columns so these six plants I did in late did him closer to I'll actually I did them on day 63 where's everything else at harvested around a 60 59 and 60 so they were they were ready to come off the stalks the stem so I cut him off and jarred him up for one day but there's still a little bit moist you know after being in the jar for overnight so pulling them back out but they are definitely getting harder pile em to sit out for a few more hours today and then go back into jars and then I'll probably grade those to separate those out so yeah that's all the Rhino and just all fantastic just great stuff blue rhino is such a great strain it's just so frosty and also as I grade them I go through and clean up the trim see like here's a duck foot here I'd break that out of there cut it out of there well it's just totally packed with frost such great stuff okay I want to show you the other streets because I had four new strains oh yeah it's either new I grew one of them once before but just want to play it so it was like a second test for the double pur pur purple Romulan was the second double purple one that I flared out and I liked it the first time it's just extremely low yielding so I figured I throw another one in do it like a second test with it and see how it came out and once again I think I got like when we got around 90 grams or something in here so definitely small yielder but from the onset of purple salad this is double purple dosha male pollen pollinating Romulan it smells so good the leaves on this are neon green but the buds are purple and I've already done a final trim on this we see there's here's a little bud that has some leaf still on it basically just under bud I haven't separated this out or anything like good buds from small buds probably just give it to someone who's like personal smoke they really won't care but a really good flavor and smell pool color low-yielding though and only three ounces off of this plant a thing about even been a little under that it might've been like 80 some grams so might even less than 3 ounces yeah that's the double purple Romulan and I don't know how much more of this I will grow you might give it to a buddy to grow would we have next oh just oh this is the Barry White this one has not had his final trim gone through on it yet so it's still kind of leafy but it's a pull but out kind of check it out my clone only white widow that I used to grow that I phased out that and this they're they're almost identical the smell is exactly the same very sweet but strong smell just the only really difference between the two strains is the way they grow the old clone of you I would over that to branch out ahead like long fine stems with big buds and kind of just branched out bushed out but wasn't really thick and bushy because it had those like nice long reaching stalks or branches whereas this grows more vertical but everything else the bud structure I'd say on the whole only white widow was a little bit bigger buds and more dense in this I mean this is still dense but not extremely dense whereas it lonely widow had a nice big fat dense snugs and the yield on the two are about the same but the smell is identical they have to be related obviously they're both white strains but it's more than that it's more closer than that because I've grown several white strains and they all have kind of the same smell well not the same smell but they all have you can they have hints of white genetics in them I used to be burned enough white strains you know what I'm talking about but the clonely want Widow and that berry white are way too similar to just be white strangers this is the chem 4 it's a really popular cut up in Washington I harvested this a day 60 and it was not ready this I cut this early the reason why I cut it early it's just because figure you know I'm harvesting or anything I'm not going to leave a whole room going just for one plant so I just chopped it early I would say that if I wanted to grow this properly I should take it 70 days should go full 10 weeks at least but the hairs were just starting to turn well some of them had turned color but for the most part all these light brown hairs to see here were closer color to white when I chopped them and they browned out after the plant was harvested so this was definitely taken early at least a week early and I only did it just to turn the room but good yield well over four ounces off this one plant I remember all my plants these are all a three week veg time so it's not like I'm growing trees here I'm growing small plans but you know I definitely could do this better will I do it again I don't know because I don't know if I want to be grown ten week strains you know if I didn't have to do a whole room of it the others come for nice dense big nugs and big yielding in the last of the odd screens is Green crack first time growing green crack definitely a big yield or well over four ounces beautiful nugs I really like how it grew it smells great man this is just I know this is like an overgrown strain out in California and it's a heated or love it strain but this just performed awesome for me rockhard nugs Riddhi frosty smelled deliciously sweet and big yielding now keep in mind my blue rhino it didn't get weighed up but it's probably between three and three and a half ounces per plant and then you know you you take this screen crack or the Barry White or they come for and you get well over four ounces it's like a you know as much as a 30% increase in the old per plant which is huge the really liking the screen crack I did keep him other plant of it I mean gross more we may see some more green crack in my garden sometime may even see a whole grove green crack you see we'll see how how much people like it if they like it or not then we'll keep growing it but at this point I have no clones of it just one small mother plant so if I do grow it it won't be you know probably for a few more rounds anyway you guys just wanted to share those bud shots with you any questions comments let me know I mean produces some really nice stuff here I'm really proud of most of this so anyway take care", "Jz1c8SSxQWQ": "patience but this is so interesting first of all thank you so much for just allowing us into your home and for coming to QVC to look at our gardening things and our plants at all cottage farms has been in business for years and years even decades and they've been here at QVC I think more than 20 years if I'm not mistaken and you're getting all of these flowers shipped free shipping and handling and we're offering it on three monthly easy payments I think pretty much everything is on three easy payments and the thing is if you have a cue card which is our QVC credit card you can put them anything on six easy payments today and so that makes it nicer this is a hydrangea with a little different design and also one that changes color throughout the season and so that's really interesting to me let's talk with Katie Bell once again our our cottage farms expert and flower expert about this hydrangea you get one of these but look at the size of this thing I couldn't even hug it from behind because it's that big I mean this is no lightweight you know little tiny plant this is a major-league plant for less than $30 you were telling me six feet tall and four feet wide that's like a beautiful big shrub you know beautiful and wouldn't you just love to have the job of naming plants this one I love it makes me laugh find the very wise very love that so I love with these we call the magic plants here in my house because I've got a three year old and a five year old and so any plant that can do something like attract pollinators and butterflies to our garden or throughout this creamy white like this very white dub is this beautiful creamy white and then as it ages it turns into this dusty pink so you've got these these two shades happening and it looks like this on your plant because the different stages of flowers will be different colors you'll have some that are all white from the other half happy remember that are all pink it is such a cool-looking plant it is really it's it's like it's not only eye catching it's conversational starting you know this is one of those where people might you know that are coming you know when we can all start hanging it together right but they'll walk in and say what is that plant you have out there in your yard you know it's that beautiful now here's the thing what's typically I want to say the frustrating parts of hydrangeas and how is this going to you know kind of not be frustrated right frustrating a lot of people get frustrated because their flowers aren't blooming as much as they want them to and so I always say that it's placement and fertilizer and so with placement this particular hydrangea likes a little bit of morning shade so I would give it up a spot again where you're walking around your garden you're spending time outside knowing where your Sun and shade are so I would say at least four hours of Sun for this hydrangea which will help it really maximize that full flower potential because that's what we want out of this berry white are those beautiful creamy they're almost put ball shaped flowers and size I mean they're huge right wow that and that's what you want out of it that's amazing and then here's your growing guide etc now one thing I mean we're just we here at QVC always want to be completely transparent with you upfront here's what happens it's interesting because if you think about it we're in the first week of May right so right now this right here is exactly what will be on your plant because these are the real flowers so these are the real what we've had to put over here to give you an idea of what the color-changing will look like these are synthetic okay or simulated basically so or faux silk whatever you want to call them because this is going to start turning pink later when we get into June and July and that kind of thing right so these are the real ones right here these are the faux but it gives you an idea of it's coming and what's going to happen can you kind of give me an idea as we go through the the spring to the fall how when the color will change will start to change will be like sometime in June or be more like July so it'll be probably more it depends on where you live of course because everyone has different temperatures but I would stand for the general part of the country it'll be more like July you could even start to see that thank you a little earlier but when you see you know what you can see it from 10 feet away from across the yard it'll be more like July and I also want you know because I know we like to manage people's expectations Mary Beth mat land that you see there it's going to be the end of your third year you know you get a nice sized sample and you will probably get flowers this year but this is a perennial plant so year after year it will get better and better you know has a nice the new this is a new style of a hydrangea you know I said it's a football shaped flower but the reason we chose this one is we call it the black thumb hydrangea because it really is it's going to keep this nice shape the flowers are the perfect size huge football shaped flowers like I said can it really is low-maintenance so if you've been afraid to try hydrangeas this is a great place to start and by the way this is what will ship to you remember it's less than $30 but it's a perennial and look how big it will get at some point I also want to mention that hydrangeas need the acid loving plant fertilizer and so we haven't here for you with cottage farms we'll give you the information for it because this is really important to make sure you fertilize it with the best fertilizer for that it's usually hydrangeas azaleas blueberries things like that so the acid loving plant fertilizer is m17 4:08 and it's priced at $30 or three payments of $10 a month and that", "K-uXk1N3yeI": "the apples and pears to bet future in it let's go out the Apple isn't a stupid do you
