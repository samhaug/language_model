{"BCc3ik2M8GA": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] don't watch this video this video another stream of your video I did one video like this in the past you guys kind of liked it like it's getting a decent amount of views but that was like a wife's car I got another wax car I'm gonna do a review on soon that's coming up but this video is some some buds and fire ass bud this rain so the strain of this is called a Blackwater OG get some fire fire but she was like some little picture about with some information about this rain so it's an indication it's like a crush it's a cross between um Mendel perps and uh San Fran Valley og og cush so it's like really it's like a really really purple bug as far as [ __ ] crystal use for crystals all do the budgets fire and it's just purple on top of that you know what I mean everybody loves some purple we just like the looks of it like it's fire I got a couple close-up shots I I had some like about an eighth of this I smoked probably about two grams only got like two probably about a gram left but when I had like a little bit more blood I got some quote but when I had like about it eight left or so I got some closer look I got some close-up shots with this camera for you guys so I don't know how well they turned out I guess we'll find out right now so yeah that's the close-up shots at the camera they didn't turn out that good I'll guess they posted shot to my phone real quick with this last little nugge have but this body's [ __ ] fire if you guys couldn't help little close-ups that's what I got left right here so I got I got this snug left and then I got like another like a little ball or so I mean you guys already seen it but this boat is [ __ ] fired alright so just got done with this close-up so you guys seen it it's [ __ ] a [ __ ] fire Frosty the Snowman with a prequel they do it it's a stupid strain but um let's grind this up I'm gonna roll up one I'm gonna smoke a bowl for you guys the balls are gonna feel kind of like a taste test the plump me smoking it just showing smoking talking to you guys and just a little smoke sesh you know what I mean so let me go to ball real quick and we'll hop into that and then what I'm gonna be smoking the bowl out of I should have cleaned it a little bit better before I made this video but I got this every side piece and I should have said this in the beginning of the video I'll probably edit it in some more but um so I mean don't watch this video unless you guys are over 18 or 21 whatever the legal age is legal ages in your state or you guys have your medical marijuana cards like I do back into this video um I'm gonna load a little Bowl real quick I load about like probably loaded like half the bowl in a little full bowl because the mother smoked a blunt - but this is just for me to get like the taste because you know you get the taste more through a pipe or a water pipe more than up lump because when you smoke a blunt you're like tasting the wrap as well as the weed just use the bowl I loaded so all right so I was thinking I want to take one fat hit just like I don't know a little challenge or something for you guys but I'm gonna take one small like a decent sized hit just like actually get to taste I mean I've been smoking on it for a while so I know what it tastes like but just for video purposes you know what I mean I'm gonna hit it once kind of a decent hit just too good I'm gonna hit it once it's like a decent hit to get the full taste experience for the video and then after that I'll probably take a bigger city or something just happened so yeah this part is so fire dude like it was cured perfect there's it's not like it has like the perfect like you guys think that close-ups like it how I have that snap to it and it's like the perfect but you know what I mean it's not dry doesn't it doesn't turn it like you know that weed that turns inside [ __ ] dust when you crumble it off or this bar that's like way too [ __ ] moist and this part is like the perfect here you know what I mean so the taste is [ __ ] fire doesn't taste too strongly anything in particular like doesn't I can't really taste like though the SATA friendo Ju cush you know necessarily at all it tastes more like the Mentos perps and the San Fran would be cushioned this to be honest but if you guys had this drain in the past time I don't blow on the comments what you guys think of it but let's take off that I said of this thing get into that block the ball is pretty much cash so my grind of a bet I'm gonna grind up about a gram throw up a blunt probably get a little time lapse think me rolling the blunt or something I don't know yeah I just don't want this video to be too long then I'll get our back smoked tip alone I don't know if I'm gonna smoke the full-blown and I don't know if I'm gonna trying to talk too fast and I'm stumbling over my words I don't know if I'm gonna smoke the full blunt in this video just because I don't want the video to be too long but let's get him to me roll on the blown out in one second I'm gonna work on the wraps you guys like I like I bought once pretty much done just gotta pack the rest of it there we go all right so much I'm gonna strap my phone it's a while back in my backyard that's something kind of weird we're in my backyard and I got the blunt roll so yeah so I rolled the blown up added a little crutch to the end of it it was a little loose um it's not the biggest blunt you know I mean it's a little personal one huh thank you guys didn't know I had a dog or some of you guys might look okay why you scared [ __ ] what I don't know what the [ __ ] is going on with him but this is hot back into this video so yeah I got two dogs I got a

crutch so it's not hitting the bus let me see if I can fix it or do some but the ash is really white for being [ __ ] up with being a blonde this is a really good week the taste is [ __ ] fire

think I read the whole thing myself Blackwater og and the constraint typically bred from in dopers San Francisco Fiocchi because it's round compact but take a deep purple color sweet grape aroma never leave stress in his ID that's one of the things that seemed and that's [ __ ] I didn't know I didn't know about when I got this dream but hey that's just [ __ ] exactly what I needed I made the right

it going YouTube I'm always blazing here back with another video and today we have a strain review before I get into the strain review I just want to say happy 4/20 to everyone now I hope you had a great day here in Toronto was a beautiful day Yonge and Dundas Square was [ __ ] packed with people Manuel's it was a good time but yeah for today strain review we have some black water I'd smoke most of it that's why I just had this little bud left and I doubt it's really gonna focus on the camera so I'll show some bud shots at the end of the video but yeah the strains black water it's a cross between Mendel perps and San Fernando Valley og - very good strains and it is a 90% in the cut 10% sativa so this is a very nighttime smoke I would say but the looks on it very very nice very said it's more of a lighter green bud I would say with very nice hints of purple all around it's also very very frosty and now let's get into the smell the smell has that that og earthiness to it but it also has like a lemony piney scent that comes through almost a little fruity as well it's kind of nice actually but yeah that's for the looks and the smell of it let's go for the effects I have a bowl packed here my graph this bong is a beaker bottom one and a half foot and I'll probably be doing a review on this - I really like this bong so yeah here's some black water and Cheers now the taste excuse me the taste is pretty similar to the smell actually has that earthiness but a lot of that piney scent as well sorry the strains I'm very hard to enter it expands your lungs as soon as all that smoke goes in there um but yeah it has that pine enos to it and also a little bit of that lemony scent that comes through as well but the taste is not bad there's some better strains out there but the effects of this bud are just there second to none like as soon as you hit it you just feel it right behind your eyes trickling straight down all the way down to your back this is a recommend very nighttime screen I'm smoking and during the day right now but it's a rainy day and there's nothing to do so I'm probably gonna sit on the couch and do nothing anyways but yeah so I'm gonna go for the ratings out of 10 right now so looks out of 10 I would give it a solid 9 very tight buds lots of crystals and they have a little bit of purple cents in here and here and there sorry and yeah very nice buds so I was 10 I would give it a 9 first smell this smells not like amazing like it doesn't smell flake like a basket of fruit or something you know where you just want to eat it but it has a good good smell I would give this smell probably a 7 out of 10 the taste out of 10 I would also give it a 7 just because it it's very close to the smell as well and effects out of 10 out give it a solid 9 just because it's so hard hitting and it's you don't need a lot of this this but to get you to where you want to be you know it's very potent and it's very very very relaxing like this is a good string for if you just want to relax and just chill watch some movies you know don't do anything but yeah this has been the official review for Blackwater and I'll see you next time Cheers you", "5RyOM1ySgvE": "welcome back the Dutchman's medical marijuana Channel tonight we cut down a bunch of the black water oh geez and this was one of the very first runs of hydro soil I did zoom back out here this is one plant I've got a good you know bob about 5 ounces offer it could be a little more about 5 that's why I shoot for per plants between 5 & 6 for the height like Rome amount of time I bej and how many plants I put in so my goal has been usually around 5 ounces and this method of growing and pecan around 8 on the bigger plants so this is Blackwater OG as you can see she's beautiful purples you get temperature down to around 68 degrees at night and I run day temps of about 72 to 74 is my temperatures and my grow rooms and they turn nice and beautiful purple so I go through them preach everything down take all the main the big sucker leaves off and then pre trim about a half inch away leaving on about a half inch of trim around each bud then I hang them for 7 to 10 days and when the stems will crack and they're all dried out and brown because you can tell when it's done drying without any have to crack it you can look at the stalks I mean if they're still green then it's not dry so you just wait until stems turn brownish colored or they snap and crack which in my room drying room is about 7 to 10 days so black water og is Mendel perps crossed with OG Kush this is one of the best phenols I've ever tasted in the state of Michigan it tests out around 22% and she is just a gorgeous gorgeous plant full of trichomes this was also ran under my blacklight or my UV lights and so she'll pull easy 20 to 25 percent THC smells just like grape tastes like kind of a great beef flavor if you're not a big fan of sweeter strains this has got that real nice oh gee skunk pumped fuel taste but also that great so it's kind of like grape OG so if you're not a big fan of the sweeter weeds strains then this may not be for you I like just a little bit of sweetness to my strains I don't think it's too overpowering but it comes out real nice so you kind of see a nice purple buds in here all the way throughout and really it only takes one week to bring the purple out one week so a lot of times what I do is out cranked my room temperatures down to 67 68 degrees just for the last week of flower and it really helps to push the color out helps to push the sugars through and get this you get the trichomes busting out looking absolutely beautiful that's what we want you'll also notice on this stream that the lower buds will always darken up more than the upper buds again it's because of temperature the cooler it is down below it's cooler down below than it is above so because of that they always purple up first towards the bottom and then as the tops come in towards the end of the last week you'll start seeing those purple up if you maintain good temperature and good air flow in your room then it's more even change like most of these were pretty even from the top to the bottom you can see purple pretty much all the way up and then because I did use my UV lights sometimes you're gonna see some really bright white like sparkly light coming at you and that's the huge huge heads of trichomes when you use UV lighting it causes the plant to uptake more calcium more magnesium and to allow the trichomes to swell up and become even stickier and the heads to swell up even bigger than they ever would normally before so adding that missing light spectrum to your room really brings out more flavor a little more taste definitely some better smell and more trichome profile your chirping profile is enhanced so that's Blackwater OG hope you enjoyed our video this is one of the first plants I've cut down from a hydrosol method you like what you see subscribe to my channel stay tuned about plenty more fun strain reviews and helpful tip bits", "O9kBd_cleAc": "hey what's good everybody j ping here checking in respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick taste test pre-roll review featuring the hammerhead infused pre-roll a group out of san pedro long beach california uh man we've i'm personally really excited to check this out i've been hearing a lot of great things um we're looking at a product that has quality cannabis in terms of flour there are premium diamonds sprinkled out throughout this blunt i'm sorry throughout this joint there is distillate and on the outside has been coated and then it was coated in keef as well and then they do a strain or botanical natural terpene specific uh kind of um blend i guess i would say depending on the flavor that they're going for and so this is the og uh og kush flavor og kush strain flour and then og natural terpenes and so i'm excited to check it out the packaging is something i'm a big fan of i really like the aquatic underwater vibe the hammerhead the logo is super dope they have the little view here on the box of what's inside the joint testing wise 26.89 on the thc 31.47 on the total cannabinoids so this is definitely potent distributed by sea bright farms so here we go we've got cardboard box plastic dupe tube joint smells good inside oh it is definitely covered in keefe y'all check this out that is one hell of a good looking infused joint right there all right the dry hit is delicious i'm gonna massage it out just a little bit infused joints sometimes can be packed pretty tight and it makes for a troublesome smoke so always important to make sure you come ready with these um premium products all right here we go you guys see the light make sure when you're lighting your joints yo you guys got to be twisting it you want to make sure you get an even burn all the way around the joint there you go and then you got to give it a couple rips and look at that a nice good even burn here i'll show you wow wow this tastes really good so i was telling the hammerhead team like yo you know i try the fuzzies i try the jeters i try all these different you know infused joints that are out there i remember all the infused ones back in seattle big shout out to all the infused companies you know all over doing joints but the fact remains is that keef and distillate makes this a harsher product and so if you have good tasting flour and the diamonds the dusty the terps whatever it is you're adding to it you're infusing it with is that if that can complement your flour then you've got it and from what i'm tasting so far this is complementing everything oh yeah i would smoke these all the time for sure feels like i'm smoking a blunt that i like or a fat ass joint that i rolled myself and then coated myself and then dipped myself i love it this is dope this is dope when i think of a score out of 10 in terms of flavor i think of a 98 99 out of 100 the only thing i don't want in this product is natural terpenes i want cannabis terps if this had some fire og terps from cannabis only in this this [ __ ] would be way more potent than it is but it's already good so i'm going to give it a 98 instead of a 99 just for that reason in terms of the overall score i'm going to give it a 90 a 98 as well because i still want cannabis terps cannabis only everything on this product and this makes it a perfect product this is going to be one of the best products on the entire west coast we tour taste test reviews everything this is just wow wow wow wow nice [ __ ] work hammerhead hell yeah let me know what you guys think if you guys have had the og kush if you had the og hammerhead infused pre-roll in the past please be sure to drop a comment let me know what you think let the other people know what you think uh if you haven't yet let us know when you go buy it let us know if you're in a parking lot chill and watching this considering it i recommend it 10 out of 10 on the recommendation this is dope super duper fire 100 natural paper over here i rest my taste like follow and subscribe to respect my region on all social medias y'all i'll catch you all

top super yet I'm gonna try those these tacos look so good somehow [ __ ] right now yeah I'm hopping bad", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to get my twitter up as well like i want y'all to be

another episode of reefer reviews my computer crashed so um it's been a minute since we've actually got to do do a couple of these for you but I got a stash we've been sitting on you know I'm saying once again shadows for my dues from THC collection so I picked up this order from we got lots of good stuff on the list we got Blackwater moby-dick sugar cookies and Durbin princess today I think we're going to hit you guys with the black water so this one here is an indica dominant hybrid quadruple equality of course is THC 24 to 26 percent and actually one percent CBD and yeah it's called black water so let's take a look at this bad boy here the smell is dank a smells [ __ ] amazing [Applause] is very cushy like actually what else can I compare it to its very cushy but it smells almost just like [Applause] almost a little pioneer look it's hard to say it's like a little cushy almost a little piney as well and very heavy THC smell like you know just the smell of crystal like you got a [ __ ] bear Keef and your grinder or whatever just you know you know those buds like yeah we'll do a zoom in on it when you can actually see it the focus doesn't like to actually zoom in on the knuckle we there's too much texture to it opposed to everything else the camera is trying to catch but um we'll break it down and roll it and well sure you get sure you guys what it actually looks like um while we do that so let's get into it anyways this is the Blackwater THC collection oh and I can't wait to get into this [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] with the pages in my notebook sacred going for the leaf display for your ears must be cleared up in this glass [ __ ] getting smashed like truck windows backing up [ __ ] alright so here we are we have the black water for THC collection yeah man this [ __ ] smells delicious Justin rolling it oh my god the way it looks the camera never does it justice you know what I mean it never wants to zoom in on the nugs of even the busted up weed enough it almost focuses better on the busted up weed than it does the actual meat itself but it never wants to [Applause] it never wants to die never wants to focus on the nug I think it's just too much texture hold on pick this up yo innocence what up I'm just about to light up a big fat spliff of black water herb and do a weed review video on it so now you're talking to me while I do it so innocent say what up to the people if you don't know who innocence is this is the engineer breaking records me and him founded it together and it's been a long road and this hasn't been doing [ __ ] all lately he's got a family now but he's still family you've been back on the engineering game though and this [ __ ] sounded fire Oh someone asked me if I'd mix and master their album today and I was like yeah I'll mix it I was like it's gonna cost you money though and my boy Ennis will master it and then he never hit me back so I think he was hoping I'd do it for free oh it's incredible absolutely you know the [ __ ] is crazy bro Cilicia yeah it's uh it's an indica dominant hybrid the THC falls between 24 to 26 percent and it's actually one percent CBD as well - oh my god - it's delicious it's like kinda cushy to a degree but like really piney like the smell of it when you open the bag but in a spliff this is one that punches blunt yeah man this [ __ ] do you order online if you ever order online yo go to the site that I get this [ __ ] from yeah THC collection.com use the promo code hip hop all capitals you save 5% on every purchase five or that yeah it used to be 10% but um but it did it didn't work with their promo ads so now you can use if you use the same promo code now it's good with their promo so you can use it on sale items and stuff the 10% didn't work on sale items all bad this buddy I just gotta finish reviewing this we've cut this video off and then there's an agenda to be discussed but y'all this weed is good man the taste you know what you smoke like do you smoke spliffs tell ya you know how when you smoke a spliff and you can just like taste the crystal and your breath like after like you've exhale yeah that's what this is like and it's like the flavor itself like as is burning is kind of hard to put into words but it's like once you exhale like you can set you can taste like the [ __ ] crystal in your breath it's like [ __ ] crazy and then it like it's pretty harsh too on the lungs but um it's not the smoothest bud going down but like this [ __ ] oh yeah bad well we'll see how happy it hits me but hit me hard you're the type of but like you get you can bro one up if you only smoke by itself I don't know if your girl smokes no more but like you can put you could stub this out a few times and get high off this thing I should probably stop smoking it no I should put it out though cuz I can feel my eyes glazing over and [ __ ] woah yeah just get [ __ ] rocked yeah yo but daddy while watching this I would highly suggest this weed this is one of my favorites I've tried from THC collection hands [ __ ] down there was one of the one of the joints I had before camera or what it's called now oh [ __ ] what was it this is but this is this is definitely my favorite over top I can't remember the strain now I have to go back and look at the what I got last time anyways yeah I would highly suggest this highly recommend this anyone go if you're in Canada THC collection calm it won't focus on us of course there we go THC collection calm put your orders in you know I'm saying 129 dollar ounces every Friday and that's all the top-shelf bud so you could get the black water which is crazy yeah yeah it's a deliver it next day delivery as long as you place your order before 2 p.m. as next day delivery and yeah and then he in any purchase over 150 dollars you save or not you get free shipping and then if you use my promo code you save 5% yeah ya'll say I'll send you all the info so you got it justice but if you love

ping here checking in respectmyregion.com here today with special guest jace windu no new addition to the respect my region team here in california we're going to be reviewing a cannabis product today we're going to be doing a taste test review we've got a pre-roll from the lemonade store all right i'm ready for that the limoncello unfortunately though this was the last one in the store it was quite literally the display unit it is from april 10th 2020. this is not fresh this is old aged it's old when you're talking about weed this is like a fruit the older it gets the grosser it gets so this should be interesting to see if the terps are maintained i have high expectations for this but at the same time there is a very large risk factor all right this was a 25 p-roll 26 this is a 26 pre-roll they do not offer first-time discounts so full priced over 10 months old at this point so it's not patient first time patient first time visitor msparkersflowers.com 17.2 percent on the thc it's not even high potent again this is going to be interesting you guys um lemonade here we go only is our most popular one too though it was it says it was packaged on september 7th which means it was roughly five months of sitting before it was packaged so it could still be taste good could still help smell i don't know we'll see um only one way to find out yeah in terms of the packaging we're in a plastic dupe tube not appropriate for a 26 dollar pre-roll damn let me get on that smell i'm getting flat sparkling lemonade yeah my best flat flat sparkling lemonade and it is in a cookie's vibes pre-roll tip looks like hopefully vibes paper oh smell the it smells spicy smells like straight up tea yeah like old tea huh oh man oh gosh one way to find out oh gosh if you guys have ever had a good cookies pre-roll drop a comment and let me know which strain if you have ever had a bad cookies pre-roll or a bad lemonade free roll drop a comment show some love talk some [ __ ] now is the time because it's very important we want these brands to be offering the best possible service and these strains when they are 10 months old that's a tough sell a 20 dollar pre-roll 26 26 but when you buy designer weed it comes with a designer price tag so as long as it tastes good i will shut the [ __ ] up and just enjoy it yeah right all right here we go one hit you guys know the rules taste test j ping respect my region my man j swim dude we'll give him a follow on instagram what's your instagram it's chase windu how do you spell this j-a-s-e-w-i-n-d-u-u all right so the way that these taste test reviews work is we hit it once one really good solid rip through one two ribs maybe whatever is your first solid hit and then we taste it taste it like wine what it tastes like going in what it tastes like going out what your mouth tastes like the high that you feel and experience i'm getting the sativa duh it's a lemonade product i have a little bit of a head rush would you feel that yeah it's a little it's a little bitter i think this has to do with the age of it it's a little yeah bitter is the right word on the spice yeah and then the lemon and citrus was there though yeah i got it yeah which is you know what you said man after x amount of months and still getting that good flavor it's like it's like i'm drinking it's like i'm smoking a flat lemon seltzer and there's a bitter tea taste to it yeah i think in terms of my score out of 10 for the taste i'm sitting for a 26 dollar pre-roll i'm sitting at a 7.5 it's lemony but it doesn't taste good it just tastes a tiny bit citrusy and it tastes like i'm smoking weed i'm gonna give it a classic six nine six nine one give it a classic six nine no it doesn't sound as good as usual six nine but yeah for 26 bucks i i would like i would like a little bit smoother it is a little bit harsh i want you guys to see the ash that we're working with here it's not that we're coughing right but it does have a harsh taste and flavor to it i think it's a combination of the older terps the degree the degradation right and then uh maybe it's the maybe it's it's the paper who knows i'll give it i'll give it we'll both give it another rip or two and then let's give it a score out of 100. so when it comes to the score of 100 we rate on 10 categories i'll just go through a couple of them real quick presentation appeal taste smell potency and then there's a couple like uh i believe color uh is there more information available right would you recommend it you know uh your overall experience all those kinds of things go into this 100 point rating and so i know i just came at you with a lot but if you were to give it an overall score you gave it a 6.9 on the taste so when you think about nine other scores what would you give it out of a hundred i'll give them a give a solid seven eight okay uh 78 because i it would be easy just to say anywhere in the 80 range because it's lemonade because it's cookies yeah but again they in store decided to sell the display this one knowing that it was the display that it's been there that old and no discount on that yeah and being a company like that they should have done the smarter choice and offered a different alternative yeah um otherwise they would be in the eight for that reason but otherwise just the joint alone i mean even though it is old it still has good flavor it's fairly smooth for being that old i mean you're right it has a harshness to it but we're not coughing but it does it just has a harsh tone flavor like to it yeah something that you're not usually used to yeah or that you wouldn't expect from us and it's 17 total thc it's not this is just not high potent whatsoever it doesn't and on top of that they don't have the total cannabinoids listed so their leaves their leaves some information to be desired and that's why it's a 7.5 for me on the taste and i'm going to stick with a i'm going to give them a 72.5 on the overall product the experience at the store combined with you know price point considered the duke tube the lack of information there's not even a total cannabinoids on here um all of those things lead me to and then it's old this is 10 month old product uh it just leads me to believe that you know not all the products are are taken seriously or ultimately you know they're trying to deliver the highest quality at every point yeah um and so because of that i might actually i go down from a 7.5 to a 72.5 yeah i don't know 100 overall um great joint i just will never be spending 26 bucks on it ever again and because of that i cannot recommend it as well yeah but um big shout out to lemonade and their fan this product did come highly recommended uh unfortunately though this this specific unit this specific skew was the display didn't exactly set them up for success yeah um but that's what you get sometimes yeah so when some you lose some i love you guys appreciate y'all for the love jay swindu appreciate you for being on the first official review my man taste test a lot more of these coming big shout out to exactly on the produce uh producer right back here man you all know what's good uh i love you guys we'll see you on the next review smash the like smash this follow smash and subscribe love you all peace", "PcZeXfokRPM": "welcome to weed witches i'm tatiana I'm tanuki and this is the end of joint month and to celebrate we're going to smoke four different joints all of them from the pot zone formerly the crock pot in port orchard they were for joints for twenty dollars that means they were five dollars each on average so you see how terrible day that's not fair we're had really bad luck lately with them hmm we we are professional reviewers we we hold our judgment until half I don't know lots of our line out so this one is is black water they're all by the same company dreamcatcher and they have really pretty labels they say they're all purple which is my favorite color and they have this really pretty diem it says follow your dream how's it smell does it smell musty Steve oh it's packed really nice too it's super tight that that could be bad it does it smells musty and it's very faint let's see how it tastes also musty it's not that far but it's hard to draw it is you have to really suck on it to get it e-cig out of it it tastes very mild taste it's very mild hissing it tastes a little like Bert like sage or something take the smell of burnt sage tastes if that makes any sense and it's also making my lips now so there's that so let's keep smoking and tell you what we think and we're back so it's not bad it's not it it doesn't taste bad although the smoke has a weird smell and that might just be from the paper it's got about twenty percent THC for five dollars it's definitely worth it were they for 45 did you have to get all four yeah you had to get forward how did you get for to get them for twenty dollars but you can get four of the same one you can make them match whatever so this was black water I can't breath they call it that now from dreamcatcher we got this at the pot zone in port orchard we'll see you in a bit bye wait if you liked it

don't know why it's doing it again there hmm why isn't taking up the whole screen [Applause] here we go Wow welcome back fellow youtubers fellow viewers fellow medicator fellow subscribers fellow fellows alright here's the deal this is 100% federally legal hemp for the 2018 farm bill passed this video is for anyone 21 years or older if you're not 21 there's the [ __ ] door go so thank you let me go open it for you no just kidding actually you wouldn't want me to open it it's hot out I don't know if you live in an area where it's as hot as it is here PA which I don't understand the weather these days but what if all right for some reason my screen is really small I'm hoping this isn't gonna be a problem when I upload because this is kind of like a one and done take deal once I open this I can't reopen it um I'm basically doing a review on a product that I've been knocking gas station and convenience store hemp products because I used them before I started getting into like like quality medication from like reputable companies that take the time like med hemp or iam and and mystic roots and and organic entourage and tweedle farms and I mean I can just I can go on and on and on and on hippie mood I mean there's so many reputable companies that why would you want to buy that [ __ ] why would you I mean you gotta wait a little while I want it because you gotta water it I mean I gotta wore it so I mean everybody's gotta water in gotta get it through the internet unless you live around here in PA there's a store called deep-six CBD in the mall and 90% of their products come from CBD hemp direct which if you are a veteran here you know that way way way way way way way way way way back in the day see me the him direct was like the cornerstone of my my channel I see that a guys like Taz and stuff were just now starting to get the big packages the DM Blair got years ago catching up with the times they are I guess shout out the Taz I seen some of your reviews on CBD hemp direct I like them I like their products I mean I get a lot of mixed say yes say no kind of thing but that's not about what this is about what this is about is like the the [ __ ] that comes from gas stations did I've started finding other companies and looking in the internet for more reputable places with better quality products because taking the gummies like the hemp bombs and stuff like we just didn't seem like they did anything and so I've come to find in my opinion not everybody's but in my opinion just about anything you get from a gas station or a smoke shop that's just like easy Mart or an A to Z or stuff like that that's really just [ __ ] but here we are years later new companies are coming out maybe there's a better standard maybe there's things going on behind the scenes that are helping to bring up the quality of those products so I thought why not start a section in my youtube channel where I'm just going to pick some oddball companies not anybody on normally reviewing and in downtime or time when I'm waiting to receive things I've ordered or products that I'm waiting on or whatever to review some of this stuff so here's the deal before I even show you the product I went through bought no hold a second this has got some other hemp in it let me go give me a minute - okay - in here in this bag so um I'm just gonna remove this this is just from this is just from from another company and I want to get that in there so this is a pipe I bought last week at a gas station here in PA every frickin corner has a gas station or an easy mark and then every one of them I mean yeah glass blowers that make like like glass that's just like boom boom boom boom boom I made a pipe but made a pipe I made a pipe I made 20 pipes today haha those kind of places they must be making a bank in monopolizing majorly because every store every corner store has an ass-ton of cheap like glass I mean you pay out the nose for it but it's cheap I mean this is it's not very thick I paid like I think fourteen or fifteen dollars for this it's got like some swirly swirls and stuff and I like how you can sort of see through the middle so you're gonna watch it change colors into here and it's got like the yellow a green color that I like so much when it comes to hemp and I bought a glass screen and this is one when I used to smoke the product I'm going to review so well I don't know anything about this product in fact I tried looking it up online on YouTube here and just to tell you not one review of this stuff so I'm probably thinking that this is probably gonna be like harsh nasty isn't gonna do anything I mean I may be wrong inside you sure maybe the best game hemp I ever smoked but I doubt it okay so here's the deal comes in this mason jar which I thought was an interesting touch Mary Jay high quality and flower OG Kush 21 only plus 21 plus only 14 grams let me tell you for this 14 grams I paid $34 for this really 34 bucks but you know what $34 seems like a small price to pay to start a new line of videos in my channel and to educate you on one like what's what so glass so a metal container top you think [ __ ] I think I blew blood for this one my head alright here we go so I have never opened this obviously I'm hoping there's a seal on here for two reasons one somebody at the store can take [ __ ] out and enjoy it themselves then charge me for [ __ ] I'm not getting two so nobody can put anything in here or fiddle faddle with my hand so let's see together how good this company is I'm thinking there's probably laws that state that there has to be some sort of seal if it's not sealed outside but who knows where this came from maybe the state it's made in which i think is like see what it's watching good good this is good it's a good first start I'm liking this so far first impression smells like it's already been smoked [Music] maybe because it's got all the air pulled out and there's like whatever they put in a nitrogen or whatever to seal it and keep it fresh maybe that's why it smells the way it smells so let's kind of know this has got an oddball smell I'm already kind of turned off I'm concerned it's like a pickle it smells like a pickle like a dry [ __ ] pickle it's kind of weird I'm gonna get some light I'm gonna see what the pickle looks like tonight okay so in the jar here we go Inuyasha it's not bad looking so far that's pretty decent it's fluffy it still just smells like a burnt pickle I don't know kind of concerned here you know I don't buy a lot of like gas station stuff because this is like this is like what I went through when I first started smoking hemp and I was like I don't even know if I want to continue down this road maybe I should think about a better source if I do all right well hell it's 14 grams that's a half an ounce let's uh let's dump it out here and see what it looks like there's a piece of lumber big enough I can build a log cabin with it little chunks I can't get over how [ __ ] nasty that smells yeah I hope I'm gonna like rule a third eye or anything smoking this stuff so here we go up close you see close-ups close-ups very very nice close-ups I really can't do much for [ __ ] mom maybe I can zoom in a little I mean is this boom button it lets you do that I guess maybe I can that's pretty decent looking I guess it's it's actually fairly decently trimmed this dumb look like they've just been ripped off you don't look like they've been like properly dealt with in any way I just get such a weird smell to it um this stuff doesn't say like says OG Kush 14 grams industrial hemp under point zero three percent Delta 9 THC it doesn't say it all how much CBDs eco-friendly organic rejuvenating enjoy kratom calm hmm packaged enjoy supplements Rockville Pike Rockville Maryland 2850 kratom enjoy Cranham car well alright it's probably what's got the weird smell some of this stuff out of here so I really really hope this isn't gonna [ __ ] up like how my video looks alright so we're done with that I'd see here alright so you know honesty you know what I'm just gonna roll the way it is all right so look this stuff is fluffy but there's no sticky to it at all not one little bit there is not one bit of sticky terpene II anything okay this is just novelty version maybe I don't know we're gonna taste it I mean you know how I roll here so wish me well right here we go well there's absolutely no terpene bite there's no flavor at all I mean taste green Wow it's fibery Mary J hem flower OG Kush this is like sacrilege guys I mean like how's this company I'll just company allowed to do this I mean like like there's so much stem like there stem stem your stem I'm gonna lay these off here stem a whole lot of stem it's down look at that I mean it's kind of [ __ ] growing something I get that but like is all the weight that they're giving me here stem wait you mean most of them don't get me wrong it's really nice flowers here but all this here that's just basically stem how Kim know how can a company honestly put this into a package and feel comfortable sending you all that's down look at it oh I mean this one here's the most ridiculous Oh mom I mean is it possible that it stuff fell off during packaging that mean shipment maybe maybe it was all one big piece I mean that would be really cool if it was one big huh sorry guys it's like 2:00 in the morning here you know be cool flake this was like if it was really one big stem like a cola because it looks like a top they all look like tops the tops - what so we don't lose it once again Mary Jay high quality and flower let's uh let's get out the old grinder yeah sorry guys got something behind all right so absolutely no flavor there's no there's no dank the Danko meter I give it like a 2.08 sorry that's just like stuck in my throat like it won't stop like during all right I mean I think I'm gonna with what's left of this I think I'll blast this in another video maybe I'll make a video as a part 2 maybe I'll blast this and see what kind of BHO I can get from it or I know I can't probably get anything from pressing it pressing it but probably just depress me from depression of the product just dump this stuff back in here uh-huh kind already dismayed about like well this is gonna go cuz it's not really much done finding a appealing about this flower hoping like grinding it opening oh look here's a seed the one thing you don't finding quality him I mean unless you know every now and then I get I guess she would but right off the nut I found found a seed kind of scary already kind of worried so I am I can't say I'm purposely taking my time tonight but I I am kind of just like it's been a long day and I'm just really not into whirring and rushing because work is maybe hurry and rush so let's see yeah so ground I put this in here I think I'm gonna grind up enough to smoke it through the pipe and then maybe roll something up and see the difference between you two okay well believe we're not smells better now it's been ground up actually smells like hemp now instead of like a dirty pickle it's not a very potent wick I am like Oh Danko meter but it smells like hemp now instead of grossed out pickle like a dill pickle little chunky stem can go pop this in here give this give this a smoke here my guys choose there's to the is to the convenience store hem doesn't really taste like don't you anything yeah it does taste like a burnt brownie you smoke there's like drying the roof of my mouth it's it's kind of like filmy it's kind of the exact [ __ ] reason why I don't buy this stuff just probably made by the same company that makes earthy I really don't see any quality in this product okay after like the third fourth bit trying to make a mic just feel tight I mean I am asthmatic but I wasn't feeling none of this until I started talking on this or basis of material in front of me and I just don't get it I don't I don't get how these companies can I mean I'm I'm sorry Mary Jay I mean I I gave it I try to give you an honest one here but I'm just oh let's try a warning I mean we're going on like the 30 minute mark 27 and 28 minutes probably in 28 minutes really still coming back to haunt me just like when you put it in a favorite sounds crispy and dry there's no real call quality like attributes no real quality attributes to this you know I mean it's like just like it's just drawing harsh for the most part so you know one thing I want to bring up was industrial him here in PA Pennsylvania common walls I caught up the Department of Agriculture when we first passed the farm bill and had asked them what the requirements were for like personal flowers like I'm not trying to grow too you know supply the whole neighborhood or even really manufacture anything I'm just not trying to make bricks or create a race car out of ham or or some new tennis shoes or anything just you're free plants that I can you know grow and enjoy in my spare time and the fruits of my labor and they told me that now I don't know if this has changed since then but the toiler really isn't a regulation and you know if you're growing a hemp plant in your yard what are we gonna do just hope the cops don't mistake it for marijuana well we reason bringing this up is because like if you're the law shouldn't shouldn't you [ __ ] know the difference between marijuana I mean there are two totally different things one gets you high and the other one doesn't I mean maybe cops should meet me just like hey you're say that that's hemp let me smoke some of that and I'll tell you if you're lying or not I mean in movies to go it's cooking you're going to jail you know reason I bring this up is because I found the seed in here I mean I don't know if to find seeds but when I do it's usually in really crappy him so maybe you know I still got a big fatty here I'm getting pretty good at Bolognese what taste is bitter you won't have something I honestly believe I feel something maybe it's cuz I'm hotboxing and that's depleting my ability to get proper oxygen flow to my lungs so maybe I'm just feel something because I'm depriving my lungs of oxygen but I don't really think that's it I think I really feel it work and believe it or not I mean I'll be honest with you there isn't much like did the whole product but I'm not saying that like I feel great but I do believe I feel it working in all honesty it rolls pretty good pretty well packed yeah Chasseur I mean it's burning pretty uniformly except for that one little spot right there but I think that's pretty much all of it and it was kind of being lazy about oh well sure it up here and see how it goes from there there's really nothing in taste it's kind of gross it's not as bad as like those hemp cigarettes or whatever yeah okay so I know honestly I think I've smoked enough tastes like a regular cigarette and even tastes like hemp okay so let's do the daily thing Packaging jours pretty interesting I mean this glass I'm kind of you know kind of that's pretty sweet you know I mean was coming up zip bag mylar or something or other but this comes in a glass jar that's really pretty pretty classy for some cheap em I mean people smoke with their eyes first if it's anything like eating let me eat with your eyes first the burger looks delicious you're automatically going to perceive it to start this pretty delicious but if it's mushy and falling apart and the buns sliding off the top and it looks like [ __ ] then you're pulling on me like ooh this burger eat all that great so the packaging is cool I want to scale one to five one being the least five being the most I've gotta say okay okay I got to give it like a four so it's getting the four there's one success I guess um the flavor wasn't all that great the look was kind of like wow there was no sticky or punji err we're dang keenest to it and anyone in fact smell like lemongrass and dry pickles I would like to say that the quality is not all that great but I feel it I really honestly feel it it is working she do I recommend the product no I think you [ __ ] believe it but it's working so kudos I i recommend the product why not I mean I'm baffled I am because a lot of the stuff that I got from like convenience stores and [ __ ] before just was garbage so maybe you know at these new times of hemp bills and things maybe there's a better standard I wouldn't buy this because I'm like hey this is a great product and I'm gonna go buy more of this I'm not gonna buy any more of this this was the only size that this came in I mean it wasn't like there was a cut or a lid or anything like that it was it only comes in a like where I got this it was just [ __ ] half ounce hey I found yours there you have finished yours half ounce jars heflin's yours half ounce jars hey we're company we listen we're gonna go some 1/2 ounce jars I'm pretty sure there's probably other sizes and ratios maybe the company the place I got it from just my thought here 1/2 ounce jar why not hmm so you know I don't want to steer I'm kind of blown away about the fact that I'm actually telling you that it works and that I recommend it but I wouldn't make this I just wouldn't make this something I go down to the corner store and buy all the time I mean maybe in a pinch and I mean a real pinch I mean a real straight hurt black and blue pinch maybe I would you know okay let me give you a scenario zombies have taken over the planet they're everywhere it's a pandemic of zombies I read a freaking a2 tzemre and I find like a half a dozen of these jars you know okay why not they make great trade fodder I guess but I don't think I would buy this like just to enjoy and medicate with although it works let me tell you why I can feel it subsiding already like I know it's still working and it's it's like it was all like right here and like here like most oh geez I think the pretty much head effects but here we are only 20 minutes later and um it's kind of subsided so you would probably have to like continue to use it maybe that's why they sell with such big quantities this fee was pretty good but it's not gonna last long um I don't know I I still don't plan on buying anymore I mean unless I find another company that well that looks interesting and I got it it's from I'll pick it up because I'm gonna make more videos like this because I'm sure somewhere else in America there's Mary Jo j og cush and if you've had it or it's in your area let me know about it tell me what you think if you've had it if it worked for you if you're unhappy with it what a scale of one to one to ten one being the worst and ten being the best in quality I'd give this like a six it's a little over half of what I would consider to be pretty good so this is a six that's not bad just one quick thing before I end a daily thing when you're purchasing like products okay and you're you're thinking about like I'm gonna buy a hemp you should probably try and consider a couple factors one being where am i purchasing it from - is it gonna work does this product look reputable enough does this product seem reputable enough I'm you know I'm going to a company called you know porcupine hemp I mean now there's honey badger hemp and stuff but I mean oddball we like you know lame-duck hemp I if the name just doesn't sound flapping then I probably just wouldn't you know I probably wouldn't consider it I mean I I didn't even consider this I mean I've seen this stuff over and over and over again and I've only because I want to try and get you guys to understand like the difference between quality hemp and am I gonna start making reviews of like products from these places and I'm gonna tell you that it's still working but not all as well as it was when I first started feeling it so with that said with that said uh there's not another review of this stuff whenever you go on the internet anywhere in YouTube maybe an Instagram or something there's some videos but there is not one video I looked up Mary J Mary J hemp flour mary j OG Kush and no dyes so if you you think about that that's another factor in deciding if they can I find reviews of this product I mean I think I've popped the review cherry on this so Jeanne from Mary Jane so with that I would probably pretty much stay away from gas station or convenience store stuff but I'm gonna still try and I would recommend that you go to a reputable place but if it's something you're just into cuz you got some extra money or you want to gag gifts or I I would sort of a guy that uh made a tincture out of a gas station hemp and you said it turned out to be a pretty good tincture so I mean maybe it has its purpose somewhere so I hope this was helpful I hope this got you to understand that I mean no sticky no dank no no so I hope this helps again and I hope that you guys don't really hope you guys just don't think I'm trying to bash a company I mean I'm just trying to be honest here and in the time that I've been doing this I'm not an aficionado I'm not an I'm not an official source I'm not a you know I'm

both boosts its og genetics with chunky pale buzz remember we talk about the flower a tangy a tangle of orange hairs and a pregnant citrus aroma it's sedating euphoric effects to make it pop a popular medicine for anxiety and insomnia definitely and it also provides an extra kick to the appetite yeah because when i woke up i did have the munchies you know some doritos we were good seasoned

review this one's coming to you by ember valley i i have done a few strain reviews for them in the past if you haven't seen them go ahead and go check them out but today the strain we will be reviewing is the walter white i know you've heard of walter white that's from breaking bad i'm not sure what strains they cross to come up with walter white if anybody knows go ahead and let me know but this isn't indica and i did get it at blue fire dispensary in merced california it is going to run you around 40 for the eighth let's take a look at the bud looks really good super dense and like always if you want to see an up-close picture of the product check it out [Music] as you can see there it looks really good uh ember valley added these seals i already peeled it off it's like a tin seal and it's uh that's pretty cool they have these extra seals on them now they used to not i'm not gonna lie the weed is still a little dry but it's got a great smell to it it's like gassy with a hint of sweet or it's like gassy and sweet so and this is coming to you at a 31 and a half percent on the thc a point zero nine on the cbd for a total cannabinoids of 37 and a half percent so i'm curious to try it out let's see i got a bong load pack shares everybody i hope you guys are smoking on something good today okay first initial thought it has a good flavor it's um it's a little gassy with a hint of sweet it's like what it smells i really do like it uh it was smooth it didn't [ __ ] up my throat it did pack it did have that indica punch that i'm looking for but it didn't give me a crazy long lung expansion like i'm used to but my bungalow did kind of get stuck right there so that might have affected it but like everybody knows two for the review get that stale smoke out and everybody please remember to smile feel it harry [Music] we do got a shoddy we're gonna take it right now in a second i'm just trying to breathe breathe that bongo did hit me after a second now who do we got today we got mona loser that one's kind of creepy looking i like it i'm a loser i got stuck on youtube watching old 90s and 80s commercials they do not make commercials like they used to then i see all the old stores that shut down like uh circuit city and uh toys r us [ __ ] like that kb toys i miss old toy stores and old commercials i know it's weird but i do okay let's get this second one in so i can get you guys the review okay that one hit me much better uh that one packed a hell of a punch it gave me that that indica [ __ ] that long expansion that i'm looking for in indica the flavor was still there it was not harsh the smoothness is there the walter white is not a bad strain i've never tried it by any other company i know a lot of other companies have a walter white strain as well but i do like amber valley not a lot of people talk about him but amber valley is a good cannabis company they have you know a lot of good products you can check out my reviews and see for yourself and the walter white is no exception it is um it is very good i'm going to sit on it for a second before i calculate it up let's get this shotty get this shoddy uh ready who's doing a shoddy with me see if i can get it oh good job didn't squirt sometimes i squirt sometimes you get a squirter i need to get a shotgun tool so i can do it faster okay got my shotty ready let's calculate this up price and blue fire dispensary in merced california where i picked up this product it's going to run you around 30 i mean 40 dollars sorry 40 dollars for the eighth that's a pretty good price for this product the look and the smell is amazing the smell is gassy with a hint of sweet the look it's they're great looking buds like you've seen yourself really dense it is a little dry for my liking but you know can't win all the time the flavor is good it's about like what it smells like it's gassy with a hint of sweet it is smooth it didn't [ __ ] up my throat at all and the high is definitely there so overall for that walter white by ember valley i'm gonna have to give it the 8.3 it's not a super great strain but i do i do enjoy it and i would buy it again anything over an eight is solid um anything over an 8.5 is a is really [ __ ] good and if it gets over the nine it's a must buy so i'm giving it the 8.3 it's nothing to shake a stick at i really do like it i hope you guys enjoyed it

not bad put this on my 510 battery looks kind of cool white card said I bought it and put out the medium setting I think is like 2.9 this is my personal preference is a federal higher but to my opinion fighters burns it up more so while they're going to give this car that looks like my rock garden no luck wait damn sticker looks good though let's see what the taste is like white Walker crew cannibal yo okay pre smooth kind of reminds me of raw garden straight-up has that flavor that turkey flavor but not to Turkey definitely has oh gee flavor it says the taste and scent should be herbal

was snowing and that totally caught me by surprise i mean they said it was gonna snow but i didn't think it was gonna [ __ ] come down like it did usually you can see that [ __ ] like you know in the hills cause i don't live too far from the mountains and [ __ ] but yeah today was crazy and i was scared man because when i went to the bank man my [ __ ] tires like slid from the back you know what i mean and that was [ __ ] like i lost total control so i had to stop slow my [ __ ] down like you totally gotta drive slow well you guys gotta understand out here where i'm from we're not used to this [ __ ] we're not used to the snow like that so it was nice but then it was kind of crazy at the same time you know but i made it home i went to work everything was good you know i made it there safely made it back safely and i got a little late night delivery as you guys can see so we got this dosy lotto rolled up in a nice vanilla white house i've been trying out the vanilla white house and those are fire man so we got the blunt rolled up fam dolce lotto this [ __ ] is gonna be bomb i could smell it already this is gonna be my first time smoking this [ __ ] too i haven't even sampled it so let's get lit man oh yeah that [ __ ] tastes good fam it has like a pretty floral kind of flavor to it and it's dang too like it grabs the lugs in the best way man this [ __ ] is this [ __ ] is stupid fire right here man damn dolce lotto [ __ ] is crossed with dosi dos and gelato number 41 and i've had docidos by itself and i've also had gelato but it was a different cut to get these two combined is a [ __ ] snack like this [ __ ] i can already feel it man the smell beautiful super diesel super dank and musty too but the taste is pretty you know what i'm saying so it's it's dope man if you guys have never tried dosie lotto before take it from me get that [ __ ] try it man that's all i can say anyways we got the fire i got some champagne man i'm feeling fancy tonight nah i'm bullshitting i'm just chilling man you know it's beautiful out here man there's still snow in my [ __ ] yard man like i just see a bunch of white all over my [ __ ] you know it's cool man this is nice you know it's touching like 1 30 in the morning i'm just hanging out solo late night and i wanted to talk to you guys about my day man that snow [ __ ] was crazy fam i don't know if you guys have ever experienced like snow like that and this is like minimal [ __ ] too like i showed you guys the amount of snow that was on the floor like you could see it but it wasn't you know we didn't get no feet or anything like that you know people from the mountains and [ __ ] like that they got they get the real snow storms i'm talking feet of snow talking about getting snowed in and [ __ ] me i was just nervous to drive man because i don't got no damn chains on my wheels you know my [ __ ] i need new tires anyways so yeah man it was just a little sketchy you know but it was nice at the same time but this [ __ ] was like at 3 pm it started to snow and it was supposed to snow in the morning but that [ __ ] came late but yeah i was on my way out man i went to the bank and it started to come down as i was driving like it started as like a hail and then actually just turned into straight snow who the [ __ ] was watching ufc 257 man conor mcgregor versus dustin poirier please tell me you guys saw that [ __ ] man that [ __ ] was crazy man conor mcgregor man to get your ass knocked out the way he did like the last time he got you know beat i [ __ ] with nadia's i don't know if you guys know who that is but that's my dude from stockton california he fought mcgregor twice first time tapped him out choked him out we were naked choke and the second time they fought man they gave it to mcgregor and it started off in mcgregor's favor but then it kind of led into nate diaz man and i feel like he got robbed but anyways that's beside the point my thing is dude came back two division champion the champ champ as he likes to say you know he was looking alright in the first round you know he was touching dustin with some good ones tagging but dustin started to [ __ ] up that calf muscle man he was giving him the leg kicks and mcgregor just wasn't checking him like that and when he was he wasn't really blocking it the way he should with the shin you know was still making contact with that muscle so you could just see it early man like his [ __ ] started to get red he started to just like his whole stance his whole rhythm got thrown off and my thing is this though oh [ __ ] it's on fire but my thing is this why the [ __ ] wasn't he guarding himself like okay it got to the point where dustin like hit him boom caught his ass knocked him like made his knees loose right dude would still keep his arms down he got put up against the cage and that's when it was over he just wasn't blocking like it just seemed like he was totally out of his rhythm like like it just been too long and he got too used to just sparring and like you know it was funny because khabib i guess he tweeted some [ __ ] he was like this is what happens when you leave your sparring team and start training with like kids and [ __ ] like because you know he trains with his kids and [ __ ] you know i just feel like mcgregor didn't have that fire that he usually has even when the fight like started mcgregor usually has this bounce to him his confidence this time around he was just kind of like you know whatever and i thought it was going to be a good fight found there were some good [ __ ] fights and the last time they fought mcgregor tko poirier six years ago and since then like poirier's been whipping ass like he went eddie alvarez abs he fought max holloway whipped his ass he fought dan hooker whipped his ass and mcgregor man mcgregor caught it cold man i was so surprised though because you know how many people have money on mcgregor you know how many people thought mcgregor was gonna come shut it down he said i'm a knockout dustin poirier in 60 seconds within 60 seconds and that's one thing i love about the ufc like anybody could get it anybody could get knocked down anybody has a chance to be a champion you know and i love to see like people so cocky like so confident like yeah i'ma [ __ ] destroy this dude imma you know body this dude and then to get completely shut down like to totally eat your words like that [ __ ] is so satisfying to me i just love the competitiveness man that's like the only sport i follow is ufc i don't really watch football basketball like nah i don't really keep up with that family i only [ __ ] with ufc and that's really about it back to this dosey lotto man this [ __ ] i feel like a strong head buzz like pressure in my temples i feel a little bit like a slur like a like a real slow down like the high is pretty heavy you know perfect nighttime strain end of the day stream it tastes so good man it tastes super fresh and it just smells

call SML we need you to subscribe and while you're there I need you to hit that notification bell and also just like me because I'm pop mom and you guys already love me anyway so make sure you're going in that love but Ananya to guys today I know have been one like a total hiatus but maybe about a week or two now just because of the holiday break so I appreciate you guys hanging in there making sure you go to my videos as soon as they drop on leave Wednesdays I appreciate it I came back with something bigger this week guys I have Peck woods not to be confused with back woods this is tactless this is packwood's dot la is out of Los Angeles and I am so excited so be the proud owner of three of them I have all three pack words from LA they're now at planted 13 so you can get packwood's in nevada now at planted 13 so shout out to shot planted 13 that always hook me up with the latest that comes out I got all of these and Nevada from them they have an exclusive one called alien og so I'm excited I have all three so what I want to do today is just do a simple product review with you guys I will include all the links to Packwood's la comm so you guys can go in a site find out with new strands that they're coming up with but I'm just excited about the company so what they have done is infused rolling papers that look like blood papers and they're not they're a handmade hemp wrap paper that they put a vein into it to make it look like it was like an actual plant wrapper this guy's is special because they did three different infuse menteur this they have a concentrate in it they have a premium flower and then on outside they dust it with Keith so I don't even know how strong this is gonna be I don't I don't know how many puffs I'm gonna be able to get all I know is I'm gonna be a little out so I don't want you to judge me but we're gonna get into this I have three brands here this one is the alien OG hopefully you can see that this one is exclusive to Planet 13 once again shout out to them they are sold out maybe out of this one you guys have to call them and see this one is called GABA and this is a hybrid so is the alien og so both of these are hyper some remember hybrids want to keep you nice in the middle that way you can feel the head body high but not too high now this one the purple one is called purple punch and this one is an indica so today I'm not going to smoke Invicta I'm also not gonna smoke this particular hybrid Agathe I'm gonna go for the alien og because I am an alien and I want to get a shot off the plane 213 because this one was exclusive you might not see this one on the market I'm not sure so I wanted to kind of give my review to them as well what I thought of the one they made just for planting 13 customers so we're gonna get into this I'm gonna remove these two to the side so first of all I'm going to just talk about the packaging because you my peeps know when I do a product review I go there I go all the way there first of all I love that this can't break I do know they're going for $60 at the shop so they have $60 here in Nevada we can look up and see what they're going for Vegas but this is $60 so for $60 to Graham would concentrate premium flower and they keep one outside that does an amazing deal and I love that you can't break anything so you don't have to silver fragile because I mean your product is fragile but I love the date took the time to kind of like really design it where it's eye-catching as well and even if you see it inside of this place like it's playing 13 they have done the displays so beautifully so shout out to the pack was marketing team in LA y'all did that it also kind of reminds me in a weird way of a Kylie lipstick if y'all agree with me pop peeps just tell me that in the comment it really does it has that whole trippin thing on the side so this is really a good packaging I I'm impressed with packaging didn't even think that so you just roll it off it's a roll and I hope my camera can get to this so let me come up I want you guys to really see that when you first pull it out and you can really smell it the scent on this is I just love the smell okay so if you can see them holding my hand up you can see the key fits nicely dusted on it outside this part of it is a glass tip so it's gonna allow you to like kind of burn it evenly so you get a nice draw every time you pull that's what the glass tip is supposed to doing this is a nice sized glass citize I would say that's a couple of inches I don't know if you can see that real close up but that's like a two inch glass that's really nice to me it feels like if you had a mini cigar in a way so I kind of I love the feel of it it's nothing to it but to do it we're gonna get into it anything I like that's a blunt or the palm rolls or anything like that I like to light mines with the hemp I know this is a little piece of this is hemp rope I like to light it with that that way it gives me some type of control instead of letting my lighter control everything so that's how I'm gonna do it so choose the you pot peeps shot the Packwood's LA and let's get this alien og from shot planted 13 let's I like to inhale just to make sure I'm pulling everything I must say lighting getting I thought the pool would be happy they go be a lot heavier and it's not it's really smooth and I guess it has something to do with the glass tip now I can tell if you can tell I lit it wrong in here but it should have a nice even lip and because that keep us on the outside it shouldn't burn through fast that's what it shouldn't do if you find yourself in you lit it the wrong way just let it take its time and let they kind of like let it breathe and it'll evenly start to burn around so what I like is that you don't have to put the whole piece in your mouth it burns real light you can just put your mouth right on a tip just like my shirt be on the lookout for shop pop mom for 20 years oh I got that weed weird I like this a little dude not sure what premium flower I do know that the concentrate is nice and to keep this not even coming off on my hand I love that so let's talk a little more in depth about this back once I got my smoking hat on you know I've seen Rick Ross smoked this I've seen you waka flocka the baby little baby what's that other baby skittles baby I don't know one of them other babies they've all had this and now I'm hot moms at it I gotta do this I need a friend shout out to any of my papi friends that want to come share cuz I don't know if I'm gonna finish this this is this is a lot I might have this for the next couple days it's two grounds one person should have to finish this off seriously what did you say when you hi you just don't know what to say I guess you say that [ __ ] was good huh no I hate that y'all see me like this cuz I'm gonna be rolling I don't even know me get anything else doing this is too much this is probably not the best product reveiw to have done I'm super afraid of my life right now but this is nice you know what this would be great for like people that are having bachelor parties or bachelorette parties New Year's Christmas you can get them the people if you live in a legal state oh I can't move to this come to the East Coast Jesus [Music] Oh also Packwood's shout-out to y'all have made a collaboration with cocoanuts which some of the celebrities have teamed up to make these into like chocolate edibles kind of thing so check out backwoods la calm because they got a lot of interesting collaborations like they did a collaboration with planted 13 they're doing it with celebrities so shout out to them definitely gonna go to pack once when I go to LA cuz this is pretty cool in the light so stoned and how many puffs that I take I don't even know if somebody keep it count I wish somebody was here to play this is what they do to me pop beats they just leave me in a room with filming and just tell me to go for my own okay I'm really high seriously you don't think it too high he's just like alright I'm over it I'm like hi okay I think I hit this at least maybe 10 times which is extreme okay this is my review of a Little J first of all I'm high I'm really high and I just don't even know this hormone right now seriously I don't even I don't even know what to say I mean for once I am truly I think it's strong I for what a high grade us I feel like my body is just like somebody else came and took off really nice somebody named Adele a no Gina so somebody can come take over your body if you did a little G because I don't feel I don't know oh I probably wish I had a friend this year went that way I can have somebody to give me feedback and I know Papeete y'all wish to do that but you're not here right right here matter of fact you try it exactly it's like a calming effect but you just feel like hmm maybe I should take it slow like I feel like I can do things but I should probably take it slow I feel like if you were sharing with this this was someone you don't have to worry about them soggy enough to tip its glass so it's really like one stay sturdy you're not sometimes you you roll a blunt and then they get all saggy at the tip of it and you gotta pull it back together they've already solved that issue so this is a great cheerful I would suggest you buy it this holiday season share it with your friends you can put it out as you see I'm probably one hit just another day so this is definitely a two day if you buy yourself this is a two day situation it's no way this is no way it's just no way like I'm cool put old day I feel great about this situation would I buy it hell yeah yeah I like the alien og I do I really do and this key thing is fascinating it really is because it's not like coming off on my hands or anything Frank it don't come on that's just like amazing oh my burn my nose oh [ __ ] I feel cool this out oh I'd say that like I got a young Stoli if I put it alright guys here's my Beulah spec would if I had to give five stars I would definitely get them five pot leaves on these these is they they're the way you hold them they strung in your hand they burn slowly not burning fast I've been at this for about an hour or so 35 minutes it's a good burn if you were smoking a regular blunt you're [ __ ] we've been done so backwards y'all got pop moms 5 leaves I'm gonna try these other two catch me on instagram to see how these to turn out guys but I wanted to make sure that I share with all my pop peeps the alien og which was exclusive to

cush and cam Valley cush is a 70/30 sativa dominant strain and from what I found out the THC levels on this can get to 23% so she's pretty strong pretty high up there the genetics on the strain is this is chem dog cross with San Fernando Valley oh gee cush and these are two of my favorite strains I really love Campbell others.you of course my favorite strain or one of them you know top five definitely and this time I've got Leo G cush and all the cushions San Fran Bally oh gee coach is my favorite both of these because of the happy euphoric high that they have and these two combined this is a really wonderful strain and I want them going all the way out to americanus and they had this so very very happy to pick this up man really wonderful strain if you need some kind of mood boost you know want to elevate yourself you got low mood or something this is really good for that it's kind of motivated and get you out there this kind of makes you want to go and do something you know it's motivating it's got a happy happy euphoric high to it strong cerebral high if you like you depress and stuff like that this will help take care of that really wonderful for stuff like stress depression anxiety great for the pain relief as well I've won it from what I read good for insomnia good for anorexia I know yeah and of course the stress and all that other stuff the depression you know this is really wonderful for that this is a really good strain day to say if you got if you're in if you're stuck in some kind of funk this will help kind of pull you out of that and kind of like get you out there you know something just thought of go outside you gotta get some fresh air you gotta go meet some people you know see people mingle interact with other people being there being a hermit inside you can get depressing you can get bad for your health so having strings like this they really do help get you out there and kind of mingle and stuff as far as the negatives effect of this the only thing I could find uh was it gave me munchies that's the only thing I didn't experience any cottonmouth or crash with this this is a really really good day time strain I totally love medicating with this and I'm glad I picked up a little bit more than I usually do because mmm well I saw that this was cam dog it's Amador Valley og cush is like man I gotta grab some of this stuff so show you what the hits are like because there is some cuff to this but other than that it's a very nice tasty strain it's earthy kind of earthy woody nough stew it kind of Foresti it feels like some kind of forest earthiness woody piney a really wonderful strain we'd love to see the shatter of this stuff it's a hundred and four in here right now I'd open that door but it's gonna be even more hot man but still it's tolerable I really love this train this is a new favorite of mine man I know I say that with a lot of the shoes I smoked seriously chem dog crossed the San Fernando Valley oh gee cush awesome stream awesome connect a combination and this is my County connection from what I understand so they got some good stuff so this is a good strain I totally love it man cam Valley Kush wonderful stuff was totally grab this stuff again man", "htEfpW6Vj6w": "what if we cheer medically fit here looking at the firewalker OG by r ln genetics i'll have a 10 or 12 pack I don't remember two

ac/dc Harlequin sour tsunami so we're not quite sure what the THC CBD ratio is but ac/dc is a 20 to 1 Harlequin sour tsunami our Harlequin most crosses either tsunami or sour tsunami have been a 20 to

is a mix between the Albert Walker strain sour and the man extreme so this shatter is from wellness farms and has the same coloring that you would find dinosaur DNA and if this was any more gold a Spanish guy would kill a Mayan over it [Music] smells dank kind of think of like a basement apartment with a dope record collection it kind of smells like a gummy worm dropped in dirt that you had the

"how's it going YouTube I'm always blazing here back with another video today is gonna be a strain review I have a joint rolled up of some master OG so let's get right into this sesh and the strain review basically Master og is a indica screen the lineage of Master og is Master Kush crossed with Empress Kush which is kind of funny I thought Master og would be a Master Kush crossed with OG Kush but it's actually not so yeah let's jump right into this review I'm outside today as you can tell in my backyard it's a nicer day to day 15 degrees not too much Sun but what can you do you know it's better than being minus 10 freezing with a jacket on so I'll enjoy this February weather smoking a joint with you guys and do a little review so anyways I'm gonna give you like the looks of this bud that I got because I have only nugs inside right now it is a very like dark green nug dark green in color I would say nothing the nug is dark green but yeah so it's a darker green color lots of crystals very dense sticky weed this patch was pretty stinky it has that like piney gas eNOS and earthiness from the OG and the master but yeah overall the looks of the strain is pretty nice nice and frosty den snugs but like I said it's a little bit on the darker green side which some people like some people don't like to me it doesn't really matter but yeah let's fire up this LP by have rolled and yeah will tell you how this master OG tastes but anyways how you guys doing how's your February going what kind of weather do you guys have right now in Canada Toronto Ontario it's supposed to be like usually in the negatives right now -1 -4 around there but today is plus 15 which is kind of unusual I guess for our Canadian weather sorry for lots of background noise there's a lot of people in the area and cars driving by and all kinds of [ __ ] but I'll try and talk a bit louder for the video but yeah this strain is actually a really good I smoked their joint of it yesterday and it's a really really good night time strain let me just get this thing lid so right off the bat you can taste that pine enos to it very very piney earthy taste which I guess some people like and some people don't like if you're a big OD fan then you're gonna like this screen because it's very reminiscent of that OG earthiness and almost pine eNOS but um in my opinion I'm not really a fan of that flavor profile of pine eNOS and like earthiness I like more of like a sweeter floral like fruity strains that's just perfect personal preference sorry as you guys can see I don't know if it's gonna focus but the ash is burning very very white so you can tell it's a really good flush on this this master OG I don't have any effects of it right now like and you don't feel any difference so I'm gonna wait a bit for the effects sorry I'm just trying to fix this Knut I don't know if you can tell I hate when [ __ ] like that happens well yeah I thought I'd change it up today just because lately it's been a lot of like inside glass reviews and like dab videos and stuff like that so I thought I'd just you know change it up a bit smoke a joint with you guys because I know a lot of people like the actual strain reviews because Bud is a little bit easier to get your hand on hands on sorry so people like to see reviews of that so they can compare to their strains that they're getting or picking up but yeah for the effects of this master OG it's very master OG like if you've ever smoked master master OG as you can tell this is already starting to hit me I'm talking about Master Kush it's very reminiscent of Master Kush because if you've ever smoked master cushion you know that it takes about like 5-10 minutes for it to kick in and when it does kick in it's a heavy stone and I can tell you right off the bat that I don't feel any effects at all right away but I do feel like creeping behind my eyes and behind my head like Master Kush but overall it's actually a really really smooth smoke not coughing I'm not like Oh dying out here it doesn't really expand the lungs too much another thing too that people don't realize is your joints and how they smoke and how smooth they are also comes down to the role how good your joints are excuse me that one got me there oh yeah comes down to the role so I don't know my roles are pretty tight they don't flop a lot they're pretty tight rolls they burn very smooth you know like I can throw this on the floor do whatever looking literally fell on the floor pick it back up the cherry doesn't fall out so that's another thing that I noticed a lot is your smoking experience also comes down to how good your joints are like how you roll them as well as how properly grown the marijuana / weed cush whatever you want to call it because this shit's burning pretty white so it's a very smooth smooth smoke but um so the looks I gave you the smell I gave you it's a very piney earthy cushy smell the effects the effects that I'm getting are a very very indica dominant it starts like behind the eyes with kind of like slight relaxation and a heaviness kind of trickles down towards your body and makes you nice and relaxed but other than that it's basically a typical indica high you know you're just gonna want to sit down on the couch probably watch some TV chill out a bit I do notice though it does have almost like like a slight slight sativa effect to it cuz I'm right now very focused I'm not like I don't know how I would say a foggy or like in a haze if that makes sense I'm pretty focused and alert but yet again sorry then again I'm only halfway done this so so the effects are pretty good so look smell taste I gave you the taste that's the same as the smell that piney earthiness and yeah the effects I gave you the effect so that's pretty much everything that I can give for reviewing the strain but I'm just gonna give the ratings out of 10 now for looks it was a pretty nice bud it was on the darker green side lots of trichomes I guess it could have been trimmed a little bit better but even then it's not even that bad I've seen way worse so for the looks I'm gonna give it an 8 out of 10 for the master oh gee first smell I'm gonna be honest I'm not a big fan of that tiny earthy smell I guess from typical oh geez and master pushes and stuff like that so first smell I'm gonna have to give it a 7 out of 10 looks no taste for the taste that's the exact same as the smell so I'm gonna have to give it also 7 out of 10 look smell the effects the effects if you want a really good indica that's just gonna chill you out put you on the couch you can watch movies but you're also still like functional like you could still get up and do something this is a pretty good indicator that I would say so for the effects I'm gonna have to give it an 8 out of 10 so yeah that's basically the entire ratings out of 10 for master OG the overall rating out of 10 I'm gonna give it you know what I'm gonna give it an 8 out of 10 it's a pretty good strain if you come across it and you're a you're an OG guy like you like the OG taste the high the effects this is a really good one but yeah that's been the official review from I'm

higher channel this is Rory Kyle p screwed one", "X1EjMw5r3Cw": "hey what's good y'all j ping here checking in respectmyregion.com i am here today back with another west coast we tour review today's product that we're going to be reviewing is the northern fire flower 8 from amber valley an indoor cultivation a high quality premium brand here in california uh located up in redding area so someone that has a lot of respect here in california their group produces quality weeds though we're going to put some of it to the test the northern fire i was told is more of a sativa leading hybrid um sweet and kind of terpy almost like a jack career kind of thing so we're gonna do a one hit review here on the higher standards times keith caringbong and uh i'm gonna give you guys a score out of ten after i do a second hit so we're gonna dive right in oh as soon as you open the jar you get this nice sweet floral piney terps and i think that's part of what's really nice about ember valley is a lot of the noses the the smell the scent of the strains they tend to all really shine through this one has beautiful trichomes here i'll show you guys at least a little top part of the nug this this particular batch that i had came up came in a little bit smaller pieces not like they weren't full nugs but they were just super dense and just when i grabbed them initially it kind of broke apart so i don't know if they were just dry on the outside but i can tell you this on the inside of the buds super duper [ __ ] oh man super duper turkey like oh just pungent as [ __ ] so here we go let me break a little bit down and then we're going to dive right in i like to do two hits on these one snapper and uh then something either a little bit smaller or bigger depending on the size of that first snapper and the two hits really gives me a better idea on the consistency i like to pull from the top of the the top of the flower and then from the bottom of the nug to kind of give a good idea of how it actually is going to taste for the consumer let's go sweet tour baby here we go first hit okay now we're talking this keith airing mong is a ripper i tell you when it comes to the taste of the the the bowl that i just hit i'm getting this sweet citrusy floral pine and for me my sativas i like them two ways i like my sativas to be super duper orangey and and like kind of piney and then i'd like them to be this sweet and sour kind of like this northern fire or a dutch treat or a giant this particular flower this particular strain from member valley arguably one of my top three from them i really enjoyed the ice cream cake i really enjoy their zukis i guess top four i really enjoy their riff og i think that's a classic and then this northern fire for a sativa really does it for me that first hit really delicious i must say i must say it was pretty damn good however the second hit is gonna give us a better idea of the consistency so let's dive right in check out what that's looking like here we go let's find a good find a good piece right here you know something that's got a bunch of bunch of trikes and then bam so at this point great opportunity for you guys to go click subscribe right down below here we'd love for you guys to tap in follow all of our videos we've got i want to say five six people maybe uh maybe even seven people doing videos for the west coast we tour shout out to them for their help and for their reviews we're keeping it real we want to spread the good word here about the cannabis we're trying second hit here we go all right so on the second hit i would have to say even more pining i don't know if it was just the piece that i chose or again the potency of the bud but super sweet super duper floral super duper piney simple as that northern fire got great potency when it comes to the high i'm thinking a head high where i'm not exactly you know sober but i'm also not exactly able to lose focus like i can 100 concentrate now body high wise you have this nice euphoric wave of just relaxation but you also have this racy energy going through your body so probably something that would be good for working out playing sports et cetera um probably good for video games as well um west coast we tour man j ping here coming at you guys live score out of 10. i'm thinking it's a sativa i'm sitting around a nine we'll have to look into the potency of this on the actual shelves i'll have to go look at some some weed maps menus to be honest and see what some of the scores are but i think right for right now based on my actual experience i think it's an overall to nine i'd love to see the terpene information and the genetics listed i think that's a pretty standard thing for me to request and then i'd also like to see a slightly better trim job there were some pretty large sugar leaves on there and i did get one of the little crows crow's feet leaves so you know not like those are huge details but when we're talking about the best the best we're looking for perfection and are pretty close to it at least so but with all that said nine super duper high [ __ ] score great uh work to ember valley appreciate you guys for showing all the love and and working with us on the tour um make sure you guys tap in with higher standards in malibu if you're in the california or socal or la area they've got some really cool glass you guys

dispensaries and deliveries i'll see you guys down the road on the next west coast we tour subscribe to our youtube and i love you all appreciate you guys peace", "0gx7Czfft7I": "what's up guys baked cookie for 20 here with yet another dope-ass video and in this one I'm gonna be doing a stranger review on this orange fuel and I know what some of you may be thinking right now what the [ __ ] is orange whew I've never heard of this strain nor did I prior to actually seeing it the nice little scraggly bud here I've already been picking off of it we are gonna show you some close-ups here right after this warm-up so let's get into that and I will talk more about this orange fuel guys they go down in the comments let me know what you're smoking on let me know we're tuning in from definitely appreciate anybody watching this video so kudos to you man thank you you're appreciated Cheers going it on the Ross installed over here the orange peel man [Music] [Music] nice fatty warm-up head whoa well quite a few other things to smoking judge all right now we're gonna break into these buds and get some close-up so why not so I hope you guys enjoy [Music] this happened to me trikona the global bill of so many different colors to this though there's like slight darkness to it my cookies a nice line green in it some shades of brown from those hairs and telexes oh my god that dark green entity from that sugar leaf on that I love it don't orange guys look amazing all right let's get a good money shot of this orange fuel Oh beautiful all right so now that we've got the close-ups out of the way let's get into actually judging this blood when it comes to these strain reviews you want to try and cover every every aspect of when it comes to this blood you want to judge the taste the way it gets you go high you know there fix the way it looks of course you want to give off your first impressions as well so let's start off with the first impressions best coming in to CoStar I knew that there were gonna be a lot of vendors Richard meant a lot of bunk probably as well as a lot of good bud but what I was looking for was that top shelf that stuff that I don't get all the time greenie you know 10 a gram type of stuff um so when I came across this orange fuel right off tops it was something I wanted to take home right when he opened up the jar I saw a fully-developed trichomes I saw a very good nug structure I saw it was that I just wanted to pick up and just stare at man so that's definitely what led me to take it home without even trying it cracking open a bud just picking it up I could tell how dense it was so I was definitely most impressed by this wheat right off tops so I have a whole nug packed into this bubbler that I picked up from the highlight music festival to get a good taste test so let's get it guys Cheers mmm good slight little burn on the note gave off a perfect taste alright so taste and smell are kind of almost like the same for me because when it comes to bud I always always smell the nutrients if you're not flushing your plants right but when it came to this stuff right off tops the first thing in this mobile is like a Jack Herer essence with a slight slight smell of tangi like a orange peel or a nectarine and I don't actually know the genetics of this but so everything I'm talking about is just my opinion I don't actually know a factual type of stuff but it definitely definitely reminds me of some Jack Herer taste like it and you know it was said to be a 50/50 hybrid but I'm definitely feeling a bit uplifted rather than you know down and relaxed so tangi and Jack rare is what I would guess is where it gets its lineage from let's get another another little taste test here keep the ball rolling cheers guys mmm definitely just like a combination in decorator and some oranges man because Jack bear is a standalone strain where it just stays very sweet with slight essence of like earthiness but just utterly sweet but it just still has the undertone of those orange peels so that's what's making me think it's like @anjghie and uh and a jocular type of strain either or man is what it's reminding you whoa kion buzz you just dumped those first two you hit off both those bubblers and shout out to the last person that actually comes in on my video you suggested a video where I talked about the stages of getting high I will definitely be posting a video on that because I thought that was an amazing suggestion I've never even thought of making a video like that so thank you for that definitely have an official shadow for you in the next video because I forgot what your channel name was but back to the strain of you guys this orange fuel so far I'm feeling very cerebral my mind's racing I'm feeling very talkative my legs are shaking a bit so it's definitely it's a t-bird dominant strain not really feeling the indica sides of anything even though it was said to be a 50/50 definitely feeling more like a 90/10 type of sativa so far definitely feeling it behind the eyes not so much like in my legs or nothing I'm not Bobby I'm definitely feeling like I want to get up and just do some [ __ ] but I'd like to get some fat bond reps in and see what that does to us the orange fuel man guessing a sativa dominant straight so we covered the first impressions that taste the smell it's pretty much all we got left is really judging the high smells looks and tastes like a jack herer if I have to guess man you like @anjghie in there and those are so dancing this well developed who ever grew up in take my hat off to you sir you did a tremendous job tastes great easy to smoke gets you faded so cheers those when it hit a couple bong rips and gent are our overall judgment of the stuff man overall great to it you know see how Stoney gets us take a couple bucks here hope your smoke along with you man I don't know if I mentioned it but I should have Cheers [Music] [Music] like that one's a little too tight but probably best thought I didn't catch the ball cuz I did just clean the fat boy so it'd be a shame to get it super dirty that quick but before I go in on this pit bull to conclude this thing I'm gonna be sure to finish off this bubbler bull so Cheers all right that one is dancers as well as that one this is definitely a sativa dominant strain I'm getting uplifted and talkative for sure even after some fad bong rips let's just take this last one and give it our overall judgment as far as the high I'm loving it though I really don't smoke the tubas too too often but it's some good [ __ ] right here cheers guys [Music] almost [ __ ] up Oh you know that clock was only because it was a huge rip this stuff is ultimately really smooth pretty well flushed I mean obviously if you take a huge hit it's gonna make you cough all along what I suggest is orange peel to any of you guys yes do I remember who or where I got it from no it was from Kush stark walked up to a tent already faded and dehydrated and walked into this orange field so thank you to that person that gave me the orange peel if you just stop and watch this book down in the comments and let me know where I can find more because this [ __ ] is fire but until next time guys think I'm gonna tune on out of here if you enjoyed this little strainer you strain review whatever them have a be sure to give this video the thumbs up subscribe if you haven't already eating at your fix don't check out my other videos because they're all dope I have a lot of crazy hits other strain interviews all that good stuff man but until next time from bait 2420 have a good one guys peace", "Czac3Ii7GVQ": "wow welcome back fellow youtubers fellow viewers fellow medicators fellow subscribers fellow fellows cameras when this side of the screen now not over here last time there no it's here okay all right so here we go okay product review um here's the thing um this is a federally legal product it's uh 100 pure hemp some badass hemp it's been made federally legal per the 2018 farm bill which some people just don't understand or know that i guess and uh i'm hoping that people take the time to educate themselves so they can learn that it is um you have to be 21 or older i would personally give you to 18 i mean that you can go vote and die for your country and whatnot but products say 21 on them i would give you to a team but if you're not 21 or older there's the door see it over there looking at it you can look at it too and go um so i've had long talks with steve and margie over at med emporium they are awesome people there are a lot of companies and dispensaries and so forth that really take the time to make sure that they have great stuff but it all boils down to the farmers the farmers are the ones who start the process they're the ones who get things rolling they're the ones who and i mean rolling is rolling in case we're rolling um they're the ones who get it going nate they take the seed they put it in the ground and with their time and their love and their passion they make the beginnings of what we use to medicate and i got a long long history of conversations with steve and margie herself um over there at men emporium and i'm telling you every time i talk to these uh these two individuals i my knowledge grows vastly now i've had conversations with other farmers and other people like uh i'd say over the past like two or three months and my knowledge grows more and more with them as well but steve really is he takes so much time and so much care and so much love in his products his curing process is amazing i got to see some pictures of all the stuff being cured and things and mind blown i mean i know personally that they grow thousands of plants hemp farmers do not you know just they in a vest they grow thousands of hemp plants and then they do what they do and you think about they cure it but you i don't know if you think about the fact that this is a really big building and that there's a lot involved okay and wendy or not wendy sorry steve and margie they really take the time to just do it right and there are other farms like that because there's a sense of pride and and love in what they do so why would you want to do it any other way other than the best way and this is one of those companies or farms i'm sorry it's been a long day guys i mean it's i think it's like two o'clock in the morning here in pa so sometimes i get a little sleep deprivated well anyway i was saying so i didn't mean to nod off there sometimes i even bore myself um these guys here now i got a [Music] for you to gaze your eyes upon now this is the blue moon kush every time i look at this stuff i'm amazed so get out our handy dandy little walmart knife here which i took some time today to sharpen it work because i can't find my knife sharpener kind of crazy all right here we go there we go i can smell it now the bag's not completely open yet you can see and i can without that being sealed like that you would be able to smell this in the package so good job guys shout out to matt hemporium for keeping my herbaceuticals private i don't want anybody sniffing on my package and saying that i'm doing [ __ ] i'm not doing because i'm just a simple person i'm just here to review this stuff not go to jail so here it is let's get this bag open and get you a shot down

had to review it like why would you why did you get your hands on this and not review it i think that would just be crazy don't you don't you don't you how could i get my hands on this awesome looking

i don't think so i only know one fool and i wouldn't kiss them not my type always my favorite raw paper just a tip everything today breaking in these new hands [ __ ] drop syndrome or something i had like two new people i delivered pizza to today who wouldn't contract drop syndrome from one of them that would suck you know you pick up something you can't put down from somebody then i wouldn't consider that drop syndrome if you picked it up and you can't put it down okay so this uh lovely uh herbaceous material in my grinder here somebody asked me the other day i was rolling up out and about and i'm like why do you put the crutch in your mouth and tell you why because they're probably watching the person who asked me and i did tell them but you're gonna see firsthand what i was talking about when you get the crutch like moist it sticks to the paper helps you be able to roll it up i mean i just find it easier that way because like i can back this paper up like this all the way down to the filter like so and then zip right up like that i don't have to struggle to get it up there all right here we go i found it like the filters don't fall out too when you kind of moisten them i mean don't stop them just put it in take it out you know what i'm saying just a little moist a little tacky kind of like these videos tacky all right here we go um that's just amazing that's amazing excellent we're gonna toast it first like this i find it burns better this way and then kind of give it a draw oh yeah that's what i'm talking about minty it's got some sagey nudes yeah some sagey flavor in there and very hempy like there's like the cannabis-y flavor you know not terps so i don't know if you guys remember for the last time i made one of these videos how do you store flower's this big i mean like you just like like a [ __ ] you just break it all up throw it in a bag do you grind it all up and keep it for later well maybe you do but i don't every time i'm gonna make a video review one of these i go out to my local warmer and i buy me one of these big mama jamas big mama grandma yep it's empty and yes it smells like glass it's big now you take this and you go right in there hey boo boo boy how's about we go snuggle so pick a [ __ ] basket i think booboo would have rather had a jar of him that's probably what he really meant anyway probably picnic basket was probably code for a jorah it's huge these hardly fit in there they hardly they hardly fit in there down in the chair down in your chair down in the jaw then you just put the lid on some [ __ ] now here's what i do i take this sticker here and i cut it out with scissors i don't know maybe if i can do it with this pocket that's hard to say or not just like that i put it down in a jar that way nobody can question what it is does anybody could question it nobody can say that's marijuana it's coming with me belongs to me and it's my house i'd have to warn it keep the label be the smart thing to do so margie and steve have been at this for quite a many years and you can tell they know what they're doing shout out to margie and steve i have a promo code i'm pretty certain i do have a promo code um it's in the last video so i'll put in this next video in a description um i'll make sure i give their website information i'm not sure if i have a phone number for them you know i should start

with a sticker you can basically put anywhere on your notepad or whatever but stickers also get kind of stickers can get lost in the sauce if you feel them saying like it's on the back of a notepad yeah i got it on my bucket or whatever but magnets are cool i put that magnet on my fridge door and magnet just makes you feel like you got something you feel me it's a little substantial i think what i'm going to tell you excuse me i think what i'm going to try to do is come up with my own magnets this i'm loving the smell on this on a serious note uh the pine smell the it's a little citrusy not much a little and just that for real for real this guy has an attitude it's skunky uh i kind of want to say it's skunky wonky that's because i like i've been playing with my daughter all week and i

definitely do this outdoor this year everything goes good alright y'all peace out", "TrGNo1Iz6hI": "[Music] what's up guys simplisik here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another wax video i've tried cali blaze before don't get me wrong i've tried it i don't think i've made a video on it but i've tried stevie's um but yes i'll be playing a video right now but this is their tier two stuff i thought that 710 labs and and like uh rosin companies really do the tier one tier two tier three stuff so uh i was surprised that this company did it and i'm gonna tell you my original thoughts on this company when i tried stevie's was just some generic crc [ __ ] um this one slightly tastes like that but with uh like something more i don't know how to say it but this was actually 25 out the door and was recommended to me by the budtender shout out to the homie he said he watches my videos um but for 25 dollars uh for a tier two this i mean it's comparable to some bear labs that i've had but honestly i'd pay four more dollars for some bear labs um but yeah here it is i'll play the video right here it is uh when only the best will do all that stuff you actually rip these corners right here to open it but the it is a thin mint batter it's total cannabinoids of 88.62 thca is 77.89 thc 74.11 and cbd point eleven percent and then batch id all that stuff uh fairly new packaging about two months ago um but yeah i'll be playing it uh if you didn't see it in the video it's gonna be right here as well very uh he did say it was a batter i would say it smells a lot better than uh it tastes but the taste isn't bad i mean it's like crc the taste isn't bad it's just very generic and very it's all over the place you know what i'm saying like i've had many brands taste the same thing and it's just like so we're gonna be hitting it out of the dip you guys are probably wondering why i've only been using the dip i am a one device guy i've mentioned this many times you only have i mean i have a lot of devices as of today you know as of me getting them but when you just use one device you only get to clean one device you know what i'm talking about and if you're using like one every day it's just more for you to clean you know and i for one don't really like cleaning even though you must you must i can't stress that enough you must um i would say clean this every [ __ ] three days you know but you know what i'm talking about i just i just like to use one device but i have many devices for different situations i have the eno if i want to take a fat dab you know what i'm saying i have the smoke scene in case this one is out of battery i have the the dab x you know in case i want to be taking a dab and i only got a bong you know so this is awake and bake as well so we are going to be packing it back so let that melt down there taking a while but it's getting there all right so this is thin mints i don't know if i mentioned it cheers so like i said the very the very taste of crc that creamy that creaminess to it but there's a little something extra to it that you know it's very different from crc but for for its price 25 i definitely would get something else cool but definitely not bad this is the first time me smoking today so the effects are going to be as as pure i don't know as um oh don't ruin that again i'm interested in knowing if there's actually uh tier three in this maybe it's a lot better maybe i'll consider buying it i don't know but yeah i mean here it is right here i actually do have some other wax it's west coast here i believe and it's diamonds so be on the lookout for that video as well put that down there let's get some fat hits for you guys cheers usually i have my fan off let me turn it off it's affecting the smoke and i'm saying her the cloud but yeah let me know if you've tried cali blaze uh like i said i've tried their tier one stuff um they're tier two stuff it's all right and um yeah i don't know cheers though oh i should hit all right that's about it for this video as i'm cleaning this not the greatest tasting wax um i would have thought for tier two it would have tasted a little bit some extra you know what i'm saying like i don't know i don't know what i was expecting but it's definitely not i don't know for their tier one and their tier two to kind of taste the same it means it says something you know i don't know um but let me know if you've tried a good kelly blaze as far as like like i said the crc taste is not bad but when you're buying you know strains or a brand different brands and they're all tasting that same type of [ __ ] taste it kind of just gets to you but at the end of the day it's not a bad taste you know some people probably like that taste but this does have a little bit something extra on there i don't know what to exactly say it is but it's like crc and more i don't know but hopefully you did enjoy this video um like the video if you did enjoy it i'll see you guys in the next one peace out [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "q94MBgzPkWM": "welcome to juvenile styles twilight review make sure you subscribe for good content enjoy the show hey you welcome to my push review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with twilight review so this is twilight strain and it is 21.4 milligrams thc and it looks pretty good so this is on opened i rolled a joint out of a separate three and a half that i bought so i can open it up and show you exactly what you're gonna get with three and a half if you go and purchase your own three and a half so let's open it up and take a good look and let this join that joint up i also have um a pre-roll that i wanted to try out so i'll do a little review of it after we do the review of the twilight and i'll pack a bit of bowl of the twilight too and try it in the bong to see how good it is in the bong as well so yeah let's open it up first so it hits you like with a really strong lemon-like smell but it also is pretty sweet smell so it's not all sour but it does smell very good and it's a very strong smell so let's dump it out onto here so you can see so it's a really dark looking strain but it does look really nice the buds look very good very nice looking even the hairs are darker colored on the strain but it does look very good so let's light the joint up and review the taste and stuff as well so it does have a bit of a lim limit lemon lemon lemon-like taste to it but it's not overbearable or overwhelmingly strong with lemon because it is a bit sweet-tasting i could have busted it up a little better but that was my issue there we go it's going good now so it does have a very nice taste to it like lemony but like a little spicy sweet like tint to it it does taste very nice it's not just lemon tasting that's just a bit of the flavor to it it is pretty strong flavor and it does to seem to be a very good three and a half so i'll start by rating the account and i'll give it i'll give it a 4.5 out of um five because it's pretty good i'll give it a 4.5 because it doesn't seem to be very small come nice juicy buds you know not small little ones it doesn't look very it doesn't look small it looks like nice juicy buds it does look very nice so i'll give the uh i don't want to be too generous i'll give it a four out of five because it is pretty good so so yeah i'll give it a four out of five for a towel so the taste the taste is a very good taste it's a very strong flavor but a lot of weed is lemony so i really like to have something a little original with a bit of a different taste to it so i'll give it a three and a half for flavor because it's good it's very good tasting but it's not very original so it is very good so i'll give it a three for taste for four for a count because it is pretty good so let's try to put a bit into the pong and see how good that is let's set this down i'm just gonna bust up a bug with my fingers and put it in so let's light this bad boy up hmm like yeah it does have the lemony taste but it does kind of feel like it has like a bit of sweet spiciness to it it's pretty good um so i guess i'll smoke a bit more of this and we'll light up the pre-roll the pre-roll is more appealing it's called it's a weird name but that's what it's called so we'll light that up so i guess let's finish some more of this joint so i can get a better rating on how good the high is and what not i'm starting to feel pretty good though so yeah this is more appealing it's a weird name for weed but let's light it up and try it out so they seem to be nice three worlds i don't know how well they're burning stuff but they look nice so so i guess we can light up that other joint sorry about that my camera slipped a little bit so it's all right though let's finish it off i'm going to loosen it up a little bit because it seems to be really packed but let's light it up so this one kind of seems to have more of a spicy herb taste to it it tastes very nice yeah it's like a nice herb taste to it but it's a bit spicy tasting but it tastes good because i've had some spicy weed that didn't taste the best but this stuff actually has a very nice taste because the herb actually mixes with it and tastes really good so i can't really rate the account it was just a pre-roll joint but for the taste i'm going to give it an extra point for uh original because it definitely tastes a little bit more original than the last stuff if it tastes nice like and it's a little different i'm not i've never had too much stuff that has a similar taste to this so i do like that and i enjoy it and this one is trying to see the percentage see what it is 21.4 this stuff is so i'll give it a 4 for the flavor because it's very nice tasting it's really original and i do enjoy it it tastes very nice so yeah if you get a chance to try the more appealing it's a hybrid try it out tastes pretty good seems to be nice and strong with that i give i'll give it a four yeah like i said an overall four i can't rate the account or whatever so i'll give it an overall four but with that i'll leave it there and i'll say thanks a lot for dropping by here juvenile styles i really do appreciate everybody that spends time out there today over here with me you have a good day peace now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more close to roll and watch another show now i'm blasting out all right plant progress start of week seven we got this nice girl looking oh nice sweater hairs all starting to pop out and look good and then we got these ones over here looking nice and these smaller ones down here they're on six because i plant started them ones all like a week or so behind so yeah those are all doing very nice you", "di5IVd9pECg": "all right i was about it i was about to smoke i was about to smoke one of these and i was like hey might as well make a video on it right so i'll make a video on it and we're gonna have box hot box the bean [Music] let's see if you guys haven't seen any of my other videos i have two other videos of jeter i have a one gram in the xl this is going to be the baby jesus um these are [ __ ] gas man literally um one hand of these will get you [ __ ] feeling different already like if you and your friends are not heavy smokers you could literally split one of these between three people um i split i mean we split one between three people and honestly i got pretty lit off of it i mean like it wasn't to the point where i wanted to but it got me way more high than i thought it would these things are amazing man this is a five pack of baby jeters this is a fire og is gonna be a hybrid for some reason this package doesn't have any of the thc information you can see everything's all blank maybe it was like the setup case or something the display case or something but the manufacturer date and packaging date was september 23rd so a little bit old about over a month old it's a five pack premium indoor flower with distillate oil and keef weighing at 2.5 grams these periods are going to be weighing around a half gram each burning time is five minutes let me go ahead and open them you gotta push down that comes sealed already open to seal you can see there's four of them in there it comes with five already smoked one all right i know this is all right y'all know this is a weird angle and [ __ ] but i'm in my car so i don't really have a good place to set it up i'm gonna go ahead and take one of these out spark it up um i already know how these are hitting man these are [ __ ] crazy small ass [ __ ] joint bro but [ __ ] hits like smack so let's go ahead and spark this [ __ ] up got the clipper spark it uh are [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] love these joints if you guys haven't tried any of the jesus strains before i recommend the fire og i recommend the gelato 33 and i recommend the durban poison the banana cushion was cool it sounds good but i don't know to me just it wasn't like i was like one of my least favorite strains that i've had i probably had all of them already but the only one i think that i haven't had has to be maybe the ramadan grapefruit that's probably like one of the only ones i haven't had you can see i've been hitting it for a cool amount it's barely starting to to burn down they also have um a different line of these where they're not infused it's just like a fire ash puro and they have different strains on them so i need to make a review on them because they have some pretty good strains i don't remember off the top but i remember seeing some cool ones it was a lot of strains i haven't had before yeah these pills are really good though man i mean one is like all right two of them will get you highest like though especially in the morning have you just smoke with these especially in the morning man you'll be smoking these they will hit hard um this is already midday i already made a video if you guys haven't seen made a video about the dab cap so i'm already pretty lit but it's a good joint you know just to like get you level-headed um you know if you're not lit so so far i've been recording for four minutes and 20 seconds so um that five minute mark is pretty true i guess the first minute of this clip was me talking about it though so and i'm talking about like that first part where you guys see me come to the car that was like a different clip so i'm talking about this clip right now it's recording when i put the camera up is that four minutes and 45 seconds we hit the five minute mark now five minutes three seconds also what's really cool about these is that they do not turn off if you cannot hit it for like a cool minute and it'll still be on by the next time you want to take a hit officially been smoking over five minutes so it's true burning time is about five minutes if this weighs a half gram it must be a 0.4 flower point five of a key point five oh some wax i'm guessing that's how it works um unless you count the point five gram as a pure flour but i don't know uh that's gonna be it for the there's gonna be a for the video though y'all hopefully y'all enjoyed the video hopefully i'll tie y'all son hopefully i'll learn soon hope y'all got lit with me and um catch on the next one man peace okay bye", "LoEACbznlD8": "what's up youtube it's your boy against our condo brand new video here guys what's going on welcome back guys to the next strain review guys that's right so

smoking that gas well now i'm actually smoking gas og guys this right here gas ogees though shares guys now i'm actually smoking gas so cheers okay so oh wow that tastes quite crazy it has like a i have an interesting interesting taste to it actually it tastes kind of weird tastes kind of weird at first but it tastes i mean it doesn't taste bad it tastes it tastes it definitely hits you though you're like what the hell like the flavor at first you know but it tastes i mean it tastes pretty good still tastes pretty good for the most part it's not like bad but you can definitely taste it right at the beginning but i have some water just a cup of water here um just a little ice water to help me out today those are boys out of soda out of all that [ __ ] you know what i mean but so it's not good for you anyway so i guess it's probably for the better but oh all right all right guys well right now i'm watching justice the new justice league uh zack snyder cut just league on hbo max right now it's super good so far i'm enjoying it i'm about two hours into it right now so it's all about two hours to go but uh so far it's really good i'm watching the part with the flash now the flash is like backstory now and well actually not the first black story but i'm watching the part where flash and batman meet up now or he's not batman yeah he's bruce wayne right now but you know what i mean like have a bruce or meet up for the first time that's the part i'm at it's certain three you guys are wondering what part of the movie i'm at right now so so far i'm enjoying the hell out of it this is the this is one of the best best uh like movies i've seen a while like uh dc movies i've seen in a while you know what i mean this is like it's really it's pretty good this is a pretty good [ __ ] movie so far that day zack snyder did a great job so far with the with that with the stuff i've seen so far you know what i mean like he's saying so far i don't know why but i i have feeling i'm feeling it i'm definitely feeling gaso g is kicking in guys it is kicking in i've got the good body high already from head to head hey what's up guys all right so i'm back guys not totally after the last clip by the way but it's only been about 15 minutes i want to say so i don't know so i'm sure i was going to close out later but i was going to close out now i'm feeling good guys seriously like wow yeah i'm [ __ ] high as [ __ ] right now i'm very very high this is the highest i've been in a while um i'm actually going to take more rips too i took two reps for you guys and then those two reps i took on camera actually all i needed because i'm i got a body high from head to toe right now guys it's crazy i i don't know if i'm gonna stream now i'm not sure because now that i'm [ __ ] this high i feel like i might just watch the rest of my movie which right now i'm watching watching uh the snyder cut of the you know justice league right now and it's pretty fun good movie by the way very good movie so um boys are doing good though um so anyways i wanted to get into this really quick before i let you guys go though um so i always give you guys the information about straight by the way you know what i mean and let's say that i went on i researched it and uh yeah it's the first time it's ever happened to me there's actually no information about stray by the way at all nobody knows anything about this straight apparently okay so all i was able to find guys no joke was the fact that it is a hybrid for sure so this is gas and og together so gas og okay and so it's two different hybrids it's two restraints it's a hybrid of two straights that's all i do know and um i mean i don't know if it's indica dominant sativa dumb and nothing like that but but what i do know is that the way i'm feeling right now and i'm feeling a good bye heart from head to toe and i feel like i don't feel that couch locked or anything i feel pretty good i'm just chilling for the most part so i would say sativa dominant that's what i would say that's what it feels like it feels like a very strong sativa so it's very stressful to even dominate so i'm thinking more sativa less less endicott probably that's what i'm thinking you know what i mean which is very nice the very nice high i'm enjoying it i don't feel like i'm gonna crash out which is very nice like the last couple mornings i felt i was gonna crash out a little bit because the weight i was smoking on was a little bit you know a little bit stronger than what i would what i would normally smoke during the daytime so but we we pushed through it though we trooped through it for the most part the last few days we still didn't fall asleep we didn't we didn't let our bodies crush too hard you know we still were able to stand all day go to bed a decent hour that night and all that stuff you know what i mean but yeah but it was just like last two days have been pretty crazy because i've been pretty [ __ ] stoned every [ __ ] morning like like way ridiculously like after all that [ __ ] it was like it was like the purple what was that the grape gelato or whatever it is it was that stuff you guys that sounds like strong on the indica side okay that's so right there was putting my ass to sleep a little bit low-key yeah anyways i don't like that i don't like weed to push to sleep you know unless it's just like best times i have like a lazy day that i don't mind you know what i mean but for the most part i try not to sleep during the daytime at all i try to not take any naps because i don't want to i don't want to be up late at night i'd rather just crash out at a decent hour every night like 10 o'clock at night be already ready to go bed you know and not be tired be tired actually tired and actually want to go bad you know what i mean so all right guys anyways i'm rambling now so like i said there's no information about it all i found was a hybrid and i would say it's more on the sativa side so it's a sativa dominant hybrid okay for you guys so you guys are wondering so with that said um i give it to that dad always 10 out of 10 you guys already know i love this strain the stream's amazing i'll definitely recommend it to anybody out there that needs weed for body pain whatever right my life's one off it's okay other than that though guys it's working or kyle having a good night guys and i'll see you guys all day i'll see you guys next video dean a little bit of sharing notified and yes we just hit 880 subscribers which is your 20 away from 900. let's get to 900 okay we're 120 away from 1k let's get to 1k you guys already know all right guys how are you guys today's the boys peace", "zZ1-HZXeaVY": "what's going on guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be smoking this pre-roll from Lux rolls now Lux rolls is a company that sells cones that you can stuff yourself to make these epic ass parade rolls I really like these some people can't roll as well as others so if you want a nice big fat joint for a special occasion sometimes it's hard to do so this company literally allows you to make a cone like the raw cones but these ones are way more bougie they come in these nice little tubes so they have one that looks like a hundred dollar bill they have even fatter ones then they have the classic cannon which is the one that we're gonna be smoking today personally this is my favorite size out of all the ones they make I really like that it comes with a wood tip I really like just the amount of wheat that fits in it it's about 3 grams maybe 4 I didn't actually scale it out but without further ado I said you spark this up [Music] I put live breath and keep on the outside of it oh yeah that keep his burden I really love the size of these joints bed they are [ __ ] huge so on the video where I cut open a $50 pre-roll I said that I could make one myself for less money and a couple of you guys told me to do it so that's what I'm doing in this video I stuffed Durbin poison flour in this joint there's sour tangi live resin coated on the outside and then I rolled that Keef we keep this bird away faster than the actual bug but I'm not too concerned as of now the Durbin poison flower that I put in here was gifted to me by my buddy he grew it himself and like I'm really picky about weed but I gotta say this dude's Durbin poison was like out of this world I truly appreciate it you know who you are bro thank you very much free weed is always the best weed especially when it's good [Music] I got a radio this very second guys like I said in the pre-roll video I think it concentrates and Keith belong on the inside of the joint but I wanted to actually recreate that $50 role so that's why I put it on the outside it's definitely wasteful like there's way more smoke coming out of this and a normal joint and that smoke that could be going in your lungs let me show you a little close to finish you can see the oil actually melting down I put it decent amount of live resin on the outside of this whoo it's just got me shaking dude this is the first day of smoke today I'm lit oh my god guys this thing is ripping so hard for those of you guys who don't follow me on snapchat you probably don't know I just had surgery on my nose I had a deviated septum so basically I couldn't breathe well through it so for the last week I've just been recovering and man holy [ __ ] like my collar ins went down so much good I didn't smoke normally I don't take tolerance breaks but in the situation I was like bucket let me just not really smoke a like one edible one day but ultimately my collar ins went down with a block time dude the flavor oh this is so good the sour tangi library is mixed with the Durbin poison it's just a super [ __ ] fruity medley of deliciousness when the key that's a nice touch to my Keef is like all PA dispensary medical weed Keef so it's like some delicious fire beautiful Keef this is definitely better than the pre-roll in the $50.00 pre-roll video just because I know the weed was fresher the oil was live resin not co2 oil and the kief was definitely like better keep a lot of the dispensary chief I just know it's just shitty Keef that's why it's so cheap versus like when you actually get Keef from your weed and your grinder like there's no Keef better than homemade Keef [ __ ] yo oh okay you hit guys your turn ritual toks I'm so glad to be boomer the surgery and pretty much recovered with a deviated septum I couldn't really breathe well through my nose it was like breathing through a coffee straw instead of like a McDonald's straw if I was congested at all I just like naturally could not breathe so I got the procedure it's a septoplasty and annoyed ectomy I honestly don't even really know what the procedure is like I just was like cooled up do what you got to do but now that that process is over I'm back to smoking and I not gonna lie guys I missed it like there's no withdrawal really from not smoking for me like the worst thing is like I can't sleep well that's like really the biggest issue with me when I don't smoke I am totally not too profitable and able to sleep like I smoke so much I should date myself basically by the end of the night I remember my entire childhood growing up I would never be able to fall asleep when it was bedtime like I would always land that for an hour - just trying to fall asleep I think that's why I started to like weed when I started smoking it so I was like oh my first time smoking weed I got so [ __ ] stoned you guys like mids and heads was like the two options back then and like people around me all smoked mids but for whatever reason this day that I decided to agree with these guys they had heads and before we didn't get back to the skatepark I am so [ __ ] stoned like I remember getting out of the car and walking back to the skate park and being like holy [ __ ] I've never experienced anything like this like I was just giggling colors were more vibrant and I just like everything was just funny and I was like in love with the feeling but what my mom picked me up and I got back home I remember I literally fell asleep in our living room like half on the Ottoman half on the couch and like my stomach was just like in like the open air between it like it literally was just like based out of sleep for some reason they just thought it had like a long day at the skate park and didn't say anything about it but how the stones [ __ ] once I got past the keep you guys and the oil it has just had a really nice slow even burn you see that notice bro can do French inhales all day now no problem buy one of these for yourself and just stuffing it with weed is so much cheaper than buying pre-rolls from the dispensary and then you know it's actually inside it even if the pre-roll is out the dispensaries were recently priced usually there's just [ __ ] mids in there so it's nice being able to stuff your own fire weed in there and there's only being like thirty bucks instead of fifty dollars to 100 bucks but seriously if you think about it this cone was like two bucks say an eight the weed is like $25 I maybe put like ten dollars worth of live resin on it which is really really stretching it so we're at like 35 bucks and then like keep this free but let's say five bucks forty dollars for something that is literally twice the size and twice the experience of what that $50 pre-roll was not in California not trying to be a hater on pre-rolls I just like I always would smoke them and I'd be like these are kind of shitty and now that I've like broken a couple it open did the science I'm just like yeah welcome I'd rather stuff my own getting rough I love the wood tip though you can just rip the [ __ ] out of it and it has that black and milds okay green and spicy vibe to it and I just like it so much more I forgot to actually have this one though this is probably their coolest kit they got they put you down for a second it comes with two in one two he comes with this giant cannon I think I felt like five grams and the last one I put in this and then it comes with another one tip cone pretty much like the one I'm smoking right now let me know if you want to see another mini of me doing something like this with these also I'm going to Colorado so you guys so expect a couple more Colorado videos coming up let me know if there's any products you want me to check out while I'm out there or if there's any strain specifically you want me to pick up or any companies you want me to try one thing I do definitely want to find is some like sauce cartridges or just some sort of cartridges with some crazy consistencies because I know there's a lot out there okay I'm so done I definitely just [ __ ] my day up especially now that I just don't really have a good tolerance getting towards the end here you guys hope you guys enjoyed this video click like if you did subscribe for more to make sure you follow me everywhere else

everybody as your boy heaven sent um in today's video i'm uh kind of uh having some camera technical difficulties so we're back to recording on the phone but it won't be uh too much of a difference i hope not oh [ __ ] gonna uh be session in this video um it's kind of gonna be a review kind of just gonna be a sesh what i have today i'm gonna be listening to some music and [ __ ] too but um i'll put that on when i start session what i have today is um a little joint it's a pre-roll from the dispensary it's a indica hybrid i guess one gram pre-roll by evidence the that's a call i wonder if all this [ __ ] is backwards for you guys no it can't be backwards all right wait it has to be back [ __ ] it i guess that's one difference between recording on the phone and on um something else on the camera with the [ __ ] on something else i'm already high as [ __ ] as you guys can tell um i already did some uh blinkers this morning but then uh i got this pre-roll dropped off so i wanted to just do a quick review on that oh that's fire that coffee's fired but um yeah i haven't even opened it yet it's got that little like tab on it it says on the little sticker that it's 17.81 thc so that's just says thc 17.81 and cbd is 0.2 percent the strain is some lemon larry og so i never had some lemon lario g before definitely something i want to try though oh this is most dangerous as [ __ ] i can say no lies it doesn't smell like that uh average like a shaky pre-roll that you get oh man ah it smells really dang i wasn't expecting it to be so dang um it's fantasy lab tests and all that [ __ ] training lemon lario g you guys know it's official even the pre-roll comes with a that's a little uh w inside of the m whatever it is in the filter so it looks like lemon lario's g so far something is staining the outside of the paper i don't even know what it is it's like so the nugs are so juicy the juices are squeezing onto the outside but um yeah lemon lario g by evidence um never heard of evidence before but um high key i'm going to open it i'm going to open the tip just to see what kind of weed is in there on some real [ __ ] oh i don't blame you guys don't play me it's not looking good oh that you played your boy it is nothing but straight shaking that [ __ ] oh god i don't know how the [ __ ] they make it smell so dang maybe that's what this uh wetness is maybe they sprayed some dank powder on it you know what i'm saying like i don't know what the [ __ ] that [ __ ] is but um it's definitely just some shaking this [ __ ] a little a little disappointed but i already knew halfway so let's get it in i mean it's definitely lighting pretty decently i'm not getting the biggest pull it was a pack pretty tight it says one gram in here it's just your um it's a good strain it tastes pretty earthy it's og so i'd expect it tastes pretty earthy it's my first larry og strain can't say i'm too much of a fan of it as far as taste i'll give it like two out of five it doesn't taste bad you know it just doesn't taste good as far as the high and the potency it's only 17 and like i'm used to smoking like probably 80 right now and cartridges so potency for me personally let me give it a two as well when i give it taste potency [ __ ] else the harshness i guess it's not harsh at all it's real smooth i'll give it a 4 out of 5 for that that's a good job i'm not really sure this is something that i would uh pick up again but then again i didn't pick it up someone just dropped it off for me but um definitely not bad it's not a negative experience in any way it's just not too euphoric of an experience as well this is why i don't really smoke um joints too often at least after i uh take blinkers but yeah it would have been a nice waking big joint it is still a nice waking big joint to be honest this is still my waking big session i'm just big talking [ __ ] big [ __ ] talking whatever it is i don't know what the price on this was so i can't let you guys know but if i would pick it up again the answer would be negative so that tells you all you really need to know right there i'm not gonna finish this i'm gonna go ahead and just put it out maybe uh spark it up tomorrow morning for a nice little waking big but this was the um lemon larry og by evidence indica hybrid not bad not bad at all it's not that good yeah i smoked that like tomorrow for you guys or

gonna come with the boost pack in that that's gonna keep it fresh let me let you take another look at that look at them try let me get it out of there let me get it out of there look at them trichomes popping on that ting look at the trichomes popping on that ting oh my fingernails are dirty mind you that's not what i'm here for look at the trichomes popping on that thing right dude uh let's not wait to it let's get to it because i'm ready to smoke i got my bucket right here oh with that new sticker the plug i have to reach out to the plug you dig so i can i'm going to break this down by i've been waiting no no i'm not no i'm not i was about to lie and say that i'm about to break this down by hand but it's it's it's way way way way way too sticky for that dude let's look let's let's do the stick test let's see how long it takes to draw one two three four four it took four seconds it's sticky it's sticky man that's why i have to use the grinder because with it being sticky like that that means that it's going to be sticking to my fingers when i get ready to roll this one and we can't hide it we can't have that we can't have it messing up my rope can't be messing up my roll it is i can't hide that you know i i'm the best blood roller in the world craig and i'ma tell you why ask me why ask me why that's what's the first step in being the best blunt roller in the world it's precaution big i take precautions like i noticed that this cannabis is extra sticky and so i proceeded to use the grinder i take precautions two-point word for me for because i take the proper precautions let me scoot my bucket back so i can dump the guts from this cigar though man on some real [ __ ] though i'm glad y'all here with me i'm glad you're here so we can get this oh blunt in the air i can feel it in there am i showing my age because feeling in the air being a seagull that was and still is my jam as uh charlemagne the god would say mood forever that's my mood forever forever forever ever forever ever forever never seem that long until you're grown big fats never seem longer [ __ ] um as you can see i'm sorry i didn't i'm not getting more detail because the trichomes on this is super popping the colors are light bright you've seen it the smell is just funky i mean i i i don't know what you want me to say about that one the smell is just that stank but it's that good stain though it's like it's like you have to be driving down the street and you smell a skunk you know how this gun smell comes in the car now to those of the those who don't um appreciate good cannabis when they smell that smell when it gets in the car it's like a skunk right now what's crazy is that when i smell that when we're driving down the street i'm like um yeah well you smell like something good that's what this is doing for me right now it's that stink that only us cannabis hemp cbd and marijuana lovers could enjoy this is that stink this that is that good stink i don't know i don't know what else to say it's that good thing it's think good mm-hmm breaks down nice and fine check this out no seeds just that little bitty piece of stick right there that's because i broke it off of that bud and that one bud is enough to get this blunt going and i've been waiting for this i'm i'm four hours past due on this blunt because i'm supposed to get off the phone and i had this blunt roll about both charity i just had to have this bumper i was supposed to have this blunt roll about 4 30. man it is 8 30. but you know being that it's an og a legendary og i know it's taking this time now welcome to the part where i feel like a boss and i get to say to you guys salute to health wealth and self self love is the best love if you haven't heard the words i love you today then please please get to the closest man to yourself self i love yourself because you can't love anyone else right you expect anybody else to love you if you don't love yourself make sense salute come on

cannabis terpenes it just it it's it's palpable it's palpable um after that it has like like almost kind of like a like some cheesiness to it um some cheesiness with just a little bit of a little bit of pine just a little bit of tart it's good i feel good all over it feels so good to finally smoke dude cbd the medicinal properties of cbd are amazing it's like instead of asking what cbd can help with you're better off asking what can't cbd help with right but it helped with so much that this is so long the list is so long and right now it's calming me down uh on days like this i can really really feel the effect because i had an attitude i had an attitude about having to work so late i was upset and now i'm smoking my cbd and as it starts to kick in my brain is just like whatever that's why i really need cbd smoke breaks at work i really do because it would calm me down but the reason i don't is because when i know i'm going to do a review i don't want anything else to be in my system i don't want to be smoked anything else to have any kind of taste i just want to smoke and review what i'm doing that day let that be the first smoke of the day and oh my god it's worth it oh gee oh g original o d this is it og legendary og original game it got it it got that good grab that e sauce that that right there it's a i told you that legendary og i just got caught sleeping and

say on smoking legal keep it positive we'll keep it pushing keep it positive like for real for real well keep it the [ __ ] pushing your dick hello", "w-RrFVp7j14": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpy time welcome back to my awesome medical cannabis review and this one might be a little long one because i got some things to show you some stuff to talk about uh and some dabs to smoke okay so without further ado i stopped at simply pleasure here uh in hagerstown shout outs to simply pleasure thank you guys awesome i didn't have what i wanted but i got some other cool [ __ ] which is pretty [ __ ] cool i did need a new torch so i picked up the new torches the first thing i'm going to show you i thought this was pretty [ __ ] cool it's these nuts torch and check that out these nice torch lighter professional butane torch right this thing is pretty [ __ ] dope they had a couple other um you know characters like mario and uh i i don't know any of the other ones i really didn't care to look at them because they didn't catch my eye but this one and mario caught my eye uh i think it's badass i did um already put some fuel in it so nice big torch right beautiful that's exactly what i needed so i got gotta get used to get used to that thing what else did i get here all right uh i did get a new optimizer for my puffco but uh i do not think it is the right one so i might have to uh take this thing back you heard me i might have to take this thing back if it works for my for my uh puffco thing then so be it i'll use it but if not i'm gonna have to take it back i'm saying that because the same pleasure i know how you guys don't like to take [ __ ] back ain't give me a receipt and even offer so i mean my shit's on mine everything's in the in the [ __ ] there you know what i mean but first thing i want to show you guys um of course the rig it comes with a a normal uh flower banger right the normal ass [ __ ] flower banger and the one cool thing is about this if you have a round uh cartridge not like this you might be able to do it like that but if you have a round cartridge you can actually put it in like that in your ball and uh take a pull off of your pen which i have showed that uh in previous fought videos i bought a new box of dirt wipes shout out to [ __ ] dirt wipes and go anywhere without [ __ ] some dirt wipes right all right this is the cool thing here so this thing is called a uh a reclaimed banger the lady lady at the head shop sold me on this i thought this is pretty cool aspect uh what is it yeah oh i'm sorry a recycler banger for dollars okay fifteen dollars i thought this thing is pretty [ __ ] dope so you guys probably seen it on on the on the net somewhere along the line you pull this little guy out there check this out right so you heat the bottom up it has this weird looking coil type i don't know thing in there right but anyway how she explained it you put your oil when you have to heat it up and as you're you're hitting instead of the the reclaim coming out through this bank going into your rig it goes through here uh or comes back down and then up and then back in so therefore you don't waste anything it's always a cycle of of uh catching your recline so once again instead of your recline going in through here it goes down and up and then back into the [ __ ] that coil looking thingy there okay here's the aspect of that 15 okay 15 i'm just gonna sit that right there in the thing all right now let's see the actual main piece what i got you guys ready you guys know meme i like i like my little uh my little rigs but i seen this i fell in love with the colors uh this was sixty dollars ready check this thing out man i absolutely [ __ ] fell in love with it my normal size rigs you guys know it's kind of like a beaker right a beaker style um yeah i mean it does remind me of my other one there with this type style thing there but yeah check that [ __ ] thing out right uh only thing i'm worried about is these little slits you see these little slits there if they get clogged with oil uh it's gonna be a rough day you know what i mean but you guys know me i don't i don't let my [ __ ] get too [ __ ] dirty but uh yeah so that that's pretty much what we got from the head shop so check this thing out yo this thing looks sweet check that out right right down now let me get the banger they come with a uh a carb cap you guys the carb cap here all right nice big ass [ __ ] bubble carp cap and right as long as it's supposed to go straight up and like like that all right right up in the middle boom so that's uh that's everything i got from the head shop i do not recall the [ __ ] price on uh the total of what everything cost but i do know the rig was 60 that thing was 15. um the [ __ ] puffco thing was 25. this was i don't [ __ ] know it was like 120 something 130 bucks but anyway here we go so i'm going to try this out for the first time i'm just going to heat it up i kind of like sterilize it a little bit i'm gonna put some water in this uh new rig here and uh we're gonna you know do a dab but before i i do do all that i do want to show you and talk to you guys about these g-leaf cartridges okay these t-leaf cartridges i am not rolling over bubble wrap rolling over bubble wrap i am not too happy with them liquid live carts by g leaf um they didn't even last me a whole day to be honest like they were [ __ ] the headspace is just [ __ ] killer okay i bought four of them actually i bought five of them but one was distillate but so i bought four of them of the [ __ ] live resin fse full spectrum extract cartridge right here's the la chocolate i saved this one because i wanted to uh like do like a little review on it right i don't know what this one tastes like but i will tell you the um the star dog was the only one i liked i didn't like the [ __ ] the uh what is it pineapple skunk pineapple skunk live resin cartridge i did not care for uh the taste was was that's that's actually a good one there the taste is just yeah it's terrible i don't [ __ ] there's another nation so i'm just gonna say like they're nothing compared to cresco cartridges um i'm gonna hold off from buying them from now on g-leaf like your live resin cartridge are [ __ ] whack and and to me it's a waste of money like i said uh i only smoke like when i'm on break like i don't smoke throughout the day like like a normal person would like that you know just constantly puffing these [ __ ] so like i think maybe i don't know it's i don't smoke a lot it's what i'm trying to [ __ ] say and it didn't even last me a whole day which is [ __ ] ridiculous but oh with that said i do want to open up this one on camera and give you guys my opinion on this one here okay so as you see it's not opened all right not open you're gonna crack this [ __ ] open bomb there it is now check out this headspace okay all these [ __ ] headspace or just killer i thought cresco was bad like my wife is really tired of me saying oh headspace headspace headspace but look at this look at that guys that's crazy now i could say oh it was sitting down inside yeah it was sitting down inside but still i can heat this [ __ ] thing up just a hair just to get it warm and uh you will [ __ ] see the headspace in it this is crazy like i know this [ __ ] sucks into the wick i know it settles and you know i know all that but i'm just saying like that's pretty rough guys you know what i mean you're paying top dollar for for your medicine like i expect uh i expect some some you know some full stuff you know what i mean can you really taste it but hopefully that that heated up enough i mean you guys can tell just about how much head space is gonna be right down to that [ __ ] base of that coil there i can't [ __ ] see it but while we're waiting for that to uh that bubble to go down you're gonna let it sit right there um stop hating on on geely [ __ ] live resin cartridges because they [ __ ] suck and i'm never gonna buy them again uh unless they actually change something about it but like i said the only one i did like out of those four is the [ __ ] star dog that one was not bad at all but getting into the tea leaf that i did buy i did buy a two gram jar of mai thai cured sugar okay and that is right here and i'll tell you what guys this stuff right here is [ __ ] fire look at it [ __ ] fire i would suggest if you got that on your menu from g leaf there in frederick or even in rockville go pick that [ __ ] up like asap once again i'll show you guys the numbers real quick there's that cart falling over on the side that's a wrap get that right there's the numbers stay stick okay so um i'm gonna go ahead and pause the video heat this thing up get this thing nice and sterilized and then i will return all right so i'm back we got that thing uh nice and clean and fried up toasted i've been downstairs rinsed this thing out got this thing on nice and clean nice bottle of water all right let's put some water just a little bit above that huh what do you guys think i know i think maybe i have too much maybe just a little bit too much i think just a hair too much all right i believe that's good all right that is [ __ ] beautiful that is beautiful oh yeah oh yeah all right well let's try it shall we let's see all right now i believe she did say that you heat it up it did say you heat it up first so let's uh let's give it a go and see what happens huh there's a little lock thing here this is locked in here right there there it is all right there we go all right let's get it boys hopefully everybody's having a good tuesday turkey tuesday definitely tuesday in my house new rig new new [ __ ] banger and new new torch you guys think this thing's hot enough i

go here's there's the uh the result like look at that guys i mean that right there for [ __ ] sixty dollars unacceptable unacceptable anyway y'all be easy peace out mama i love you", "8xi6JrT6pH0": "okay cool today in the name of what's in my pre-roll we have this eight gram grenade xxl infused pre-roll from napalm with originals flower so uh this is definitely by far the biggest joint i've ever gutted i'm not sure how i'm going to deal with that i have some ideas hopefully this all pans out but yeah let's go ahead and just jump into it if you're watching this on my patreon page thanks a lot i appreciate you being a patron it means a lot because this thing was [ __ ] expensive sorry to use some foul language there but uh yeah it was 150 on the menu pre-tax uh so thank you to tropicana for making this happen giving me that 15 discount got me out the door under two bills but still very expensive nonetheless uh but yeah let's take a look at this tag cause i'm interested in what we're gonna find here um so we've got eight g's it says seven g's of originals indoor flower and 1g of live resin and it says lift tickets infused rolling paper so i guess there is a g of live resin mixed in with the flower we'll find out together um and then also lift tickets are infused so that's like more live resin in those papers so in any case that's what's going on here with this label let's see if there's what's on the back okay this is the actual testing panel here just came right off that pin and this is what we got in here so 28 to total thc and it does say 7g a flower 1g of extract southwest caregivers here and when was it made back on 8 26 so not too long ago were just coming up towards the end of september now it's about the 20th um so yeah not too old just under a month about so interesting let's see originals og rolling paper by lift tickets so that i don't know we're going to find out together but that makes me wonder is the live resin just what's in the paper because lift tickets is you know it says rolling paper and then flower by but doesn't say concentrates by so oh but wait oh oh ingredients never mind hold on cannabis flour cannabis extract live resin diamonds cannabis extract live resin infused rolling paper alright so that answers my question of course there's the government uh warning they're always watching um so yeah we should find some diamonds in here as well as the flower and then of course the rolling paper is infused so maybe i'll be able to save some of that maybe not looks like quite a bit of cb oh never mind i was reading that wrong i thought it was 11 cbd i was like wow that's a lot but uh point one four five percent cbd so not too much compared to the thc in any case let's get into it and see what's good i'll take this tag i'll put it over here i'll move my sticker because i imagine there's going to be a lot of flour coming out and so this is it let me zoom out you don't need to be that close this is the pin here is the seal so you see you have the official napalm seal um and yeah i mean i think that's it i don't think i actually pull the pin that would be pretty cool but but i think i just twist this off so let's go ahead and watch the seal break together or if it yep there it goes and you can see that it's got that kind of amp anti-tamper seal stuff there stuck on the jar and here we go it's ready to come out let me zoom back out drum roll in your heads boom there it is damn this thing is huge uh definitely again the biggest pre-roll that i've ever gutted the surface looks a little strange just before i pull it apart i thought i'd zoom in on that and i do want to get a dry pool and not neglect that because there's no going back on this one and how the heck oh maybe you do have to pull the pin no i don't know maybe not do i just we're finding this out together i should have did it say pull pin on the instructions to use no no okay uh i don't want to break it but it doesn't it's like stuck in there what the [ __ ] hold on hold on here you get to see me mess with this thing and be a total idiot let me try to pull the pin no okay it doesn't work all right well it's in there it's stuck in there and it's like if you spend this much money on a j and you can't get it out of the cap like what the [ __ ] maybe i gotta unscrew it all right okay i'm just there we go okay i don't know what i did there i think that was my fault so pardon my retardation um pardon that my use of that because i can't erase it and we're live in this video so i'm sorry for saying that but yeah that was my fault i think i i feel like is this screwed in or what what what's going on here this looks like porcelain i should have probably read to see what this is made of but looks like a nice tip it smells great i gotta give that to the originals the uh i can smell the ogenus from back here so let me go ahead and get a dry pull on this real quick and it pulls just fine like i feel like if i lit this up it would smoke perfectly it's got that like really nice it's almost lemony it's like yeah definitely a lemony um maybe minorly gassy but i get more of a freshness off of it so it's like yeah but there's definitely a fuel in the taste too on it so i'm gonna enjoy smoking this flour for sure it's got a great taste classic og so maybe the originals you know i don't know it's it's it's definitely uh on point with a lot of very popular ogs i'm not gonna comment more than that but it tastes very good um all right so let's go ahead and get the right angle on this thing because there's no going back here we go with this here looks like this is where it was actually sealed together so here we go snip snip snip now this is a barrel and i really am curious about how they put these together because it's just like this big tube and i'm like is this you know i mean are these all made by hand hand packed most likely at least like do they cone these out at first how do they do it so let me see i'm going to try to actually cut down the middle here i'm going to try to preserve the paper as much as possible maybe i'll be able to roll it back into a j let me see oh there we go here we go i'm just going to open that up there it is there we go all right awesome well there it is it's coming out in a big old barrel because that's what it is in here all stuffed in oh man i don't want to lose any of this material so i'm going to be really careful as i pat it out of here come on now come on now come on now here it comes all right here we go is that no no i'll be honest i am on the lookout for seeds only because that is what i saw in another video where somebody had opened this up oh special k i just i'm glad the paper caught all that only one tiny tiny little piece managed to make its way off all right cool so the paper is pretty much intact i don't know if we'll see if we find any of those diamonds in here i don't know what they're supposed to look like this stuff smells so good though it's really awesome i definitely love the the smell i'm getting so let me go ahead and get more of a centered view here as i go through this it's a lot of material as i was saying i don't even want to breathe too hard because it'll just go everywhere um so let's see what we got in here already just a little passenger there so far now this is going to take a bit it's going to take a bit but i i don't uh don't see how where the diamonds are exactly and uh you know eventually um if napalm sees this video let me know what i'm looking for exactly because i'm not seeing it i'm seeing a lot of this though which i'm just suspect now because i've seen that other video special k i believe is the user that put that out and there are a lot of these little tiny looking pieces that like are not seeds because i keep smashing them and they go away they're just very suspect you know so but uh the material itself i mean i kind of like the grind it's not grounded down to nothing um so that's good it's got a good consistency it probably would have smoked pretty well but it does have the occasional passenger man it is just so hard to go through this much material though to be honest i probably should have put it in a rolling tray i think i think maybe these chunks i keep coming across might be something to do with the live resin i mean it doesn't feel sticky it doesn't feel like a concentrate by any means uh when i'm breaking them up but i'm just you know finding these little clusters in here and uh and yeah so i just want to be thorough this is probably gonna feel one of the longest joint videos also i hope my phone holds up uh heat wise because it tends to overheat but yeah i just keep seeing a lot of these little bits of things so i i think those might be the diamonds i don't know i can't say because it just feels like herb when i'm when i'm busting them down but they have a c like shape so it's very uh suspect in that way but not yeah not a lot of passengers really you know i mean i've come across a couple here so far there's just so much freaking material in here and so let's break it down you know we're talking about what 150 bucks pre-tax um so that's a quarter so and i mean you've got a g of live resin so i'm not sure what that goes for concentrate wise um but yeah breaking it down by its components what is what are a couple weights maybe like uh 80 bucks you know let's say 48 yet each right and then you get a g of live risen whatever that runs so this really isn't too bad considering that they constructed it also and i mean i am kind of going by more store prices pre-tax etc but uh but yeah i i wouldn't say it's necessarily super overpriced because there is something to do with this construction but as you can see it's not free of defect you know i mean there are a couple and i mean it's just so much too i'm used to just going through one gram so this is seven times the amount of material that i'm used to going through and it's like i can see as i'm doing it there isn't too many but there are just little tiny pieces that are suspect it's got a good consistency though i've really got to give it to that because yeah i'm sure this would have smoked awesomely um just the way that it's got a mix of like really finely ground stuff and uh and really big chunks in here and it just smells so good yeah it really does have that classic og scent sweetness to it um like the lemony citrusy sweetness with that fuel in there yeah i can't wait to smoke this stuff but uh and i just brushed those stems back in there so i mean i'm not seeing anything crazy i'm not seeing any seeds you know i mean that was the question after seeing the video that was released not too long ago would we find any seeds there's nothing sticking out at me you know and i'm checking as you can see i'm checking all these little bits as i'm coming across them but i really don't think we're going to find anything but i just want to be sure because yeah you can only make this video once and i mean you know yeah i have to say this looks pretty decent i came across a couple stems but you know stuff like this here there's gonna be there we go there's another one over here so i can pick these out you know and there's probably going to be a bunch more of them you know not not a supreme amount because i you know otherwise i would just be doing it right now but as i go through it i'm sure i could find more of that we found that bigger stem so there are some stems in here just a little bit nothing crazy again especially when you consider the price point you know and the and the work that goes into making something like this now i don't know what kind of material they started with maybe they get a good deal on lowers or whatever you know but uh yeah can't really see anything to complain about in here um but i'm not finding those uh we're gonna weigh this out right now so it comes out to eight g's they must be in here i guess like but i'm not seeing what i would suspect are the live resin diamonds or whatever so anyway i'm getting a notice that my phone is getting hot so i better move along and get this weight off uh because this is again a really long video um so let's go ahead and get the scale going i'll move you guys over there here we go all righty and there it is and you can see that pretty good from right there so let me tear this out yeah i'm gonna try to corral all of this material in here it is again more than i've weighed out before so i'm hoping this all stays in here be cooperative here we go oh all right so there's some left on the paper coming up to 7.7 and i did there's a couple crumbs out here but not a whole lot so that is what the weight is coming up to you now if it's supposed to be not including the paper then so be it uh it's going to be kind of a pain to pull this paper off i think oh let me try it hold on i want to give it away just to see if it comes up to at least here we go here we go all right i'm throwing the paper into two so you", "m6eD8kvGuTg": "today we're smoking space coyotes five pack sativa infused joints uh first things i should tell you about this is they rotate the flour that is in these and they rotate the extract or live resin that is in this depending on what they have at the time so you can't you can't bank on it being the same flower every single time you buy it there's a good chance that that the insides will definitely change and rotate depending on what's available but i absolutely love this idea i think it's super freaking cool to just like do a package of five joints and you just brand the box and then slap a different sticker on the back for like what's in it and this is your this is like the five package joints that you buy you don't know what kind of flour you're getting or you just like ask before you buy it um in this case it is gmo root beer and lemon bean resin this was a super [ __ ] good combination of like strains or flour and extra or live resin they balance it so there's a 93 percent herb and 7 percent live resin in each joint and they all weigh half a gram each so there's five total in this package they come in a like this really nice metal tin you can see silhouettes and mountains there's a moon on the front and then on the back there's it says blazed blazed glazed blaze totally cosmic um inside if i can get this open inside so normally there's five joints i've smoked a few of them already but inside you would have all five of your joints carefully packaged my favorite thing about this or this package is i can carry this in my backpack if i go on a hike i can put in my disc golf bag if i go play disc golf i can put it in my pocket if i'm just walking around town and i don't have to worry about my packaging being squished i know that my product or my joints are going to be safe and i can't even recycle this now and put my own hand rolled joints in it and have a perfect tin for carrying those around with me they use field extracts in there as their infusion pretty sure they grow their own flour um but anyways these are our space coyotes sativa or five sativa infused joints

at uh scherbinski's on fairfax los angeles fashion district i thought you guys might want to check it out with me so fuzzies so it says hand rolled in bold one infused pre-roll net weight 1.5 grams you see a little california warning sticker let's roll it over bam og kush okay boom let's see what they say over here about 25 thc very little cbd manufactured 11 24 20 package 114. so that's not too bad they got this to the market fast i've had this for about a week so that's really good actually for california cannabis that a really slow supply chain out here testing and just all those various things bam so let's see what this is saying boom manufactured by sublime in oakland california sublime is a well-known uh manufacturer up there in oakland shout out to my friends at sublime uh tamper seal tamper seal all right let's try and break in here with one hand fiona in the mix fionna so you guys never met fiona before she's dope she's kind she's from a feral bloodline she's a little nutty she destroys stuff but she's she's all about that mad love so word up to fiona helping us out here with this joint let's see if i can get this open with one hand i really didn't plan ahead and it's been a minute since i made a video sorry about that by the way i've been busy working in the weed industry instead of doing my reviews of course i've been out for many many years bam okay okay i see you fuzzy i see you fuzzy so boom chow resistant plastic two bam see what's inside blam okay all right we got our fuzzy so that's uh dipped or sprayed in oil and then rolled in keefe so it looks pretty good let's see what fiona thinks fiona you know fiona's more of a bond girl so she's not really co-signing all right i did not fix my hair and man how's it going guys rockstone was my pillow too where do i look is that you guys in there hey what up i'm looking at the wrong side got my character down bit of an oil fire there sorry rookie move you guys i'm so out of practice thank you for your patience i don't know where to look i'm like um kind of tastes like cheap hash oil and this keef a lot of people oh [ __ ] look at this look at this look it already went limp on me and i hit it too hard so it canoed so i'm gonna blame that on me let's just blame that on me let's just blame that canoe on me um this limpy part oh look i got it back oh it went limp that happens to every guy sometimes ladies no no no bad david um i'm gonna go hit this again huh um kinda not great a tiny little touch of og kush flavor but it's really that sort of syrupy sweet sort of oil taste i'm not sure if they're using distillate or what kind of oil they use for this but um i don't know i joints are kind of whack anyways in the california world because uh if they're legal they get ground up and then they got to sit through testing and do all this stuff and it just takes forever to get on the market but yeah not feeling this not feeling this fuzzy gone limp on me that's kind of how i feel about the experience it's kind of an analogy but look check that out how i got it all cray maybe you could blame that on me but i think that's just me i just hit it too hard i'm a [ __ ] fiend i've been cleaning up around the house all day making topicals and i'm just like a little uptight so i had this joint but well there's the fuzzies um packaging is great initial presentation's great performance questionable um these are really popular these are really high selling uh joints um 25 you know which is pretty high for enjoy and but certainly a decent amount of that's due to the key for the infusion but um i would not recommend this i apologize to everyone at fuzzies and my friends over at sublime this one's kind of whack um it just doesn't really taste great it kind of like very little strain flavor and mostly just novelty i think i'm gonna try again just yep nope not feeling it no good no good but uh thank you guys for a quick little thing i think a new new video name bag of weed weed bag i got a big bag filled with eights of all these different strains and companies that i just need to dump out i've had it for months and i just need to test them and stuff so leave in the

yeah i got a couple of different things whatever but i'm gonna start off with the plain jane what is going on guys it's your boy joseph the realest with another review and i got something from texas hemp culture let me see i'll show you all this real quick uh uh look at that oh yeah okay i'm sorry let me zoom in bubba kush og kush so i bought the og kush and they sent me a bubba kush to try out he said he was gonna send me one an extra cart i bought one because i want to try the og kush and he recommended the bubba kush so you know joshua i appreciate you for saying that out to me let me let me try it out he also sent me a little note you know thanking me i mean nothing me uh to pretty much like here's the extra cart road and i was like i appreciate that that's awesome so i think we're gonna start off with the bubba push on his recommendation so these are live terp carts thc delta eight ninety four percent delta eight 100 uh hemp so there's no it's all organic whatever it's all from the plant there's no chemicals or anything extra uh it's all terps and and um cbd well terps rc whatever you get what i'm saying so this is the car let me see if i can zoom in on it so you get a metal tip right here let me show you if i could shave against the metal that is all metal cart right here uh the cbd concentrate is clear instead of yellow or um so yeah it's pretty much it's a clear uh liquid in there a real thick liquid because if i turn it upside down whatever that's i don't know yeah it's not moving which is of a it's a it's a that's a really good sign whatever you want your oil to be thick um so yeah let's try it out guys that's i want to give you a close look at it real quick i'm going to put it on my brass knuckles so this is the bubba kush so let's try it out guys [Music] well there's definitely a lot of flavor in that you can tell it's very potent [Music] oof yeah it has a lot of flavor like it literally like you get like you could taste the plant like some i watched the review on this one of the guys first guys to try this before it came out and um it could definitely like it tastes like it tastes like you're vaping the plant like if you ever have like a dry herb vape and you're like you have you ever tried a dry herb vape whatever like it's like one of the best ways to smoke whatever you definitely get like the full like it just tastes way better than smoking it like it's kind of hard to describe it it just you just definitely get more flavor and you get more high you get more you know percentage whatever thc and then just straight up combustion with the lighter on the pipe um that's that's what i get from there whatever this bubble kush you definitely it tastes like your dry herb vaping the the plant itself now what i'm curious about is how much is in here because it doesn't look like a full gram it looks like a it might be a half a gram um i love the cart um design it's really nice i love the all metal like you know i like something that you don't see every day whatever like no nowadays everyone's using the ceramic coil which is a good one but you know if you're getting all these ceramic clothes you don't know like you know when you look at it you're like which company is this from so the bubble kush was good it's very good very flavorful it it tastes like like i explained earlier it tastes like you're vaping straight from the plant like from a dry herb vape like it's really all natural and the flavor is really nice so this is the bubba cook i'm sorry the og kush yeah this is the one that i bought and i'm really excited about this one has a smaller bubble which i'm i'm happy about the other one had like a a good size uh of i guess it was i i like when i get a carton it's like just all it is is a small bubble that's missing let me show you let me see if i can show y'all so you can see that right there on the side look up right here there's a small bubble and the other one those i can't come like literally like on that one i cannot say anything whatever because um this one uh it's full this is the one i bought and they gave me the bubba kush so the one that they gave me um it probably was meant to be that way whatever because uh that was a sample that was like for me to review so don't no you don't have to worry about if you get it from them um i got literally like a [ __ ] texas hem culture they have like this little like um green marijuana plant like confetti and it's literally all over my floor but okay anyway sorry let's just get back into the review i talk too much sometimes so um yeah i want to try this uh og kush also delta eight whatever supposedly is supposed to get you uh like the psychoactive uh effect whatever like the way thc does but i'm not too sure um i never like i only tried one in my whole life a thc cart and it was no terps it was literally just straight up ta delta a so anyways that's a and that's uh i think that's even bad like just for preference whatever the og kush is definitely uh it tastes better in my opinion because i love og kush bubba kush is amazing as well whatever like and both of them definitely you get that flavor you definitely get that like uh you you get like the you can taste the terps whatever like it's very like prominent whatever like when you're vaping this um it's very it's very delicious whatever like i said like i smoked a lot of vapes whatever and you get some good flavor from certain vapes and with this one whatever like this is the first vape that i tried then like inside like i said it earlier whatever i saw this youtube video review on these carts and this guy he does a good job um i forgot what his name is i wish i could tell you all so i could like recommend them if if anything up actually no i can't put the link on these cbd reviews i i can't put links whatever because i get in trouble so anyways um this is the first vape that i tried and this other one too whatever where it actually tastes like you're smoking you're you're vaping uh in a dry herb vape the flour itself whatever that's how that's how like close to the like i guess because it's pretty much like what does it say on here that it's um live terp cart and it's 100 hemp so like i said there's no extra chemicals in there there's no like any like stuff you got to worry about whatever that's gonna like get you like second cause there was like a vape there was like some uh what's it called um carts on the market that were like um they're like in the black market they were created or whatever people were making them and putting stuff that like there was pesticides and um vitamin e i believe i'm not sure exactly whatever i watch the whole video on it but with these you have nothing to worry about whatever like these are literally legit like all 100 cbd or thc delta 8 so you definitely like don't have to worry with these um i love the fact that the the oil is clear it's very nice but like the taste of it the terps everything is amazing like definitely um i'm gonna give this a 9.5 on both of them definitely very very very nice i like it a lot i definitely recommend this guys so these go for about what was i think it was i don't want to misquote it i think they're like ah damn it oh i have the receipt here oh that throw it away okay give me a second i have the receipt here okay the the carts are forty dollars all right use my code i think it's jay z ten to get ten percent off i believe don't i i think it's jz10 i i forgot i'm a i'm an affiliate for them my dumbass always forgets i could be making so much money but i keep forgetting to like [ __ ] i think i have a cold with plain jane too but there's no affiliate thing on there but i don't care whatever with the plain jane uh really the affiliates really i don't really mess with like i do it whatever but like i don't really like you know go all in with it and try to make a lot of money from it um you know sometimes i make a couple but literally i think i had one with amazon where i sold a couple like computers that i reviewed anyways back on the review though i definitely recommend these they're very nice carts very well made uh and the contents are pretty much 100 pure pure hemp whatever and this is a delta eight thc whatever so it's not your average cbd cart it's thc eight delta eight i'm sorry and it's um you definitely get like a good effect with it like i'm feeling it right now because i hit both of these carts [Music] it tastes all natural dude like it's very smooth it's almost like like a like it's light like it's very like um some cards could be very heavy whereas like overbearing whatever with this one is like it you get good uh vape production but without like the harsh like where you want to cough so but like it it's definitely the flavor comes off very nice but yeah i definitely recommend this guys anyways i'm going to end the video there i hope you enjoyed it leave a like and a comment down below guys subscribe if you're new and i'll see y'all next time guys peace out oh [ __ ] i didn't drop it that hard [Applause] you", "2FKdJ7d1x9E": "I was a hating Scouts coming to you with another payroll review this time we got a

over here we've got the gelato some larger looking nubs definitely covered in frost some nice purples again the bomb fully branded um what does it say what does it say 25.48 on the thc for the gelato

chunky dark green purple there's just covered in trikes wow and then tucked inside is a custom branded napalm cannabis premium rolling paper pack so super cool inside of the bomb there this whole this whole experience can literally be gold you know this is a little storage device so this is super cool big shout out to napalm cannabis man that's [ __ ] dope that's super dope all right let's get this one out next all right all right the oakstra damn oh gee oh sweet and piney wow delicious and again another little napalm rolling paper pack custom fit there's actually a little slot that it slides into super dope man all the details really thought out um all right so for this versus i'm gonna roll up two little baby joints real quick and we're gonna get right to it so let me get this rocking and wrong the first one is gonna be the okra damn og i've smoked this a number of times uh i'm told and rumors have it here in la that this is the uh uh either the same cut or the originating cut for the marathon og so there's that which is super cool and then the gelato i'm a big fan of gelato's been smoking a lot of it i literally woke up this morning and smoked a gelato joint so we we shall see how it goes man i think you know when you think about these these marijuana madnesses these verses right it's it's so easy for me to just go brand versus brand but in this case this is a brand new product from me upon that literally just hit the market uh i want you guys to be able to to understand whether or not you know which one to buy it's a 60.8 plus tax so for some people it might be expensive and whereas for others you might be buying you know an entire ounce worth of these i personally i'm going to try them out so we're going to see we're going to see how this goes the oaks again unfortunately is smaller buds even all the way to littles the biggest bud in here is going to be that one so already at least on the bag appeal a lot of this is just smaller um just smalls unfortunately the bag appeal on the jar peel on the the gelato is significantly better but you know ultimately it'll come down to the flavor here so let me go ahead and grind this up get this going here we go the smell is delicious i mean there's no doubt that oxtrade emoji is one of the best cuts of og around there's just no doubt in my mind about that so we're going to start off with this one here we go i'm not going to do too big of a joint but i do want to get a good taste and then we'll just finish this a little later do you guys roll joints do you smoke blunts do you prefer gelatos or oh geez let me know what you guys think in the comments great time to like follow and subscribe right now definitely smash that down below trying to get this up to a thousand i'll be giving away honestly i really want to give away one of these flower bombs so uh whoever's gonna be my thousand subscriber i'm gonna go buy you guys a flower bomb you all heard it here first all right here we go all right here we go i'm excited okay damn oh gee versus the napalm gelato napalm versus napalm here we go first hit delicious smooth piney creamy not gelato creamy but og creamy wow okay okay it's good it's good it's not the best version of the oak shredder that i've ever had though just to be 100 i definitely had it better taste wise nine nine flat it's super solid it's just not as sweet or as tiny as i've had it before whether it's from the marathon og or literally the ocean dam i bought it before i've tried it uh it's delicious though absolutely delicious okay okay so that's where i'm at with that one wise it definitely makes you feel a little a little bit sluggish a little bit foggy in the eyes or the head it's definitely a heavier uh a heavier high um oh see there we go back at it with the there we go back at it with the jar on the top so this is a little bit tricky for me but i should be able to get it oh once i get a seal there it is there we go there we go there we go all right so i've got a little gelato nug right here we're going to use i'm going to save the big one because that's just too beautiful but to be real all of the nugs in this gelato thing are bigger than the nubs inside that one over there so gelato is a clear flat out winner for nug size jar peel bag of peel they got one beautiful big ass nug and then every other one is just big yeah you're not big but at least you know a .25 or 0.3 there's not little there's not little scraggly ones that would be used for pre-rolls traditionally right you guys the gelato i can smell it from here it smells like sweet creamy berries let me get it stuffed in this joint and lit up i gave you guys a nine flat on the ocean damn over there for the taste test let's figure out what the gelato is at here we go here we go here we go the high for the okra dam was pretty good too i'm not gonna lie i do enjoy the way it's making me feel it gives you a little bit burst of energy you're not sober slightly sedative you know feel like all which is a good feeling sometimes you really just want to feel messed up you know but now we're on to the lotto okay here we go you guys now we're ready so let me go ahead and give this end a twist so i can give it a good light here at the end and then we are going to figure out what it's at i've got an official score in my head for the ocean dam it's a nine on the taste test here we go overall though we're gonna have to see i'm gonna wait for the gelato and then i'll hit you guys with the score at the end like follow subscribe take the time go support napom flower bomb support green uh green thumb dr green thumbs la i got these at the downtown la doctor green thumb wow first hit right away you get a blast of gelato holy [ __ ] sweet sweet creamy berries gas all right here we go second hit sweet sweet creamy gas okay so it's really it's really hands down on this one the gelato has a more of a blast of an experience more sweet more cream more pungent the buds are better it's an overall better buy right but the reality is that if you do prefer og strains i don't think that the oxygen is gonna let you down so my official taste test review for the gelato is gonna be a 9.75 it's absolutely [ __ ] delicious now overall i'm gonna also give it a 97.5 maybe even a 98 out of 100. the only thing that i have issue is that i would love to see the terpene profiles on the packaging it's a standard comment i make right there so 97.5 98 whatever you guys would rather have it highly recommend it go check it out gelato beats the ocean dam on this taste test on a pure numbers basis but gelato go buy that if you're an og person definitely go check out the yorkshire dam it's delicious my final score for the okra damn is going to be a 90 out of 100 i'm gonna keep it at a nine flat i really have an issue with the smaller buds being that it is a sixty dollar premium eighth and wrapper weed right but at the end of the day you do get what you pay for if this was 75 80 90 then i would definitely expect bags and you know we should see bags with only nugs like this but i love it i would go buy it again i highly recommend you guys do it go check it out let me know what you guys think in the comments be sure to like follow and subscribe and go support napalm cannabis on instagram respect my region everywhere baby i love you all peace see you guys in the

everything in my videos are legal industrial hemp flour how is the smoker fam doing today it's the homie smoke CBD coming back with another fire hemp flour review today I'm bringing back the company empire direct and what I have here is an ounce of their legendary og now they're legendary og seems to be the most popular on the website it's got the most reviews and I see a lot of people talking about it and I even was recommended this stream a while back a couple of times on the front and says made in the USA it's a humidity Terp lock pack so it preserves your flour nice keeps it fresh Hazzard logo says the strain CBD hemp flour the weight Empire direct and on the back you got your QR code and all the law-enforcement information saying it's federally legal and all that important stuff so I have a code for Empire director that I can offer to the smoker fam and I am blessed to be able to do that the code is in a th H to five in a th H to five and you could save 25% on already amazing prices Empire direct they they probably got the best deals on on in flour I've ever seen they are doing a deal right now if you use my code that you can get a QP of smalls so that's four ounces of smalls for $75 that's with my code so it's $99 minus the 25% v-belt $75 that's a ridiculous price that's crazy so it's coming to 19.7 total CBD and it says legendary OG is known for tart floral and pungent terpenes stays true to its cush background heavy in effect in large doses legendary OG works in her works hard to relax the consumer by elevating the mind while helping soothe the aches and pains throughout the body it's sleepy qualities also make it a solid choice before bedtime so yeah it's an indica dominant strain and I'll tell you when I open this bag to get close-up video and some pictures this smell smell is it's got a sour smell but that that sour smells subtle it's overpowered by the floral earthy aromas coming out of the bag a couple of the the buds here like this one it's just got a little bit of leaf on it like not bad at all though like I mean take me four or five seconds just to get that leaf off but I mean for the most part almost all these buds are trimmed very nicely especially for an ounce that's surprising because I've seen a lot of ounces of hemp flour where they they just machine trim it and throw it in the bag most these buds look perfect there's a lot of big buds here a couple small ones um but I'd say 2/3 of this bag is just big plump knobs like this I mean it and it looks gorgeous guys this legendary OG it has reds purples the

you could join me and I hope you're gonna be session along with me and let's see how this legend legendary og stacks up Cheers really heavy smoke while the taste super floral and earthy but not in like a hemp are like leafy or grassy type away it's like a dank earth yeah it's got some musk to it and yeah it's got a great taste it kind of reminds me of some just OG some like cush type flavor I'm just that classic flower taste that we all have grown to love and yeah I roll a fatty guys I didn't even mean to my dad that's pretty fat I'm getting a lot of flavor from this let's go for it number two yeah I'm loving this taste the effects come on pretty quick it's not like intense it's just kind of you just kind of feel it after that first hit now it could be because I rolled a fatty but yeah I felt I started feeling some effect after one hit super calming kind of gives your eyelids that heavy feeling so I definitely feel the indica dominance in this strain yeah this would be great before I go to bed or something probably really good friends already I personally love and because from my anxiety just kind of chills me out and mellows me drops my shoulders gives me some stress-free feeling but yeah 19.7% CBD you feel it pretty quickly y'all and number three a super heavy smoke Wow that cloud was yellow but it's surprisingly really smooth but you feel it on it on the inhale kind of restricts your throat tightens up your chest a little bit but that's most likely from the potency yeah man this legendary og this is my first time smoking it but from first impressions I think I like it a little more than the Grape Ape and that Grape Ape was killer but like I said I'm an indica guy and this is definitely a heavier indica than the Grape Ape the grape ape was like a 60/40 indica dominant but yeah this is this is a heavy indica it's got me feeling really relaxed yeah man I'm digging this legendary OG it lives up to the name I think it's a great indica strains a great stress reliever anxiety reliever it's definitely gonna get the dank dunk from me yeah this is the second strain I've tried from Empire direct and right now it's my favorite I will definitely be smoking on this whole ounce I'm so glad I got an ounce of it like you know you can't pass up on a great deal like that make sure to use my code in a thh to five it'll be on the screen be down in the

about smoking on some banana og flour from moxie got a little bowl packed up ready to go that's delicious it's got a real dank earthy taste to it while it still has like notes of banana and some creaminess in there as well but this strain review is going to be a little bit cooler than my other ones that i normally do typically i only review the flour but when i was picking this up on the menu i also saw that they had banana og and live resin so i grabbed both banana og live resin banana og flour so stick around i'll take a dab towards the end of the video but first let's talk about the flower banana og is a cross between you guessed it og kush and banana kush the effects of this strain are amazing and they come on super quick like that one bowl got me feeling pretty good already and when you actually look at this weed man it is crazy it is like all trichomes you can see a little bit of stem and some plant matter under all those trichomes but this is seriously caked up this is some beautiful [ __ ] weed and the more i break these buds open the more trichomes i find it is an absurd amount of trichome coverage and the weed is super sticky i'm gonna stick two nugs together and see if they just stick together by themselves this is the ultimate sticky test can two nugs become one yep that's pretty impressive that is some sticky ass weed but this banana og is a pretty light green color with little orange hairs poking out of there as well the nugs are nice and loose they're not dense at all but they still had a really nice bud structure to them it wasn't like a bunch of shake in the jar and the weed is super fresh and cured perfectly i'm super impressed always by moxie they just have like the best curing process for the weed in the state in my opinion granted they do rarely drop flowers so they might just pick the perfectly cured weed for when they drop it but compared to most of the other companies around here i just do not get as good of a cure from the other companies if you're from pa you know what i'm talking about it is not rare to get dry weed straight out of the dispensary but the scent of this strain definitely lives up to the name it seriously smells like you were smoking some og kush in an ice cream shop it's like a banana split with nugs in it it's [ __ ] crazy it's like a mix of fruity flavors and creamy flavors under that og kush flavor if you've smoked og kush before you know the flavor it's just that like classic dank weedy flavor i can barely fit this whole bong in the shot i gotta back up a little bit that's fire dude such a great taste at first you taste little hints of banana and vanilla and then it's just overpowered by that pure og kush taste if you're a fan of fruity strains or that classic og flavor this drain is definitely up your alley and those two flavors just pair really well together that like dank grassy taste with the banana and creamy flavor it's just a nice experience i really [ __ ] with the strain but this flower is testing at 22 thc and the terpenes on it aren't out of this world but the smell and the flavor alone are just so overpowering to me that like it is a very impressive flower to me terpenes mean a lot more when it comes to extracts than flour to me if it is flour and has a high terpene profile it's typically good but flour doesn't necessarily need a high terpene profile to smell very pungent and have a great odor to it when it comes to flour i think a lot of that really has to do with how it's cured my main complaint about this drain is it's a little stemmier than i'd like it to be but it's really not too hard to pick that off i feel like when the weed is super dense it's hard to sometimes pick all the stems off but when it's nice and loose like this you can just pick all the good stuff off and then get that stem and throw it right in the trash can i'm gonna pack one more bowl up before we try out the concentrate i had smoked this flour before i did the video but i haven't tried the concentrate yet i only had a half gram of it so i didn't want to waste it moxi's concentrates typically only come in half grams which for some people they really like that because it's pretty expensive but honestly i feel like i go through a half gram so quickly then i don't always like to pick it up they do have grams too but i feel like 80 to 90 percent of their concentrates are weighed out to half grams but like that's only four or five dabs like only one dab if i feel like being crazy so i kind of feel like i'm wasting an entire jar if i just go through that so quickly but they only had the banana og in half gram so i had to grab a half gram i will enjoy this four or five dabs trust me delicious the high is mainly like a nice spacey head high but it's still like noticeable in the entire body as well and i still feel like present i don't feel like super zoned out or anything but sometimes i feel like my brain is just going a mile a minute with these random ideas and high thoughts i'll catch myself being like i wonder if my dog knows i'm high why do we bake cookies but cook bacon what if kobet doesn't exist and just nobody ever wants to hang out anymore i don't know man it's just a nice spacey high but now i'm going to take a dab of this live resin it has more of a wheaty scent to me than a fruity scent i'm curious how it's gonna taste it looks like some beautiful sugar wax though nice and crumbly a little drier than i like my sugar to be but as i've said about consistencies it's really just a preference thing it really has nothing to do with the quality of the actual product but i'm about to take a dab out of this little guy it's practically the size of the banger it's so small it's got a great function for such a little piece though oh yeah it's a little too dry for the dabber so i'm just going to dunk these three little rocks in all right choose you guys oh my god dude that's so flavorful i was expecting it to not taste as good as it does oh wow that's super sweet it's weird it really just smells more like the og kush and like a carafeline scent where it's like a little peppery but it tastes just like the weed smells like it's super sweet you can really taste that banana it's like really noticeable the banana is definitely the most noticeable flavor on the concentrate holy crap it's pretty much the same effect just a little bit more intense like it's definitely more in the head than the body but i'm still feeling higher in the body as well but this is like a true hybrid high where it's like you feel present you don't have like a total couch lock but you still have that like stress free like happy high feeling you get from the indicas if you like hybrid trains this is definitely a good one to pick up moxie really hit it off the park with this one it's probably my favorite banana themed strain i've had it's a nice sweet flavor without being too sweet i just love this blend of dank weed and sweet fruit it's really a delightful mix but this strain was a very exclusive flower i was literally only able to get 1 8 of it that's why i thought it'd be fun to add the concentrate as well let me know if you want me to do that in the future by the way i can't guarantee that i can always get a concentrate of the flower form at the same time but if i can i'd love to do that for a strain review if you guys think that that's a cool addition but there's a 1 8 per patient limit at the dispensaries because literally the dispensaries get such small batches of this flour but hopefully moxie flour becomes more prevalent one day and it's something we can just always see on the shelves this banana og is definitely one that i want to get again i'd rate this strain a 9 out of 5. [ __ ] i'd rate this strain a 9 out of 10 and honestly i feel like it almost should be bumped up to a 9.5 out of 10 after that brain fart it's a super strong strain the weed was strong the live resin was stronger i'm [ __ ] lit i really hope this stream comes around again soon and hopefully in a bigger bath so more people can enjoy it but let me know what train you guys want me to review in the future i got a lot more on my plate that i want to review but i love hearing your suggestions you guys recommend some pretty fire strength to me i always appreciate it that's the video you guys make sure you click like if you enjoyed this video and click like if you didn't no one's gonna know you don't have to tell anyone just click that like button it can be our little secret and subscribe for more videos i got a lot more on the way and leave a comment let me know what videos you want to see in the future and any strange you'd recommend that i review and if you need more pop point in your life you can basically follow me everywhere else on the internet i'm pot underscore porn on snapchat i'm popcorn on instagram on popcorntv on twitter my handles for everything are in the description of this video but that's the video you guys thank you so much for watching my name is jeff peace", "NRP8dYFXOZY": "I just wanted to show you guys this individually I've showed these in a previous video but I didn't review these individually CBD hemp direct sells some pre-roll some options include 1 Grand Prix rolls 3 gram and a jazzy pre-roll joint with Keith infused in it now I've smoked one of these and a little risk associated with this is that this one here with the wrap on it and with all the bud that came into it when I put this on the scale it comes out at 4 grams it's about even when I put one of these two on it it comes out at like 2.8 so that's obviously less than the 3 grams of flour that you're supposed to begin so for the 15 dollar price that these are they really while 3 grams of flour is worth $15 these things go pretty quickly I was lucky enough to get these as add-on items before CBD hemp direct updated their website and got rid of add-on items so these were definitely worth the add-on price but I don't think that with what you get out of these pre rolls here that they're really worth like 12 bucks or 810 a gram you know this one I think you can get it for like 8 bucks I got it for 5 and I feel like it's barely worth the 5 so if you are a fan of pre-rolls and you were curious as to what you'll get with CBD hemp directs payrolls they blunts are juicy J hand perhaps they aren't tobacco wraps so they're a lot smoother and they are absolutely full of flavor the strawberry is actually really really strong and the natural I thought this was gonna be more of like a green tobacco leaf flavor but this is actually like a very light vanilla very very pleasant if I were to go back and get more pre-rolls from them I would just order Naturals the tubes that they come in are really cool though this the the reason I bought this pre-roll here was just because I wanted the screw top tube the one gram pre-rolls you might get this with the quark super satisfying to hold CBD hemp directs buds are you know little harsh so you know keep that in mind when you're ordering this these are the AC diesel strains they used to use cherry wine but they upgraded their pre-rolls to AC diesel so if you were curious and wanted to see a pre-roll in size comparison before ordering one this is what you'll get", "mKrqfPOIWSU": "yeah you guys go out there up your pre-roll game if you get it in a cardboard box and it's uh they're dry grab yourself a pack case throw above it in there let it sit for 24 hours your experience will be completely different than smoking a dry pre-roll nobody wants to do that anymore so let's let's change that welcome everybody this is anthony with boveda joined today by cody ziering with pac case how the hell are you buddy i'm good i'm good i'm coming off vacation so i'm still uh still a little bit of vacation mode um which is always a fun little area to be in no doubt uh best part about vacation is on the way their worst part of vacation is coming back to the office and seeing 18 000 emails waiting for you it happens all the time i know yeah so it's just been pitchforking out of that but um things are good yeah there's a lot going on here a lot of things to talk about today absolutely industry's booming boveda is booming pack cases booming let's get to it where do you want to start i mean you want to start with i guess how we kind of ran into each other years ago yeah absolutely this has been a long time coming no doubt um where was that i think mj biz vegas 2017 maybe yeah okay um yeah you guys what launched in 2016. just about yeah we uh we we came up with the idea very very early on like january 2nd 2016 we were still working for a vertically integrated cannabis company right near aspen colorado great experience gave us great insight into the industry and really what the cannabis market kind of demands uh and everything has come from there it was like it was one of my first very first trade shows i think when i walked over and saw you guys um it was a funny story we we bumped into you uh quite literally um saw your shirt and were like oh we know bobito we love that and we just started talking with you brett and i actually got invited brett's my business partner everybody in case uh nobody nobody knew that uh brettgelfan shout out to you buddy um brett and i actually went to that convention for free the cannabis company had purchased tickets for us and we had left before the show happened so we got to go on their dime and you know that's kind of when our world turned around and how did you how did you guys get into the space again um what was your background before pack case funny funny story uh i was working tech i was uh working for apple at the time i was an engineer um doing some annoying stuff on the phones with in between customers and engineering kind of realized that uh corporate life wasn't for me i needed a change and i was helping brett work on some website for some cannabis company uh two weeks later he said hey we need a director of marketing are you interested i jumped on the opportunities like all right we'll pack your stuff and get to colorado next month uh time to start so went out there a little bit of nepotism uh brett's uh brett's dad my dad and the guy that hired us have all been friends for 30 35 years i guess he wanted some smart cheap labor at the time and that's uh kind of how we got our invitation but a few months later unfortunately he got sick and it put brett and i in a position where we were running the show uh in our young 20s which is absurd to put 20 year olds in charge of a 15 million cannabis company but hey you know you got to do what you got to do in business it sure is yeah we have a similar story too um you know i want to hear it how did you get started please yeah no i was i was in tech as well like straight out of college um under the fluorescent lights in a cube sea of cubes and i was like oh yes i'm getting out of school i'm gonna you know work and sell stuff and pay off my loans and you know it's a big fortune 500 company and uh after about a year and a half you know i was going through started out as like uh you know basically a quote guy you know early on learning the sales process and then moved through quickly but i know i wanted to to sell and to really own accounts and quarterback stuff and i talked to my boss and he's like well that's probably eight to ten years away for you and so i'm like oh i can be patient but uh not that patient [Laughter] and uh yeah luckily family friends um one of my family friends lived down the street from my cousin again nepotism here lucky right place right time but um kate holstein who's in charge of our international business she's been uh she actually got me to sidetrack even more she got me my first job um working like as a banquet server at weddings and so i've just i've known her since i was a kid basically and she's like hey i worked this company boveda and um now we make these humidity control packs we're in the cannabis space we're in the tobacco market and we're in the music industry and i heard those three things i said cool i mean yeah i'm in so i interviewed with them long story short um you know as employee number 12 and i think we're over 65 now and that was just four and a half years ago so um really fun fun place to work similar stories here we're basically um very similar in what we do our products and our services are very complementary to the things we're trying to address here to the cannabis industry 100 peanut butter and jelly uh especially for for pre-rolls we make something that's uh great for protecting them and you guys make sure that they stay fresh and tasty for as long as absolutely possible longer than most thought would be possible exactly so anthony i mean we've been talking we've known each other for a long time but really i don't know the the story behind boveda how how did that come about what is it like tell everybody what bovita is yeah so um it's a really simple product and that's that's what uh that's what we like most about it but it's very effective and it works pretty well um it started 25 years ago a couple of guys in the tobacco business they were cigar smokers saw a problem with uh humidification one-way humidification for regulators for cigar humidors um they said there's got to be a better way to do this so they worked um with a couple of engineers from general mills here in minnesota on coming up with a product that's able to basically self-control it's not you you don't have to add anything to it um and it's a two-way controller so in a deficit environment it'll add humidity and then when there's not enough it'll or when there's too much it'll it'll absorb some too so it's it's really getting rid of those peaks and hills and valleys of humidity um and so that that technology started for the like i said for the the cigars and tobacco business and then over time and we i'm sure this has been talked about on many of our other podcasts but um you know we started seeing these tobacco stores uh selling a lot of products in northern california um to the traditional market and um there's like wow there's there's a demand for this on the cannabis space too and that was probably 10 12 years ago now um and so we came up with our our 62 formula and um you know from there the the technology has really stayed the same but we've been finding out more about how this technology can um you know not just protect weight and help you know manage the moisture content or water activity but to also preserve terpenes and trichome integrity so it's been fun to to watch how it's how it's grown and what we've learned um that's that's really fun there's a huge feast of thought culture here feast of learning love of learning um that's that's something that's at our very core um and we have a lab down in um the basement of our hq here where a lot of these tests are being ran we have a lot of partners um different labs across the states and even internationally that help run tests and it's it's really cool uh so yeah that's you know it's a bit of a ramble there but that's uh no it it it sounds super cool i mean we did we've we've been doing r d on our products for four years you know always trying to come up with new stuff but we just have to make a really interesting design and make sure it's structurally integral you guys you have to do some chemical engineering which i can only imagine just ups the level of difficulty by you know to the umpteenth degree so good for you guys it's great that you guys can do everything downstairs and run humidity tests and i know that's a great segue into what we'll we'll talk about next because you can't really run a humidity test without measuring what you're trying to contain the humidity within uh which kind of leads me on to what we do over a pack case and we make these really amazing joint cases this is one of our awesome hemp clients father obsidian but check this out we call this product a jpeg it's our flagship so you'll notice inside this is what's amazing to bovida and everyone who uses it there's a gasket seal that lines the actual case to hold five payrolls um so when you close it you can actually hear the click that's how you know it's sealed and then our favorite part not so boveda is central but we have a extra little place that you can store roaches so you can't finish a joint you don't want to stink up the rest of uh the fresh ones inside the pack that was a really cool idea um so as we were developing this the whole reason we put a gasket in there was to make sure that pre-rolls stayed fresh unfortunately in this industry the pre-roll has been an underutilized product skew for so long such an easy product to produce it's something that from a beginner to an intermediate to a super heady everyone loves smoking joints everyone loves smoking bloods and when we first got in the industry back in 2016 everyone was just taking trim that shitty extra leftover whatever stuffing in a pre-roll and saying okay good enough today now it's totally different story people use only flower premium everything sometimes they're even caviar which means that they may have a core with some hash or are wrapped with some keef and some extra little bits on the outside and can exceed retail values of over 50 bucks in fact last time i was in vegas at the show we went to a dispensary planet 13 and they were selling a can of cigar for a thousand dollars uh so the pre-roll game has totally evolved now think about this anthony what would what would you do if you went out you bought a blood that was a thousand dollars and it was dry i would immediately want to return it right and can you probably not probably not so products like that have to be in something that's airtight and gasket sealed and if you're doing it the right way you have a bill vita pack in there as well yeah no doubt um you you brought up some really interesting stuff cody um do you mind expanding a little bit on how you've seen um you know we're we're more on the you know we certainly work with a lot of companies that manufacture pre-rolls um but also you know people that are just packaging grams or eighths or quarters or ounces or pounds um but it seems you know i mean you guys have a focus on pre-rolls do you want to elaborate on how that's changed throughout like the last four or five years um you know going into this more premium stuff versus just the consumable hey you know the dispensary is running a deal and you get a free pre-roll and it's kind of just like everyone expects oh it's it's probably gonna be dry it's probably not gonna taste very good but i mean how is it where is it changed and where is it changing where is it going yeah absolutely like i had said before when we first got into it no one really cared they just took a pre-roll they were sometimes even making them in the dispensary with leftover whatever after bagging out you know an eighth for a customer there's maybe another gram or two in the jar so the manager said screw it let's grind it up throw it in some pre-rolls and now we can sell it today the pre-roll is a main sku in the industry i think it accounts for maybe 10 15 20 somewhere in there depending on the month of total cannabis sales in the entire country so clearly they're here to stay and it's a product that people love so very quickly back in 2016 and 17 when we were starting pack case we realized that the pre-roll was super underutilized it wasn't really given the appreciation that it should have i mean it's a top level sku it's a real money maker and it doesn't take a lot of money to actually start producing them so we created our product because there wasn't any premium offerings like i said everyone was just throwing [ __ ] in a tube and or a bag and that was it there really wasn't like a uh a big demand for people asking for quality pre-rolls and we didn't understand that because as pre-roll enthusiasts someone who we smoke joints all the time especially when we went skiing or out for hikes or whatever joints are the way to go um no one really had anything that was nice or worth talking about bringing home so instead we just buy flour and roll our own but it left a huge amount of market opportunity for all these cannabis companies who weren't doing something to make a premium sku that addresses a huge market need so there was an incredible amount of demand and no supply whatsoever and that's where pac case came in to fill the gap and give opportunities to companies like this to be able to sell a premium pre-roll so was pac case kind of born on the mountain per se it's funny uh we quickly came up with the idea late at night uh the second night that brett and i had ever met um just because we were talking about going skiing and taking joints before we ever had a prototype uh i had actually uh three or four joints like in my chest pocket um took a little kicker while i was skiing and totally yard sale ate [ __ ] skis went flying worst part though uh i was kind of hurt and the joints were all broken so not only was i like in pain i couldn't smoke so it was it was rough so brett and i very quickly jumped on finding someone to help us out with the design and we quite literally used our prototype our very first one which i have right here super basic shitty design but uh this i used for an entire winter to hold pre-rolls and make sure that they wouldn't break so connor was uh was born out of uh two things a we needed a person we had a personal need we needed to be able to carry joints on the mountain or going for hikes or wherever uh and at the same time we knew that the cannabis market needed it too so it was a little bit of a selfish uh build it was kind of doing it for us and then realized there was a business behind it too that's that's exactly it though i mean that's how great products and ideas are born what's what's uh what's a problem i'm facing in my world today like some broken pre-rolls and then you know there's gonna be thousands of other people that have the same problem so cool stuff i've always loved your guys products um and you guys um you have your your five pack obviously what's what's more of your consumer facing um your duo right do you have you don't have a single though because who's gonna smoke a single joint i mean you're always gonna have one for a buddy so you would think that we uh we do have a we may or may not i cannot confirm or deny that we have a single in the works um but it won't be ready for a while if in fact we're working on something uh really though like one is never enough right like two is always better than one three is better than two and [ __ ] if you can have five will have five um so it's it's what's most amazing and what i find most interesting about our product and why it it works so well on both sides of the aisle um it's a packaging product it was always developed to be a packaging product and whole allow cannabis companies to sell pre-rolls but over the course of a year or two as we were our social media was growing and people were starting to find out about what we were doing people started asking for these just like hey i don't live in a cannabis state how do i get one um so we put them up on amazon and let it ride and uh two years later we've sold you know more than 50 000 units and are absolutely crushing a thousand reviews which blows my mind and we have over four and a half stars which on a product intended for packaging that gets sold as an accessory yeah blows my mind every time 100 and um one thing that i've always loved about your guys product is that um you know you can you can customize it um you know the the business can go put their branding on it and customize it however they want um that's a huge thing especially up in canada and some other markets that um you know they can't necessarily advertise or brand do you have any experience there um helping companies really market their brand with your guys packaging technology i'm glad that you asked that anthony pack case technically is a packaging company right that's the product that we sell but really when you get down to things we consider ourselves a marketing company we give our clients an ability to brand and promote products in ways that they wouldn't be able to before our packaging may be slightly more expensive than everyone else on the market but that's obviously because it's a premium feel what other packaging can go out and say hey i sell for 20 on amazon but instead you can come to my dispensary take five of my best highest quality joints with delicious flour have my brand on it and then now go and walk around with it so we give these companies not just an opportunity to create beautiful packaging that's going to create an amazing customer experience but we also allow their customers to then become a walking advertisement for their company think about it you buy a jpack from somebody that means you have five joints so you take one joint out to smoke with a friend well you're obviously gonna close the pack put it back in your pocket again you still have four left so you're gonna hold on to the packaging for a long time which means anytime you smoke with somebody and you take that out your brand as a company gets exposed to their friend who's now likely to become a customer their self themselves yeah well and let's let's back up to a second so let's talk about um the premium aspect so and what that value can can mean not only to a business but to the consumer so your guys you go i mean let's and we can even back up to that leap down study that we helped you guys do so that by let's explain this to the the people so yeah boba can take uh packaging and put it into a um a dry chamber put above the pack in there and then we can basically estimate the shelf life or stability how long the boba packs can last how long the product is going to stay fresh um versus no active humidity control versus having a boat pack in there and then we can compare that um against the control and give you hey this is going gonna you know add an extra week two weeks a month some cases um let's should we chat about uh how that went and what that kind of means for brands and consumers as far as you know brands are gonna be able to go into more inventory and that's something that we've seen on on the boveda side is um you know a big concern or a big problem facing a lot of these operators was hey we're just trying to get product on the shelf because the supply and demand chart is totally kitty wampus and you know we've had cultivators operators say we're we're trying to like they're torn especially these commercial ones because they want to have a longer cure on their their flower and they wanna couldn't really control that quality um but then they have um people in the supply chain saying hey this dispensary's been out of said strain this amount of flour for x amount of days and like we just we need to get on the shelf it's just flying off the shelf that we have seen as i have seen personally that's kind of slowing down and people are able to go into more inventory and carry more um but our products together can help assure that that shelf life is there and so product isn't sitting for two three months and then it's sold dry that's one of the benefits of being able to use pack case and boveda together um these operators who you know think about it if you have a production team of 10 well you don't necessarily want to have two people doing pre-rolls and two people doing edibles and spread out your labor force a lot of the times it's more efficient and our clients have told us this that you know i want to put my entire production team have them do an entire run start to finish bang it out and then move on to the next project now when you do that with flour with pre-roll with something that's not necessarily super shelf stable like a concentrate or an edible you have to have velocity so not only do you have to package it up quickly you have to get it out the door you have to get it to the dispensary they have to shelve it and then they have to get it out to the consumer now that process can take a lot longer than it would take a cannabis to dehumidify and then dry out lose terpenes lose flavor lose potency and mess with um with effects right like if uh some thc converts into cbd that flower that you smoke once it's converted is gonna make you feel totally different than if it didn't exactly so with boveda and pack case because they're such a tremendous seal these producers have the ability to make an entire run of pre-rolls leave them in their factory if they have to and as long as it's properly sealed and the boveda pack is fresh these pre-rolls are going to last a lot longer which means that their production problems that come along with having to do massive runs and then making it like sit on it as opposed to doing smaller runs and moving them quicker and making a regular process makes life a lot easier for them they can sit down bang out all of their pre-rolls that they need for a month and two days and then not have to worry about the quality at all because of the protection that pacquiao boveda provides yeah and a term that comes to mind that i hear a lot is consistency um and that's that's what a lot these brands want to deliver because they know in a lot of these markets especially on the east coast where i've been working predominantly it's medicine so uh you know it's if you can the cannabis plant in the flower is not a it's not a pill and it's very volatile and so like you said um you start getting that trichome degradation and you're gonna lose medicinal benefits um and it's like you know going to get your prescription and your short your short two pills and there's an extra one magical pill tossed in there you know it's like you you want to make sure that the product is consistent and delivered same same smell same taste same flavor same effect every time and uh yeah i think i think our our two products definitely can help um in that in that regard absolutely cannabis obviously is a product that affects headspace and if you find something that works for you and you find something that you like you want to make sure that if you buy it again it's going to have the same exact effect uh there's only one way to do that in terms of flour and pre-rolls and that's control the humidity making sure that the product stays the same on day one as it is on day 30 and potentially even out to day 60s so it's important i know that a lot of people that consume cannabis for medical reasons um which there are many that's how this whole industry really started right um they need that they need consistency of dose they need consistency of effect and you can only do that by controlling terpene and humidity content right yup yup there's no doubt about that and then um you know let's another thing that i've been seeing um and sorry this is so salesy just because that's the world that i live in every day is just sales but um you know competition between brands um i i like to think of the cannabis industry as a more friendly um competition uh than any than any other industry that i've been in or or seen where it's you know really we're we're all in this together with one common goal and that's to bring uh relief to a lot of people and liberty to a lot of people um to do what they want with their lives consume what they want and um just not step on anyone else's toes but competition on shelf space um is the pack case boveda combo is that something that people can use to set their their brands apart from others is that can you take these these two common value adds and educate the consumer to say hey i'm gonna my pre-rolls are gonna probably be better in here by the time i get them depending on when they were packaged and you know i'm gonna have an extra two three weeks to go through these um with the boveda pack and then you know i have the pack case forever um these are these are things that consumers care about and are gonna want is that messaging from the consumer is that getting driven to these brands that are making these decisions on packaging yet it's a good question some of the brands who really have a premium focus and a premium attention absolutely they understand that their customers keep coming back to them because their products are so good some of the there's a lot of a lot unfortunate but there's a lot of cannabis companies out there that really don't cater to a premium market um and don't really care about the quality of their products um you know like i said a lot of them are still back in the model of 2016. let's take any leftover [ __ ] that we have let's toss it in a pre-roll put it in the doob tube and just send it whatever happens happens i don't know about you but whenever i consume something that affects headspace uh alcohol cannabis whatever else it may be i always want to make sure that i'm getting something that's quality and consistent um price isn't so much uh a concern of mine right i would much rather pay an extra 20 or 30 bucks to know that uh the quality that i'm getting is there versus having to deal with some [ __ ] for a much cheaper cost i believe that if you're gonna intake something it should only be the the best quality you know it's affecting you like you as yourself not a car not a house you and your health so for me as a consumer i always want to make sure i'm getting high quality and i think that there's a lot of companies that value my sentiment and cater towards a client like me when you have a customer that doesn't you end up with shitty product and that creates a negative loop sure you're going to get the sale once or twice because it's a cheap product but i doubt that person's coming back to you there's no consistency there's no flavor it's all dry harsh smoke it's no good no one likes that yeah and that's i think that's changing too i think as more people get introduced to cannabis i mean we talk about all these people taking baby steps i mean i was down in in florida i had a dispensary doing a visit and i i witnessed what i always knew was going on down there but never had witness for myself which was a woman that looked just like my grandma going into a dispensary for the first time and she has all of her paperwork and she looks at the the person at the front desk and she's kind of you know pretty coy and her her husband's behind her um you know they're just kind of looking around and she goes i'm here to um purchase some marijuana it's so cool to see that but there's so many people that need to be become educated on you know multiple different aspects of cannabis um but it's there's so many new people coming into it and uh that's that's a that's a big piece of the education piece and you know knowing what you're consuming how it's gonna make you feel um you know what you like essentially there are a lot of people figuring out what they like and um you know here in minnesota it's tough for me uh because we don't have um you know like we don't have adult use here so i can't just go in and say hey you know i'm wanting this today and that's uh that's something that a lot of new states are having which is is great um and uh sorry i kind of lost my train of thought here it's all good those are those were always my fate when when i was back at the cannabis company those are always my favorite people you know there were times and days where you know as just a higher level employee at the company uh the dispensary was short-handed so i'd have to go in there and maybe put a quick shift in and just talk to cool people about wheat all day it was honestly not a bad way to uh spend a couple hours outside of my normal role my favorite customers were always the older folks who really had never id any idea they'd walk in they'd always be like hey can i like can i buy some weed yeah and it's like you don't have to whisper it's legal welcome to the cannabis store let me show you what what are you what are you interested in what would you like to try are you interested in smoking something would you like to vape something would you like to try an edible it's always great introducing those people to the entire world something that as an enthusiast we've been living for decades right but i don't want to date myself but [ __ ] it's been a long time um yeah it's it's it's remarkable the clearly the direction of the country the world is totally changing our neighbors up to the north were a lot smarter than we were legalized a lot quicker and look what happened now they have five or six companies in cannabis worth over a billion dollars you ever think that there'd be a unicorn in cannabis now there's five it's insane yep ellen what do you think is i mean comparing the canada to the u.s right now um especially these last couple weeks um just these these larger operators and what what is that what does this mean for cannabis in 2021 um as far as these these bigger companies you know that and you know four or five years ago in the grassroots cannabis movement semi grassroots cannabis movement um you know a lot of it was the the buzz around trade shows in the industry was all these you know these big companies are gonna come in and they're gonna start getting swooped up and the commercialization does cannabis in your opinion cody does it kind of model what happened uh recently this last decade with beer craft beer and you know your big domestic beer is there gonna be a commercial side of cannabis and then also room for the craft cultivator um that's really focused on small quality good stuff um that's gonna be competing against you know price and volume from some of these giants that's a great question the beer model is one that is perfect to use as an analogy um i think myself a lot of these major cannabis companies are swooping up a lot of the smaller ones there's a lot of conglomeration that's going on in the industry obviously when you kind of grow as a company or you want to expand you either need additional growth space which requires additional licensing so a lot of the small guys or the guys that were in quickly did some decent growing started as a startup and made it to mid-sized company those are ideal acquisition targets for the big boys so i think what's going to happen at least the next three four years is that all the big boys are going to start to swoop up a lot of the smaller guys that's where you emerge the budweiser the coors light all the the general high volume lower quality lower price type products from that will come the grassroots movement again so i think everything is going to kind of go underground for a little while and all these craft companies in maybe three four years will start to emerge when people really care about quality and it's not so much about bottom dollar anymore yeah we have a huge canadian client that we love working with when we first started with them they had a huge huge initiative and focus on innovation it was 2018 they had an opportunity to really try and control the market with an innovative awesome product uh cost was no object they said [ __ ] it we want the coolest best highest quality product that we can provide and it worked out great for them they quickly jumped into one of the leaders positions in the industry in canada and everything was was great it towards the end of 2019 and then with uh early covid uh early 2020 uh their share price fell dramatically they were you know their balance sheets showed that they were just outlaying cash left and right for the innovation without necessarily realizing that when you spend so much on innovation it takes a long time for it to come back right roi on innovation is a year year and a half process minimum for us for example you know we started designing jpeg trio in 2018 it didn't get launched until you know mid 2019 it took 12 16 months 18 months to get the product out there so with this cannabis company even though they were so amazingly focused on innovation for the first part once legalization happened now they realize that it's all about bottom dollar and how do we reduce cost of goods so now instead of trying to produce flowers that may be tastier but take an extra two weeks now they're producing lower quality genetics that harvest faster that they can just turn around and sell and cheaper packaging and i think that's now the start of where you see the the budweiser and the the coors lights versus like uh you know a small batch brewing company really focused on delivering a delicious tasty product i mean one has consistency one has flavor yup but you know which would you prefer to drink budweiser or the the local craft beer pretty easy decision in my opinion yeah well for me too it's a time and place thing sometimes uh you know being from minnesota and uh going up to the cabin a busch light just kind of brings you back you know i love those you mean can't hate on that i'm a big coors guy i went to school in colorado spent a few years in co i love course especially like any tailgate absolutely but then you know you're trying to drink 16 18 beers potentially and really have yourself an afternoon that's not so much the case when you're drinking something that's a little bit tastier and perhaps next to a steak and maybe you're gonna have one or two very different days though the pairing is everything bingo and the season two i'm a big seasoned guy when it comes to those things absolutely you brought up uh i don't know how much time we have here ramsay um but you brought up uh kovid um how do you think that's been um impacting i guess pros and cons um your guys customers people you've been working with um you know if i can touch briefly i can just say what i've noticed is um i think a lot of these quality things sops standard practices best practices a lot of these procedural things are starting to really get drilled into um on paper and people are starting to like really figure their their [ __ ] out um and that's i think making a little bit extra room for products and services that focus on true value-add and um you know roi that you know we can bovada specifically too can can really tell you hey your flower your inventory your entire inventory weighs this today um and here's the percent moisture content um if you added two percent moisture content to that entire inventory here's the literal change in fair market value of your inventory i think those things now it's not it's not everything's not moving so fast where it's hey package it get it you know it doesn't matter if it cures on the shelf whatever we just we got to get it in stores because we don't have any and people are buying it anyway um i think covid kind of or the lockdown specifically um kind of help people really look at their what they're doing their day-to-day operations and where they can make changes have you guys noticed that too absolutely it gave you know business operators a chance to sit back and not be surrounded by the buzz of a hopping office and they actually had a few moments to think about like hey what can we do better what can we do to improve like our everything our process is top to bottom from growing the production of packaging to sales yeah um what's interesting is that you know this is what makes me happy is that a lot of the country deemed cannabis in a central industry um okay would you ever have been able to imagine that 10 years ago probably not i mean even back in 2014 but government said hey people need cannabis especially in california and all the cannabis companies stayed open so i think having those cannabis restrictions that got imposed on everybody required all these business operators to really sit back and understand how can we do things more efficiently because [ __ ] i used to run my growing operation with 40 people well now i can only have 15 in the building so how are we still going to manage the same output but with less than half of the labor staff forces you to sit back and really think about what you're doing and if you guys are cutting short you know corners trying to take a shortcut when that's not necessarily the best thing to do or neces or even necessary you know small little changes in process like adding a movita pack into your curing box can potentially generate an extra 300 000 a year for a mid-sized cannabis company it's substantial and that tiny little you know how much could that really end up costing you a couple thousand dollars over the course of a year when you can end up you know that can let you back a couple hundred thousand so a lot of these guys with cannabis you just you've been running and like you you ever try and get on a treadmill when it's set at 10 you there's no warm-up time you just have to get down and start sprinting yeah college a couple times yeah i'm not sure if those ended well but that's that's what working in a cannabis company is like the moment that your product goes out the door for the first time it's off to the races you have now an endless uh endless demand for your product and you have to continuously handle that that with good supply um and they don't haven't had a lot of time to think about it as soon as they got on that treadmill it's just off to the races full sprint covent gave them a chance to sit back take a second step off the treadmill and try and figure out what they should actually be doing yeah i completely agree um definitely notice that as well on our end um all right cody uh what's next for paccase great question we have a couple cool new packaging products coming out but that's not really what what tickles me i get very excited about the consumer market i love bringing products to people that will actually use it so we have a really awesome new case that should be launching the next five six months uh think jpac an iphone had a baby that's about all i can touch on it yeah well that's uh that's intriguing um because i think i think i know where that's going um don't wanna don't want to speculate too much but um and where can you pick these up so i know you said amazon um i know you guys have uh point of purchase displays too so i'm assuming that it's this is getting into more mass retail absolutely yeah we uh we sell in a couple different places you can go out and check uh jpac products out on amazon number one uh our shopping website packcase.com i'm sorry packcase.shop you can get there from packcase.com as well um and now they're we're starting to be available in retailers so there's a whole bunch of distributors starting to pick these up so you should start seeing them in retail stores over the next few months and if you're a retailer and interested in picking up our products we have a wonderful wholesale section on paccase.shop so make sure to stop there put in a little vendor request and we'll make sure to get to you so you guys can start selling pack cases yourself cool cool yeah same thing for boveda um we're on amazon we're in the retail stores uh we have a direct site businesses we have a wholesale site too um yeah you guys go out there up your pre-roll game if you get it

not think that i was going to smoke one so this is a this is a fun surprise and it's it's been quite a minute since i was actually intimidated by uh getting ready to consume intimidated is the word i do here it's intimidating i hear that from the bud tenders people are a little bit intimidated by the price point but when you talk about luxury items the best of the best the best some of the best flour exotic collaborations look at this grenade it's quite literally a grenade there's a pin there's this handle super cool i don't know if you guys can see this but they're the the uh the little fire emoji emblem that they have is right there on the glass it's it's insane so we're gonna jump right in we're going to keep it keep it consistent with the west coast we tour we're going to hit it once talk about it we're going to hit it twice we're going to give it a 4 out of 10. um you're supposed to smoke this all the way through we are going to put this out after a couple hits after we talk about it uh and then i'll dive in because no most people are gonna put this out unless they are fully prepared to smoke 200 which we might have to do it are you ready yeah all right let's let me let's let's let's get it rolling three and a half grams of flour how do i see you pull the pin you pull this out i don't i didn't pull if you have to pull yeah yeah very easily without the engineering packaging i'd be impressed oh yeah you just twisted them out that's pretty cool okay so we've got this eight gram monster here check this out you guys oh wait lift ticket paper that's it lift it we'll have to look that up wow it's gonna be dope it's gonna be dope i'm pretty excited all right you guys we got the torch i'm gonna massage it out just a little bit i do hear the general feedback is that these canoes so we will have to find out let's dry hit figure out dry head is smooth and creamy uh was there a strain oh the blue tummies all right here we go [Music] we got too much all right here we go nothing yet let's try to just try it with a little bit of a lighter all right so i can tell you right off the bat it's tough to hit the airflow is really good on it though it's not like it's too tight it's nothing to do with that i definitely rips through super nice that ceramic tip that's the nicest mouthpiece on anything i've ever smoked without a doubt it's very easy to rip the flavor is super creamy tiny little bit of gas and i'm getting a tiny little bit of berry like tiny little bits of like blueberry or maybe blackberry or whatever it is i don't know just berries so [ __ ] curious right it's pretty heavy it's large a lot of flavor to it when it comes to the flour again it's the blue tommies you got one gram of live resin the lift ticket infused rolling paper and the ceramic tip super delicious product i'm not sure as to the genetics of the blue tommies i'm not sure on the tripping profile on that i do wish that was included on here um the lift ticket information would love would love to know the stream for the live resin on that but we could probably look this up on their instagram or something um overall i think it's a delicious experience super heavy definitely like you mentioned the weight it's a solid super solid the the branding and the product appeal off the charts um this group napalm with exhibit you know they just really went above and beyond to deliver truly a premium experience kind of redefining the pre-roll category it is a pre-roll joint rolling papers infused rolling papers live resin seven grand premium indoor flower and it rips we did hear rumors of it kind of canoeing on some people at least i've heard that from multiple sources uh but this is honestly smoking pretty much perfectly yeah i'm um i'm actually impressed by how it smokes because that's how you light it though well definitely how you light it's going to control a lot of it but in terms of i thought it would be like an overpowering smoke yeah that it would really hit not harsh no not at all no like it actually i guess delicious the amount of wheat in there does a nice job of filtering the smoke as it comes down yeah absolutely um yeah i think that ceramic tip too super smooth just to just like i wonder what else could you re-roll with the ceramic tip though i think i'm definitely going to keep this running tip i'm going to see if we're able to kind of clean it and reuse it i don't know about my rolling abilities to roll another one i don't think i have it in me to roll any grammar that's for sure that's the i mean for for me with the the packaging i love this because it's that this is the child resistance resistant piece um i'd be curious as to how airtight it is i'm sure it's pretty airtight but you could put weed in here oh yeah definitely reuse it here just to show the people to reuse this as as the stash jar for your weed uh a great grenade glass and you guys can see the flame right there on the front and that's not just like a random jar that they got repurposed they had to get this jar custom-made that's dope that i i'm usually gonna look for for reasons to to dislike packaging for for waste related reasons but this is cool enough to keep so it goes into that category you can do a lot with this not just put weed in it like it's a do you have a tournament or some [ __ ] do you have a score in mind out of 10 for this review because i am extremely impressed with this the price obviously you know it's a product in its own category on the on the category i'm gonna from for my sport it's gonna be relative to other pre-rolls uh and i'm not gonna consider cost because you know when you're when you're getting a piece like that that's getting that [ __ ] piece yeah yeah um and for that reason i'm going to give that a eight eight five eight point five eight point five on it okay i'm surprised myself that i would give it that type of score with again this is without knowing much about the flower but in terms of the harshness of the smoke blue tommy's flower seven grand premium indoor from the backpack boys is that bay area hype [ __ ] right is [Music] i think i think backpack boys are la boys is is bae oh so i'm confusing the two i i might be confusing the two this is let us know we don't know this is that but like no i think i think that that's an la outfit i [ __ ] i'll [ __ ] with it man i think this is some of the best the best i've smoked the lyric hannah gars i've smoked i've smoked 10 of those zero cannagars the biggest of the biggest the ounces the small 12 grammers the small ones the the the seven grammars i believe is what uh the smallest one i think some something like that this is incredible here's here's what i'll say about this so she's probably my my highest cost on a quarterly to perhaps buy monthly occasion i would pay retail for this that's impressive that that's uh for the writing for the right occasion for the right group for the right reason to to celebrate this is a nice piece for that my score out of 10 out of 100 i'll respect my recent website i'm coming in at 9.2 and it's the same issues that i typically have would love to know more about the genetics we'd love to have a terpene profile on there it just really helps to cement the the experience you're about to have as a consumer as a customer we're paying good money for for just weed in general at this point and the consumer we want to know what we're about to experience flavor wise taste wise high wise and i know that can sometimes be a lot to ask for but there's so much going on on this product and there's a nice beautiful empty space in the back of the tag that it would have been huge maybe that's where they put like the sticker in the testing results well but there's two spots one one we could go qr code on there yeah i'm always with a qr code i'm looking at this and you could have they could put a nice insert in here yeah yeah because all that's sitting in there is the is the piece which you don't need to see anyway i mean i couldn't really tell what it looked like until i took it out anyway and i couldn't even add to the allure perhaps this is a free game for dave paul and for any packaging people or branding people creating a surprise when the product comes out that's a nice little uh endorphin rush for the consumer it's going to be memorable for that experience but also to so fill this with information about perhaps the farmer or the medium that it's grown in or the history of the company the people that are involved anything that you can associate to the story yeah yeah yeah i think that's fair too so like i said you know 9.25 for me more information on the story more information on the terpenes and the genetics and to them to me it's a perfect product regardless of the price point i think this is something that i would pay the money that for a couple times a year you know either as gifts or for myself uh i thoroughly enjoy it experience in itself the overall potency of this [ __ ] it's all fire it all tastes really good yeah i would uh i would love to find reasons to to hate on it but as it goes well we'll let you guys do the hating make sure you all type

the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "2AZ_bgGoLSU": "[Music] hey guys what's going on welcome back to another stream review today we're gonna be reviewing purple punch [Music] purple punch is a sweet union of larry og and grand daddy purple this is a delicious dessert stream that it's better when you like after dinner you just smoke one of these you can start feeling really relaxed look at the size of this knot okay this is the this is a seven gram nug look at this he said oh my whole palm the ceiling there's a beauty look at that look at the little logs down it has like little nugs inside nuts like if you if you look in here you see this little knot inside of the knot inside of the nog i think they call it foxtail and don't quote me on that but i think that he has like mug inside not inside now a bunch of little knots inside lugs and in all different directions look at those orange hairs all those trichomes what a beauty beautiful whoa here's one nog they're a bunch of little nugs like they're dense too they're they're pretty dense i wonder how much one you know what let's not wander this really find out let's actually find out how much is one this like this this is this this is a small knot but it's go oh whoa whoa boy where are you going let's put this that's a gram point nine or a gram basically wow oh it has a really good smell it has like a sweet smell to it like almost grapey you can smell the terpenes i mean it's not really strong but you you smell sweetness to it like oh it smells pretty good oh this reminds me of gorilla grape have you guys ever smoked out or smell that that grape smell to it it looks beautiful you can see the purple oh look at this one look at these terpenes i mean these crystals [Music] and you can see all the purple here too look some of that purple in the leaves see it and and i haven't seen a butt like this where it has different tiny butts inside of the big buds it's a lot of little tails everywhere coming out from all this side so you can you see tail here here here i like the sweet smell that he has it's a dense bud grapey smell i wonder if he's gonna taste like grapes as well or i mean it has this sweet smell it's not pudging it's not too strong it just it has like a like a sweet grape smell to it almost candy let's let's go ahead and break one off well here it is it's gonna have this granules strained it up and as always we're using a clean bow and a new screen so that way we taste the actual kindness instead of resins from whatever so this bowl basically every time i use it i put it in solvent and i cleaned it so that way it's always a clean bowl for reviews on let's get all these orange hairs wow that's a nice crunch to it this train has 20 to sea levels and it will hit you like a train oh man this was claimed to be grown by somehow wired brilliance i mean somehow wire breeders and i think those supernova gardens however the true origin of this train is still a mystery like there's no official origin all right let's see this strain is also good for like stress um it's good for stress anxiety depression oh it smells really good as soon as you start grinding up you start spinning that grapes that derping oh it smells so good it smells like sweet no wonder it's like a good for after dinner it has that that sweet smell to it and that creepy smell oh man stays like grapes oh it says mood too you can definitely taste those terpenes that sweet grapey flavor it just hits you on the way in on the way out some but some strains that i have reviewed before they were like you when you when you breathe them in when you inhale it they don't taste the same as when they're coming out and when they when the smoke is coming out when you is when you really hit the flavor with with me on some strains and this one as soon as i hit it the smoke was on my mouth i started to taste the terpenes and the grape and the sweet flavor i inhaled it and let it out and it was just like tasting it again it was pretty good the third hit in i'm already feeling it i'm already feeling it i'm feeling really relaxed again i'm liking this i'm liking this only three hits didn't took that long to hit me i still say it has like it reminds me so much of gorilla grape because of the smell and the taste of it what i gotta say though i like this string better because i mean gorilla grape what was that i don't know it took like a whole bowl maybe a little bit more for me to start feeling the effect and it didn't last that long at least not on my i mean that was my experience with it this one three hits as you can see the bow is not even completely clunky it's still green all over i just hit it three times on this side and i'm i'm feeling it i'm feeling it right now i'm feeling like really relaxed right now i'm feeling a little giggly but hey that's i don't know i like the flavor smooth going in and out [Music] for hit end i can still taste it i still think the grapes not bad not bad hey you know what i wonder what it tastes out of a joint i say we roll the drink and we find out see how the ash burns see if we get a nice white ash or flavor so far flavor is good the butt the looks are really looking good it looks really nice it has a bunch of orange hairs white crystals all over it's dense it's not dry it has a really good flavor and and now smooth going in smooth going out i don't think this is gonna be enough usually i like to put one gram on my joints so that way to burn evenly and it burns slower because it's tight you know if you if you have a joint you don't roll it well you're going to lose you'll start side tracking or canoeing or even tunneling and um so i like to put one gram and that's gonna do it so we're gonna take this one now that's a half a gram there so you see and we're just gonna see if this yep that'll do that'll do i like to put filters in my joint so that way when i'm smoking the cannabis i don't eat it when i'm inhaling it i'm actually smoking i like to cut my paper too as you can see i did a fold here so like that i'm just gonna cut it off the less paper the more canvas i can taste i don't know it's just me it's probably not even true though but that's how i feel so like i take as much papers i can't i use i use raw blacks raw blacks it is so good because like ultra thin paper they're almost transparent of how thin it is and they're watermark so they burn evenly so you really taste what you're smoking with regular rolling papers if they're not thin enough you start tasting like burnt paper i don't like burnt paper so with this super ultra thin paper then watermark even smooth burn and more taste of cannabis than paper here we go so you see that filter now i won't eat the canvas because it's being hold back like a filter nice tight joint and you can you can actually see the canvas through the paper that's how thin it is so you can see it through the paper if this thing won't actually well take my word for it you can actually taste it on a joint too i like it i like how it's good smooth burning nice white ash this part in there [Music] even burning you can see the ring of resins forming around the joint actually yeah i feel like it's a lot smoother in a joint than it is on the boat like in the bose smooth but this right now is like super smooth i'm feeling so relaxed right now i feel good he already hit me like i'm already high i mean why could you expect 20 percent you know this is disturbing is between 20 and 23 percent but this particular batch was 20 percent seriously okay so i finished the joint and it burned smoothly it tasted good it was no problem but here's the problem that i got with this strain it's only been 17 minutes and i'm sober i'm like i haven't smoked nothing and that's not fair that's not good this is the first train that i reviewed that the effect doesn't last as long any other strain that i have reviewed before this minimum of a minimum of an hour then the effects start wearing off after an hour and and it i mean starts wearing off not like it completely improved you know it starts wearing off about an hour so i still continue to feel the effects for over an hour with this one 70 minutes into it after i smoked a bowl completely so it was a gram on a gram and a joint i don't know how much you can put on the boat but you know a bowl is worth and i feel like i haven't smoked that is terrible purple punch my ass i don't see the punch this is that punch line uh-huh i see what i did there i'm sorry that's what happens when i'm sober i get this lame ass jokes i'm just gonna keep on smoking this but you know so to end the video and wrist and to resume the whole thing it okay so it looked good because the butt looks really good it was real cured it had purple all over nice dry columns it smelled really good okay it tastes like smell smells like sweet grapes and um when you smoke a joint with it it burns right you know it's really smooth but when it goes down to the eye it will hit you fast and it will go as fast as it hit you so like three hits in and i was already like oh i was already fitting four hits in so it hits you fast but as fast it hits you that's how fast it goes away because in 17 minutes later here i am smoking water so i mean based on that if they have to give it leaves i'll give it a six leaves and that's because you look good and smell good and taste good but to me the effect is what matters not the looks so yeah six leaves and i'm gonna leave it with that guys because i'm gonna start with another bowl and start working my next review hopefully the next part is gonna be better than this we'll see what happens i'll see you guys in the next one don't forget guys i'm streaming on twitch twitch.tv slash lurk city i'll play games and do the same thing just get stoned and play games with viewers so if you guys on twitch find me there let's play some games in day high i'll see you guys later in the next episode [Music] peace [Music] you", "aiWVkxPev7A": "[Music] all right so I just got

night gang [Music] keep down please smoke everywhere we go [Music] let's go baby fam we got the joint lit as you can see it is ripping you guys you guys see the cherry on that thing I think it's back what you guys think about it yes I really like the tip that it has on it it's like I never seen a tip like that before but I'm really liking it because it keeps all the Scooby Snacks we're coming in your mouth and we also noticed that you don't have to get a hella hard like I thought that you had to be like you know how like when you roll hella fat you've got to hit it hard know that one you can hit it regular like a regular joint and it's hitting really good yeah I'm hitting it way too hard it is pretty heavy you guys there's hella [ __ ] weed in there I mean what the weed included but the tip is pretty heavy left away the tip itself see how much it that's some Gaston I didn't even know there was constant rain there either I just see like the celebrity spike scenes and I was like in aware how much to smoke on what should be cat he was saying that bringing a joint like this is like bringing like a bottle oh yeah like okay it's like usually when you go see like a family friend or just somebody like that's important to you bring him like a like a cake or a bottle you know something for like this nice gift big Oh join make sure if you have it comes to your size I mean if you ever go see your friends you pull up with one of these and yeah and if you live in a set you better keep its rental in your pocket in case you're looking up saw yeah it's kind of running a little bit late yeah that's the only thing that I'm trying to figure out how would you stop that or just [ __ ] probably start lighting the other side once I feel like you need to have like [ __ ] yeah look we did it work to catch it up old fashioned hello saliva you know stop the look going out right hopefully that works let me know what you guys do to stop your plants from running put it on but so far what do you guys what do you think I'm highest luck gets high in here it's boxy to be honest with you I'm gonna give mine to pee I'm not gonna if I go it's its exhibits joint the [ __ ] flavor is could be more flavor II like I've been smoking some SF cultivators wedding pie $61 out the door testing at 31% that [ __ ] is way better way better than this but I mean I don't know maybe maybe I maybe it's the concentrates too though I'm just doing a little bit of flavor yeah I mean honestly I'm gonna keep it really guys I feel like it's not hitting like a hundred percent it could be I think if you roll do be better but yeah you know I don't like the fact that it's running so bad I think that's like my main problem with it and yeah I feel like I'm wasting away I'm so high that I'm just like [ __ ] you know but it's like if I were to rolled it I'd be more pissed because it's like damn you exhibit homies these are hand rolled them I see them making them I'm pretty sure I have no idea what is each test bet just a big flex guys we're smoking a [ __ ] $184 joint what let me know if there's things that you guys feel like it's just for the foot I feel like designer is just for the Flex you know I know bass quality to this testing at 27 percent by the way pretty high 27 percent concentrate don't see any wax running or anything like that either so I'm not really sure where the concentrate is in the joint I mean it is like white ash though all the way yeah it definitely does the job oh yeah let's play baseball you know what I was thinking is that like it's a big guys joint you want it to last you how long Lee I don't know I didn't set a timer but it's feel like I'm going kind of fast yeah yeah you right sure it's eight I mean there's still no cuz it's hella fat but it's like you think you'll be just custom ah don't underestimate you guys and then I just want to remind you guys to go cup some lady where a wave emerged a very explosive second exclusive that we got the

$1 i'ma tell you why you guys polite you could just get so much weed with that money you could just roll so many blunts that just getting so much higher I don't know that's my s what I so I think

short amount of time [Music] want to get hella high in a short amount of time that's a good way and there's a lot of money well but it was worth it yeah it was worth anything I think I would buy it if

"88xTvMW1W18": "[Music] yo yo i'm drew gilchrist and today i wanted to do another strain history video but this time i'm doing on og kush and this is probably one of the most controversial strains i could have done a strain history on but trust me i've done a lot of research here and i really think some of this is going to blow your mind because it really blew my mind especially as he kept getting deeper and deeper whoa quickly before we get into this video though need to have a message from our sponsor of the day two loud rolling papers yo two loud rolling papers are actually amazing

to have a brand that's in the kind of scene in the uk sponsoring the channel and yeah their products are actually amazing so big love to them and i hope you guys enjoy the video so before i start this story off i need to introduce you to two people the first one being josh d josh grew up in new jersey and then moved to san fernando valley when he was 14 and then in 1991 he moved to los angeles so i need to introduce you to a second person here who is matt berger or burger i'm not really sure how to pronounce his last name so i'm just gonna call him matt for this matt was born in delaware and then he moved to florida when he was eight but he wasn't any normal kid because by the time he was 13 he was already messing around with cannabis seeds and trying to grow him and trying to grow him in school so that's a little bit of background information to keep in mind here as we're about to go into this story so we need to do a little bit of time travel in here to the year 1993. so matt went to a concert and he managed to get some northern light seeds now we don't actually know whether this is actually northern light seeds but we do know that that's what he was told he popped all the beans and at the end he had this one plant that was a bit short and stumpier than the rest but it was so much better and he called this one the bubba so we're gonna have to time travel a little bit forwards again to the year 1996. by this point matt now had three different versions of the bubba he had the bubba he had purple indica and he had the kush matt's been talking to josh dean he's been telling him about this crazy strain that he has which is unlike anything that is available in la and he's talking about the kush so matt ends up moving from florida to la to actually live with josh and he brings curtains of this on the plane he straight up just puts them into his hand luggage jumps on the plane and goes over to la so after josh d and matt and the crew do their first harvest they sit down they have a smoke together and they find out that this the kush is one of the strongest strains they've ever smoked josh steven says that the first harvest of the kush is actually the highest he's ever been so after a year or so the word of the cush has gotten out in l.a like people are talking about it people are wanting it and because of this naturally people are adding kush onto their own strains they're trying to make sales by saying hey this is something kush hey this is this kush you know and eventually people are coming up to josh d and they're saying to him hey man what type of kush is this and he's there and he's obviously saying well what do you mean it's the original okay i guess we need to quickly address the elephant in the room here which is what does og out of og kush actually mean so a lot of people will try and say that it's either original gangster or that it's ocean grown neither of them are right so josh d himself has said in many different places that og literally just means original the original gangster stuff started coming around after you know the rappers in la started smoking the og kush obviously they didn't know what og meant they started dubbing it the original gangster now ocean grown basically happened the exact same way as the rapping thing except in a different scene of people so people had this og kush they didn't know what og meant they're in california they're growing next to the ocean and these people suddenly assumed hey maybe this is called ocean growth and then suddenly ocean grown became what was known for og kush josh d says in an interview that he doesn't really mind people saying that it's ocean grown as long as they actually do grow it by the ocean and i think i share pretty similar views to that i think that you know where nobody really knew exactly what og meant for such a long time you know there were growers and people who crossbred og with different strains who you know thought og meant original gangster or they thought og meant ocean grown and i think at the end of the day if you're a grower and you're breeding something and you're making a new strain and you think oh gee means something i think o.g means whatever the person who created the strain thinks it means really so so i think me and josh g would share similar viewpoints on that but obviously the og kush we're talking about in this story was obviously called original kush so the name josh d is thrown around a lot as the creator of og kush and the thing is if you actually look at josh and matt talking about 1996 a word that will come up a lot is the crew so it obviously wasn't just matt and josh who were you know a big part of making og kush happen especially as they will refer to the six godfathers of og kush quite a lot now i tried to find out who these six godfathers of og kush were and i genuinely couldn't find anything obviously i know that matt and josh are two of the godfathers of og kush what knows who the other four people are now while i was researching this i also found that maybe be real and kenji from cyprus hill could also be two of the godfathers of og kush now i'm not really sure on that but the main reason why i'm thinking that is because they played a huge role in creating bubba kush so the story goes that the kush was really hard to grow and sometimes with hermaphrodite if it just had a bit too much stress and be real had the kush and the bubba in the same room together so now the bubba is pollinated from the kush and b real takes the seeds from the bubba and then gives that back to josh d and matt which has now created bubba kush so even if be real and kenji aren't part of that six godfathers of og kush at least you do know they did play a big role in creating bubba kush itself which i'm sure is a strain that you guys have heard of now here's the main thing that i came across when i was researching this as well a lot of people credit josh d as being the creator of og but if you actually look at josh talking about this story and you know going through his experience he himself will tell you that he didn't create og kush it just happened he just happened to come across this cut and he managed to do the best with it at the time i mean to be honest if anything matt should probably be the one who has the credit of being the creator because he's the one who in general came across them seeds and kept it for so long and got the phenos of it and named it the kush but even still matt didn't really create anything again he just got lucky and managed to keep what he had at the time so it does make you wonder what it really means to create a straight so i got some side notes here that i wanted to put in the video because i'm sure people are going to ask about these in the comments and i found out the answers to them as i was recording dna genetics weirdly enough try and claim that they were the ones who popularized the phrase original gangster when it comes to og kush now i don't think this is true i think dna genetics just trying to pull something out of their ass because obviously og kush originates in la and in la there's a lot of gangsters who will say og means original gangster and if these people are smoking on og kush then they're gonna call it original gangster i don't think there's any way that dna genetics really hold weight to that claim unless they're the first people who ever sold the strain and then put in the description that it's original gangster i they they definitely weren't the people who coined that phrase like definitely definitely not also hindu kush has nothing to do with og kush now if you do some research you might come up with some things trying to say that oji kush is actually a cross of like hindu kush and kem dog or some [ __ ] that's absolute bollocks what i just told you here is the story from josh d himself and obviously matt is the person who named the cush right and he didn't get the kush from hindu ko she said it multiple times that it was just a total coincidence hindu kush was a thing and then he called his thing the kush he'd even called a previous thing kush berries before and you've also got to keep in mind that back in 1996 like you know the internet wasn't a thing you couldn't just find out that there was a strain like out in india called hindu kush in the mountains like you wouldn't be able to know that so there's absolutely no connection between hindu kush and og kush and also when you look at it this way it's crazy because not only did they really make og kush a thing they also made kush in general a thing in america like before they came around kush wasn't even a type of strain that people knew of so not only did they make og kush they they made kush well to a point obviously hindu kush still a thing and obviously that that makes some big complications but it's crazy to see it from that angle another thing to clear up is that josh d is not from the netherlands i know a lot of people from the netherlands a lot of dutch people or a lot of people from england have this weird rumor or like suspicion or myth that josh d actually got his original cuts of og kush from the netherlands and then brought them over to america and i think this is just chinese whispers from you know people mixing up matt's story of him being in florida and then you know taking the cuts on the plane to la josh d didn't get any og kush cuts from the netherlands and then bring them over which also means if any coffee shop or any dutch people try and tell you that to sell you their og kush because apparently their og kush is the original og kush from before josh d had it it's not true and an extra side note that i found while i was looking for this josh d i think in like sort of 2017 2018 he was trying to push out the club 33 og which was apparently the original og kush so that's what he was marketing as the original now it's 2021 i haven't seen too much information about it past 2018 i'm assuming obviously it still exists as a strain and if you go on joshji's instagram everything's kind of paused or you go on this website it says that everything's going to start again in 2021 so maybe he's bringing out a new og cushion 2021 who knows i'm not really sure so guys i absolutely loved making this video researching for this was absolutely amazing and fascinating and i would love to know what strains you want me to do a strain history on next so definitely leave me a comment down below what you think about this story tell me if there's any rumors that you've heard about og kush which i may have debunked today um if you've got any questions about the story as well let me know this was kind of paraphrasing i got it from some of josh's stories some of matt's stories some articles from here and there so try to just piece everything together and guys make sure to hit the like button it really really does help the video get pushed out and if

all right here we go here we go here we go another west coast speed tour pre-roll review you guys i'm here at the plant check this out woodland hills cannabis drive-through and a dispensary super cool we just picked up the stone road the stone road pre-roll grown organically with love this is a .7 gram pre-roll let's see what strain do we have what strain do we have oh we got blue dream uh 146.01 milligrams of thc 0.8 milligrams of cbd manufactured in oil plant santa rosa california so this is out of santa rosa cool beautiful packaging simple plastic cute little craft uh we've got this it says blue dream here sativa hybrid creative euphoric it's got a batch number super dope let's dive right in shall we one hit talk about it two hits score out of ten you guys ready curse on the camera my man justin here rocking like gary payton jersey you know i'm saying shout out to seattle okay packaging good i smell cannabis dropped it i smell cannabis in this oh we've got a cork top this one i don't know if i don't think it fell on anything sharp but this one had this cork top and i pulled it off and it was already broken i don't see any little pieces down here but it did come like this got the stone road pre-roll looks looks pretty nice i mean it's only a 0.7 so it's not going to be super packed and filled you know i'm going to massage it out i don't feel any stems poking out on either side the smell it's got flower smell taste i'm tasting this citrus light lemoniness all right one hit here we go [Music] first hit not so great mainly getting the paper getting a darker burn here right off the bat i'm going to set it on fire a little bit more see if it doesn't help get to some more terps and turn a little white here yeah the color is changing slightly let's go ahead and dive right into the second hit second hit much more smooth i'm getting a much more notable flavor i personally am getting a little bit of citrus uh a tiny bit of this i don't want to say haze but it's almost like haze like like not dutch treaty but light not so much this super sour pine just kind of lighter than that um the burn here it didn't get significantly lighter i'll show it to you guys again up close so you guys can kind of see what we're looking at there for 0.7 it's pretty smooth i'm going to do a third hit here just to give them a fair chance of getting a good score out of 10. feeling nice got the homies here unfortunately it's still just burning harsh i mean i don't have the desire to smoke through this whole joint because of how harsh this is blue dream is generally always a super light creamy uh sometimes it's super citrusy sometimes it's got a little bit of that pine but i'm just not getting that i'm not sure i got to give him a low seven here i'm thinking seven flat maybe a 6.75 i'm sorry stone road i've always had good joints from you guys but this blue dream here particularly not a great one 6.75 maybe up to a seven at the highest definitely recommend coming to the plant and checking it out they were sold out of a lot of their other higher end pre-rolls this is kind of what was left so i'll be back here to check out other strains that they've got we've got another blunt here that we're going to do in another video make sure you guys check that out otherwise check it out y'all stone road we've got a harsh smoke dark ash doesn't taste that great six point seven five to a seven kind of being generous i'll let you guys know if i you know what i really think in the description there will be a uh there'll be a full article all coming soon on respectmyregion.com uh for the official hundred point rating system but for now i'm definitely gonna fall on that 6.75 it's just not getting better as i smoke it appreciate you guys for the love talk some [ __ ] below follow unfollow dudes you gotta do stone road is definitely worth checking out just maybe not this batch of a blue dream pre-rolls i'll see you guys down the road

time I post a new video today I'm going to be oh my gosh damn already um today I'm going to be finally finally finally trying out and reviewing a marathon Oh G from the Cure company the boxing and I've been wanting to try this for a while ready last time that I don't know if they had a marathon oh she does somebody went or what happened but I didn't end up having it you know whatever but it's okay the time has came and she's here and I'm going to be smoking it in three different papers and I'm going to basically be seeing which one I [ __ ] with more which one burn slower which one it tastes better in and yeah so I have three different papers like I said the first one is a classic rock owned and a king size next one is vibes we're gonna catch a vibe these are king-sized as well combs and lastly we have Amsterdam organics I have never heard of the of this company before until I was hooked up with these I went to go originally purchased these and the person who who was who works there yeah other than face who sells everything I know that the worker you he was like Oh have you ever tried things and I was like no he was like oh like they're really cool they burn really slow and let me try let me get one of those too and he actually ended up hooking it up and he said that he actually [ __ ] with them more than raw so and I already did too happy when I really burn slow like hello yeah I was smoking me dream for it for like 22 damn 30 minutes I said let me go ahead and show you guys what we really need to want to see Mariano Jean the packaging is always soda from the Cure company there's an eighth in here as this seal protection jenia you see that but you even get the best view until you have it in person excited alright see you guys in a bit what's good so we are back now with the three [ __ ] joints and inside of them is marathon owned gee I thought 1/8 was gonna be enough but it actually took a little bit over the eighth and I do have I did have them too marathon og8 so that worked out perfectly fine and they're all about the same sciences as you guys can see and for today's video I have a crackhead lighter I love this color this is like my favorite color and we also have this big-ass ashtray you light this up right now I'm gonna tell you how the [ __ ] I feel how they taste and whatnot before we light them up let me let me try it it is really really good like really lemony I would say I hope you guys are sparking it up with me and having a great time hope you got univibe with me let's break the [ __ ] up so one before I do start this video I just wanna my new guys that they this is my honest opinion on each of these papers I'm not sponsored by nobody so therefore I'm not committed to say when it's better than the other meek and me not really thinking that you know what I mean and yeah Cheers it tastes really good wearing my wife's truck right now and all the windows are up so this is a [ __ ] hotbox like look how smokey a looks in here already who would then just like the first one to hit they're very very smoothly I thought my supposed to know which one is some other huh it's to be hit out of the I'm straight I'm first but itself holy [ __ ] stop smoking oh I'm trying to feel high already can you guys find me you guys even see me holy [ __ ] I think I have to open like a door and because for some things it's way too hot box and yeah my lipstick is like half gone so don't even mind that it's all on the [ __ ] tip yeah that's good that I'm just working by myself his fire definitely already certain so I don't feel like I have four or five and I was not high before his video big cloud so far they look like they are all burning dead as evenly yeah yes oh my gosh I imagine I would have been held through the burning side yikes better than horrible y'all gonna poop stain right there because my lipsticks Brown I'm not feeling anything like one harsher than the other I think they're all hitting smoothly to be honest and I think that's just because of the weed as well the word definite is fire and I just can't even describe it other than then you smooth that bomb holy [ __ ] y'all little custom okay that is all right so I'll go ahead and get back to you guys when I'm like I have smoked more but definitely before I finish this so I can let you guys know the update keep blazing in with me though all right so I am done but these are these can see um I did notice that the raw filter was the smallest filter out of all three and the abstract had the longest filter but the Amsterdam did end up burning the slowest it was last one that I had like sweet they all came like I wrote like very very close but after damn who's surprising me the last one this was not even really even part the supposed to be part of the reveal and burning floor I am gonna be having some new videos coming up reviewing crew weed and the seven ten laps weed I was looking for so if you [ __ ] with me reviews go ahead and drop a like and comment down below some cloud emojis if you want to see more reviews coming up everyone coming up coming your way and yeah every stain heights in the [ __ ] sky and let me know what is your most favorite paper I recommend I would recommend those top three I did try the blue five papers the blue packaging and I didn't flip with those that much like my first impression was like about them because those were running quicker than what I thought they would have but the black packaging which that I showed you guys is the one that I tried it out today and those yeah raaah vibes and Amsterdam organics I would say did a great job did we drab that's another focus Cayenne until next video bye I didn't mention but my highest probably like that uh six now seven he was kind of dropping whose I'm not smoking but it was a pretty good high and like I said it was over an eighth I'm about to eat I'm ready we're about a film my wife and I are about it from another video a mukbang on my phone whatever you gonna call it so stay tuned for that and he had till next time", "iapvOJEFSp4": "[Music] hey guys what's going on welcome back to another stream review today we are going to be reviewing skittles og [Music] the skelosogi is an amazing combination of two great strains we talked about skittles and og kush now both of these are really good strains because skittles alone won the 2015 high time magazine canvas club and og kush asap actually has 25 percent ac put those two together and you get an awesome freaking strain skittles og now mosquito sod only has 23 percent you see but that's still high you know i mean that's pretty good this stream is good to trade chronic pain headaches and all right informations loss of appetite and nausea so if you know you're not sure you can smoke some of this now right off the bat it has this dirty smell to it the knocks are quite dense actually yeah they're quite times long oh man make them open and no longer has that that earthy smell it has a lot more of a citrusy smell like like fruity smell and it has a decent color to it let me show you oh this smell completely changes the smell completely changes healthy is earthy that yeah earthy smell fruity candy smell oh man oh man okay okay i wonder if that's only that bud nope nope it's not only the butt oh i'm getting excited now i smoked this spring out of a joint before but never i haven't smoked it out of a bowl before oh i like that now okay okay oh well i broke all of the nuts i wish i would show you but i mean you guys saw the intro right now he saw some good close-ups of it that's what it looks like so it's not talking let's drink some of this up yeah it's this one's like they all got that inside smell of like citrusy like you can smell those terpenes that's really good but this one's i don't know pronounced i'm hoping this actually i could actually taste terpenes you know what let's put it all in there what's the point i just have it there right let's just put it all together [Music] oh the smell starts coming out that citrus is not overtakes the earthy smell yeah i like that that's why i split it like that what is that what what is this [Music] a seed oh come on a seed and not even a good seed not even i see that i could be like oh i'm gonna plant this thank you jackpot you know i got skittles now i got skittles you know this seat is gonna go nowhere this is a dry city this damn i don't know about y'all but every time i find a city on something supposed to be like primo like you know like it's supposed to be good see the same media and you know premium stuff it's not supposed to have seeds in it it is kind of a disappointment at that point as i lose some points just for that alone now really expecting have high expectations of the highest and they gave me of a ball because like i want to see that you know it's not a fun scene so all right let's see and as always we got a clean bow i always clean my balls on solution before i start a review so we can truly taste the cannabis and the terpenes if we had any well let's go [Music] yes it has a sweet taste it doesn't taste like a small you cannot disturb beans but you can taste like sweet it has a sweet taste to it it's not bad personally i would rather taste the terpenes that fruity is like you know endless like it is like the smell but it still has a good taste it is smoother going into i like that has a sweet taste as you start burning it that's hit number two the sweetness is going away a little and i'm starting to taste the earthy flavor like the outside smell like how small outside earthy i'm trying to taste that now [Music] okay [Music] after hit i know flavor is gone by the third head it was a little more hard i got to hold my car [Music] but i am feeling it though three hits in i'm feeling it it's gonna be like two or three minutes and i'm already feeling it well that's good i'm not high yet you know it's like like it always starts with me i'm not high but i'm not sober you know i'm i'm not positioning right now and he only took three hits in a couple of minutes so that's not bad the only thing i don't like is the flavor is already gone and on the third head got a little harder yeah our flavor is completely gone now all i can taste now it's just burnt cannabis the forehead will also i feel like it's a little hard she makes me want cough it's not bad though i had worse [Music] that's my fifth hit in that one was a bit harsher it actually made me cough a lot and um but i'm high i'm really high right now i am actually like i'm feeling like real calm relax i like i like i'm starting to notice wow that was quick oh mouth clicking real quick with this one oh no that's no food no boot my friend okay nothing to drink with me i didn't expect her mouth that quick okay okay the height is good it is fast they host the flavor for about i don't know two hits the third one starting to change flavor to more like earthy flavor and then after that it's like from canada it hit fast though you can tell i'm happy now okay okay okay okay i like it i like it i'm really happy right now oh man okay so to choose resume i guess you know we finished the video and i can't fix that both hey thinking about it i didn't even finish a ball yet i'm already high yo okay the bow is finished i'm blasted you know so let's let me show you what i want to gather from this i mean at first i was terribly disappointed because of [ __ ] seed i found a seed on my weed i don't like that you know if i want to get a low grade stuff i'm expecting to have a toothpick and start poking seeds out i remember those days i'm that old yeah we're back in the irregular close to normal and anything else like hydroponics or cush or anything like that was like rare and if you knew somebody they had that i was deployed and like when twenty dollars will buy you a gram not even a gram because people will be like giving you 0.7 you know for 20 dollars that's how rare it was i had a point to that story [Music] yes yes yes yes so um so i'm expecting that from low grade to fine seeds but when i buy some sort of prime stuff you know like some premium stuff so things that you know so this looks supposed to be really good and seedless the finest city name it's like a big no-no but uh hey i gotta say though that well the way i'm feeling right now it makes me not even care about that seed that was the point of my story like the way i feel right now it's like a scene to [ __ ] character slip it to the side pack a bow joint or something you know good stuff man so he has this put it all together so i can finish this video has a pretty smell on the outside when you break it you can smell terpenes sweetness to it really good smell when you break it all of those dripping smells they all take over the earthy smell and you can smell it from actually over here when you pack a bowl the first it tastes sweet it doesn't taste like terpenes like you know like like sweet candy terpenes or like serpents like like mango or pineapple i love to start you know when when there's stuff like that what was he saying yeah you don't you don't you don't taste that but you taste the sweet it is the real sweet so it's really it's really good three hits in i was already feeling it okay um two hits in the flavor changes from like too sweet more like earthy and then after that just turns like taste like burnt cannabis i didn't even finish a bowl and i got high and i'm really really hiring it started like biting me like calm i gotta think you know like this calm sensation this calm feeling started taking over and then i started to feel like relaxed and in this feeling of like hey like a really good mood like i'm happy as [ __ ] right now like i don't care about that seed and that's how i'm feeling right now one bad thing two bad things okay yes see this one two the the mouse kicked in really quick like really quick quicker than any of the restraints that i have reviewed in this channel before that i didn't like so all too bad things but i think the way i'm feeling right now makes up for it so if i had to give it leaves i'll say i'll give it a seven now let's give it eight let's give it eight because you know no seven because he had a [ __ ] [ __ ] but then again i feel so happy though i don't really care so let's give it that what do you guys think do we take please away because we found a seed although you know the high makes up for it so the feeling makes up for it it's good for all kinds of things like chronic pain

of a background of this strain so grab your popcorn grab your session your bomb i know you already have but let's get into some close-ups so the venom og strain is an indica dominant hybrid and it's a cross between the two strains rare dankness number one and poison og this strain is testing anywhere between 11 and a huge 27 thc this strain is definitely one for the night that's for sure this extreme is good for anxiety and depression and also the effects from this strain you will experience uh euphoria relaxation and incredibly hungry i can say that since i've been smoking this strain i have had the most crazy appetite and i can say it's a obviously a good thing as you can see as we break open these nugs here there's a lot of hints of purple throughout the bud and all in all just an absolutely awesome medicine i'm glad i could share this with you all so i think after some close-ups i'm breaking open some nugs let's take a couple more rips and wrap up this video so there you have

"Xw0VzBAfzzk": "Bammer TV welcome back to Bammer TV weed reviews where we review the best strains around today is a pure hybrid known as deadhead OG before we get that started though guys thank you very much we actually just hit 200 subscribers so thank you for that continued support we also have an Instagram where we post behind the scene photos and if you want to check out all of our past reviews we actually do have a playlist for you which is found in the description well let's get a start let's get talking about Deadhead og deadhead OG is a crossbreed between Ken dog 91 and sfv OG Kush and it's known for its very potent THC levels the chem dog 91 brings a piney and earthy aroma to it and the sfv OG Kush brings in those diesel and gas a flavors ideally making this a very flavorful now the strain that we actually got one of the you know cons with it is that it's so dry compared to something like the cheese a little bit more denser this still has the potent smell but in terms of flavor it was kind of lacking it grinds up pretty well though it looks kind of like it's gonna be dry and dusty but it does grind up and it's very nice medicinally this really helps you relax and it's a great mood enhancer as far as stress and depression this is the wheat to go to if you suffer from those especially if you have headaches or pain management that you need to control now we always go over our preferred method of smoking this and actually we had a pretty difficult time deciding what to put this in we finally decided this is a good bowl weed it is dry does burn fast but it does smoke I think the best in a bowl actually we used a dry herb pen as well which really brought the flavors out with this so if you do have a dry herb pen definitely helps out these natural flavors Dave any final thoughts before we go into the grading of this the strain that we got ourselves was very dry but it did break up very nicely and it does have that aroma that we're looking for but not necessarily the flavor all right so with that said I guess it's time to give the old Bama rating to this most like the cheese weed that we that we recently reviewed but how does that compare and what do you give this is it is it great so in comparison to the cheese this is a little bit drier but also it has a very similar aroma I do like the cheese we tow a bit better than this one so overall this weed is gonna be getting a 3.5 on the Bammer scale all right there you go guys so if you are looking for that kind of skunky potent weed this is pretty good one but just not for us so guys let me know how what we are doing here on the channel and if you want to check out some of our past reviews there are playlists that you can go watch in the description but for everything else Reed and weed related keep it here on banner TV [Music]", "nF2P0rLPfEM": "what's up i am going to review the og kush for you right now by arita hemp a little bit of a back story last week if you didn't see my previous video on the blue dream go check it out that'll have a full unboxing if you're interested in that and kind of you know going off on more rants than i'm gonna go into in this video but i feel like i described it pretty accurately in that one and i'm excited to try this one out so in the last video i mixed them up i had no idea which one was which and after that last one i'm pretty damn sure that that was the blue dream from the last video and this one's the og kush i put a little o on my pen so i know which one's which now because i am damn sure that this one is the og kush i vaped a little bit of this just a bit ago so i feel like the effects have kicked in and when i did it last week in the video i said i was going to do the same thing walk to the store and basically you know see how i felt because that's what i did in the day before and it was a noticeable difference and you know maybe it was just in my head maybe but i feel like i tried to control the scenario the same way to see if there was a difference but i was much calmer and not that i wasn't calm on the blue dream but i was more mellowed out the blue dream was i'd say more kind of mentally energizing in a sense where i was you know super like very just you know kind of good mood but my mind which is kind of racing but in a very very positive controlled kind of way and i was you know almost kind of like borderline like kind of giddy at least that's kind of how i felt obviously it's not how i was acting or anything but i was just in a good state so with the og kush i don't know how long i actually rambled on with that since i've already had some of this but it wasn't even on dude what so as i said it already kicked in but noticeable difference in the sense that i was calm as before but didn't have as much as that you know kind of giddy state but my mind was still going in the more positive but it was much more of a type of relaxing thing and that's how it felt the rest of the evening so this may be a new video because my battery died so this is an entirely other day but this og kush that i have here i wanted to give a different explanation of it is it um a way it kind of popped into my head to word it in a decent way because i know it's pretty hard to be able to vocalize and put into words some of the experiences and things like that but as far as the effects go compared to the blue dream because that's the only thing i have to compare it to but with the blue dream being the sativa uh even yesterday having those i'd say like the way the the path that my thoughts take me is more of on the blue dream is more of the you know kind of if i'm in a good state you know gets me excitable about the future and just kind of like amped up and getting all these different ideas and things like that so if anyone else can kind of resonate with that that you know kind of good uppity feeling almost like i had caffeine but i didn't just that good euphoria and also i did have that tincture tonight as well just a little bit it was about a quarter of a mil so not sure if that's adding into it either but anyway the og coach in comparison to that compared to the blue dream with the og being the end uh satipe indica and yeah so it's almost like when i'm in that good present calm state compared to the blue dream the og instead of being that kind of the excitable amped up feeling in a sense but still being calm obviously the og kush is almost like the parallel of that but in the sense of the contrast is how the hell do i even word this but in contrast to the blue dream the og kush and parallel kind of thought patterns is that you know kind of amped up feeling an energetic thing i was getting before is more kind of now like calm down in a sense where i'm just more you know kind of calm relaxed going with the flow thinking about it but not getting super amped up just thinking of it from another state so and then overall i'm just much more calm and then my mind isn't you know even even though i could be doing the same thing right before i'm about to eat dinner but my mind and the the i'd say the quality of my thoughts and then just the the uh effects that i'm getting from it the blue dream is more of that kind of you know mentally just kind of amped up being you know hopeful and getting all these ideas and things on how to progress in my life and then the og kush is more of the not toning it down but putting it in a different sense where it's that more kind of calm serene feeling of not so much letting go but just an overall more of a calm demeanor where you're still somewhat amped up a little bit more contemplative but just calmer overall and it's almost like between the blue dream and the og kush it's almost like your mind when you're experiencing that those effects it's almost like your mind can go in the direction of having that you know kind of amped up mentality or going the direction of having that calm down mentality even though it's going to be the same types of you know thought patterns and just same kind of vibe overall and it just helps you take that shift in the direction of that calmer state the way in which i'm going to perceive everything is in more of a mentally calmer relaxed state so yeah i thought this was going to be insightful in the sense of the way i was going to express it i was going to be happy with but now i'm just like that was probably just pretty lame but i don't know hopefully that resonated with some people and will explain the the way that i'm explaining it hopefully you can resonate with it and then be able to decide if it's something you want to try out whether it be the first time you're going to try this stuff at all this delta eight or you're already you already have tried it and you're just interested in the different effects from those particular strains so yeah bye", "JE85rIJaPos": "9200 ji is a select phenotype of OG Kush this indica has a piney sweet and spicy taste with

subscribe today i do got a weed review it's coming to you by a company that i have not tried before they're called the west coast trading company the strain i have also not tried or heard of it's called the rolex og i did get this at blue fire dispensary in merced california it is going to run you 36 for the age and this is coming to you at 26 on the thc 0 on the cbd they are some small nugs they are pretty dense but they're small they smell okay it's nothing uh too crazy and like always if you want to see an up-close picture of the bud check it out as you can see there they're a bunch of small buds uh i'm not like super impressed with the look or the smell but let's see how it smokes and this is an indica dominant as well but before we get into the smoke let's do a full send let's get a shotgun in hope you guys are having a great day it's getting close to the holidays let's keep this [ __ ] happy huh whoo what's your guys's favorite beer have you guys ever tried the rolex og because i haven't and how they got the rolex og is they crossed a what is it white fire with a strain called kushi k-u-c-h-i i'm not sure how that's pronounced and i've never heard of it so the white fire crossed with kushi or some [ __ ] like that is how you get the rolex og cheers everybody gotta get that burp out but i was curious on what that strained kushi or whatever however you pronounce that on what it was so i looked it up and what kushi is or however that whatever it's called is is it's exodus cheese crossed with san fernando valley og kush so exodus cheese crossed with san fernando valley og kush is how you get that kushi or whatever it's called and white fire i looked it up as well that's just wi-fi and i've heard of wi-fi cookies and stuff like that so that's what wi-fi is it's white fire okay cheers let's get ahead of this rolex okay right first initial thought this is 100 honest reviews i can't lie to you guys west coast trading company rolex og off the first hit i don't like the flavor the taste right off the get i don't know if it's a little grassy or what it is it is maybe a little grassy i i really don't like the flavor it didn't for being an indica dominant it didn't give me that lung expansion that i'm used to you know it did get me high a little bit you know i did feel it but the flavor wasn't that great off the first hit the smoothness wasn't that good it was a little harsh and the high was pretty moderate or pretty weak i'm not gonna lie to you guys but like always two for the review ah i i don't have my hopes for this uh this strain you know hopefully if i try the company again hopefully it's not the same maybe it's a little better west coast trading company it says best in the west but uh so far off that first hit i'm gonna have to beg to differ you guys [ __ ] with cheese in the can i know it's a poor man's broke stupid food or it's actually not a poor man's food because shit's expensive but uh i [ __ ] with cheese in a can that's just solid grew up eating that processed cheese as [ __ ] if you're a stoner you know what's up with that ship oh i did just get the brand new call of duty uh cold war just downloaded everything yesterday the zombies is [ __ ] cool as [ __ ] i still i've only played it for like an hour yesterday just trying to check out the map and [ __ ] but i'll get more into it and tell you guys how i like the game more as i play it maybe i'll do a couple of maybe a live stream or something and do some zombie live streams if you guys are into that okay let's get the second hit in two for the review get the stealth smoke out that shuttle [ __ ] up your hit man you got some stealth smoke in the in the bong next hit you take it to make it harsh okay rolex og by west coast trading company 26 percent on the thc um i already know that i'm not going to give this one a crazy high score so let's just pull out another beer and do a hoot and shoot maybe it'll give me a little more [ __ ] up so we'll take the bong load you know hooting shoot so let me get this ready get this all [ __ ] ready i did buy another uh pack of these holiday budweiser cans but they are the same exact ones because it says collect all four but i can't find the other cans it just gives me the same ones every [ __ ] time so i don't know maybe the other ones are in a different state maybe they're not in cali another county okay cheers let's get this second one in see if it gets any better off the second hit [Music] ah i want to be able to tell you guys about the flavor though if i would have took the beer it would have [ __ ] up the flavor and everything so let me wait a second flavor same [ __ ] cheers i really don't like the flavor of that weed it is very harsh um for my liking for dispensary weed that i that i'm used to getting i do not like the the flavor and i don't like the it's too harsh yeah i don't like it let's calculate this [ __ ] up price where i get this at blue fire dispensary in merced california thirty six dollars an eight uh for this it's too expensive it should be down on the [ __ ] 19 or in dollars and eighth or something [ __ ] the look and the smell i already told you at the beginning it wasn't that impressive the flavor no good the smoothness no good the high no good i i really wasn't impressed with this strain and it sucks because it's the first time i tried this company so that's called a horrible first experience so overall for the rolex og by west coast trading company i'm gonna have to give it the five i don't like it you know it does get you high it's weed but it reminds me of like some [ __ ] that i can grow in my backyard this is is are you sure this is indoor i don't know it says whole cannabis flower i don't even know if this is indoor says exotics but i don't know don't taste like it so i'm giving it the five that [ __ ] is jive don't recommend it that was my review until next time smoking with small town out", "eADEEsMjf4U": "hey y'all trevor here with red leaf and today i've got the last strain from good buds that i haven't tried yet at least the last one on the market that i have yet to try we've got their sapphire og three and a half gram right here i'm uh interested to dive into this cheesy bass drain i will see you guys on the other side for uh the information before we get into that urban scale for time being cheers y'all and i'll see you over there [Music] welcome back you guys so as i said in that little intro we're gonna be diving into some sapphire og from good buds this is the last strain that is on the market currently from them that i have not tried so i'm really interested to see how it's going to do and how it's going to compare to the other two being that salty god and mango taffy mango tapi mango taffy that we've tried before and have actually gone through the full urban scale with you guys but let's get the information off of this container before we dive into the sapphire og info that good buds has actually given us themselves and then we get into the good and fun urban scale you guys the part that i think we all enjoy so thc total on the sapphire og came in at 18 18.0 percent you have a cbd total of zero percent and a package date of july 23rd 2020. it came in with a price of 50 before tax so we're going to go ahead and see how these glass containers hold up with that package data being back in july i'm really curious to see how they're going to hold because this is going to be the longest or while the oldest bud that i've dove into from good buds just the longest time between seal date me crack it into the container now let's get off the information that they have on the website so we can actually get into actually get into the review you guys so our sapphire og is the is for the true canisaur this heavy hitting indica is caked with sticky resin and trichomes it has a pungent cheesy aroma with hints of earth and lemon it's small batch indoor grown organic hand-dried hand trimmed in salt spring island bc the top four terpenes that are going to be involved here are going to be carefully limonene meristening and humiliating the thc range is going to be that 20 to 25 we're just on that lower side which can happen from times and less than one percent cbd range so that is all the information that we have for the good buds sapphire og guys now it's time that we uh crack into this container and dive into our look at aroma and then eventually get our audio listeners caught on up and let them know what's going down but for the time being you guys let's get that urban scale intro in here so you guys can uh can get actually into the full review of this bud but for the time being cheers you guys [Music] okay guys so we've got that urban scale intro we've got this container cracked let's see how the glass seal does with these buds packaged back in july oh still very fresh snugs in here that glass jar did these nugs a huge benefit you guys as one falls out of the jar hits my thigh and tumbles on away we're gonna have to find that one after the review i'm thinking yep yeah we'll have to find that one on on after but for now let's check out the rest of this eight so it does have that really stinky of course the best bud the best bud in the eighth is one that falls out of my fat fingers but they're all really still very fresh you give them a squeeze they bounce right back decent amount of uh of trichome coverage throat not much stick but there's still a really fresh feeling and experience to this all in all you guys the look and aroma of this bud with this really dark and dense purple and red pistol shooting in their purple cup hues and that kind of deep green it has me really excited to smoke this and um i'm really looking forward to uh seeing how potent this light cheesy earthy combo of an aroma i'm getting continues to present itself once uh the buds busted up and rolled up you guys but for now i'm gonna go and find that big big nug and catch our audio listeners up while i roll our joint and uh we get a little bit deeper into the service scale but for now the look and aroma what what am i gonna give it i think i think i'm going to give it an 8 out of 10. i'm excited but i'm not bouncing out of my seat with excitement it's a very intrigued kind of an interest you guys but we'll see on the other side when we're diving into the vaporizer before we get into our bongs the pipe the joint and then we talk about the high and the overall but cheers you guys i'll see you over there when we're getting into the vape welcome back welcome back you guys so we've got our joint rolled up we've got our audio listeners caught up let's go ahead and pack up the vaporizer and get on ahead of them again so we start out with our boundless cfc vaporizer at 175 degrees celsius the reason we start out at 175 degrees is that gives us the lemonine and the marisonine terpenes primary um but it's their primary boiling point so it gives us kind of the initial flavor that we can expect from them and it's really where we'll taste the most of them that lemon and mango flavor that acidic fruit flavor after that we go into the 205 degrees and at 205 degrees we end up reaching where the majority of the other terpenes are going to start boiling off and you're starting to get a lot more of the rich blended chocolate cheese that's where hopefully this strain really takes off earthy cushy tones like the very rich and vibrant tones that's where you start to experience and was at the 175. after that oh ho the vaporizer's dead you guys no why why must the vaporizer be dead when we're trying to get this review so let's plug her in let's let's let it charge up a little bit while i'm continuing to talk so like i said 175 the meristening and lemonade terpenes that lemon and mango base flavor after that you bump up to the 205 which is going to be the rest of the terpenes really playing a factor that earthy cheesy woody the rich flavors and then from there you move on to the 220 degrees and at 220 degrees you get the primarily you get the beta carefully and thc boiling off so you start to get the strongest woody or pepper based experiences and then you also get the heaviest high experiencing that you're going to have so the vaporizer is just about ready at that 175 degrees we're gonna take a couple dry hauls while it charges and see how it does you guys before i bump up to the 205 and then the 220. cheers when you forget to start [ __ ] you gotta modify interesting very humid and damp experience for the first one almost even a touch of a pine but there is kind of a really rich and coating flavor near the end of that that i'm enjoying quite a bit let's bump it up to 205 and really let the rest of these terpenes develop and present themselves because i have a feeling that they they're gonna do a lot more um make well let's just make this reference they're gonna make a lot more noise at the 205 than they will at the 175 just because there's more boiling off at that point let's dive in and find out you guys cheers there it is there's that cheesy there is exactly what they're talking about very rich does have that almost earthy woody touch to it but by no means is that the overwhelming flavor the prominent flavor it is very rich creamy cheesy because there's a sourness to it that that blends very well with the other flavors this 205 and it starts to go on to more that woody side before it transitions into that cheesy creamy earthy flavor which is surprising and is not something i was really expecting you guys but right now the battery is just a little bit a little bit too dead we almost had it at the 220 degrees we're just gonna give it a little bit of a warm up or not warm up charge up and then we'll get it up to that 220 degrees and take ourselves the halls because the fact that we got almost all the way through before it died when it was plugged in gives us a shot you guys let's see if we can get up to 220 degrees without it dying on us again all right 190 195 200 205 to 10 15 20. there you go just hold off for a couple minutes and holding temperatures a lot easier wow holding temperatures a lot easier than actually bringing it up to temperature wow you guys that maintains its cheesy flavor right into the vaporizer which was not something i was expecting it does have kind of a hint of a wood but it's not there you go it's dead we're done with the vaporizer not an overwhelming woody experience to say that and it it blends off into that cheese flavor that is just so rich and so powerful and i can already start to feel the effects tickling in which i don't expect but i always enjoy when the vaporizer is the first place that i start to feel the high you guys so for the taste from a vape this overall experience with all the difficulty i am going to give it an 8 out of 10. it's enjoyable it really is enjoyable and it is something that i would look forward to putting packing the vaporizer and smoking again that way or vaping again that way but now we're going to go ahead and smoke our way through the bonds and we do the bonds the same way we do the vaporizer three different types we do three different ways of igniting this bud though to get those three different temperatures our first way hemp wick lowest temperature usually gives us a very unique rich flavor but it's definitely more that melt out bong rip kind of a flavor second one is through a clipper lighter with our nice glass beaker bong that is going to be like your average smoke most people just do lighter to bowl that's what you snap third one jet lighter this really seems to pull out the fruity flavors and the really sweet flavors because that intense heat i don't know why just seems to like those type of flavors but for now you guys we are going to go ahead and start packing up these bowls so we can start smoking them we've got our first one packed up ready to go ah look just a hand packed up ready to go we've got our hemp wick lit up we're gonna get a nice big flame going on that one i'm gonna dive into this bulb cheese you guys and i'll see you on the other side of these [Music] so [Music] case for a bong i am stuck between a seven and eight here's my reasons why and let's see if talking about is gonna be what i need to just get this sorted so reason for an eight how smooth the experience was all three bong rips went without a cough boom boom boom all three that's a thought for the eight then i go well what was the flavor like through those three bomb ribs were you looking forward to and excited and really wanting to dive into the next trade or was it just um wow i can smoke i got another bowl it's packed let's just smoke it and i'll see you guys there's more that's second side which for me is a little bit disappointing for how smooth and how rich the flavor was it wasn't a flavor that excited me and i i think i think that alone is gonna be why i'll give it a seven it's a personal thing you guys one hundred percent very smooth and the fact that it was july package and that could be another thing too the fact that it was july package a little bit on the older side could affect the amount of flavor i'm coming i'm coming the amount of flavor i'm getting through the bongs it could play that factor but you never know you honestly never know you guys until you get a chance to really compare a lot of things side by side still really enjoyable i definitely will be uh snapping quite a few more bowls of it through the bongs because of how smooth it is and the light kind of piney slightly cheesy like cream cheesy with that pine is very much what i'm getting because there's a sweetness to it that comes from the pine that's making it very creamy and experience overall enjoyable that way but with that 7 out of 10 you guys we're going to dive into the craved straight pipe see how it does through here before we wrap it up with the joint and then we start talking about the high and the overall i'll see you guys on the other side cheers okay guys so the taste from a pipe is a definite 7 out of 10. it had all the smooth qualities of the bong without the flavor i'm getting a little bit of kind of a cheesy kind of that that sour taste you get after eating old cheddar really like more of a mature cheese like a really hearty cheese um more that kind of uh aftertaste and lingering flavor that isn't bad it's enjoyable and the smooth was there it just flavor wasn't anything to get me excited or looking forward to it and the more i'm smoking my way through this the more i'm thinking that i think it's just the age of the buds they hold really fresh but the terpenes and the flavor just starts to break down a little bit you guys because i really i really want to give good buds the benefit of the doubt because i've had nothing but great experience from them a really tasty bud and a glass container can keep the buds as fresh as they want but if the terpenes start to break down they start to break down right and being transported and shaking the [ __ ] out of right like it's these buds aren't treated as gently as they should be to preserve optimal quality they do a great job jarring and um processing them themselves but there's only so much you can do right you guys but let's go ahead and welcome back our audio listeners while uh we go ahead and take our first dry haul through the elements paper and see how the sapphire og does through here and then we'll spark the sucker up catch them while the video gets time lapsed and then we start talking about the high we rate the joint talk about the high and the overall but for the time being let's get these dry hauls in and get the sucker lit up cheers i'm getting like a pizza hut cheese pizza like that is 100 the first thought that came through my mind it's not the tomato sauce that i'm tasting but the spice on it like that not the spice on it but the spices in the uh the sauce that they use that and that cheese that hearty cheese and just kind of that that crispy crunch like the crust that combination is really what i'm getting with this with this strain and that's interesting you guys and i don't know why specifically pizza hut but pizza had a royal pizza those two just i think it's the cheese blend they use but let's go ahead spark this up and catch up our audio listeners video i'll see you guys about halfway through so taste from a joint you guys i am going to give it an 8 and it's going to be right along the same way of thinking as what the joint and the pipe were that this bud is just old honestly it's that's what my my thinking is there's potential for it i honestly think it would be a nine a consistent eight or a nine on the new scale you guys honestly it is on the new scale i'm loving this flav this flavor and this experience and it could be just because i'm excited for my cheese auto that we just chopped down today it could be because of that and i will be honest but good buds always puts out a quality product for me you guys in my opinion i really really do enjoy what i uh what i smoke from them now going into the high i will give it a 9 out of a 10 for the high it is a nice smooth body hitting indica and then as you get deeper into it it does start to hit that mental drift and that kind of take you off onto adventures mine just mine uh my numbing experience overall you guys incredibly incredibly enjoyable and absolutely a great strain to smoke and i uh i am looking forward to smoking the rest of this eighth but with that nine out of ten on the high the eight out of ten on a joint i need to quickly add up our total to see what our overall is i you know what it's a 47 out of 60 because i know we're just one shy of that beautiful herbage of eights across the board so 47 out of 60. just shy of that beautiful garbage it did really really well you guys good buds and honestly i am i am on the softer side with this because i think that i the potential on here you guys honestly is what i am uh why i'm giving these guys the benefit of the doubt because they are straight a lp that i've smoked before and anything fresh has been through the roof just breathtaking and this strain honestly i think has that same potential if it wasn't july package when we're smoking it in november but it and this eighth stands by the scores and it's the medium to smallmouth nugs and i'm smoking to you guys so it's not even the big ones that really are flavorful and powerful for the effect but let's go ahead and wrap this one up hope you guys enjoyed i really enjoyed it the time being when my end card slides in all you got to do is hover over that logo logo click that bell notification after you subscribe that you know anytime one of my videos go live down below we do videos for you one will be the most recommended and the other one be the most recently uploaded please go and check out either of those and anything else red leaf has the offer time being back later some more content hail and welcome to our audio edition of the sapphire og one hitter weed review on this monday we're going to be diving into the indica dominant strain from good buds so the sapphire og that i have came in with a thc total of 18 it has no cbd for this container and it has a package date of july 23rd 2020 and the price for the 3.5 grams is going to be 50 before you add your taxes now for the information that good buds provides us on the strain is our sapphire og is a for the true connoisseur this heavy hitting indica is caked with trichomes and sticky resin it has a pungent cheesy aroma with hints of earth and lemon small batch indoor grown organic handshammed hang dried in salt spring island b c so the top four terpenes that are going to be present in this strain is going to be the carefulline limonene mercene and humiliating thc range is going to be that 20 to 25 percent with a cbd range of less than one percent and it's going to be an indica dominant strain so all in all you guys i'm really excited and i'm very much looking forward to diving into the strain and seeing what it has to offer now when we cracked this container open had a little bit of an issue actually keeping the uh the buds in the container where i wanted them to but aside from that we ended up giving it an 8 out of 10. you do get a really nice heavy dank sticky kind of cheesy flavor coming off of the buds when you stick your nose in there it's nothing overwhelming or anything too strong that would make you start to think skunk and it has this really inviting earthy undertone to balance out and complement the uh that cheesy note quite well and it makes it quite exciting to want to dive into the strain and try it out but for the time being you guys i've got this joint rolled up and ready to go we now are going to dive into our boundless vaporizer get a score out of that before we take our three bond rips a little hootsuite through the pipe and then eventually wrapping it up with the joint where we welcome you guys back into the show and uh we dive right into it but for the time being until we get on into that joint i gotta say adios and i'll see over there well you'll hear me over there cheers you guys", "V46QL3Ca8bQ": "all right let's get into this true flower 29.3% THC see what it looks like lemon OG Kush pop that top on it nice seal I like that wow this is actually smells very different than the last batch the last batch I I was like oh man this stuff stinks cuz it smelled so bad alright let's see what do we got here what am i smelling it smells kind of sour I don't know if this is a good view this right here it's one of the buds I have to say I'm surprised this doesn't look as dank as I expected it it really doesn't you know I'll have to smoke it obviously it it really tell but it smells really good like me for my face in a whole bunch of this yeah it does smell a little green so you know maybe the cure is not so great on it but uh it smells it smells really sour and a little bit of green to it on some of the buds so my guess that the curing wasn't totally the best on these but we'll give it a we'll give it a vape anyway see how it is make sure I don't have anything in there when I vape it on my Tara boundless Tara that's I was trying to think of the company name wait let's see let's pick out a good bud this one looks good right here believe that you see I mean hey by the way yeah let me get you some close-ups it's not it's not bad I mean this is I'm just I've had like they're super Silver Haze man is ridiculous it is absolutely ridiculous let me see if I can get this in it's probably too much light I don't know if that helps at all yeah it's pretty but it smells good it's probably gonna be pretty potent everybody on the forums is saying on a Florida medical trees they're saying this is really good [ __ ] so and you know this is only one of the eight so I've chosen some more for you guys and show you what those look like but yeah I think I'm gonna break this bud up just a little bit of it my grinders on here too much ground up I'll see what it smells like woah wow that almost smells culinary I mean it smells like a savory spice now that was a really cool I don't even know how to explain it well this smells really good alright let's get it packed here nice bowl packed in it I have to do a review of this boundless Terra that's pretty good pretty good stuff so I just like to pack it down there pretty forearm and then this is that's not what comes with it this is actually from an and I forgot the name of it it's a whole little wooden one wooden vape they still sell it I'm sure but and then I just attached it to the rubber grommet it comes with the attachments Lootera see like this is one of the attachments it just doesn't have very good airflow and they do have a glass attachments that has a glass stem that's kind of like this but it's really short it's only like two here so it's really hot paper and this lets it cool down just a little bit let's put it on here just hold down a button and get it going and just let it heat up the 428 put the weed in the picture grab me a drink", "dVElnFyT_cU": "buddy back at it another update video looking at the tropicana cookies f2 only seed co set day 45 so what's that coming up on seven weeks starting to fade just a little bit we started the sugar feed two tablespoons of a mix of sugar and brown sugar per gallon two tablespoons per gallon and we give it that last two weeks roughly see what we got so she's doing her thing look at this top nuggie so yeah she'll be here another another week or two for a couple weeks what's this plum classical cookie i think this was on day 25 some day 25 or 26 something like that just shy of four weeks got the fuzz going a little happier this time around than last run so i upped the craft blend in the soil mix i was just doing one cup per container and they recommend one to two cups per cubic foot so these are about one at least one and a half to two cubic feet containers that i get in here so i went up to two two cups you know per mix so that probably helped i was keeping the feed kind of light so they'd fade out but uh feeding that sugar they really don't have uh too much an issue this trap here is a week behind that other one so somewhere in the five six week range instead of the six seven week range and this one here is a week behind that one there we go let me back up a little bit let's go look from this side so yeah you can see i moved that one over there under the other light i had this four pack under this light but i had the space here i took down the um what came down fruity pebbles og and the east coast tower diesel um both of them so it's got a little more room but i should have put them side by side so you can kind of see i wish i knew exactly this is probably coming up on four weeks something like that compared to that one over there it's probably a better comparison right here actually yeah she's a good hasher leafy son of a [ __ ] but she hashes it out this one too is a leafy one body uh purple kush sunshine daydream great smoke though love smoking joints of the stuff see if i can hold still enough i did a video with my gopro i thought it'd be better but it actually came out shittier i got that oh hitting plants over here i got that wand thing or whatever you call them the gimbal for it and i don't know kind of screws me up more than anything so we're back to the iphone um i planned on getting the new new iphone and i just haven't got around to getting that with that fruity pubs over there praying so we'll get the new iphone pretty soon so that'll be a little bit of an upgrade on the camera this one's a 10 10 something look at this tropicana here this one's probably about six weeks along nice little color yeah i like how this fruity pebbles grows nice little gap between the buds get that airflow put out golf balls you know a lot of people they like the donkey dicks growing throwing swords and [ __ ] but i kind of like it like this easier to easier to manage too when they're done this string here i'm knocking the [ __ ] out she's a beauty though so yeah i think the uh extra craft blend helped in this one too so if you remember this one always like to have the purple stems like it kind of had when it was younger but shooting straight greenies now probably too much jumping in and out in and out zoom back up zoom back up this guy needs to settle the [ __ ] down with his camera i watch a video back i'm like jesus stay still quit moving it i don't know how you guys watch this [ __ ] when i'm filming it though it seems like i'm holding it there for a while it's weird so i'll try to slow down i probably say that every time and never do it yeah i think this is coming up on seven weeks too something around the 45 day range i got a sour diesel s1 that'll be rolling in here soon yeah i [ __ ] hit that i got to move that planer i crashed it in we got a little crash here i can slam that into there so yeah and we'll go out and film the vipar spectra tent i got two where's my bikes in there with the one cotton candy crunch so we'll see how that goes but that's that for today keep on liking subscribing sharing all that good [ __ ] and if you like this video do something nice for someone today peace", "dJdc1uuOtw0": "hey y'all trevor here with ryder leaf and today we're going to be diving into one of my favorite alberta-based lp's newest strain on the market we've got a bow valley o g this is going to be the number 26 rendition of the strain for these guys i'm really really looking forward to giving this a shot this is going to be their og kush variant i hope you guys are excited as i am we got ridiculously high terps i'll see you on the other side of the intro [Music] welcome back you guys and like i said in the intro we've got some ridiculously high terpene percentages on this bow valley og from ogen and again it is going to be an alberta based strain i have loved everything that ogen has put out so far the lemon z the gas berries the early glue rbx honestly they have done a very very phenomenal job on all of the strains that they've put out so far and i've really enjoyed it and uh you guys will see tomorrow i've got a little bit of a 3.5 lemon z coming back my way and you'll understand that when you see the garage sash tomorrow but before we go into uh any more of that shenanigans we're going to save it for tomorrow we're going to get into our ogen one hitter read review today so let's quickly cover everything we've got coming for you guys this review before we go ahead and move on into the actual meat and potatoes of it so first and foremost cover the information on the container we move over to the ogen website which is the preferred way for me to do that using the cultivators actual websites that we're using the information that they provide we cover that on ogen and then we get into our actual review it's going to consist of six parts each being scored out of a total of a potential 10 points sevens and eights are where you're looking for that more above average and typical scoring but if it has a nice flavor or overall experience eights are what you're looking for all the way across the board if you want to hit a beautiful herbage we did that last was it was it last friday or actually this last monday you guys we hit our first beautiful herbage since the update of this update of the scale with the rc dream school and i'm hoping that this bow valley sativa strain comes through and does it as well now to be able to do that let's break down the actual urban scale first is the look and aroma should be relatively self-explanatory we took a look at the buds we take smell of the buds and the overall quality and output of uh experience that they have there will give us our score out of a 10. after that we go ahead we pack up our boundless cfc vaporizer here we run it through the three key temperatures to activate as many terpenes i go into full detail on that when we get to that portion and we score that out of 10 you guys seven and eights are really needed for that potent flavor that's where you're going to get it through the vaporizer now going into our bonds in the more combusted and heated way through flame being the ignition source there's a lot of factors that play into getting those sevens eights and nines and we go into details as i've spoken and really what would be the reasons why smooth and flavor are the two key components that will play major factors in here our bonds we approach very similar to our boundless cfc vaporizer we have three different ways of igniting it it provides us with three different experiences and we go over full details when we get there then finally the last two waves we smoke are going to be through the pipe our regal slim right here and then our elements paper i roll up a joint after we uh bust the nugs up and score it for the look and aroma and we smoke it at the end after taking a couple of dry hauls and figuring out exactly what we have to expect getting into it now after that we finish up with the high giving it its score out of 10 for the final time in the review to allow us to add up to the total out of 60 and if you break 48 a beautiful herbage will be deemed now you know exactly where we're going to be going over the next 20 minutes so let's go ahead and get into it you guys the ogen bow valley og sativa dominant strain came in with a thc total of 18.4 percent a cbd total of 0.04 and it has a package date of january 14 2021. now as [ __ ] falls down i am going to make a huge big note on this strain the terpene percentage available on this is huge like we are looking at the six plus percent terpene profile on here which makes it a incredibly aromatic and potent flavor based bud hopefully for us to dive into now let's quickly cover the information that they have on their website all the way down to the base and then we'll get smoking you guys beau valley og number 26 our final of og kush we have hunted and grown this power sativa at our facility in bow valley in alberta on first with this buds aroma is sweet vibrant line followed by sour gasoline and it only comes in the eighth the thc range is going to be 18 to 23 percent it's gonna have a less than one percent cbd and it is going to be sativa dominant cultivation process she grows like she smokes long and high bow valley og loves her space because she stretches pinches early on pinching early on is a part of ensuring an even canopy for well-developed buds the terpene profile is going to be lemonine osmine beta-carotelline and beta-meristenine they do go into the details on here so the lemonade is going to provide us the fruity citrus flavor awesome is going to provide us an earthy fruity flavor baited carefully and spicy and peppery don't forget that woody base as well as the betamercene give us that herbal and earthy flavor as well as a handful of other experiences your smile to experience is going to be sweet zesty lime followed by sour gasoline the appearance is dense stacked brax with shimmering and a sun like experience the touch is going to be stickiness of the sticky icky and the taste is crisp sweet and lime the final thoughts fresh crisp clear uplifting we're talking about bow valley provincial park here folks but seriously it's fresh now that we've had ogen do their promotion here you guys it's time for a little ready to leave let's get the urban scale in here and get this review on its way i'm looking forward to this bow valley og for emojin you guys let's see if berta puts out a good sativa cheers back you guys let's go ahead crack this container and dive into this bow valley og from ogen now biggest benefit ogen has is how tight their containers are there is no wasted space on these three and a half so i can say that for sure now overall experience i'm definitely getting that gasoline punch and pungency first and foremost it's coming out and just absolutely slapping me in the face you guys i am loving this overall experience now i'm getting a little bit of a more pepper tone underneath for sure it does have a little bit of a kind of a citrus citric style push through it but it's it's got some enjoyment to it you guys i'm looking forward to it now for the overall look of this bud i am going to have to switch it over for you guys to get a little bit of a better feel as to what to expect but for a sativa that's a little bit more on the airy side this is still looking pretty good so we have it laid out here on the better call salt tray and as you guys can see this is how it came out of the the container i did pull our three of the bigger nugs over to this side because this stuff in the middle right here this will be primarily what i'm smoking on so it looks like a lot of this piece here as you guys can see they're not it's not just shake like we've got a little bit of that in there but the majority of it is coming off of just these bigger nut nugs because as you can see it is a little bit more airy in between the spaces it doesn't quite pack on as densely as you would expect a little bit of a more indica growth in the style but overall the structure and the quality buds are nice it is drier than i would expect from ogen but again sativa dominant strain more air being moved but amongst and in the bud you will end up having a little bit of a drier strain and i find sativas typically dry out quicker than indica's just like and i'm talking more bud structure than actual effects like indica buds i mean the little [ __ ] rocks that are tightly packed versus these which are pretty loose overall i can see quite a bit of sunlight through out all in all looking aroma i'm gonna give it a seven out of a ten the smell is quite nice but the dryness of the bud and the little bit of the lack of punch and pungency there is really where i'm lacking and for some reason i can't spot my buster i can't seem to oh it's right over there i'll be back in just a gif you guys i do want to bust this butt up and if it does have any more additional aroma you'll see me cut that right back in and adjust the score but for now i'm going to keep it at a seven until i get it busted up we'll get the joint rolled up and unless there's a change guys we'll see you when we're getting into our bow cfc vaporizer and the temperatures there cheers let's get into it will definitely get bumped up to an eight out of ten you guys once busted up i get a lot more of a rich pungent aroma this bud has some major potential for it we'll give it an 8 out of 10 for that look and roam up because once it's busted up she's stinky guys now let me get this joint rolled up and we can start smoking okay guys so as i finish up packing up this joint i might as well walk you through the temperatures that we'll be going through with our boundless cfc vaporizer so first and foremost we will be starting out at 175 degrees celsius the reason we start out at 175 degrees is the limonene and meristening terpenes typically boil off at their highest levels there so we do get a little bit more of an opportunity to taste them and experience their overall performance you guys so the lemonade leans more on that lemon citrus side as you guys heard when we were talking about it while we were looking at the ocean website the meristening leans a little bit more on that herbal earthy side it does as well um complement a more mango juicy ripe flavor to it that um can almost be interpreted as like a rainforest a like a humid very green vegetative experience that's the mere scene where it really is dominant you guys at least i find it now 205 is where we go to next 205 allows us to really dive into the rest of the terpenes available through the cannabis plant it gives us our rich flavors our cushy flavors our creamy tones our chocolatey richness the cheese the pungent cheese flavor that you can get on some of those strains 205 is the place that we really start to experience them now we finish off at 220 and the two points for that are thc and beta carefully thc boils off at its highest point right around that 220 degrees and beta carefully does roll off at that high point highest point as well at the 220 guys so you get a really peppery or woody based experience sometimes you get a little bit of that earth as well as the strongest high off of the vaporizer all in all it's quite an enjoyable way to sit back and consume the bud because you are baking and not burning so it does have a little bit of a cleaner feel now i've talked well enough about it you know exactly how we're gonna get this thing going let's go ahead turn the sucker on set it on the 175 degrees that we start this review off on before we work our way up to the other temperatures you guys cheers and let's just give this a little time to warm up and dive in with the six plus percent of terpenes on this strain you guys i'm expecting such a potent and flavorful experience you guys i really really am looking forward to trying this butt out and seeing what it has to offer we now have the coffee cup telling us 175 degrees is ready to go let's start smoking you guys and seeing how the strain performs cheers very light very green definitely has that kind of sour citrus lime experience you guys nothing really overwhelming or like mouth washing but it's very mouth watering very very nice overall experience you guys i'm getting a little bit of a pepper or almost kind of a ginger tone there where there's just a hint of that spice underneath that's giving that kind of gassy undertone and aftertaste a little bit of a bite and hold to it now 205's ready to go let's dive in guys okay now we're getting some richness to it we're getting a little bit of that cushy richness there's still that sweet citrus tone at the start and an almost kind of earthy richness near the end you guys all in all it's a reasonable experience of let's bump up to the 220 and see what it has to offer there because right now i'm getting a very rich and potent flavor it's got my mouth watering but it's not strong like strong in the sense of it takes over this just it comes in while you're inhaling while you're exhaling it's potent but now i just get kind of that bland gingery almost experience now 20 it goes a little bit more on that wood side than the pepper it maintains that kind of sour bite but it doesn't run away with it it's an enjoyable experience you guys but it doesn't have anything that really gets me so excited or so pumped to take that next haul it's just got an appeal and then oh well this is nice well this is nice well this is nice it's so it's above average would be the best way that i could describe it it's just that nice above average experience potent enough flavor to be able to enjoy but not strong enough to push through so with the 8 out of 10 for the look and aroma i'm going to give this a 7 out of 10 for the taste for my bong biggest reason why it just didn't have that real heavy strength that i'd be looking through to push it into the upper echelons of eight ninths tense now moving into our bonds we're going to be smoking it very similar to the way that we did with our vaporizer we start out with the lowest ignition source temperature and work our way up to the highest so hepwick first clipper lighter second which is the most standard way and then we finish it off with a jetliner which seems to be a quite growing method to go alongside with the hemp work we got a little bit of a health movement a little bit of a flavor and flame movement so with that happening you guys let's just dive into these three bomb rips we've got our envy straight pipe first our nice glass beaker bong which gets the clipper lighter and then the envy not envy the red eye tech cyclone straight tube well that sucker she's how we finish it off with the jet so let's go ahead light up this hemp wick light up this bowl and i'll see you guys on the other that side of these three ribs with a fresh score and a little bit more to chat about cheers [Music] so [Music] third ball let's snap it we haven't coughed yet let's see if we can do no cough for all three ribs cheers [Music] incredibly smooth you guys incredibly smooth i honestly am not even going to take a break i'm just going to go right in to talk about this stream i did not cough once outside of a little bit of a let's clear the lungs such a rich and potent flavor definitely if i packed up one of these bowls keeping or filled right to the top brimming i would sit back i'd have to cough a little bit but just like this past monday it's a thc cough it is not a harshness cough it is not a rough on your throat cough it is a let's clear things out get to another bulk out of a cough if i sit there and i have to get two or three out it's not the it's cannabis you're gonna smoke you're gonna cough a little bit when you smoke like it's that kind of a strain which is like [ __ ] get it out dude so you can smoke another one nine out of a ten is the flavor i'm going to give off of this taste from avong and it's more so because the overall experience of itself is excredibly enjoyable incredibly enjoyable you start off first and foremost with a very ripe flavor it's the best way i can describe it is ripe um you know that time in the summer where you get that rainfall and the apple trees or whichever kind of natural growing fruit trees that you have in your area because i know bc you've got some option for a little bit more cherries and a little bit more citrus fruit and those guys who are a little bit more central locked like we are wear apples and stuff like that that can grow a little bit more rigorously in areas like this tears like this um that morning dew grass was cut the night before or it's getting cut first thing in the morning and that kind of fruity sweetness in the air with that fresh cut grass like [ __ ] it you're cutting the grass in the morning dewy sweetness like that is the experience i get like it reminds me of getting up in the morning to go to um to go and swim competitively that crack of dawn that kind of dawn humid grass being cut summer experience it's honestly guys with a day with the sunshine the way it is it's hyping me up for the sun sun to be out for a little bit longer for us to get into more of the campfires and the more summer-based activities it's really the experience that uh the bar grips have for this now let's go ahead do a little one of those clears pack up our pipe and see what the um offering odd is through the flavor here because if the pipe has anything to compare to the bongs you guys we're gonna have a very nice and highly scoring bud and because of the um sour leanings that this um wood pipe likes to go i'm overall expecting it to uh do well through here but incredible work on the bongs let's dive into the pipe i'm gonna give it a seven out of ten you guys the taste from a pipe it had a small moment where it really piqued my interest in the overall flavor really had something there that i was holding holding my tongue and really letting me enjoy the experience that it had but this time it just it didn't have everything that i was looking for it was enjoyable enough but it just it lacked that potency and the pungency to carry the flavor through i got that sweet grassy experience like i did through the bongs through the first pull and then after that it just diminished into that kind of sour woody flavor that the pipe's known for that little pike of an interest does earn it the extra point out of the six that most strains have been getting lately when they just taste like the pipe but we can move on to our joint safely now knowing that the pipe isn't anything that exciting a couple dry hauls here and then let's move into it definitely it's got that gassy push it does have a little bit of a of a good citrus undertone too i'm excited to see how this one smokes you guys i'll see you in just a second okay guys so taste from a joint i'm going to give it an 8 out of 10. it's enjoyable and honestly those of you that have tried those birdie bots every flavor beans or the bean boozled or any of those ones and you've had like the the lawn clippings or the mowed grass or anything like that this is kind of reminding me of that because i've had a couple of those and it's that's probably the closest similarity i have in comparison to the other description like the walking through that really descriptive um mid-summer morning right but this has a really nice and smooth experience and flavor and honestly guys it is really really balanced i think would be the best way to describe it between that and almost a little bit of a kind of a pepper wash every so often get that wave of just a pepper wash i don't know if it's something that i would get overly excited for it's definitely something that i think through the bong overall is going to be my most enjoyable way to smoke and i think that is just purely because you don't necessarily get that pepper wash that i'm getting through the joint but you just get that nice kind of lawn clipping beginning of the beginning of the day smoke but with that you guys we'll move on into the high we'll give it a 7 out of 10. it's got a really nice and balanced body and mental high it definitely gives you more of a body uplift and you guys might be able to pick it up like i feel like the speed of the way i'm talking has increased like it's made me a little bit more chatty a little bit more interactive definitely more along that lines but it has a quite enjoyable overall experience you guys and i'm looking forward to stuff riding this out and feeling how the rest was going to go definitely has more of that body kit let's get up let's go do something this is going to be a good one to smoke before i go and work out with that being said you guys a 46 out of 60 is how it did overall and honestly really smooth experience really nice smoke definitely something that i can see myself smoking the rest of the eighth and enjoying not something i see myself necessarily buying again the the overall enjoyment and experience is there it's just not something that's got anything overly exciting that's really grabbing my attention like the bong is really enjoyable and i think that's gonna be the way i smoke it but the fact that the high doesn't just [ __ ] rock me like the energy's there it's but i feel like it's gonna patter out like like kind of just wean out real quickly so i don't know i'm skeptical skeptical that's the best way to say um if you guys want to kind of check in for follow-ups on this best thing to do is weekly updates and weekly wrap-ups i should say and the live sessions that's really when i get into the more lengthy coverage of these strains and talk a little bit more about how it makes me feel overall and this one i'm i'm feeling like we're going to be doing that a little bit more just because i'm not sure how the length of this high is going to hit because i can already feel it starting to kind of weigh down and break that energetic cycle that i was having but uh all in all you guys good week for uh the weed we've been reviewing tomorrow you guys are gonna have a lot of fun with that garage sash i'm looking forward to getting that uploaded for you guys and then we will have the weekly wrap-up on sunday and then on monday we'll be diving into some grandpa's stash from thumbs up that was strain voted in for this monday we know the next three mondays worth of reviews i'm only gonna let you guys know a week in advance so grandpa stash this week and uh it'll be fun we're gonna have a lot of fun with you guys and

being said you guys cheers and we'll see you in the next one you", "N56CSt7H7sU": "[Music] look what I've got here this is a butt of something called triple og and there's a lot of triple og in the market right now I've been reviewing a few of triple og strains from different cultivators and I wouldn't have bought this one but what makes this one unique and the reason I bought it again it's it's my third and final selection that I got from Tyson ranch that was all that was available they had a rainbow cookies which I gave a nine they had a Sour Diesel that I get an eight point seven five and today we're gonna review the last of them which is a triple og and you can see this flower comes in this jar and what makes this store really nice is that it got this really nice seal inside you can see it's got a foam seal so when you shut this it's really sealed well the only problem with it doesn't really say the strain on the bottle so if these things get separated you know you don't really know what it is but I'll take care of that but I hope that they see this so they can fix that actually I don't want to keep the box it takes up too much space but anyway we're gonna try triple og by Tyson ranch out of the vapor cup you can see the cup went off so we're going to give it a second to come back to temperature this is actually vapor cup number two and you can see it's at 266 to 75 to 85 it'll come back real quick because it was already heated up so this is just the reheat it turned off just this cup goes off every 18 minutes just as a precaution so you can see we're back at 335 so let's check it out this is triple og by Tyson ranch out of the vapor Cup so one thing I'm saying about all the Tyson ranch flowers is they're all cured really good they're really smooth this oh gee it's sweeter than most oh geez most those cheap most oh geez have more of a pungent ammonia taste this one has them just a little bit of that and mostly sweetness but at wheat entertainment we're looking for the best and how does triple og by Tyson ranch right well I don't really like your blue G and I'm gonna say the same for this one this flower was just okay for me I'm giving this flower 7.5 it's a little heady for me you can see of all the three strains of the Tyson ranch that I reviewed I like the rainbow cookies the best and I thought that was a really good flower but for a triple og by Tyson ranch is just a 7.5 this is a doctor from wheat entertainment thanks for stopping by party on my friends [Music]", "tML8CSxR9a0": "hey guys what's up how you doing happy thanksgiving hope everybody had a good thanksgiving it's black friday everybody's out there getting their sales on so we're gonna enjoy it guys we got some good stuff here we got something i haven't had in a long time

because it's like if you look at it it's not it's wall growing it's well flushed and everything and then the compare to a really heavy indica yeah take it out let's compare and contrast that this is an indica in here and see how it's all compressed and yeah that's what I'm saying look at that this is the your indica right here this is my indica we're not smoking this right now but it was here a little bit later look at that we got that so here [ __ ] smells good but yeah this right here everybody we got some yeah the Mendel breath that she's fired [ __ ] we got today we got ireia I did the real damn some live I'm gonna choose that eight if you don't mind me after [ __ ] was thirty-five bucks that was 30 bucks my fault thirty bucks there let's get a 3.5 for free yeah there's thirty bucks

a joint so [ __ ] stay tuned y'all again everybody the SEC really glue some sativa I'm juiced man this is about to be five then we got this [ __ ] T you gets literally smelling it out of the container like you're just smelling it rocket almost literally like it reeks through the [ __ ] container I've been using this when there's we don't care how mad you house think is it oh damn that stink match sticky and I even break it down I literally just broke it just little pieces and I want to break the [ __ ] by hand now look at that you look at you look at closely like super super closely again this camera doesn't really do any justice but like if you look at it super close a [ __ ] is [ __ ] yeah that's just something bad so you know what you could do to grind it minimal yep do a couple just do a couple turns here let me show you how to everybody let me show you how sometimes like I think about it on my dude if you grinded if you grind the [ __ ] load out of it bro it could potentially take away some of the like trichomes engine you know anything a lot of people press down when they're grinding and like yeah you have to obviously present but like to a certain extent press down it only do like do one full turn another full turn another [ __ ] that's it that's it you need okay yeah that's really all you need you just kind of need them kind of like break down this little bear looking good yep was looking good nice fallin grinded and everything too so it's good I also today I'm the one that rolled it let me know how I did I'm usually not I'm not a roller definitely not a roller so it looks it looks nice from this side it doesn't mean he's good from far apart from good this side is likely what I'm gonna show you guys this a yeah a little ugly except for me I'm gonna taste that just takes to just take a hit and just taste that [ __ ] bro that girl that gluing on [ __ ] joke bro that guy was - yeah thank you yes make sure you acts nice impressing this oh you should have put a minute just a little oh [ __ ] no wait hold on I'm just thinking it's up to you but I'm just thinking on the bug I think now would have been at from the inside yeah yeah but no I was thinking I'll think I do that other container has a little layer like honestly with your Pig we could've just have my seat where's it now but my shits at the house let me check one of my things oh yeah so we slapped on some regard and well hold on you miss egg let a book all right yeah what is that some longer than what this is the the fire oh gee turns over whoo it's that one pass out that one book one book yeah that's just fire wrong oh let me see the right there oh nice yeah you're kind of just melting at huh yeah should it be warm yeah oh yeah huh yep even better yep there you go now it's getting more moist cheers gorilla glue with some OG fire wubba Oh some by someone the way that the og og well but no no no no let me rock rock introduce me man you introduced me to a new technique on how to spark it I knew it yeah whatever guys like this look you gotta make the usual somehow get into the facts how much cheese with that she's so [ __ ] loud you think about that first couple of heads bro what's up first couple hits I had a little bit of a stress on my mind my mother from whatever I had stressing from where our stressing banana just like kind of like weight the table my shoulders I'm just chilling I can just not worry about it and just be chilling and bright so what I'm trying to say is that I'm lit what was good though y'all have you guys ever smoked that gorilla glue what's poppin let me know in the comments down below makes you guys drop a comment there's no way guys a friend what you guys are smoking on mm-hmm but yeah this is some gorilla glue some Gigi number four so I'm really cool for so g-g-gee it's definitely paid like hella good like better or worse from your previous experiences hmm can't say just yet but I think this is good who knows actually because I know we had some guerrilla glue not so long ago honestly if you're right nut so that's what I'm trying to remember I was like you remember Johnny's guerilla game that's what I'm saying that shows fire to it look like an indica yeah and gorilla glue or also known as GG 4 created by Gorilla Glue stare decisis Evo dominant hybrid and multiple award-winning strain famous for its high THC content yup it a verge is 18 to 25 percent THC this one average is 22 this batch that we got 22% so with the imagine with the wax to this Pilate Helen oh yeah no [ __ ] regard and wax is looking like 50% but you may find it as high as 32% some dispensaries 32 some dispensaries have this [ __ ] at 30 to 30 when you get to 30 percent THC that is that's 5 [ __ ] right there that's that's fire yeah cuz the 30s that's why what the yeah yeah and then the CBD is very low ranging between a point zero five at a point one I honestly don't like I really don't like [ __ ] homes in CBD I don't like that should be giving me headaches in shape so let's see this is a 5 a 5 star out of 5 Gorilla Glue number 4 this is a really good strength and it's crazy too because the guy was like I asked him all that what do you recommend and he reached his hand on the back of something pulled some [ __ ] up and I was like GG floors I looked but he put his hand in a in a black pants and a black hole you just put that he just needs wet his pants and he's check out that [ __ ] and I was like Oh fire it's yeah I have two of those it's wait I don't get it so it says sativa but it's recommended to smoke at night interesting very interested if uhrin types of sativa yeah let's see in different types of engine typical typical effects relaxed card mouth sleepy common usage depression pain and insomnia okay that's kind of cool gorilla glue for us on itv4 was created this is that the strain gets his name because of the resin that collects on the scissors when trimming gorilla glue number four has several parents parents due to extensive background Sour Diesel sour dub cam sister at Kansas City Kansas and chocolate diesel the hybrid strain has won awards at the 2014 catalyst Cup in both LA and Michigan I usually don't cop that much unless I'm smoking like taking a nap described as a bunch of trichomes with a few but leaves in stocks sticking out the aroma is very strong true that and as most is mostly diesel with notes of chocolate and coffee although sweet and earthy is also it's also used to describe it you'll be going back for seconds due to the full-bodied and flavorful spot you mention it I do taste the chocolate milks in the smell is really [ __ ] nice I'm gonna lie this is gorilla glue this gorilla glue I'm not gonna lie it's Pollock in my top five best smelling weed flowers top five it's in my handful for sure not top five for me not me right now what I'm really on is all like the the oranges all the of the sours like the line technically yeah technically I try to choose I try to choose one of every category if that okay that makes sense yeah so out of like the ones that smell like these the gorilla greens like you said sour diesels and honestly cuz like Sardis let's just smells fire stuff too we really can sister [ __ ] and chocolate diesel I've never tried that sour dub neither so our diesel initially actually trying to a chocolate it's a strain called chocolate peppermint you remember that fan it's [ __ ] it tastes similar to this but [ __ ] now that I think about it I'm like Sour Diesel does [ __ ] smell like this too and I just gotta have both comparative we got to start doing versus versus yeah yeah like this versus this huh I'm Donna another hit 11 a campaign stepped out let's see the buds are green with orange hairs that's it is very oh it's spongy resinous and covered in trichomes it was yeah yeah the little dents what are the parts yet because it says it's this very dense spongy president then the trichomes you can see all that [ __ ] you really can't I really want to get a camera week the [ __ ] young man well imagine how high-quality are [ __ ] video get a microphone a microphone a freaking the colors the microscopes doesn't just end up looking at the [ __ ] well when our tree looks under my physical eyelids green that they know people have a bunch of like [ __ ] that in German and the little Tigers well you date that [ __ ] just marijuana a [ __ ] a cannabis plant looks really [ __ ] crazy then you zoom in and you see literally every little detail you see the trichomes are like little little crystals on there it's like it's like clear you know like orange hairs they're nuts like do this it's such a it's such a satisfying view like a whole nother filing Wow it's a home of the funny hobby like yeah that should say that [ __ ] has a lot of information though you know the glue is because it's really popular I know a lot of people like it with new [ __ ] a lot of people like been emoji to vent emoji remember the one that we smoked the vent emoji or do a send us upload that video curl igloo makes you chill medical and recreational users boat it gives a full body melt and despite the sativa dominance the body effect may be a result of the THC CBD ratio but let alone the copies a lawyer buddy if you guys ever smoked on some Gorilla Glue I know a lot of people out there it's kind of crazy bro this is what I really like about having this type of channel and having the type of community that I'm trying to get together you know it's like everyone's different parts of the world I have people commenting from the UK people from the East Coast and I'll shout to you guys try people from [ __ ] Antarctica but even from [ __ ] marty at what gods it Mars I don't know why I was hunting Bush out there but and you guys be smoking on like [ __ ] that I've never even heard of honestly people will drop a name or a strain or some [ __ ] and I'll just play what the [ __ ] I never heard about that I'll check it out yeah they did for sure I always say oh yeah I try this one we bro you don't have like if you guys are from California then we might have the same strength but you guys are from like somewhere else y'all have different strains like in London in a night like over there overseas do they have cookies like they should but that I'm pretty sure burn it would be smart enough to yeah setup with cookies club and in the UK especially London [ __ ] yeah oh yeah oh that's just legal out there hey Canada - mmm but maybe he already does have dispensaries in Canada and UK Glasson it's Canada cat in Canada that's just the legal legal that's just like you're smoking a cigarette you just have to be on personal property at urine which is the hostas personal property and you have to be of age we're both we're both 23 or 96 babies this is an 18 and up channel but it's all literally for all educational purposes I'm loaded with let us know if you guys are loaded and bloated with us learning gluten for sure I feel like I've been lettered in bullies inside that was 13 since eighth grade this is just like Lil D freshman year we started smoking it's crazy we should make a video on how I first started song in breath why we started smell good I'm there because we wanted to get our tolerance off for the under the influence we would have smoke sessions uh-huh and by his crib my house we would like kick in by like these offices because we are apartments are connected to like pretty much you can say abandon offices and [ __ ] so we just glad kind of walk to like the offices in shame and we just be like smoke and [ __ ] we smoke a [ __ ] blunt it's crazy back in the day everybody loot all it would be like six of us and we don't opt like two dollars and fifty cents each literally two dollars to fifty cents these food walk the shell end up then and we're all like 16 17 and no no we were younger yeah we were younger and the guy the guy that used to work but at the gas station that we used to go this guy he would let us buy [ __ ] like Swisher's and [ __ ] he just wanted to make sells you know so he's like [ __ ] which works for us and yeah yeah exactly and I'm pretty sure bro we all like tell a little to the video server to keep making dropping videos like that bro that [ __ ] I should have a funny bro [ __ ] that's just really crazy bro we don't drop $2.50 clothes if you go to the gas station get changed and by a blunt go to the walk walk see if we can get a ride to the plug house and so now we would walk or it was an adventure yeah it wasn't that far the plug look over the bridge for the bridge yeah cop like a good like a 10 sack or a 1.5 roll that [ __ ] in a blunt maybe two maybe like [ __ ] split that point what point eight point eight in the black yeah yeah well I think gave us dub we just rolled both blunts mm-hmm and we just smoked one both of them and we'd just be chilling and I just having hella fun like six seven of us is hella loaded just not going on adventures don't have a fun [ __ ] we'd be stupid loaded and out of the consume but a display survivor like you know that was live yeah one time we had these like these guys dressed up as girls chases yeah right and we like we really we were young [ __ ] 15 so just imagine and we were this is like this is like a 25 2012 2013 yeah yeah yeah you're right we're little well technically we're like when I brought what

should turn the light up so y'all can see but the lights too far away today so hopefully you guys can see that pretty good triple o g all right let's get up into the bone work here i hope you guys slept like kings and queens you know i slept last night i sleep like a king every night if you're new to the channel smash that subscribe button hit that post notification bell so you don't miss any of the bad ass videos look at this shirt y'all this is my nephew shirt i can't remember the name of it i'll try and put it in the link or i'll say it on next video but yeah this is his shirt i'm not promoting it i'm just showing it to you guys i'm not promoting it for sale because nobody's paying me for that so that's what we don't do everything's got to be about you paying me not you but you know what i'm saying i used to didn't be that way i used to be cool with everybody you know like if you needed me to do something i knock it out but not anymore man i see how people are acting now so i gotta adjust my [ __ ] accordingly because you look like an idiot man you're going around helping everybody ain't nobody doing [ __ ] for you and i'm going around helping everybody ain't nobody doing [ __ ] for me give me my energy back i hate wasting energy on stuff like that because this is a good morning and i don't need no negativity in my [ __ ] early in the morning you heard me so get get up off me i don't even know if i got a lighter triple o g you guys look at it in the ball triple o g oh [ __ ] we need some ice too yes i do have a lighter oh i have a lighter man i did i slept good as [ __ ] last night y'all got some ice water here because like i say in every video now that we don't use ice anymore because there is some hazards to use an ice in the bong so it's better to use ice water accomplish the same thing in a little cleaner fashion if you guys can hear icing and anything you can put ice in the in your container of water but just don't have it in your bone like regular just dry ice don't have to [ __ ] your phone not dry ice you guys know what i'm saying man anyway let's go ahead and get up in here i got too much stuff in the way ladies and gentlemen triple g you guys see me brace myself for that cough because that muscle i pull not in my ass but on my ass cheek the muscle on your ass cheek it's like feels like my hip like it's inside but um we're gonna work on that like i said we go to the gym every day so why don't i keep saying we i go to the gym every day course you guys can see that gym workout every day so off the first hit every time i cough that thing just like anyway so off the first hit i immediately tasted earthiness as soon as the smoke hit my lips i tasted earthiness i'm kind of i taste so g i'm not a fan of og at all just regular og kush i'm not a fan of it because o.j kush tastes to me like old weed but this is triple g and it has a little sweeter taste to it it doesn't taste like old wheat like og i think og's gotta be old [ __ ] weed but it doesn't taste old it tastes tastes kind of sweet and delicious can you say delicioso it has a very pleasant taste to it i can't put my finger on it on what the flavors are there's like a a faint diesel taste there's a not like not like sour diesel but like fuel like gas this is a slight fuel taste there's some earthiness with a lemon backdrop to it but there's a flavor coming through my nose that i can't put my finger on it's got to be pretty good because that's the second hit and i can feel it right behind my eyes already starting to get high higher than gas yes that is um quite nice quite lovely indeed i don't know it's not hitting me like like exotics dude this is street grade so we all know what that means so i got a question for you guys simple question me and a guy was having a discussion about it yesterday i said i wasn't going to say anything but i always say something how many of you guys think the earth is black [ __ ] what you learned in school don't worry about what your parents told you how much how many people do do you think in your own mind with your own opinion how many people do how many people think the earth is flat now i've heard people's um opinions on why it's flat or how it's flat and that was discredited by science i don't know how it was discredited i'm not picking one side or another it really doesn't matter to me if it's round or flat but for me for me personally my personal opinion how can i look up in the sky and see the moon and see that it's round and see all everything else and it's round like the sun's round the moon's round every planet is round but earth it just doesn't make sense why would we we be the only flat planet unless it's like they said that nasa is like projecting those pictures out there to make us think that we're living in this [ __ ] universe i don't know all i know is that is that everything that they told us man is [ __ ] that's all i know man it's like it's like you guys have they've had they've had an agenda since the beginning and it's all been [ __ ] we don't even know if [ __ ] e equals m c squared we don't even know if that [ __ ] is true man we don't know none of that [ __ ] man we're just going on what they told us and it's obvious that their word is not you can't believe their words you can't believe [ __ ] the same they can't even come up on a a decent number on how many people have died from this pandemic some people say a hundred thousand i've seen something last night they said seven hundred thousand people have died off this pandemic i'm like come on y'all how hard is it to count dead people they're not moving this is all [ __ ] man to create some type of mass panic if we all just keep going on living our lives doing the [ __ ] that we're doing man and not worrying about the [ __ ] [ __ ] boys up in in dc because that's all they are man is a bunch of [ __ ] boys in washington man all the people over there running the country doing what they think is best for us well how about i know what's best for me oh gee oh gee oh yeah triple g that is there's an og taste that old old flavor it tastes old to me like like og to me has no flavor i i i can't put another pattern i can't cap on it anyway i'm getting pretty hot one moment please i'm pleasantly baked hmm i have this burning in the back top of my throat though that's just like it's indicative to og og is always harsh to me every every og i've had from regular og to triple o geez always has this level of harshness triple g or og period is something that you mix with some wheat now that's a good weed to mix with sour diesel yes it tastes kind of like cardboard to me that's what that that earthy flavor is to me it's like cardboard like it's hard to explain how cardboard tastes i'm sure you guys have tasted cardboard before but that's what it tastes like to me i don't know anyway on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] 10 being that good [ __ ] of the flavor critique of this triple o g we're gonna give it a six it's an average flavor man now we're gonna give it a seven because it's still average flavor but it has that little extra kick to it that regular og doesn't have this has like a sweet a sweeter taste to it like i can't explain it's just a sweeter taste it's not berries it's not [ __ ] it's not sweet like that's just a sweeter taste a different taste i should say yeah i think it's worth a seven i don't think that i would recommend this particular strand to my friends although people love it man i am getting high but i don't see i don't see me personally recommending this rant to anybody this to me is like this is like mids to me it's not trust me it's a good button i'm getting high this is it's fire bud man but to me it's like mitch you guys got to realize all the [ __ ] that i've been smoking look go back and look at all the buzz that i've been smoking and then you put some og up next to what i've been smoking man you can't put triple g up next to panther piss or pineapple piss you can't put triple g up against some wedding cake you can't do it man you can't even put triple o g up against sour diesel so i gave it a favor by giving it a seven because i really want to give it a six but that's just a little too short for average or a little too close to average now the highlight of the hair seems like he's going to be something different because i'm getting higher and higher but it's not an event getting higher you know what i'm saying it's like when you smoke that sweet exotic man it feels like a damn event when you get hard you know what i'm saying like like you're getting high like yes i feel beautiful i feel like oh you know that's the way you feel and [ __ ] but with this you feel like man no you're not like that you feel like i'm high man but i'm high i got the monkey off my back that's about it but i can feel it slowly creeping up creeping up right now it's behind my eyes again still lurches in [Music] here okay do we have some more of this i think we do that j yesterday you guys whoa wait that j had all the flavors of greatness in the trust and believe but i'ma tell you what man that pineapple piss ain't no joke y'all wow y'all need to give that [ __ ] a shot it opens up pretty good see how it looks on the inside let's see all the [ __ ] crystals and [ __ ] falling off my hands it's a nice looking bud man don't get it wrong but uh yeah let's get back in here and i'm starting to get really really hot now i believe that that if i just sat here for some minutes man that it would creep up and just bite him we ain't gonna wait for that hmm tasty oh yeah good lord yes okay okay that hit right there got me actually even higher perhaps i would recommend this to my friends have you guys ever heard of triple g hmm it's quite tasty quite tasty indeed whoo so um they were talking about damn i can't think of her name i want to say brianna the female that just got killed they're holding the court i don't really know much about it you guys i'm sorry but um so what they're saying is don't go riot if the police get off if the police are fine found not guilty don't go over there riding because they're trying to set people up they want people to come over and ride and they're waiting for your riding now so they can put caps in all of y'all that are riding so they're trying to just stop all the riding and it's weird because you guys got to realize we're riding because we're [ __ ] unhappy about some [ __ ] uncomfortable about some [ __ ] we can't walk up to the white house we go hey there's uh trump in there hey trump let me hold you real quick though so there's this law man that sounds really [ __ ] up man and it's a law that says we can kill black people and get away with it what you think about that trump you gonna do something about that bro we can't do that [ __ ] man so what's the only thing we can do we can't tell the police because they don't give a [ __ ] you know what i'm saying you can't tell nobody in power what's going on that they're killing innocent people of color you can't tell them about that [ __ ] because they don't give a [ __ ] they already know what's happening man so what's the bet next best thing to do riot tell y'all [ __ ] up you don't want to act right for us we don't want to act right for y'all tell that [ __ ] up but see now that's [ __ ] up but for all these years we've been cool about it be like we're not gonna do anything you guys are killing us and we're just cool about it go ahead police kill everybody else we don't care man this [ __ ] gotta stop man i got a video on my page right now i mean on my facebook page right now go over there and follow me on on abu dhabi walker on facebook b-u-d-a-a-b-i w-a-l-k-e-r on facebook y'all go over there check that out anyway i just put a video up where this police came in to arrest this black guy for a noise complaint they were removing him from his own house for a noise complaint there was no females involved there was only like a few dudes there there was a couple females but it looked like a party scene to me anyway the white dude was in between the cop and the black dude he was like no you're not taking them you cannot take them there's no reason for you to take them from this house only person he wanted to take was the black guy and that's [ __ ] there was like five or six people there the only person he wanted to take was the black guy the black guy was being cool he was like no i'm not going with you man i didn't do anything wrong this is my house the [ __ ] are you talking about it's just crazy because that when the police walk into a room the only thing they see if there's like let's say there's [ __ ] four latinos a couple a couple of asians and uh some white people and about six percent about one black person when the police walk in the room the only thing he's looking at is that black person the only thing that's on his mind is that i'm gonna take this black person to jail more importantly he's probably thinking i'm gonna take this inward to jail and it's like dude man why is it the only [ __ ] thing you guys think of what is it just not you guys i'm just i'm saying the police i can't stand the police man i [ __ ] hate him man i really don't hate anybody but i hate them man i really do i have no love for police man anybody that makes you feel like that you can lose your life at any minute just by being around them is not cool it's not a fear man it's it's like just a nervousness like it's a [ __ ] nervous energy like this [ __ ] could literally just pull out his gun and blow my head off and get away with it at any minute so how do you think that we're supposed to feel comfortable around police this is constantly in our mind this is the only thing in our mind the only thing in my mind when a black person walk out their front door in the morning man is damn i hope i don't see no [ __ ] police today man i don't care you're not doing nothing man you could just be driving the [ __ ] work man i was driving to a doctor's appointment he got pulled off i was like damn not doing nothing not speeding not riding dirty none of that [ __ ] that it was crazy i'm lying i was speeding for the most part the last what two cops i've come in contact with have been okay don't get it wrong i have no love for police and [ __ ] all police but the last two police i came in contact with there was no incidents you know [ __ ] like you were speeding here's a ticket have a nice day bye the other [ __ ] pulled me was like hey man you a speed man you want to slow down have a nice day pulled off see those are the cops that are worried about how black people perceive them because of with their blue brothers we're going through blue brothers [ __ ] outta here anyway i'm getting hired you guys that's why i'm talking so much because i'm trying to let this high kick in oh he's son of a creature now tasty yeah delicious we're back okay now my arms are starting to sweat so you know that was a pretty good hit there i kind of see why i'm the bodybuilders wear tight shirts now it make you feel like it makes me feel big because this is just an xl my nephew was like here man you want this xl i was like yeah man you should i wear a big and tall or i'll wear a double x or triple x homie yeah but let me take this thing let's see with that bomb i put it on as long as it's long enough i got a little flex juice there y'all look my shirt bends around more i'm just playing i'm getting pretty high right now though i still think there's going to be no extravagant number though it really is not very much of an expansion rate when it hits your lungs you gotta see i didn't like bust out coughing too hard you guys seen that one budget i had i think it was like two or three videos ago man i just could not stop coughing it was just like it was annoying me trust me guys i love the cough when i smoke the bong actually i can't help it from time to time man so i guess i have no choice but to love it but it doesn't hurt it doesn't hurt anything it makes me feel better i feel good when i cough if you don't cough you don't get all [ __ ] out of here anyway on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] tim being that good [ __ ] of the high critique of this triple o g we're going to give it a let's see the flavor got a seven should have got six but it got a seven so the high we're gonna have to give it eight and that's really high we're gonna give it a low eight a low eight high seven so the flavor was a seven in the highest and eight i i think the dispensary grade of this would be quite delicious and it'll provide an excellent high for you but street grave not too impressed with it i'm not too impressed with it now that monster cookies yesterday was whoo when i got off i was really hot so yeah all in all man i really wasn't too pleased with this i know they got some good numbers but that was just because of the flavor actually let's let's go back and revisit that flavor we're gonna take that flavor down to a six so we're gonna give it a six for the flavor and we'll give it a a seven for the um for the high because it's really not that spectacular trust me it's a nice high man only because it's awakened bait right behind my eyes it feels beautiful anyway i hope you guys enjoyed

get this at blue fire dispensary in merced california and it blew fire this is going to run you 52 for the 8th take a look at the buds they look really good i know you can't see them as good as i'd like right there but like always if you want to see an up-close picture of the bug check it out as you can see there they look really good it's got like a citrusy pine gassy smell to it they're the buds aren't real dense but they're not like super cushiony but they're not really dense either it was really sticky when i broke it up i do got a bong load packed already and it is coming to you at a 27 on the thc zero on the cbd 31 on the thc a for a total cannabinoids of 32 the og kush unruly by blem 52 for the eighth i heard that they go more in other places but 52 where i got it at blue fire dispensary so cheers everybody let's get a bong load in um damn damn that bungalow got me feeling like i'm warning you [Music] do you guys see that the video cut out or something i'm not sure [ __ ] it let's continue okay our first initial thought the flavor it is like an og kush it's got that pungent og kick to it it gives me that indica lung expansion that i'm looking for my eyes instantly drop it is smooth it didn't [ __ ] up my uh my throat so so far off the first hit i like the flavor i like the smoothness and the high is definitely [ __ ] solid it's got me feeling great off the first hit but like everybody knows two for the review get that stealth smoke out i will be going live tonight from 5 p.m to 6 p.m california time everybody that shows up highly appreciated i did get accepted to the membership program so now you guys i got the super chats i got the membership with my tears all set up uh if you guys want to become a member it's in the description of all my videos so you can get it there we got the beer let's get a full send in i am getting a i had a little cold or something so the beer is kind of going down a little shitty right now but it's always full sense on my channel yeah so far i really like this [ __ ] strain solid i like an og kush though those are some of my favorite man i'm a little sick so this or you know i feel under the weather but i'm still going to hit it cheers that was rough oh [ __ ] okay two for the review gotta get that second one in blim has other uh weeds too not just the unruly this is the one this is their indica flower and it was highly recommended to me by bud tender so that i trust so i wanted to try it out shout out to lando it's one of his favorite [ __ ] uh strains yeah but the blem has i think they have a sativa a hybrid but they're not all called unruly they're called like something else tangy ting and something else i'm not sure oh trying to get that burp out got stuck okay let's get the second hit in cheers hope you guys are having a great day [Music] [ __ ] definitely packs a punch it has great flavor this is more for your veteran smokers your og smokers not your beginners because this is a heavy hitter it's very smooth though great flavor and it hits hard as [ __ ] damn all right let's calculate it up price at blue fire dispensary in merced california it's going to run you 52 for the eighth that's a good price for this flower this flower's top shelf it's [ __ ] as good as it gets so i'll pay 52 for this quality of weed the uh the look and the smell is really good it smells great it looks really good too the flavor is on point it's got that gassy og flavor that you're looking for in an og kush um the smoothness is there it didn't [ __ ] up my throat and leave it all harsh or raspy at all and the high is amazing it's definitely a [ __ ] top-notch strain gets you super baked so overall for the og the unruly og kush by blem i'm giving it the 8.8 it's a solid ass train it's high up there it's one of the best that i've been smoking lately so i'm giving it the 8.8 there's nothing to hate it's a great strain i highly recommend it if you guys see it in your dispensary pick it up try it let me know how you guys like it so i'm getting at the 8.8 that was my review i hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town", "MBbTOveKUFo": "hi let's talk about the Tahoe OG Kush strain

my honest opinion but i'm very thankful that they hooked me up with this with these products like that's so amazing but this wouldn't have been done by myself i wouldn't be able to do this on my own like you guys have also helped me get like these free products so y'all deserve to see me smoke these and it's like i'm smoking for you guys okay we smoking virtually hopefully one day we do get to like have like a big ass smoke sesh together and like a lit ass day like that would be so fun you know nice view type of [ __ ] but this is how the packaging looks hi 90s super nice super yellow definitely summer vibes has the palm trees right here they're wax infused cannabis pre-rolls each of them hold 1.2 grams and you all know like most of the time i be smoking like joins priors once in a while backwards but it's like everywhere not rare i would say but it's not i don't smoke it as often you know because pre-rolls um are definitely much healthier since they're nicotine free and let's just take a moment thumbnail these are so cute i can't i cannot oh my gosh so we have right here the um flavors that it has we have strawberry it's sweet and juicy strawberries straight from the fields we have watermelon the refreshing watermelon you crave after the beach peach so juicy and delightful you'll want seconds definitely tropical punch oh i love the the color for this one i love the color for all of them but this is like my favorite color a blend of sweet tropical flute flavors gelato oh my gosh you guys are you guys seeing what i'm seeing the packagings are so cute super [ __ ] cute sugar cookie ice cream better than grandma's pink lemonade like a cold glass of lemonade on a summer day definitely for the summer days pineapple sweet pineapple sprinkled with sugar and double cup a candy lemon lime soda your favorite rapper's drink okay hi nighties i see you guys you guys the packaging oh my gosh i can't even decide which one i want to try out first because they all look so cool and you can tell like the packaging is good quality i like glass containers like this because i can usually like stuff this pre-roll if i didn't finish it in the um back or like if i have another one and i'm like i'm gonna save it in here so it doesn't reek my room like these are just pretty cool containers and like i like that they're colorful that's super cool and it's vibrant and it makes me like happy and it's so summer vibes definitely summer vibes i really like it like i don't know i'm just so excited i can't even choose which one like i think i'm gonna have to like grab them all and do like any minimizing well because they're all too good so guys i actually didn't record a lot and i was actually talking a lot about the product itself and i'm already i already had sparked it up too and i was not recording uh youtuber fails look it it's definitely burning pretty nice we have that white ash i just [ __ ] up the burning that's why it's like but it's burning very like nice and even not even but smooth because i didn't burn it even but yeah as i was saying i was talking about the product i really love um i'm smoking tropical punch and this one has 29.7 thc i just chose this one because it matches my nails to be honest nothing specific in particular but it's hitting pretty good their weed is indoor weed they don't use no um no trim nor shake which is like number one like a big thing most of the pre-rolls range from 30 to 40 so far as i'm hitting it it's super smooth i can taste it that tropical in there these are so like on the gold and cute as [ __ ] like hey you're going to freaking grocery shopping or something you want to smoke right before let me take out aha 90s super cute super fashionable just spark it up ready to go so far i actually like the weed it's hitting pretty good and for it being small like it's hitting pretty good and as i was saying when i was unboxing packaging um they are wax infused heroes and h holds 1.2 grams so these little shits hold 1.2 not bad at all oh i did try fuzzies and it has 0.5 and i just feel like last time in like five minutes or so and this one already has lasted me like okay decent time and although it doesn't have the wax out on the outside it has it in the inside it tastes like pretty enjoyable versus the fuzzy i just felt like i don't know it just tasted like straight up wax like i don't know how to explain in like straight up wax and it also i don't know if it also could have been like the weed too that fuzzies carried because i know that the packaging date was pretty um it had been like since the end of march that they had packaged that [ __ ] so i was like [ __ ] but i already had paid for another great thing about these free rolls each of them comes from a natural blend of terpenes but i really like these spring rolls like i feel like with two i'd be like pretty cool two or three [ __ ] smoke on eight right now [ __ ] it it's all down maybe smoking like how many do you want me to smoke in the session because they do have seven now left i have seven all left so let me know what you guys want to see with the rest of these pre-rolls because yeah i don't want to be reviewing each flavor that's going to be too many or maybe i can i can do a series on this high 90s let me know down what you guys think i should do seven pre-rolls in a sitting um a series of like some flavors or like i don't know don't let me know some creative ideas i sometimes don't i'm not really creative i'm not creative to be honest but i do enjoy making videos for you guys and for the people that do enjoy thank you so much like i said i wouldn't be able to be doing this without you guys and we all go make it here i [ __ ] burned myself with a lighter but definitely i [ __ ] with it i also loved like it is a pre-roll i'm usually you guys always know i'm usually smoking joints free rows once in a while i'll be smoking some backwoods or whatever but it's an occasion it's not all the time because they are nicotine free so they are healthier which is it benefits you you know but i hope you guys enjoyed this video and say hi to the [ __ ] sky and until next time bye", "0QMRglBiLHU": "if

automatically did your turn I'm going to try talking when he's dying I'm not taking a dad bro like eight days bro then you can reheat yeah you know once I got one those shims drop this [ __ ] took a little vacation from smoking and all that [ __ ] like I was just drinking non-stop I went to Mexico what's a Baja California I'll have a video on my main channel if you guys want to check that out I guess I got honesty bruh I was so urine you ain't having like a good time living in the moment I don't really like record that much but I'm like [ __ ] that you know like yeah I live in the moment drink DD drink more alcohol than wonder if I move why didn't know people literally didn't I drink all I drink was just soda when I was thirsty uh-huh and then beer and he my lord and then it got a little good I literally did not drink water for like a good roll I broke out so bad on my bag on my face yeah backing oh damn yeah tasted a sativa like a mother duck it tasted like OG only OG Kush how'd you sleep yeah wax more yeah for sure brother that [ __ ] was [ __ ] fire little snake to [ __ ] and I love that you can see I'm a-tingle I'm back baby I'm back baby back to the parenting this one was good I'm excited for you to try this in town man how you guys been though let me know in the comments down below you guys was personally me you guys are gonna watch this video and you guys are gonna you guys are not gonna notice that I'm gone unless you guys follow me on snapchat follow us on snapchat so something's gonna be down description but uh yeah man I was gone for like eight days bro I went to a bar California San Felipe yes so that she was popular we got like my uncle got a an air B&B out there and we're just out there just chillin we got a B kind of got like a beach house like the house is like on the cliff you know so and then actually leave come with no it's how I said go what the hell I've livin in a mini mansion truly yeah yeah big-ass house too it was sick and then bro we're writing like crazy eyes like a thing called the sombrero and in a banana and if some guy was like with the speed but not a speedboat but a boat was just dragging his bro that [ __ ] was crazy for anyway my bull was riding a banana I was riding on Anna oh [ __ ] yeah some okay badly oh and they're rock so they just fell off - look at that oh the [ __ ] dives my son noise huh noise oh shut up buzz for providing us some smooth ups damn right oh damn whoo that smell bro it didn't even hurt so Larry oh gee everybody we sparked it up nere rolled it up the little Dutch what you think that's a nice taste to it oh it's piney like it says it did say it was like a piney tastes kind of like a sweet tiny taste it is sweetened good good so it also has a very tart taste when you exhale so you know when you inhale it's sweet aromatic and party so that's exactly when you exhale it has like a tart like taste I'll give you drinking coffee or something like it's like a really dark coffee way what's up yeah down [ __ ] stone tough that shout out seismic brewing coming and for Hannon cut the check when I first seen this Larry just first thing imagine they made I'm serving was gonna say something that my mind is just racing like right now I just go into like thinking hello [ __ ] and imagine they made a like a THC like IPA or something like a wheat IPA you know how to put hop so they just put treeling you know way yeah we're somewhat the fun or they still harvest or I guess so wait would you just get hella late or did you get fainted when you get both both so it'd be like a a THC a liqueur infused and then just call it twisted just cause I just called twist because I have I yeah it's you know I can see them maybe not putting THC in it but CBD the CBD IPA like I can see like that's like the closest here comes they complete life it makes them sumbitches or you're saying those like the main CBD and MATC I can see that happening bro so they made one for like if you want to do you do it huh you think what cell though because usually if people like to drink I like to drink if you like to smoke back to smoke and then there's like why not try it yeah it could be for the experience that should be it shouldn't be for the everyday customers could be for the for the enthusiasts you know for them yeah I mean like us we like to drink and smoke I would give it a go to just take a little sip of this long runner throw some IPA in there bro use the [ __ ] podcast weather you know and I've never watched that I [ __ ] with the job is it just this is them talking about imagine we got I was saying like I was think about it cuz like one of our boys he got he also has a podcast too and he just got his own little studio so I'm like bruh like imagine like we blew this [ __ ] up bro we'd be able to get our own little studio and it'd be we can make it both [ __ ] make videos for the main channel with the [ __ ] new Hello [ __ ] you know we could legitimately have a legitimate collab with them that's what I'm saying no but I'm thinking about a bow like how out well I would love to like get like a little studio maybe have like four corners one is for like four exactly let's say in the cut another one is for like I'm crunchy and other status for podcast so it's like we just have to switch keeps with turning around the cameras if that makes sense you know so it's like the cameras would be everything would be like lighting and all that [ __ ] and then we'd have the lights portable lights obviously you know and then the camera would just be like shade in the middle sort of just twist because that way we could get the we can you get some sick-ass paintings and sick-ass setups better Matt that's so sick every single [ __ ] channel has a different [ __ ] setup and [ __ ] sick as well painting in the back it's like one room but like there's like lines like huh dividing you mean a couple studios I'll be safe that's one thing I always thought about like have a little work like an office to work out but then at the same time kind of just like it's kind of just you know my office is my room and then just like I go out get the footage you know come back and edit that's always list for room but if this were to become like you could say like a like a primary like and just when it's pot but you know and I guess this i think it's possible soon I probably I give it a give this life but then at the same time but I like you don't need a we don't need a studio it's enough space for everybody bro it's got to be different that's it really the thing is we the matter how saturated something is if you bring something new to the table it does not [ __ ] matter if there's a billion people doing it if you bring like I said something new to the channel you show something brand new never brought to this [ __ ] platform you'll get popping for sure yeah and the more viewers bro the [ __ ] better they're saying then the next few years bro there's gonna be like four over four billion active users have to be different just put in the word you know what I notice is the way to your right the exhales that's what I said like the back of you it looks like a coffee bag like yeah you look like some premium coffee I guess that remember that focus on boy and that she came out Friday that was like the most hated song everywhere it's [ __ ] comedian check how many just like sounds now Friday cuz I remember had over Oh [ __ ] all I know is that the most disliked video all I know is that the most disliked the video is like one built on one billion I think

edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis strain reviews so today we are going to be reviewing grim dj o g i'm not sure if you guys can see that it doesn't want to focus today by copper state farms and this i purchased at soulflower tempe i know sometimes you guys will see this listed as being grown by soul or you might see some strains out there saying that they are being grown by copper state farms copper state farms is basically just one of the grows that provides um seoul their cannabis so like seoul is producing cannabis under the name copper state farms kind of my understanding if there's anybody from solar copper state you guys can clear that up but anyways if you guys are like me have never tried out grim dj og let's go ahead and talk about it so grim or it's otherwise known as grimace is a strain that was made from face off og number four cross with purple urkel um that is grim grimace is what the strains name is um so i'm guessing this dj og would be like maybe dj short was the one who came up with these genetics um so maybe what i'm figuring this is across is is a cross between grim and og kush so grimace you know is is more of like a sativa dominant hybrid it's a 75 25 and og kush is kind of a 50 50. so i'm guessing this is gonna be honestly more like a balanced hybrid is kind of what i'm getting uh you know what i'm guessing it's going to be like but before we get into it let's go ahead i'm going to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out then we're going to take a look at it together and get this party started okay so you guys just had a chance to check out this grim dj og what do you guys think of it let me know in the comments below um i really apologize these are some popcorn buds you guys this sack this eighth was only 30 bucks it's considered their gold tier they have gold excuse me silver gold platinum and diamond tier over there at seoul flowers so this is like only their second best that they offer so i don't have really really high hopes but to be honest you guys i mean when i you know let's go ahead and pop the top you guys saw those were popcorn buds and that was what i was kind of getting at is i apologize that these were popcorn buds but believe it or not you guys this is what's crazy this stuff is like it it smells like og like it smells like og kush it's not super strong don't get me wrong where i'm saying like oh it's so so strong but like straight out of the jar i'm actually getting that pushed smell which is shocking this is actually it's hysterical because this looks just like an og bud structure really dense like pine coney kind of um buds and like those short orange hairs that hug right up against the bud that's a classic og bud structure so honestly i think i might be surprised by this you guys i mean looks wise it's that prototypical lime green here is the you know the buds that i just dumped out and let me just show you one this was one of the ones i was gonna photograph um and actually you know what i might have actually used this one in the photo to be honest now that i'm sitting and thinking about it i think this is the one that i did take the picture of i took a few buds out and i was trying to find the biggest ones but yeah this this bud i mean it's got a little excess leaf material on this particular bud none of the other buds have that the only thing is like this stuff really doesn't have a lot of trichomes you guys are like the trichomes that are there are just like you know kind of hidden they're not super super pronounced um but like that light lime green color real dense butt i mean again this looks like a classic o.g kush bud structure and honestly it smells like og because i'm shocked at all that this has any smell and the buds look you know look good honestly i mean i think they look good all things considered like i shouldn't say good they look okay they don't look great but they don't look bad i mean this is a 30.8 you guys less than 10 bucks a gram so i'm excited to try this out honestly like really really excited to try this out because the budget if we can find good budget ganja i'm i am all about it i will promote it all day if copper state pulls through with some good ganja you know this is unbiased so i don't care if the the sac was free um or it was you know 100 eight and these are unbiased reviews you guys so today i'm going to be enjoying this out of my air riser extreme q you guys just saw it went from 375 to 374. but i have it set to 375 probably just cooled off when i lifted it up right there so this bad boy is set to 375 degrees there i'm gonna put my male end which has got the screens in it just got those cleaned as you guys can see just perfectly clean that one's gonna go into the vape itself i've got another male end that doesn't have a screen on it that is going into my triple filtered scientific inhalations triple filter bubbler so right here this is the down stem right there that actually has a little notch in it that would you can hold some carbon in there believe it or not and carbon would actually catch ash that would get into the second chamber which is basically just where our purified water goes you guys see that um but since i am not smoking this today and we're vaping it there won't be any ash getting into that purified water i am going to go ahead and i've left the opted to leave the carbon out today and i have just used the second chamber which is the purified water in the third chamber which i've got as always my organic cotton filter in there to filter out any remaining impurities from this bud so if you guys are ready let's go ahead fire up this grim dj og and see what it's all about you guys wow great great first rip so flavor profile i'm getting a subtle sweetness i'm getting some of that pine from the kush in there i am also getting some like clean fresh linen taste as well and honestly you guys i felt that coming on towards the end of the rip so like i was shocked that i felt it coming on i mean for a first rip to actually uh to feel anything that's amazing so i'm diving back in for the second rip let's see how this flavor profile develops wow you guys it's coming on honestly strong like i'm not gonna lie i mean that was huge that was a huge rip i'm literally feeling it coming on right now so like honestly i have a feeling this it will probably be potent medicine i'm not positive about that this might have just been initial effect so i want to see how this develops so what i'm going to do is i'm going to finish out this bowl and flavor-wise just so you guys know that one was a little more like i was getting a little more of the plant matter um still some of the pines still some of the sweet but more plant matter like kind of earthiness now is the flavor that i'm getting a little clean fresh linen like clean tasting on the back end but like those are the flavors that i'm getting right now so i really hope that this flavor um stays smooth and the actual flavor you know stays throughout the bowl i really hope it doesn't go to leaf matter real quick i mean that was the second rip i'm i'm seeing it already leaning towards that way so i'm keeping my fingers crossed it doesn't go that route and it's just developing as we blaze this so we'll see what happens there we'll see how the potency goes but while i am finishing out this bowl i'm gonna bring the stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under a 25 times magnification macro lens you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this stuff so here it comes now all right so here is the grim d j o g you guys from copper state farms and honestly you guys this has got that just neon green light light green coloration and then honestly a really nice proportion of these bright orange hairs they're not super long not super thick they really hug as you guys can see really right up tight up against the butt there definitely a little bit of excess leaf material there but honestly certainly not too many uh you know excess leaves there certainly it was like looks like it was trimmed right up to the bud there but like overall honestly a decent amount of trichomes not super covered in trichomes but like overall it's not that bad it's it's pretty good looking stuff all right so what did you guys think of this grim dj og under that macro lens you guys so to me under the macro lens i mean i really think like it looked good i don't think it looked bad um now it didn't look unbelievable and it certainly wasn't blowing me out of the you know water or anything you know i think my big problem with this stuff in the looks department um is that there's just a lack of trichomes you know that is a huge problem for me to not have bud that doesn't have trichomes i mean you guys bud's supposed to have trichomes um that's just the way this goes you know so um there's a lot i want to talk about with this strain i mean and honestly like this is one of the few strain reviews that just kind of really surprised me and it really surprised me in like kind of a bunch of different ways um you know from literally the look the smell the taste and the potency so all of these reviews i do i give a rating out of 10. the scale is basically that 10 is broken down into four different categories the ones that i just listed the look the smell the taste and the potency or how effective this medicine is and each of those respective categories can earn 2.5 points each in its individual category you know hopefully comprising of 10 out of 10. i mean we still have not seen a 10 but that does not mean they're not out there that does not mean we have not had them in the past they know what they look like i know what they are you guys so let's go ahead and dive right into this uh breakdown and i'm gonna start by talking about the look or the bag appeal of this um grim dj og so uh since i'm gonna do that i want it fresh on your mind so i'm gonna bring it up on the screen one last time for you guys to check out and then we'll go ahead and get right into this all right you guys so you've seen it multiple times here's the deal let's go ahead and chat about it out of 2.5 i'm going to give this a 1.5 you guys it's got that light lime green color bright orange hair that hug right up against the butt i mean they're real short they they really they hug right up against the bud um you know the leaves were trimmed right up to the bud not really any excess leaves i've gotta you know knock at a point for the popcorn buds being all popcorn buds are you know half a point but even then i won't even take that half a point out but i'm going to knock a full point it really is what's going to happen for the no lack of trichomes i mean you guys you've got to have weed that has trichomes and looks really really crystally this stuff just really doesn't trichomes are not popping on it you guys saw it under the macro lens trichomes are just not popping so i'm going to give this a 1.5 out of 2.5 which i still think is respectable to be honest in the smell category that's where this stuff surprised me you guys it's not real strong but it's like you could tell it's trying you guys and honestly i'm gonna give it a a two because it's like the smell is there and i like the smell that's there and when you break it up that smell definitely does come out more and it's just that classic og smell it's kind of like a sweet og is kind of the smell that i'm getting um but it's subtle on this it's really not like loud and in your face it's not gonna fill up a room by any means you know again i really gotta stick my nose in this jar you know to um to really get that but again a two you know a two out of uh a two on a 2.5 for the smell category i think that's amazing as well in the taste department that kind of let me down you guys i'm gonna give it a 1.5 the best taste and flavor was literally that first rip sadly and the second rip too but like um third it just kind of like went more it wasn't like leafy by any means but it just went to more of an earthy type flavor and then um it kind of lost all of its sweetness and uh the pine flavor as well that i was reporting originally um that kind of died off it went to that like earthy clean linen and then just kind of faded and fizzled but it was like it was clean and it was smooth throughout the smoking process and honestly when i was smoking it it was really really heavy um like it was it came on really quick and really really strong it's hitting like a hybrid honestly it's it's very much like a hybrid i'm not even gonna say that this is like on the sativa side um which i know grimace leans on the sativa side which is i'm pretty sure you guys go rewind and watch what i said at the beginning of the video i think this is going to hit like a hybrid it's hitting just like a hybrid i mean my body is kind of um you know chilled and mellowed out my mind is actually also kind of chilled and mellow out um so you know maybe like for people with like i mean my body might just be chilled out because i've gotten a lot of exercise already today um you know so like somebody with like body pains and stuff that's really using stuff for like you know strong strong um you know medicinal uh effects you know for for chronic pain you guys this might not be quite strong enough for you because this is more of like a heady um stoney than a like body uh so yeah more cerebral than it is um you know in the body as far as the effects go you know so it might not uh put you down but honestly um uh you know i i i'm sitting here and like now i'm talking about stony i'm like i'm getting confused you guys so the potency i'm gonna go ahead and um i'm gonna give it a 2.0 in the potency but i don't think i even finished giving you guys my final rating on the taste department and again that just shows like so no [ __ ] you guys i mean honestly uh from for a thirty dollar eighth it's like getting me to forget stuff you know like jesus christ you guys so but in the taste department let's go back to that um i'm only going to give this a 1.5 because this stuff kind of died out on me a little prematurely i mean it was smooth and everything like that but i'm only going to give it a 1.5 which again i still think is respectable and then i'm gonna give it a two in the potency as you guys just saw me jumping ahead of myself there um which brings us to a seven and it's gonna get a dank recommendation shockingly enough and honestly here's the thing you guys i've gotta make this seven clear okay i'm gonna make this real clear because i've got that kind of rubber bandy head high that i'm not super a super fan of and i think this high is gonna kind of die quickly like the potency i gave it the benefit of the doubt like i would have probably rated this typically about a 1.5 in the potency category i honestly think a 1.5 is fair in the uh potency category for like for what this stuff is but the reason i wanted to give the two i mean even though i got a little stoney there um is because this is budget ganja you guys 30 bucks for an eighth of this stuff like i'm sure if you guys are buying this in quantity they're gonna give you a discount you know if you buy a quarter if you buy a half or whatever so like shockingly enough if you can pick up you know eights of this stuff for 30 bucks or like you know whatever a quarter for maybe uh it goes down to 55 bucks or whatever and then you know a half is like 110 or 100 you know maybe even for a half i don't know what the price is um i haven't checked but like that's a really good deal if you're just looking for some budget stuff like truthfully you guys this wouldn't be like my everyday smoke this would be kind of like stuff that i would roll up jays with when i go out and i'm with friends you know but like you know to vape it and just have a sesh i mean honestly 30 bucks you guys really cheap and it's it's it's clean for the most part i mean this isn't like i'm not gonna go and like put this on the level by any means you guys i'm sure this is just outdoor grown or greenhouse grown at best honestly but you know even at that like 30 bucks you guys this is a steal so this stuff would be considered dank you guys even those popcorn buds but you know i take everything into account okay so it's popcorn buds if it's 30 so you know you gotta gotta look at everything here so um for the grim djog that's gonna get our dank recommendation at a 7.0 um if you guys have tried this definitely let me know um what you guys think of it and again you know i saw this is labeled by copper state farms um so that is you know and i know that copper state farms represent seoul vice versa so um you know i'm curious to try some other copper state products if their budget and honestly um you know the other two soul reviews i did were not too hot but like this one really surprised me you guys especially in their second gold tier so um you know if you guys see this and you're looking for some budget ganja go ahead and pick yourself up some of this but if you guys want to see anything reviewed definitely let me know in the comments below but until the next one you guys take care of yourselves and one another and i will see you guys soon [Music] peace", "OCn_NkLKki4": "what up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis strain review so today we are going to be reviewing oh gee pie breath by soul flower so if you guys are like me have never tried og pie breath let's go ahead and chat about it this is a slightly indica dominant hybrid it's a 60 40 on the indica side um and it is a cross between cherry pie that has then been crossed with a cross of og kush and og kush breath so og kush and og kush breath those have created a strain and then that strain was then crossed with cherry pie to make up this o.g kush excuse me og pie breath i should say i almost got uh confused there you guys so i am excited to try this strain out today since this is a new one for us but before we get into it i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out and then we're gonna take a look at it together all right so you guys only one nug today i left the popcorn buds in the actual jar here we have this huge knob that like this is a straight up rock you guys that i photograph and this is the one that you guys were looking at in the picture there um and i'm just getting out of the way so it hopefully focuses on the bud but anyways you guys let's go ahead and chat about it here okay you guys so this stuff is kind of like just like a typical green coloration it looks light you know like under this light like light green but it's not it's actually kind of dark or green um i can tell you for soul flower this has the most crystals of any of the bud that we have tried from soul flower um to date which is shocking um these orange hairs are really short they're like hugging up towards the bud and i mean they're they're pretty bright um you know as far as coloration goes and let me just open this jar here and see how some of these other nugs look yeah i mean it's not super turpy as far as like uh excuse me crystally um you know but i mean i'm honestly surprised by these terpenes you guys like this smells it smells good it smells like kind of like a sweet kush so it's like it's it's funny at first when i was smelling this um you know and this said oh gee pie breath right i was wondering if this was a cut of some like um wedding cake or a chair you know cherry pie or whatever i've tried a couple different pie wedding pie i've tried as well but it smelled a little like wedding cake with a little bit of sweetness and then the cushy kind of like piney like heavy undertones are there on the back end and honestly those i really really dig um and i mean i'm guessing this stuff was run through a machine so like here is the full sack you guys i mean this this one bud was great um these other buds are kind of like popcorn looking buds and it's not again it's not the worst looking bud i'm guessing it just went through an auto trimmer i'm guessing this was probably like either outdoor grown most likely outdoor grown greenhouse at the very best definitely not indoors we know that for sure um but i'm excited to get into this you guys honestly i really like that terpene profile in mind you it's not super loud and banging as far as um like the aroma it's not going to stink up the room but honestly when i stick my nose in this jar it's flavors that i want to try and see if they translate to the um actual smoke of this or in my case the vape of this because you guys know what's coming here today i'm going to be enjoying this out of my air riser extreme q desktop vaporizer i got this bad boy set to 375 degrees fahrenheit there i'm gonna take the end with the whip and the screens on it i just cleaned those out you guys can see this is like literally perfectly clean um that end is going in that i've got another male end okay that one doesn't have a screen on it you guys that one is going into my triple filtered scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler you guys um this is a great great piece the first chamber here is actually in the downstem it's very difficult to see there you go kind of see where that fat little um knobby looking you know penis is you guys that's where carbon goes that would catch the ash that would get into this water but since we're not gonna have any ash in the water today which is just our second filtration stage of the purified water i've gone ahead and left the carbon out and then in the third and final stage we've just got an organic cotton filter to filter out any remaining impurities that might be left in this og pie breath by soul flower so if you guys are ready i am ready to get into it so let's get your pieces fired up mine's ready to go and let's start your engines and get this party rocking okay so first things first you guys that was not a very dense rip with vapor so it was hard to report a lot on the terpene side of things just yet the flavors that i got so far are honestly just like a nice subtle sweetness i'm getting um that cherry pie flavor like that's the flavor that i'm getting originally right now on the tip of my tongue so let's see how it develops on this second rip okay so you guys that was really smooth like when i say it was really smooth it was very very enjoyable to puff like the flavor and terpenes are not super loud and strong i'm literally i'm not getting anything from the kush side of things it's all flavor is coming from that cherry pie so i'm getting like the subtle sweetness which is again to me it's kind of got that cake or pie flavor if you're familiar with those and a little bit of that cherry so just not super fruity but just a little sunny fruit uh subtle fruitiness um as well so i'm curious to see if this flavor profile develops here as i puff this bowl those first two rips were very enjoyable so i'm curious to see if that sustains throughout this bowl but while i am finishing out this bowl i am gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under a 25 times magnification macro lens so here it comes now all right so here is the og pie breath by soul flower and you guys this has got kind of just a really really generic green coloration to it these uh hairs just hug so tightly up against the bud that's actually very typical on an og kush hybrid strain to see that same bud structure that you would see on like an og kush um not super super crystally you guys can see the terpenes really aren't super popping on this stuff and it's just like so dense this is like a little marble of a bud um leaves were trimmed right up to the bud so they did a good job with that at least um definitely not the best looking bud we've ever you know seen on the channel but by far not the worst either okay you guys so what did you guys think of this o g pie breath you know it's this is tough you guys for me because honestly i don't think this is like terrible looking ganja you know um i really really don't you guys heard me talking about it i mean i just think that we've seen better you know and there's a lot of stuff that i really i want to talk about with with uh this strain with you guys i mean it had ties it's had its lows and there's a lot going on with this og pie breath um now you know i'm pretty sure you might also be seeing this sold or labeled as a copper state farms so i'm going to probably even label this in the description as soul flower slash copper state farms because i'm seeing it sold by copper state farms as well which again they kind of share that same name but you guys i want to give you guys my final run down and rating on this stuff i mean the effects i'm feeling right now are honestly kind of minimal i'm not going to lie to you guys i don't want to sit here and [ __ ] you guys um you know it's it's like a hybridy very minimal effect um but i want to kind of and i'll go into my my rundown on the actual potency and how effective this medicine is and all the effects and all that good stuff but i'm going to give you guys my rating out of 10 and how i break down that rating and how i got to and derive that rating is i break all of these reviews down into four different categories the categories are look smell taste and potency you're familiar if you guys have been on the channel before each of those categories can earn up to 2.5 points each in its respective category hoping that these strains add up to you know a total of 10. now i'm going to tell you guys if you guys have not heard about what happened with my experience when i was at soulflower go ahead and check out a couple reviews ago i did my very first um review for the orange sherbet which came from soul flower so go back and check that out but like i ended up with one of these thirty dollar eights you guys um as part of my first time patient you know buy one get ones or whatever i typically wouldn't buy flour like this so it typically wouldn't even be rated on our channel because i just kind of consider it snickel as it already kind of defines itself in this nickel category sometimes you do find hidden gems though and we know that but regardless i'm rating this unbiased i'm rating it based on what i think it is especially in this category i'm kind of going to cut this a little bit of benefit of the doubt just based on that but i want to start by talking about the looks or the bag appeal of this strain so because i want to start by talking about that i'm going to bring this stuff up on the screen one last time for you guys to check out and then i'll go ahead and give you guys my final rundown on this stuff all right here's the deal this og pie breath when it comes to the looks i was honestly i was between a 1.5 and a 2 and i think i'm gonna just give him the 1.5 honestly because when you don't have bud that like is in my opinion like there's there's some trichomes on this stuff you guys i mean and maybe it deserves it too but i'm still like you know it's tough because it's like it's not bad looking bud and i don't want to make you think that it's bad looking bud by any stretch of the imagination but it's like we've just seen so much better um that it's just tough to see something like this that's kind of just lacking it's like you know it's just kind of generic to me and i mean it's not bad i'm not saying that this looks like bad butt it doesn't look like bad bud it's just really generic there's not a whole lot to it that i'm like oh you know this stuff is like crazy looking or it looks amazing it looks good i mean and you know maybe i do give it a 2 in the looks department as opposed to a 1.5 but you know it's going to mess up my whole rating if i do that honestly you guys because my final rating i think is really is what this stuff should be so yeah i'm going to go ahead in the looks department you guys i'm gonna give it a 1.5 it really doesn't matter honestly um at the end of the day you know no let me give them the benefit of the doubt this was a big bud that they gave me i'm shocked that i got that in the thirty dollar thirty dollar eighth i'm going to give the look a two honestly it's not as bad as i'm making it out to be so let's go ahead i'll i'm happy to give them the benefit of that you guys i'm gonna give them a two i know i was where i was at before with this but like i'm gonna give it a two um and the smell honestly you guys i also wanna go ahead and give it a two because i really like the smell of this stuff i really really do like it was it was good um and in the taste taste so i mean a two and a two that's really good for a thirty dollar eight that's like unbelievable when you go to the taste now and the flavors that i was getting just so you guys know to remind you again and the smell is like a cakey a tiny bit of that cherry is cutting through but i'm getting like a subtle cakey and then again beneath it all i'm still getting some of that pine flavor from the kush now the taste it didn't really cut through you guys it didn't translate um i personally am gonna go ahead and i'm gonna give it a 1.5 in the taste department terpenes were really you know they were lacking in this stuff you guys um there really wasn't man maybe that's where i have oh you know what i'm gonna go ahead and okay just i want to clarify this just so that i had to even out this review um this stuff is smooth like it is smooth and honestly you probably won't have any problems smoking it and like it you'll probably enjoy smoking it but there's not really any flavor and because there's no flavor and it's just kind of earthy it's like man i gotta i know i'm gonna i'm gonna stick with what i originally had i'm gonna give it a 1.5 i don't think it was a complete failure and it was really smooth um a 1.5 out of 2.5 is what i'll give it so right now it's got a 5.5 you guys for a snickel strain um you know that i thought was snickle going in this is shaping up to be pretty good the problem is you guys in the potency department this stuff was just lacking it really was not potent i'm not really feeling any effects a little bit of a head effect um so i'm only going to give it a one in the potency department so this is going to get a 6.5 and it's going to get a thumbs down and a snickel but to be honest you guys i'm not joking like if you're looking for some budget ganja like that's all you're looking for is budget ganja for 30 bucks for an eighth and i know they sell like real cheap halves of this stuff and then real cheap quarters and stuff like for even less than 30 um if you you know multiplied it by two or four or whatever it is um you know it's not a terrible strain it just doesn't have a lot to write home about i mean personally i would go for some of the grim dj og that copper state and seoul put out over this which is what the last review that i straight uh the last train review that i did that was a bit better um in you know a couple different respects than this one was um but you know a 6.5 for a snickel strain is like you know i would say this would be something that you know i would recommend if you're really on a budget and if they don't have any of that grim dj og over at seoul or you know selling from copper state i mean but it's unfortunately it's gonna get the snickel thumbs down we're not gonna recommend this buds but i honestly i'm quite surprised and i'm quite surprised uh i'll be surprised if you know i try the strain again and they've worked on those potency issues and the taste and terpene issues because honestly if it had the potency this stuff would have been knockout um and you know really just that in and of itself i mean if it just really was strong it would be banging but unfortunately not going to get our recommendation from the og pie breath from seoul and copper state today from us but if you guys have any strains you guys want to see a review definitely let me know in the comments below but until the next one you guys take care of yourselves and one another and i will see you guys soon [Music] peace", "SBiNwQibNzQ": "we're outside of

we are going to be reviewing o g cush breath by true infusion now this is a brand new strain to the channel but true infusion is not so if you are like me and have never tried og kush breath let's go ahead and talk about it for a second this strain is an indica dominant strain with parent genetics that are supposedly derived from girl scout cookies the ever popular girl scout cookies so i am so excited to try this strain out today as true infusion is definitely well known on this channel for putting out great products so before we get into this review i'm going to bring it up on the screen for you guys to check it out and then we're going to take a look at it together okay so you guys just had a chance to check out this og kush breath what do you guys think of this stuff let me know in the comments below but the uh main nug that i actually pulled out to look at here is is this one and this one was one of the ones you guys actually saw pictured there let me get out of the way and see if this will focus on this nice little nug here so you guys i don't know if you can see this well enough it's still gonna focus on me sorry but anyways this is really leafy it's like really leafy you guys i mean i don't think they did a great job of trimming this bud right up to the leaf and i mean it's like it's frosty but it's definitely it's leafy like they didn't do a good job trimming this stuff you guys they just didn't um and that's unfortunate i mean and i'm gonna pour out these nugs you guys so you guys can kind of see the size of these nugs that i got this is pretty typical for um an eighth of true infusion product and honestly you guys i'm not super impressed with the size of these nugs that they have and the smell is there it's good it's actually it smells like o.g kush is what it smells like you guys um there's like a little something extra though a little bit of sweetness it's actually it's pretty nice um from the smell perspective not super strong though the chirps are not really really loud but like i'm getting kind of like oh sorry i just kicked the camera i'm getting kind of like an og kush sweet you know terps on this stuff um so man i'm excited to jump right into this thing because i need an indica dominant strain right now so let's hope that it is true to the lineage here so today i'm going to be enjoying this og kush press from true infusions out of my air icer extreme q desktop vape as you guys see it sets 375 degrees fahrenheit and then i am feeding the extreme q vape so i'm gonna put the male end which has just been cleaned out you guys see that male end is gonna go into the vape and then i'm gonna put an another male end that actually has a built-in screen a glass screen in it into my you guys already know what's coming scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler the first chamber there which sits in the down stem that's where carbon goes but no ash is going to get into this second chamber because we're vaping this today so i've left that first chamber empty but we've got some brand new purified water in the piece as well as as always an organic cotton filter in the third chamber there to filter out any remaining impurities but true infusion is pretty good about that so this should be some clean clean vape so you guys if you're ready i'm ready let's go ahead and try out this and see what this og kush breath is all about okay so the first trip you guys really did not produce much vape so i'm diving back in for the second rip because i didn't really get much so there's not a lot to report all right a much bigger rip that second one and wow you guys that was smooth smooth smooth but these terps are real subtle like really subtle you guys like i'm getting kind of like a sweet cushy flavor like a sweet piney but the sweet is actually more prevalent than that kush flavor like but but maybe only from like a 60 40 split so i'm curious to see if this flavor develops or how the taste kind of continues develop as i get deeper into this bowl but while i'm doing that i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under a 25 times magnification macro lens so you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this stuff okay so here is the og kush breath by true infusion and you guys i absolutely love those bright orange hairs they're not super thick but they are bright and this is definitely got you know some good trichome coverage but honestly you guys look at how leafy this stuff is like that is the first thing that i'm thinking is if they had done a better job trimming this stuff we would have seen that nice blood structure exposed but instead it's being completely hidden by all of that extra leaf matter on this bud but you know there's definitely a good proportion of crystals to hairs but certainly not the best we've seen from true infusion okay so you guys just had a chance to check this stuff out up close and personal i'm so curious to find out what you guys think about it i mean to me personally you guys is stuff is just way too leafy it really really is i don't know if they you know just did a bad job trimming this stuff or what but it's just too damn leafy for me um but i just finished having some of it there's a lot i want to talk about there were some highs there were some lows everything in between so i rate all of these strains out of 10 the way i break down that rating is based on the smell excuse me the look the smell the taste and the potency or how effective this medicine is so since i want to talk about the look or the bag appeal of this stuff first i'm going to bring it up on the screen one last time since it's fresh in your mind still from the macro lens i'm going to bring up the regular photo of this stuff one more time for you guys to check out before i give you guys my final rundown on this og kush breath by true infusion okay so let's go ahead and let's talk about it you guys it's not like terrible looking bud but if i got to give this 2.5 points or i can rate it out of 2.5 points in the looks department i'm honestly i'm going to give this a wand you guys because it really there's a couple things that come to mind okay it's a little bit leafy and like you know to me there's i i see some yellowing here on some of this these here's a leaf that's like yellowing on it which i mean that indicates that it didn't uptake all the nutrients properly actually that just flaked off so to be honest let's not say that but like all in all it's just like there's nothing super redeemable it's like just old it's leafy bud in general um and it's like it's just generic looking there's nothing really stand out about this stuff so i'm going to give it a 1 out of 2.5 honestly in the looks department but where this stuff redeems is in the smell department it's not super strong so don't think it's super strong but like that cushy flavor is there you guys i'm going to go ahead and give it a 2 out of 2.5 in the smell department in the taste category i am going to go ahead and i'm going to give it a 1.5 okay i honestly was kind of teetering between a 1 and 1.5 a 1.5 because this stuff was smooth there's no question about that it was buttery smooth medicine but it really lacked in terps and the flavor that it did have went away almost damn near immediately like that second third rip you know was kind of like the max and then it was just all downhill from there so i'm only going to give it a 1.5 out of 2.5 which is still not terrible but can be a lot of room for improvement and then the potency category i want to let you guys know this stuff tested out at 18.21 active thc 20.96 total cannabinoids in this but anything that's hovering about 18 you know percent 18 19 if it's below 20 it's just not ultra potent stuff it's not like the it doesn't do nothing but it's just not ultra potent so i'm gonna go ahead and you know it's funny i'm gonna go ahead and i think i want to give this one in the potency category to be honest because i'm not really getting many effects up from this stuff and you know that's kind of disappointing because i really thought that this stuff would at least you know gosh yeah i'm gonna give it a one honestly in the potency category i don't think this is really it's not giving me any type of indica effects and it's not it's just not really heavy it's not really sedative um a little bit of a head high you know but i would go ahead and i feel comfortable honestly giving this a one so if you've been tallying that up it's a one in the looks category it's a two in the smell category so that's up to three and then a 1.5 in the taste so up to 4.5 um damn and then a one in the potency a 5.5 yeah this og cush breath is not going to get our recommendation you guys i mean honestly i thought it would be at least a six i mean i think it honestly does deserve at least a six you guys i don't think this is gonna be a fair rating if i give it that that low something needs to come up a little bit because it deserves a six i'm going to be honest it really does this isn't that bad i mean so to say that it's that bad like i don't know if i want to put yeah let's you know what i'll put in a 1.5 in the looks category so i'll change the one to a 1.5 so that'll be a 1.5 in the looks category a 2 in the smell category a 1.5 in the taste category and a one in the potency category and that'll be a six out of ten i think that's very fair for this stuff honestly i think that's a fair unbiased review for this stuff it's not awful i'm just not gonna recommend it i'm gonna consider it a snickel because it's like there is better stuff out there now mind you i picked this stuff up at jars dispensary this was labeled as the diamond tier it now they have a private reserved here above the diamonds here and to be honest i think this was sold to me in the perfect category where it belongs is that's probably where this belongs this is not low-grade [ __ ] by any means you guys but it's like but it's definitely not up to the regular true infusion quality and i mean jar sells it in their jars because they sell it in the deli style they don't come in those pre-packaged which probably saves them a little bit of money they pass the savings along to you the consumer so yeah i mean a 6 out of 10 i think from the og kush breath not gonna get our recommendation but honestly like you know if they do a little bit of work with this strain get this train up to standard i would totally try this stuff again if they retest this stuff on their next run and it tests out higher the terpenes you know uh terpene profile on this also was run you guys it had a total terpenes of 2.27 and most of it was coming from that pionee um was about one one percent was coming from the pioneer and then i'm seeing about another one from uh or half point six four percent from limonene and then mercy um is point five so yeah that's where that sweetness is coming from you guys so yeah we're pretty much dead on it's funny i didn't even see that until after when i was looking at these uh testing results so six out of 10 from the og kush breath from true infusion for us so let me know what you guys think of this stuff if you try to leave your comments below and let me know and if there's something you guys want to see reviewed definitely let me know about that as well in the comments below but with that being said until the next one you guys take care of yourselves and one another and i will see you guys soon

Pham and welcome back so check it out for this video right here I have some different flour for you guys I'm going to show you guys now all this flour right here is different price points this is all different levels of prices some of them actually might be around the same level of pricing but we have you know the more budgeted stuff down here going all the way up to the more expensive stuff and I'm gonna show you guys this as a comparison video so you guys can't compare the really cheap stuff to the really really dank bom top-shelf stuff and then that way you guys kind of got a good overview of what the flour scene is like here in a state of Oregon okay so if you're coming to Oregon if you already live in Oregon this is a great video to kind of give you a good layout of what to expect you know what I mean if you're coming here and you're like hey how much money do I set aside that what do I want to get blah blah blah blah this video can help you so without further ado let's just get into it okay guys so first up let me set some of these ones aside because we're gonna get to those those are not where we're going to start off we're gonna start off with the lowest the cheapest ones and work our way up so the cheapest one I have right now here is this misty mountain days coming in at 16 percent THC this is an indica and this is by green source Gardens okay now this right here runs about four dollars and fifty and over 4.4 dollars and 20 cents sorry so this is a four dollar 20 cents a gram so just imagine what you could get for like a quarter or even an ounce of this stuff because you can't pick up ounces here in Oregon so but anyway that is what it looks like okay [Music] that's what that's what we're dealing with for the $4 20 cent section really cheap really really budgeted I didn't want to go really lower than this even though they do have stuff that is lower than this they do have stuff that's like three dollars a gram two dollars a gram stuff like that but you know this is just I figured you know this is pretty good budget like four dollars come on so anyway I'm gonna open this up so that's what you're dealing with okay [Music] okay not too bad I personally wouldn't smoke this just because that's my personal preference if you are somebody that's on a budget or you don't really give a [ __ ] you just want whatever you know you can get the most of most bang for your buck this is something that you should try out then okay if that's your preference if that's gonna work for you then more power to you however my personal preference I would not waste my money on something like this okay I don't smoke this kind of butter this is really really low grade Bud really really low grade but okay however it's not the worst I have had like nasty green bud that was just awful anyway up next this is at the seven dollar price range so seven dollars a gram so we jumped from four dollars to seven and this is Sookie's by Alta crest and this is a 50-50 hybrid which I kind of doubt that I don't believe that it's a solid 50/50 hybrid it's probably more like 60/40 or something like that anyway 23 percent THC with pretty much no CBD I mean it's going got a point one percent CBD so there you go that is that there's test date let's open it up and take a look at it alright alright so we're just gonna show this big nugget here or vamo it's really dry oh I just lost some of it I just lost a little chunk over here oh shut those right there anyway there's really dry guys this one's really I mean you guys could probably hear it it's just snapping dry and it's not bad I guess it's all I definitely stepped up from the $4 gram you know at least it's more of a dense nug let you know but that is the $7 section so that is what you're going to kind of expect if you're you know looking for that $7 budget-friendly strain you're gonna get stuff like that majority you might you might you might get lucky and find you know something here in Oregon from a certain dispensary that is really bomb at that price point but most of what you're gonna find at the $7 price point is going to be something along those lines okay now we're going to move up one more to the next tier which is I believe here this $10 yeah so we're gonna bring in the $10 ones alright so first up for the $10 actually you know what I'll do this one first actually since this one's opened here at the top we'll do this one first alright so $10 a gram this is probably let me just say this before I get into this $10 and up is probably as far as quality goes as far as good quality this is probably the best bang for your buck $10 now these $10 strains right here I'm about to show you would go like I've seen firsthand in places like California and Nevada I've seen strains just as dank as this if not a little less dank go for like 15 18 dollars a gram in those states so being able to get what I'm least three right here on a buck show you 410 that's phenomenal within itself okay can't beat Oregon prices telling you anyway so look at that this is the hypnotoad 20% THC headrush hills is the farm this is one gram and just look at that purpleness man look at that purple old [ __ ] I dropped it anyway let's do it pull these bad boys out of here oh look at that just beautiful nuts frosty as hell man yeah look at that frost on those nugs beautiful purple in there nice tints of green just what you want when you're looking for nugs and the smell I know you guys can't smell none of this but holy [ __ ] guys this smells great the terpenes are on point with this okay this is some really really good quality for ten dollars a grand okay same with this one this is a 10 gram one two when we open it here so this is the Donnie burger 13 okay you green no-till [Music] and again $10 a gram for this one and I mean just look at that Oh smells phenomenal it's very pungent guys as soon as you take it right out of the bag I mean just phenomenal smell just nice dense nuggets break up nice like if you're rollin blunts or something with this you'd give me you'd be the joint lovers and blunt lovers would love that flower right there it breaks up really nice all right so again Donnie burger 1325 percent THC and then here we go this is the garlic breath now this is probably one of my favorite strains out right now with the GMO if you ask me hey what are your favourite strains right now what what do you recommend uh it would either be the GMO or these garlic breath sorry this garlic breath or the garlic mince uh really I mean I just love stinky strains okay I really do I love that gasps that pungent nest that smell through the bag that's what I like that's what I look for now look at this is a big note look at that Oh beautiful how does one want you to know you're my favorite girl I didn't look at that nice big nug fire ten to ten dollars a gram again I'm telling you that's what to expect here in the state of Oregon okay now so those are the ten dollars set those over here now we're gonna move on to the 12 to $14 arrange now I have a twelve dollar one and then these other two or fourteen so I'm going to show you guys the twelve dollar one so this is the m4 twenty nine percent THC this is super dense that's like a rock I mean that is super dense guys smells great though smells really really good but super dense and just very nice lime bringing some bright orange hairs very nice bug like listen to that listen that listen sit yeah it's dense but so twelve dollars a gram twenty nine percent THC top shelf now we're moving to the last two which are these two $14 a gram and if you ask me my opinion right now they're not that much better than like these are like when I showed you guys these ones that are ten I mean they're almost there they're really not better okay they're kind of the same these just happen to be more expensive I don't know why oh I really don't maybe it's just the flour company or whatever but this is voyager number one from seven points oregon twenty nine percent THC with pretty much no CBD and i'm going to show you guys this 14 dollars a gram for this [Music] or get that nice snug again dents really dental if you you're liking those hard den snugs then you know you want to go for the 12 to $14 sections because that's where you're gonna get a lot of these dents nuggets the smells great phenomenal smell very chirpy very very chirpy I guess maybe that's why it varies in price why this is more expensive than the other stuff is probably because maybe it's more chirpy I don't know but then here we go another $14 gram one strawberry cream 25 percent THC again by seven points Oregon which is a good farm they make good product wash look at that beauty look at that beauty it's the cutie with the bootie I mean seriously though like just nice dense little little tents little very very little tents of purple in there you know just frost it as [ __ ] I mean it looks like somebody took like a salt shaker of tri Chrome's and just shook it all over this bud I mean just drenched it I mean it's super trike City here and I really like that I enjoy that again smells super good it's got like a fruity strawberry smell so that that's really good so there you guys go this has been a comparison video of the cheap budgeted stuff versus the more expensive stuff here in the state of Oregon now let me just end the video by saying this okay guys here in the state of Oregon this is kind of the norm of what you're gonna find at most dispensaries now there are gonna be some premier dispensaries I like to come from your dispensaries because they're more high-end so you will find stuff at those kind of dispensaries that are maybe like you know 16 to 18 dollars a grams stuff like that however this is what you're going to find add just your average basic dispensary that you're going to be visiting in your local town or wherever you're visiting a hatch or anything like that this is majority what you're gonna find and you're gonna find dank bud like this at good prices okay here in Oregon we have the cheapest weed in the United States okay I know there might be some people in the comment section that would like to argue that point maybe they're from Colorado and stuff where they also have cheap weed there as well but Oregon is the cheapest in the United States we have the cheapest and the best bang for your buck okay as you guys can see these $10 grand ones you can't like that's phenomenal that's phenomenal okay so I like I said I just want to do a comparison video show you guys comparing the budgeted stuff the cheaper stuff the the B stirs the whatever you want to call it the low end low grade cannabis versus the high grade you know top-shelf stuff you know that way you guys can get a good idea of kind of what it is you're dealing with here in the Oregon cannabis market okay now I've done a lot of videos on the flower here in Oregon I've done videos if you guys check my channel out I've done videos where you know it's the budgeted but a bunch of different cheap stuff I've done stuff what top shelf looks like here in Oregon I've done this video now that you know kind of compares the two so I'm going to be moving on to dams I got a bunch of dabs here we're going to be moving on to a bunch of different products and stuff like that that we're gonna be moving on to and I'm gonna go show you guys in the next video kind of a comparison of cheap dabs what are expensive dabs and then kind of doing the same thing where I'll show you guys comparison of both cheap and expensive dams

or the cinnamon or whatever other yeah when we when we was researching it it says they have taste of orange you know and cinnamon cinnamon hops but again tyson ranch super simple um branding of this tysonranch.com again you guys this is an indica it's kimoji and girl scout cookies so two palm strains actually i get a i get a sweet taste to it i have a sweetness to it really yeah and that's okay i mean i'm all making faces like you can have your own i mean yeah that's fine i mean if that's what you taste i really can't taste it you taste sweet there's a little sweetness in there it got a smooth taste this smooth hit it i'm gonna tell you that it got a smooth nice hit it like silk it's like silk it's smooth [Music] oh you guys the breakdown was super it was easy it was soft and it was nice and like easy to it was very sticky crumbly it wasn't sticky like that it was thick like that on the breakdown honestly i mean it had a stick to it but it wasn't like it was nice it was nice and easy to roll it to the back with it yeah cause i'm not gonna lie i mean i do love sticky bud but sometimes i'm like sometimes it's too sticky and it's just like damn like i can't even get this [ __ ] off my finger it's a nice nice it's very smooth i like that i like hot i like how the smoothness of it you don't get that sweet aroma no you know i'm not gonna lie no [Music] i do get a little hint of that lavender the lavender in there it's okay so when we were doing like a little bit of research on this it did say that there was going to be like a little lavender i don't know if it was like i don't remember things like the smell or the taste but i think it was more of like the they were saying like the aroma of it is well i taste it i do taste it it has like the lavender the cinnamon the hops and some orange but i do the aroma of the actual butt in the jar it was mild and you could smell a little gassy but it was mouth the taste of it to me is more of a have a subtle sweet taste to it but it's very smooth it's a nice smoothie so how do you kind of taste that so look guys we're going to go ahead smoke this for you yep and get high get high and roll up another one yeah and let you guys know how it how it make us feel [Music] so [Music] okay yeah it's not bad i feel right now my honest opinion on the tyson ranch toad it's a how i feel right now it's a balanced high like i'm i'm able to function i'm able to go out and and and um in the in the pop you know open population and um vibe out every people and still be able to know what's going on uh i'm nice i feel like it might be a creeper it could be a creeper definitely be a creeper on me you know like later as of right now how i feel uh i feel really good like i feel really good um definitely like a headache for me yeah i i don't feel like an indica like a downer i don't know yeah it definitely like yeah it doesn't work but um no this is yeah so far this is um it's a chill it's a chill okay it's got me feeling really good like um it's really good yeah i like it um so i mean i definitely like the way it looks i definitely love the way how it broke down um the highest chill i'm definitely gonna smoke another one after yeah it's a real good it's a real chill high i would definitely i think um it's worth the money yeah this was like how much 65 what tax was like 71 out the door at l.a it could be higher other places because of the thc depends where you go some people might want to upsell it you know but uh for the price that la cushes actually was a good price also they do they do discounts they have discount stairs too so you probably get a little bit cheaper than i did i didn't have my coupon card on me because they do coupon cards and stuff like that i paid it straight out the way it was but uh uh yeah i'm sure you probably go find deals if you can find deals i will go ahead and do that too but it's worth what i spend i would definitely recommend this i like it yeah the toad you guys yeah the toad by tyson ranch and i mean i feel like it's honestly my honest plan i think it's gonna be a creeper i i think it's gonna be a creeper and for 36 for the 36 point what 36.20 i think uh [Music] [Music] okay so uh 36.24 thc with the 42 uh total cannibal noise i think it's i think it's really good so yeah i'll go ahead and recommend this yeah it's good for the for the the money like what you think your opinion do you think that people should go out and spend their money on it i think for those of you who have not tried thai syringe definitely go out and try it it's a good high it's not a super heavy indica like he said um it doesn't have me too much in my thoughts like a normal indica would but i guess you could say yeah it's got me it's it's got me it's euphoric because it's gonna be a nice like you know feel right nice um element or vibe vibe and a nice little vibe but um yeah uh verb all right so it's your boy pompey this is free and you are watching we hi and we hope you stay

a review on it and i think it's [ __ ] garbage and it sucks that they got nipsey's name on it because i'm pretty sure that nipsey wouldn't like that weed he probably changed after he passed away

review by the way you know it's been a while since we've done these but we decided to do that in-house in store and treat you to what we got on our menu and right now we're about to pop off the insane gelato it's a cross between sunset sherbert then mint cookies and it's you know it's that fire it's that gas what can I say you know I'm not just saying it cuz it's here but I am saying it because it's here cuz we pride ourselves on having the quality flavors here for you this is you know pretty much got all the characteristics and traits of a gelato purple trichome ish and white ash and all that good goodness that you would expect when you blaze this in a joint or a blunt or whatever the hell you know you choose to do it at come down try some for yourself don't take my word for it even though my word is good for it you'd be [ __ ] up to not listen but this is the packaging it will be an insane packaging right here for the insane gelato this has been another strain alert presented by b-real TV and dr. green thumbs peace the [ __ ] out stay blazing we're gonna blaze some of this right now in st. gelato strain alert we're gonna fire this one up joined by a zone many do piano DJ Nels here we go hey listen Pedro gets at 9 for this one yeah that one was not as R ok if an ID for this role right here but that you know the roles not deal today it is the in st. gelato and the taste jumps off on like smacking you in the [ __ ] face you don't how like it's creamy you know what I mean in your own bus yeah and it's it's it it's got that [ __ ] gelato impact man I gotta tell about that for you can smell it right when you lit it very well when you lit it it's right it's sweet but not in a fruity way of sweet more like an ice ice cream yeah I always felt a lot oh it was like a good coffee week yeah for sure yeah let me ask you this do you think there's like we'd use if you could smoke with tea that's better better with teeth and better with coffee and vice versa yeah there's probably components like just how mango has an effect whenever you're high - up you're high there's probably affects or that's please and coffee and antioxidant yeah edgy like be triggered in your body chemistry I don't think so yeah I think I think like you know some some strings like you said I think gelatos were the ones that complements coffee and [ __ ] yeah that things like the og is more tourists like tea she like green tea yeah [ __ ] like that no I'm not like the black tea black tea I think that goes up in them you do like a citrus one with the tea to like a chain but not awesome or is there like I can't you can't do awesome get off the subject but this Jihlava that's one you know work I'm gonna be honest I used to think that these are names of these weeds was like a just a gimmick right but the gelato was actually one of the first strands to like prove to me that like this [ __ ] actually does taste like creamy it's like tinnitus there's a cream to three minutes to the electrodes to eat it's old me but there's a that it wasn't a give there's there's like clean sweet like you know like ice cream and pastry tight ship then there's the Jolly Rancher type of [ __ ] sweet like that you know it's like Tory [ __ ] like that you know that's like what oh she is in and this gelato and and stuff you don't like strange like gelato they're more creamy and in my opinion in my taste to me nice move it's smooth like you said then there's something our tarp yeah sour taste in your mouth or whatever yeah a lot of people love the gelato look this nice purple with the full of yeah and it's hard to pass it's hard to pass that joy yeah yeah body this to your head you don't want the tarps for your coffee like [ __ ] that are you good those don't eat the bread you smoke that with your coffee you know because it's it's like having a biscuit if I lose joint is becoming like four number over 1000 that's the move I mean that's what my fused coffee if Darren already hurt did they already have no like you could take a girl out for coffee in debt I don't know what it is Oh joints and I like my coffee coffee gelato juice it's kind of like a contrast there though because if you did yeah because you would have THC in the coffee which normally boosts you up so you're gonna have that yeah coaster ride of ups and downs right there you know like we take it yes and we drink it but I need this to go up and that's it go down it's like a balance in a lot of gelatos produced like by a bunch of different folks you know to me because there's a lot of people to do it now it gets really good in the halfway point of the joint like it tastes good and on the top of the joint but when you get halfway to it that's where that full flavor comes labor just clumps in like you know cracking now I don't know if you've explained this to people yet but but the whole insane in the house it does that mean that everything's crossed with insane OG or is just insane family is just insane this is just plain July yeah that is a July July biasing yeah do not go by insane it's so smooth but that's you know it gets you man yeah it's [ __ ] heavy that that's what we do we do

organic this one is their san fernando valley og kush this one here is sitting at 23 thc sfv or san fernando valley og kush is an indica dominant strain bred from crossing san fernando valley og and afghani and is said to feature an earthy piney gassy aroma this is the certified version of the classic california kush the terpene profile mostly consists of limonene uh beta myrosine transcarafleen and uh betta pinene simply bear is the only producer in the country to achieve the standards of an environmental farm plan in 2015 jessie mcconnell former co-owner of whistler cannabis co and peter dewig both experienced in organic growing joined forces and founded rubicon organics which is the producer of simply bear organic simply bear is located in the fraser valley delta bc grow in 125 000 square foot greenhouse facility basically when mother nature isn't cooperating they have a an led light system which is full spectrum simply bearer also has a proprietary organic living soil which is locally harvested and contains douglas fir bark worm castings kelp and fish meal simply bear manages every step of the process by hand and they 14-day cold room lights off hang dry the plants to ensure all buds are properly cured if you're looking to invest in simply bare organics they're under the parent company it's under it's either rubicon organics inc or vintages organics cannabis company inc so we'll have that on screen so this one here is packaged september 12th so super fresh okay so let's get a look at it here really like these lids and these just jars and the seal it's very easy to uh to open really pungent smell right off the bat okay now that we've learned a little bit about san fernando valley og kush and simply bear organics the last thing i got to do is test it out for a rating so i'll go do that and i'll be right back [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right guys uh after testing out the sfvog by simply bear organics san fernando valley og really really liked this one it burned really well it was very smooth strong effects the ash on it was very white uh super clean as you would expect with an organic product i guess the only thing on it was the the taste the taste was really good um i guess the only thing i wanted to mention was um i rolled the joint of it initially when i first opened the jar and then i put the rest of the flower in a glass jar with a two-way humidity control pack i think it was a boveda or an integra boost and um it actually tasted uh quite a bit better the next day not like uh astronomically um wasn't a huge difference but it definitely made a difference on the next day definitely a little bit more uh the terps kind of came out a little bit more like i said even without it it was still definitely a good flavor with all that being said i'm going to rate this one a 9.3 out of 10. really well done till next time guys", "2eQYQFCcAL8": "[Music] this is a farm this is highly active [Music] the plants that we go up intensively the synthetic supplies that living Organa's can imagine made it with nature what is up wonderful and amazing human beings smokers growers divers connoisseurs anybody watching this video I hope you having a wonderful day my name is Terrence and I'm here with mrs. highly active farms hi and today we're bringing you guys the official venom og strain review now this is grown widely at the farm but it's bred by humble seed company and this particular cut came from dark heart nursery so if you're in the California area you could get this exact cut go for yourself of course we grew it in organic living soil and without too much going on about it we're gonna go right into this bug test of course you know a couple things before that we got to do the smell test so getting it grinded up right now in the grinder these aren't even the top notes or anything or some of the lowers but still still should be a nice smoke of each I bet emoji before the concept of it this is venom og cross with Humboldt og and me neither actually it's my first time also are you a fan of oh jeez that's a yeah yeah meet you okay what do you think about the smell of the surgery orange thanks oh yeah those are some of the larger penises did you see yeah I'm a little bit of that gas and getting to very citrusy to sneak out your eyes very Swedish think again it's not like feel your skunky it's like you're at a very sweet it's very a very good OG honestly I'd say it leans more toward like you said like the citrusy side of the OG flavor that's earthy more citrusy a little bit of gas in there honestly as far as smell goes it smells like the dam here though gee you know everything everything looking for as far as smell next is the flavor test the most exciting part this is what we came for as far as growing goes to be honest you grew exactly like you know G grows talking you know a little bit slower on the veg a little bit smaller of a plant golf ball shaped nugs as opposed to a you know big full colas or donkey dick to some I call them a lot more of a golf ball shape but super resinous and Leighton flowers and Purple's up on us we didn't even have low temps really except at nighttime but uh yeah the colors came out really nice and overall she grew phenomenal if you've gone oh geez before she basically grows exactly like you'd expect in a group an OG to grow but without any further ado let's get into the flavor test I'm getting here did you want to get the first taste of this game of course really dancing on that but yeah it is good Elliot you said really really good stitches notes definitely a full ODU flavor you know that super Danko G hit you in the face type liver and I think you're right means when worked with the stitches when I think oh gee I think of three main flavors and smells I think gas citrus and earthy and different oh geez that feel like I think we in different ways this one definitely lean toward the citrus yeah I'm never gonna get tired of that flavor honestly I'd say it's one of those chains if you really you could really keep smoking and that really attire my tactic that I agreed I will say it's a little bit of a creeper you know you're gonna take those first couple hits be like oh I don't really know if I'm feeling it it tastes really good full body to the lungs denotes you feel like it should be potent and then all of a sudden right when you start to doubt it we're like a wrecking ball right to the face I can't even say words correctly anymore but it really comes to it really comes to show you what's up yeah I'm not really speaking clearly here but basically it's a creeper there's definitely got some of those uh you know there's later onset effects axis and then pakka's another oh yeah all right and let's smoke another boom yeah I gotta say as far as though jeez go Ben emoji is one of the [ __ ] with you Cvent emoji definitely pick that up especially if you're looking for an OG super nice strong classic typical OG butters have that part less interest og flavor those notes gas and everything is top it off nice then snugs also like I said the golf ball typical OGD shape next Purple's in there nice and frosty just all-around good boy as a as far as the rating goes I it was the best rating I could I don't have a scale for this or assistant because I tend to base exchange more off you know I think all strains have their qualities and I think this is a real good one for pain relief for nighttime for she gets relief wonderful for all those really good nice OG traits not great for functioning I wish you know heavy machinery or anything like that I keep this one more for after work nighttime strain or keep it you know micro dose it if you got to go through the day with it but definitely retain overall and if you're looking for an OG wonderful OD I definitely gotta recommend it reminds me of kind of the first time I had to be a classic cookie flavor and all that super good stuff as far as growing goes grows exactly like an OD so yeah thank you so much for watching that's about it for this chain review really hope you enjoyed this video was anything else I wanted to say about this eh that's right

[Music]", "Rga3l5hpJn8": "what up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis strain reviews so today we are going to be reviewing kosher kush by our friends over at house exotics now you guys know kosher kush is no stranger to our channel we have already tried and reviewed the growth sciences blend but the house exotics one is a brand new one to the channel so kosher kush is an indica strain that is a cross between kosher and the ever popular og kush so one of my favorite favorite strains of all time og kush this is a phenotype of that so let's go ahead and bring this stuff up on the screen so you guys can check it out and then we're gonna look at it together so what did you guys think this is some juicy looking stuff you guys exactly what kosher kush is supposed to look like so let's break open this bag and see what this stuff is all about what do you say hey now this house exotic did not come in the glass jar but the second i open up this bag boom og kush smell fills the room and a whole lee mackerel you guys i know you're not gonna be able to see it until we bring it up on the screen for a real close view but i'm gonna hide so it maybe viewfinder focuses on that bud for you i don't know but you guys this stuff is covered in thc classic pine cone bud structure so like this looks like just any type of og kush that you would get or cush type variety and the hairs are kind of short they hug the bud real well this was god was this seem perfectly manicured you guys i'm pretty sure to be honest just based on what i'm seeing this looks like it was trimmed by hand i don't think they ran this through a machine i am so excited to try this stuff out because gosh i i feel like we've had a few duds on the channel you guys back to back to back so let's go ahead and get this thing kicked off right so today we are going to be enjoying this kosher kush out of my air riser extreme q i've got this bad boy set to 375 degrees fahrenheit and that is being fed into my scientific innovations triple filtered bubbler no i am not sponsored by either of these companies remember i said unbiased at the beginning of this come on you guys come on so there is no charcoal in the first chamber here which is where ash would typically be caught but i do have some brand new filtered water um in this second filtration chamber as well as a brand new cotton filter to filter out any potential remaining impurities but honestly i don't think that they missed anything this looks like they purged everything out of this stuff so let's go ahead you guys fire up your jays your bloods your vape pens your vaporizers your pipes your bats your bubblers your bongs your rigs and let's get this party started so here comes the kosher kush by house exotics now oh my gosh so already and that was barely even any vape actually holy [ __ ] guys so a bit more vape than i thought it was gonna be classic kush flavor in my it's very subtle because you saw i didn't blow out a lot of vapor there but it was real smooth oh i got a tickle in the back of my throat um but that was like i just want to taste that piney flavor so i'm going back for more right now you guys you guys that like is already coming on strong it's probably because this has got some oh we love it a good thc content in this and i wanted to talk about that like these buds are really really small and packed in there you guys see i mean that was an eighth and it's like it's very very dense fence but but oh my gosh that flavor you guys classic kush flavor piney piney flavor it's like a little earthy man it is so delicious i can't wait to finish out this bowl but while i'm doing that i'm gonna bring it up on the screen for you guys to check out under a 25 times magnification macro lens so here it comes now so here is the kosher kush by house exotics wow you guys like look at how many crystals there are and what a perfect proportion of crystals to hairs in my opinion i mean this stuff is just absolutely so well done they manicured this just beautifully you could even see some of those lot leaves trimmed right up to the butt on this stuff this kosher kush looks dank all right so what did you guys think of this stuff honestly i thought it looked super bomb under that 25 times magnification you guys no joke like this stuff is legit i just got done firing it up and i'll tell you what i am fired up more like kind of fired down but like seriously you guys this stuff packs a punch it's great definitely indica leaning there is no question about it i mean you know again i am a regular user so my potency you know i need it to be ultra potent and this stuff is ultra ultra potent um but not as potent and honestly it's funny you guys i think for me it's the only thing that i think like this bud could be a little bit well you don't want to know let's i'm going to take that back let's go ahead and give this the full run down you guys i think i'm getting ahead of myself here so the effects are in the cleaning and this stuff definitely packs a punch you guys the smell is bomb [Music] like it's just that classic kush smell so i really really like that and the flavor was there it wasn't quite as strong as i was gonna hope it would be like with how strong this stuff smelled but it was still there don't get me wrong like i could still taste that cushiness there um and i would say let's go ahead and let's bring it up on the screen one more time because i want to talk about the look of it before i give you guys my final opinion okay so you've had a few chances to check it out and i'm gonna check it out again here i mean you know listen kush looks a certain way it's supposed to look a certain way and this looks like a classic kush like this pine cone looking bud you know this is what kush looks like you guys it always has looked like this you know and i've been doing this for a long long time so it really does look good could it look a little bit better of course it could look better you know uh there's very few strains that i'm like just absolutely blown away with by the look but like honestly this stuff if it packed a tiny bit more of a punch for me it would just be through the roof but like all things considered this is good medicine that house exotics is putting out and honestly you guys i've always been impressed with the house exotics products so i'm gonna go ahead and just i'm gonna give this an eight out of ten which is honestly unbelievable you guys for what we've been seeing on this channel like they've been like some threes and fours and fives i'm like oh my god is there no good bud you know and you guys this just goes to show you gotta pay for the good bud house exotics buds are a little more expensive and you're gonna pay more for them but they're better the quality is there these guys care about this medicine and you can tell when you are smoking it it's like this is grown with love you guys that's the difference that's the difference that's the ingredient that it's missing i mean somebody with a green thumb and whoever they've got as their head grow over there you know at house exotics you guys big ups i'm absolutely digging this stuff and i can't wait to try out more house exotic products so if you have any strains you would like me to try or you know you want me to pick up let me know in the comments below i would love to bring some new strains on this channel especially some new growers um so if you happen to know of any or you know want me to check out any just leave them in the comments below i am super stoked for all the reviews that are coming up but this one for me is going gonna be an eight out of ten honestly you guys [ __ ] as i'm sitting here i'm like i might have to give this an eight and a half and you know what you guys it's like because do i like this more than the grow sciences one and i think that's the question you know and god these are like almost a toss-up you know what i might do i might do now i'm like just getting an idea here and i'm gonna go off the cuff a little bit here this is not typical for our videos you guys maybe what i'll do is like a strain a strain off you know i'm pretty sure i still have some of the kosher crush i'm pretty sure from gross sciences um i'm going to see if i have some of that in mind you might have lost some terps but i'm pretty sure i've got it with a boveda packet those boveda packets keep the humidity regulated so if you guys don't use those you absolutely should between 58 and 62 humidity to keep your medicine fresh and keep terpene retention which is where all that flavor comes from absolutely pick up some of those boveda packets um but maybe i'll do like a strain off where i try both of these because like this stuff the onset of this stuff is like you know what no i'm not even gonna wait i'm gonna give this an 8.5 you guys i'm gonna give this an 8.5 honestly i i gotta give it i seriously think they out did the growth science and stuff now the growth sciences nug i think i had was a bit better from them but i'm going to check you guys and if i have that gross science uh if i have that growth science product i might do some sort of video where you know we bring both of them up on the screen and i do kind of like a challenge off and maybe you know what i'll do for that day is i won't smoke it out of the vaporizer or vape it out of the vaporizer i will use like a tube like a bong or something like that like get two clean bongs uh and then take you know a rip of one and a rip of another and see and i'm like i'm getting all happy and excited just thinking about it and all the new content i've got coming out for you guys but anyways [ __ ] they they you guys even in the review it went up half a point 8.5 this is some killer stuff if you guys see this kosher kush from house exotics floating around town scoop it up so until the next one you guys take care of yourselves and one another and i will see you guys soon peace [Music]", "NNQD4k3VQ0M": "what's up with y'all indian diver here i'm here by l.a out here for a week and this video is the thousand dollar main word

scorching hot sunday evening i'm recording your guys's monday indica review we've got some organic san fernando valley og kush from simply bear we're going to be tapping into today can't wait to see how this bud does and uh let's get into it you guys so that we can actually see how this bud turns out on the urban scale see you guys on the other side of this intro when we get into it [Music] welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we've got some simply bear organics san fernando valley kush so this came in with a t let's turn the sound off on this laptop there we go so this came in with a thc content of twenty three point four percent a cbd total of zero point one seven percent and it was packaged on june 24th 2020 which puts it at a really fresh button i'm actually really excited to tap into this and try it out so i have leafly's website pulled up here with all of the information we're going to rattle that off quickly and then we're going to get into the actual urban scale you guys so let's roll out quickly off and get into it so san fernando valley og kush not to be confused with his precursor san fernando valley og is an indica dominant strain spread spread bred from og kush genetics by cali connections by crossing a san fernando valley og clone with an afghani father and selecting for favorable traits over several generations the indica heavy san fernando valley og kush was born you could smell the og genetics in this one as its odors is commonly described as a strong lemon cleaner smell intermittent with pine intermixed with pine so let's hammer off the effects that you're likely to feel when smoking this so the top five feelings as voted on by the public are going to be relaxed euphoric happy sleepy and uplifted top five things that it is going to help with is pain stress insomnia anxiety and depression this has some side effects like most strains you get dry mouth and dry eyes being top headache dizzy ebb paranoid coming in last i'm really excited to see how this uh bud's gonna end up doing you guys but we've got all the information rattled off let's get into the actual urban scale and i'll see on the other side when we crack into this container and see how it's gonna do for the look and [Music] aroma welcome back again you guys so let's get this looking aroma started we got this steel right there let's crack into this another seal for your protection oh fat nugs in this container wow simply bear you treated us on this eighth let's get all these nugs out of here so you definitely get that pine lemony kind of smell it's not overwhelming so there's the eighth there but it does have strong enough smell to really make it nice and a little bit exciting to smoke in the like excited to smoke is a better way to put it it has such a nice smell you guys nice and light that lemon with just that hint of kind of pineapple it's it actually complements really well and i am very surprised at how well this bud smells i'm uh i'm really excited to try this and it is really fresh dank sticky dense nugs very true indica dominant nugs um i think this bud has some potential to do really well and i'm really looking forward to seeing how it's how it's gonna do you guys i am gonna give it a i can't give it a nine because the smell isn't really getting me that excited but the quality of the cannabis is definitely close to that nine range i'm gonna give it an eight on the strong side like the strongest eight eight you guys can think of just because that smell doesn't have enough push to really sell me on it and i think i definitely think it could be doing better but we'll see you guys when we got this busted up i'm gonna roll a joint do all that good stuff before we go any further in this review um we're gonna be tapping into the boundless vaporizer first i'll see you guys when we get over there hey guys so we're going to start it off with the vaporizer we're going to start this sucker out at 175 degrees celsius that lets us taste the first little levels of the terpenes that start to boil off you get the lemon in and the meristening which are the mango and lemon based terpenes are definitely sweeter terpenes and then after that we bump it up to the 205. you get a little bit more of the earthy muggy spiced kind of flavors hinting in there as well before we bump it up to 220 and right there is where you're going to get the top level of the flavors that peppery spice the beta chlorophyll and definitely more of a woody type of flavor in there you don't get as much thc at the 175 as you do with the 220 so there as well is the thc dump so the sucker is set at 175 we're going to start out there before we bump it up to the 205 and then 220. so let's see how this one does and i'll see you guys on the other side cheers really light damp flavor enjoyable definitely a fresh bud kind of flavor hmm it's definitely really light and lemony it's almost got a little bit of a woodsy kind of flavor in there it's it's enjoyable and i'm liking it quite a bit you guys okay let's bump it up to the 205 and see how it does there because i'm curious to see if we're going to get a little bit more of that woodsy type of flavor if we're going to get something different so it's set at that 205 let's uh pound this out you guys cheers this definitely goes to a little more herbal and peppered flavor which isn't bad it's definitely not my favorite but i'm still enjoying it again that really kind of peppery flavor which isn't bad but it's definitely not exciting me very much we're now bumped it up to 220 and we'll see how it does there you guys cheers it's gone really peppery and light woodsy touch to it too it's not bad but again it's just it's not really exciting to you guys it's kind of a mad bud like after that 205 i was like this is gonna get a seven and that's all it's really gonna get yeah it's just it's a personal flavor thing and it's not really exciting me i was really interested and hoping for more of that lemon flavor but i'm just not getting it you guys so uh seven out of ten is the best that we can do for this one and uh we're gonna tap into some bongs next so i'll see you guys over there hey guys so we're going to run this og kush through the bongs so we started out with the hamper wick hamper wick the hemp wick and then we go into the straight clipper lighter and after that we use the mk torch slider so there shouldn't be any more weight in any longer let's let up this hemp wick and get to smoking this so start out in the sea turtle rig before we go over to the nice guys beaker bong and then straighten it out with the cyclone from red eye attack hope you guys are having a great day and uh hope you guys enjoy this review because i'm definitely enjoying what i have smoked so far cheers let's get into the second rip y'all cheers okay yes i'm going to end up giving this an 8 out of a 10. it has a really strong cushy's definitely the best and most predominant flavor i could tell you guys there is hint to that lemon definitely hint to the pine but it is a very cushy traditionally cushy strain and the bud is relatively moist though like it's in really good shape the glass container is doing incredibly well with the strain um and overall it did really really well you guys i'm giving it an 8 out of 10 because that flavor is really enjoyable nice and strong it does have a touch of a harshness to it that personally just it's a little bit of a turn off to make me not run to the hills and scream about it but i would definitely be talking this butt up because it's been just really enjoyable with uh with the consistency of the flavor but it's not a personal favor but it's a damn good flavor and definitely worth checking out if you guys like that really cushy flavor but we're gonna move on over into the taste from a pipe you guys we got colorado spoon pipe packed up here and uh you'll be finding out how it tastes while i smoke it so cheers and i'll see you on the other side hamburg every time at least once a day this hempway [ __ ] be over that time you guys got to see it so cheers i'm gonna have to give it a 7 out of 10. it's really light and subtle with its flavor you've got a hint of that citrus cleaner pine that that very light kind of acetone touch to it it's not bad in any way it's just not something i'm overly excited about so seven out of ten is the best i can do um it is a little bit disappointing i was hoping for more flavor i got out of the bong but i guess it just didn't happen so we've uh rolled it up with some rice baths paper there's some vibes blue papers like i normally do i really enjoy smoking these for the reviews and it seems to really give me the best flavor so uh let's take a little bit of a dry haul on here see what kind of flavors we can expect when we light this sucker up but uh yeah cheers so i'm getting surprisingly like a licorice flavor like a really dark soft black licorice kind of flavor and it's interesting like those black licorice babies that is very much the flavor i'm getting from this which is interesting and exciting because if that's what that's what it's going to taste like i'm going to enjoy this joint you guys cheers [Music] okay guys this is a really slow burning joy but i'm enjoying it quite a bit i'm getting a really strong cushy pine flavor it is definitely very fresh bud very strong and fresh flavors i'm uh quite surprised at how well this joint is developing as we're smoking through it and how it's not becoming really overwhelming or like changing the flavors from one to the next it's staying nice and light and consistent and and really is quite an enjoyable strain to be smoking right now you guys let's bring this mic a little closer since my how much i've been talking there we go so that's right we brought the mic a little bit closer you guys i was talking a little bit too quiet i could see it not picking up quite enough so brought the bike in just that touch closer but that's bud really really impressed with it i'm gonna give it a nine just because again personally not my favorite strain but definitely a strain i'm i'm quite happy and enjoy quite a bit i really didn't expect this slot um not sly light of a flavor but that would just build and develop a really nice settle of an overwhelming and really strong flavor on your tongue that i'm i'm enjoying quite a bit you guys it did well nine out of ten it's a solid score but uh i'll uh be right back we're talking about the ha okay guys this is gonna end up getting a 9 out of a 10 for a tire now tell you right now where it's losing it's one point is the headache i can feel coming on right now it is very disappointing when i get this headache sensation especially when it's later on into the sesh when the effects are hitting kind of their optimal highest level for me the headaches come in as well and it's just a little bit of disappointment this one however has got a really nice euphoria to it like that mental drift where i want to just drift off you guys i am so ready to just crawl into bed and get into a tv show um this one definitely is gonna have some munchies to it i believe um i can already start to feel it like i'm really thirsty and there's some dry mouth with it so i uh usually when i'm like this i know the munchies are following through it does have a pretty decent pain relief to it and it's got a really nice relaxing end of day not necessarily sleepy but comfortable um feeling to it and it's very very well grown for its effects and i'm i'm enjoying it quite a bit you guys so we've got it added all up this bud did pretty well it did get a beautiful urban score for its overall it got a 47 out of 60. we're just going to finish this drawing you guys know no more extra bowl for this video but uh it's got a a 47 out of 60 and it did really well in some categories taste from a joint and the taste from a bong were definitely the two that are most um are like they're the ones that really stand out to me this joint just tastes really nice as i'm finishing it up it's still really light flavor it's got more than it did at the beginning but still is that light flavor i am very much enjoying it as well as from the bongs just that really soft cushy flavor that i was getting through there it was nice definitely nice and the high is [ __ ] great you guys the high did incredible as well it's got that really good mental drift end of day smoke i am quite impressed with how well this butt did but i'm gonna wrap this one up hope you guys enjoyed if you guys are checking this out on youtube stick around because i've got an end card just for you well you might as well just make it everyone's end card hope you guys enjoyed

cherry pie strain also sometimes known as the cherry cush is an indica leaning hybrid and is testing at around about 20 to 26 percent THC the strain is also a cross between the granddaddy purple and the Durban poison and the effects include relaxation euphoria creativity and up lifting effects and the smell and taste is a very sweet and earthy sort of herbal smell and taste to the strain very very nice I could refer it or say that it is similar to sort of a garlicky sort of smell very interesting as I said first time ever trying it so super stoked so far very impressed let's get into another second rip and see how we go okay so as you can see there are some absolutely beautiful shots there of the the cherry pie really really blown away I love the smell of the taste so far the

looks 20% THC of pure in the Chi believe yes it is yes it is it's not a hybrid at all alright let's see how she looks a reasonably thin three and a half no no wait there's more pretty reasonable under three and a half for sure yeah it's a nice dark green you can tell some indica well that's uh it's pretty dry though of course packaged at the end of August on the 29th so some will hit almost bone-dry yeah yeah so it's uh that's two and a half months old anyway yeah but well you know a nacelle seaweed there you go so will some of us up and see how it is absolutely is it crystal eh what sort of beauty have the mixers you're supposed to be somewhat alike there's colours attached to it it's um in the description oh yeah you can see well there the bright light you can see all the crystal and everything of course any purple this is a description there was supposed to be a little hints of purple a little hints of purple plus I don't know what offer is no I don't know what aqua is theirs let's go what's up everybody welcome to Canadian cannabis reviews with Dave and Gavin what's up there not too much buddy not too much I'm excited for this because honestly I'll has everyone who watches the show with any regularity knows I like myself some strong gas into god yes and pushes and pushes and the parrot of this is the Hindu so that's uh you know should be a good stream it's true classic strain if nothing else no I for sure and is this just an original og strain or did it come from Afghani cushion something else and became cool it's just straight out of him straight or as a straight at him but yeah far as the mountains and stuff though it's all just from like that Afghani mountain do yeah alright yeah cuz I can smell it from here which is surprising considering how bone-dry it is yeah yeah it's got a nice nice aroma to it a little earthy little woody it's got kareo Filene a and B piney and bear scene of course I think everything has mercy so all the sleepy ones yeah you know could I see the jar yeah yeah sure there you go sir thank you it doesn't turn to powder but it doesn't need to be busted up no no it's a it's definitely a hand crumble yeah we hand crumpled metric shit-ton of trichomes on there yeah that's nice that's a nice looking we eat very well trim but there's no little leaves or nothing on it no nice hairs yeah this should be I'm hoping this is not a psychic witch it was a little thing maybe it's fresher the term I'm walking for yeah well totally fresh considering did how much we liked the TWD indica yeah I'm hoping this is something similar [ __ ] well I mean you know assuming they throw some of the remnants of this in there at some point all depends on what the remnants they throw away yeah exactly exactly should be good and I probably need to buy some new Ross here in a minute now you've got three papers left there and that's about it that's it didn't have a Seabees around here I've got some Canadian one members around but I like those Ross yeah like I'm going down stairs cells wrong papers now looks nice oh sweet yeah I saw him on his cash just this morning I'm like hey guys pretty stoked about that Thanks after the walk at Point Pleasant it didn't feel like buzzing into the building like using my keys so I just got through the store for a minute nice it's I'm not the only person to do that no I um you know no you live in the building and to talk to them women they don't think they might I'll be back to my [ __ ] later well yeah exactly listen you live in the building it's not like you're gonna yeah I just didn't feel it buzzing they're using my keys like especially its back when the store was open like in the evening more yeah it especially was cold and raining you're running in from superstore that's the first door you're gonna go through the store for sure yeah sorry guys I'll be back he's gonna skitter skitter squish squish squish oh yeah yeah should be and important Pleasant was busy this morning like I abbess well I mean it's a nice cool morning everybody gets out on morning's like this except me yeah once actually no it's like my fate I've lost my tube and you could buy a new tooth what my face was cold and on my chest was warm soul opened my shirt and then the wind would hit me in my sweaty titties and my titties with all that sweating again I couldn't wake you so much temperature like as I was moving with the wind yeah yeah that's a man in the ass was it was nice there's no wind Sun was stream and like us hot in the woods so we could like I'm gonna break in the woods it was cold yeah once the wind hits yeah that's that's the end of the day if the wind picks up that's there's one of those giant dogs there that I patted out that was a pilot like one of those ones you could write until you were 1200 it's a big and fluffy or big and or hair shorthair all right like that stuff right yeah um but you know I'm traveling with 85 pound two husky and this thing was very much bigger than my 85 pounds a husky like a tease yeah Oh chef bird yes nice all right super friendly so just running around off-leash making friends with dogs okay although you know katie probably befriended some dogs I don't think Katie probably has trouble for dogs yeah and then she also is getting an oil change and winter tires done both of which I need to really move up to like a much higher on my list from where they are hurry yeah well once I get my car back I will put winter tires on it so is your frame jacked or how did all that work up for you I have no idea the I was in a car accident last weekend I got rear-ended so yeah I was stopped at the end of my road waiting to turn waiting for oncoming traffic to stop and grab an ax left yeah so I'm gonna single lane going down and there's a double lane coming up and of course a busy Saturday afternoon around 1:30 I checked my rearview mirror and I see this woman coming behind me and she's coming too fast to stop and I don't even think she I know she didn't see me cuz she didn't stop at all like she stopped when she hit my car the back end of my car is destroyed and enough brand new car effectively well was its year old and dimes past it's not afraid anymore she hit me with a 2011 Kia Rio her car was rode off they had to bring in a truck to come and take it away and its value was only like 4 grand so what would you buy an 11 Kia Rio for I don't think it was hers and I think it was apparent okay yeah well the clothes might value mean what it no but completely her fault of course doesn't matter where you're stopped if you're at a full stop anywhere in Canada and somebody hits you it's gonna be their fault unless it's the highway don't stop on the [ __ ] highway for docs you can stop on the highway if you're on a full stop on the highway and somebody hits you and it's still their fault worked out in the courts that's what my insurance company told me it typically yeah personally stopped a lot of family ducks crossed and then someone else got killed ah well that's yeah because they got stopped on the [ __ ] highway yeah what I mean you and you got to give yourself time to stop okay generally two car lengths I mean yeah I like this way to good it's a nice flavor nice flavor beautiful like buds well trimmed great crystal and already halfway through the joint we're trailing off yeah no but yeah so my car is still being assessed I took it in Wednesday or Thursday and got a rental you have a suite rental it's a Chrysler 300 that's not right rental that's not bad - Chet no no don't need a sunroof it's all power everything else so I mean I don't think I have a sunroof haven't checked actually I don't remember there being a sunroof when I got it it's nice car everything's automatic still 300 you're gorgeous yeah I love their seats it's a pig on gas but yeah yeah engine on probably goes real fast when you want it - it does I find myself doing like 120 130 on the way to work but on the highlight oh yes on highway I found myself to 95 down the bay roads sometimes yeah it's a 70 zone mm-hmm it's an easy road to go fast on that's the girl who hit me try to slow down my time and coin through that subdivision yeah yeah yeah someone who's you keep your eyes up like I I could see she was well I mean I couldn't see her eyes say she was looking down at her phone giving it a 2011 REO they didn't have like the visual display and everything that you have - oh we can all have that right so 300 to roll no it's true true but she's okay she's okay good yeah and your healing better nothing no it's you'll be in busy over a while do I think she was probably in shock because I know when I was I was in a car accident last year as well last August where I was the one hitting somebody I collided with an SUV and airbags deployed and I'm sure her airbags would have deployed but I don't think there are airbags and that model or gonna have to have some airbags I don't know okay I get that but I like could have the front two is probably all it adds and have all the good ones I didn't see her airbag deployed and her front end was Molly mean the radiator was bent in along with the rest of the front so if if her airbag was gonna go off if there was one what I got okay yeah what had gone off the lessons defective okay yeah yeah but I mean she's gonna you know her seatbelt probably locked up when she hit me yeah yeah she's gonna have some bruising and in four to six months a physio oh he was young so maybe she'll recover quicker but yeah interesting Saturday yeah so much is coming home from here last night well when I came down and got cookies and I took them out to somebody and I took a few up to somebody and then on my way back from Bedford and is when I got rear-ended yeah so no fun at all and yeah I don't know I can't be like I can't be too integrating like it an accident accident but you know I know I learned my lesson after that I don't know what the lesson is in this case always keep your eyes on the road never look at your cell phone never look at the radio and never you know like the cars these days you know you've got all the steering wheel functions on um well yeah I'm also looking throughout us hoping you're already - yeah but I mean everybody looks away for you know split second just to check something but that's all it takes or to eat a cheeseburger yeah like on road trips and [ __ ] McDonald's is so well made for just like eating on your lap some foods travel better than others but McDonald's is awesome just like set it on the steering wheel you put the thing and the thing like and set the back of the gate I'm the steering wheel itself just going on the highway you don't want to make any sharp turns my fries yeah you have the burger here yeah fries here in the back of the things holding the fries on the bottom of the steering interesting but you don't make any sharp turns cause of course your fries are held by your steering wheel but you know you driving straight on a highway typical you like on a road trip when this move comes out I've never done that I've driven around a lot I'll be back what's up I mean and we're back but you didn't notice so there we go actually showed that magic alright so yeah still a really good weed I'm really I'm still buzzed very buzzed for one pretty good yeah very nice flavor absolutely a little bit better yeah but it's a 20 percent indica where I've sat down on the floor to take some picture of this I proceeded to be like yeah I'm comfy down here and not want to get back up so yeah if you like strong indicas this does the trick for sure wish it was fresh or I'd give it a better score but man yeah eight and a half for nine that happily keeps smoking this I just wish it was Russia I'd say eight and a half but yeah definitely I mean yeah I mean it needs to be a little fresher I just picked up limelight again this week because apparently it's not a limited edition so if you go back and watch our review on that or we said it was they're just gonna keep growing it apparently that's down 25% yeah wells 20-25 percent but they still they're still putting that freshness pack in it okay so you know anybody who's who's having the package and those little plastic or even the kind of metal ones with the plastic in probably be smart to use those things too and we'd be less complaining about the freshness yeah exactly exactly and especially after being there for two and a half months although maybe they didn't maybe they've started doing it now because that's been sitting there for that long I don't know what ever seen a freshness tackle another tweet though yeah I don't know I don't remember but if you do see the what is this Hindu Kush yeah well it's the Baker Street but yeah it's a it's a hint yeah I'm like strong couch lock weed probably not for novices but if you did need it for medical purposes and couldn't get you to your actual medical script down to this would do the trick absolutely if you need to sleep smoke this video game smoke this yes but doing much probably not the best weed no no no but yeah definitely well worth checking out and

strain and the tea she loves on this can be about 25% so she's pretty high up there as far as the genetics cold this is a cross between Hells Angel oh gee and Jack the Ripper so you got a lot of good stuff involved in here Purple Haze is in here lambsbread Northern Lights 1 to 5 Cinderella 99 and from what I could find out my brother he said he went in Conte he contacted TJ sub Quinn had found out that the Cinderella 99 in the space Queen is in fact the Brothers Grimm Cinderella 99 [Music] found out wondering that because I was sitting I think you know me I'm always hunting down the Cinderella things and I always keep my eye out for it and every time I see a pop through it's always to the space Queen I'm wondering is that the boys Grimm that's in there and I was happy to find that it was so and because my brother man and Big Ups of TGA some [ __ ] Spa Thank You Man anyways wonderful don't know this kind of strings are involved in this and this is a good strain a wonderful daytime medication if you like an uplifting focused kind of a high and you kind of helps with the pain relief kind of I kind of felt like it was it so much on the body relief for the pain more so in the mind that you kind of just forget about it on your plate other than the pain the pain is kind of in the background so I mean it's there but it's nothing to worry about this isn't one of those well I guess it could be but from what I found out it's a good strain to go to work with I would talk this before going to work I had a very productive day with medicating with this I wake in baked with this the other morning and had an absolutely wonderful morning I have a lot of work to do I had this huge big tree in my yard t-d tiny recycle bin to put all my branches in so the whole day I'm just breaking branches breaking off leaves kind of store firewood you know and fit as much as I can I said my garbage can I had a pretty pretty busy day from the morning time all the way to the evening we're not to the evening about the afternoon but still being consistent one thing about me is I'm all over the place please my mind you know so when I'm doing work I'll do like a quarter here half here a quarter here half here and by the end of the day I have all these unfinished things but I'm already exhausted and tired but man what you know day what you do nothing nothing looks like it was done but with something like this I was able to stay focused on what I was doing and could create my task so I thought this straight really did come in handy might be good for ADHD except for the fact that it is kind of uppity but it is focused it is alert and I finally do is matter what you're doing whether it's driving working on the computer doing physical work around the house this stuff really did come in handy so we're gonna take a DAB here this morning and this might kind of put our lungs into a fish so anyhow it's our first gap of the day we're gonna take it and I love this train for the wake-and-bake so hopefully we're gonna have another productive day today so yeah yay for the Jesus Oh Jeannie and I was saving this my Sunday just cuz it was well hey Zeus aog here one I guess yeah you wouldn't be wrong maybe at all don't quote me are you two getting [Music] how's that [Music] Jesus og [Music] but I'm not made me down on the strain I'm dabbing with some of this butter crumble stuff I don't like this stuff but because I saw Jesus oh gee I never had it before I was like I wanted to try it but usually I don't pick up stuff like this you know I'm I'm not a fan of the butter crumble stuff I love my shatter but because it was Jesus og I want to try it so I grab some of this anyway it's it's a wonderful strength but just the hits a little bit on the harsh side might want to have some drink with you some water or something but still a wonderful daytime strain have this with your orange juice in the morning man forget cigarettes and coffee Jesus and orange juice oh jesus oh gee but oh sheesh a wonderful strain and I felt like my anxiety wasn't really affected by it being it was kind of uppity and uplifting and energetic I guess because I was working and doing stuff with it and that's kind of using this strength to its advantage you know I'm just kind of getting as much done as I possibly could I did find that there is a crash if you're not well rested also if you kind of like me you hit this tray you go out you're working working working you come in you down again and you're just kind of sit on the couch dabbed out and you're kind of exhausted from working so you find kind of its kind faults when I sleep you know so the crash is there if you allow it you know but if the wheels are in motion if you're moving around doing stuff and you've got an agenda of stuff to do and you're well rested this trait will really come in handy but for me I caught the crash but I think that was probably more so because I was pretty exhausted by the end I kind of got down got into a real comfy state and just took some dabs and just kind of sat there with nothing else to do except go down man so but I went down nicely and it was good so I didn't experience any munchies I think the cottonmouth and and the crash so but overall the anxiety didn't affect me I thought it was good for like going because I was running errands that day too and doing stuff throughout the day so it was good for like interacting with people being on the phone standing in line doing all that kind stuff shopping so it's a good do whatever you want to need to do strain you know go out and get stuff done going to things and it's pretty pretty happy not as euphoric as I was hoping it would be usually ask why I hunt down the Cindy 99 but still overall a really nice train Jesus oh gee it was good I liked it", "Hby7h2_NXbk": "pochi wooded hills california from mother nature's women boy and they got the remedy right hip so green blimey dense bird to man it's kind of thinking in the snow is

peace [Applause]", "c_v-kYS8h9g": "Skywalker og is an indica dominant strain with lineage from OG Kush it possesses a thick warm diesel flavor with a very pungent yet rounded earthy diesel smell when smoked Skywalker produces a long heavy cerebral high with a body high that is relaxing and not too overpowering or heavy medically it is recommended as an antiemetic in addition to helping with anti nausea chronic pain and appetite stimulation this is an impressive flower with incredible bud formation and trichome production come see this great OG strain for yourself at the clinic today", "CzzTf0mkKLM": "hey guys welcome to the channel this is a medical marijuana patient review for Florida medical marijuana patients if you are not age of 18 or older please I'm gonna have to ask you to dip out its left right up down on your dam just don't be here um now that that's not the way how is everybody doing today I'm feeling good feeling great I got two days off after a long 60 hour week last week Black Friday I sell cell phones so some [ __ ] in holiday season yes anywho that's fun stuff today now I know a lot of people have already seen the lemon OG Kush reviews by other folks personally I've seen a lot of Airy buds and then I've seen like one that was like 29% it was a little darker and uh anyways this is like the best most staple looking lemon og cush that I could find and I have found in a long time I bought it there's three different times and this is literally the best it has been it is so much on point please just focus for us come on give us just a quick little [ __ ] there we go it is just so pretty young I mean it looks just like just the regular picture oh gee cush or lemon no cheek excuse me but man it's so pungent I already got one rolled up right now people always pay attention to the THC count um I don't know man because I've had ones that you know say 27 28 and then I've had ones that say you know 17 that have hit me harder feeling than the higher percentage ones so I think it's all preference on how people feel and react to it now your chemistry is for it but in my opinion this 19.3 strain right here it's the PK 28 batch so hopefully hopefully they keep doing it like this because I've seen it in the past and it's been so area it smoked good but it's just been airy and not good-looking a man it's just so pretty I'm going on Thursday to grab as many of them bad boys as I can but let's get this bad boy sparked up I am gonna also roll a joint for later I got some paradise weights I'm gonna throw some member berry crumble on top of it see you know maybe a little bit of Keef see how that bad boy smokes but back to the OG Kush oh man I just I can't get over the flavor it's so lemony that it's hard to it's hard to taste other flavors cuz it's so limited I mean you get your basic OG your basic OG fragrances and flavors but let me pull up the weekly that way we get some straight-up stats to go by man yo it's it just tastes so damn good I'm just loving it no we don't want to sign up for that okay so it's very calming not energizing they say what they're skunky indica lacks in longevity so I guess it kind of doesn't stay good for luck or not good but the effects don't last for as long as other strains like this but it makes up for in speed a cross between the mythical Las Vegas Lemon skunk and the OG the limit OG provides users with a quick acting sleepyhead sensation I don't get sleepy with this one um other folks might die and regular OG Kush uh I you do get sleepy with but this one I can smoke this all day and go to work and everything and be good to go it does great wonders for my back I have a lot of problems in my back I'm eating carbs that's why I am a medical marijuana patient because I have a little wire and pin going into my sinuses and it gives me massive migraines especially whenever the it's about the raid and the humidity goes up I don't know why it does that I need to look that up I'd like to find out if anybody knows that let me know why people get aches and arthritis and surgery areas from the rain you know I mean is it like the density in the air some but yeah this does great for migraines pain anxiety I'm very very prone to anxiety I have deep depression this right here just I don't know this is almost the miracle strain there's almost the miracle spring og cush is just always a good one I know plenty of people like old for instance someone that other people might know dope is Yola due to only smokes oh gee couch doesn't smoke nothing it's I mean I'm sure he does if he like this trying something but he said that really only smoke though because one thing I wish I wish we had [ __ ] likes tizzy down here and I wish that we had like actually pure cannabis derived herbs in our vapes down here and that live resident babes they get because you know Susie just came out with those new [ __ ] things and we're just so pied out here babe goodness gracious but we're getting there and and I'm not knocking it you know we're getting there we're at the forefront of it so but uh how's everybody stay going so far you know I'm just probably gonna in it a little bit play some video games kids are at school wife's at work I'm just enjoying this day off for once I don't have anything to do everything's done ooh dishes food hey she treat now I um I just started dabbing and this member berri it tasted so good that last night I literally took man it had to be seven dabs in a row it just tasted so good and it just I don't know it took a second to hit me so I just kept going but they it well they looked at the dip criminal charge through later what the [ __ ] I don't know that's one thing it the Davin will get away from you that's for sure and your tolerance will skyrocket that is one thing that I'm worried about if anybody has any good tips on like bringing your tolerance down without having to completely quit let me know cuz man I can't quit smoking because I just have too much anxiety too much pain in my back and stuff and I don't want to have to eat the ibuprofen said the tylenol is either because it's so bad all your liver you know so anyways back to the strain sorry I got off stop it so they feel that it's it's a little more psychoactive than other members of the cush family helps with stress anxiety pain depression and insomnia it'll help you sleep like like I said before I don't get sleepy on it but I could go to sleep on it no problem yeah anyways I'm just really happy with the way it's going right now truly it's been great I only had one problem that was a Dutch Hawaiian but that was the only problem that I've had with true leave so far they were real cool they took it right back gave me credit on my account that bad boys out already remember back in the day used to be like man if the weed goes out it's some killer weed one thing about that curse though it's sticky that [ __ ] is sticky icky you can take your fingers and just go [ __ ] almost get a damn honeycomb in between them oh one thing that's good though we're actually getting a little more variety in my town other than Panama City Beach and what kind of my City Beach side is ten minutes away anywho we've got a true leave sir Tara and a liberty and now we're getting invited can we're getting two body cants one on the beach and one on the in town side so that's good I just I'm ready for variety and Bay it I just I don't know people need to start looking out for the customers you know I feel like like if you go to Colorado and you buy trees it's literally three times cheaper than it is here and hopefully it gets to that but a baby that week probably got another year to come in for those prices to regulate out but at least we're going in the right direction they got all this stuff going on for next year trying to get recreational so it's pretty cool little experience going on right now like I said before I know uh talking tippy-toe be a couple places to fight that og he's got some good videos y'all come check it out uh he told me where to buy the Ho Chi but if anybody else knows we're defensive OG Kush or some lipid tree like I said before on delivery let me know I don't know why truly but I guess they're not making true like a gloomy tree anywhere they have this [ __ ] without again yeah I guess they're not making it anymore not right now or maybe it's just not time to harvest it excuse me sorry about it but yeah it tastes so good matter of fact yeah one thing about these damn things I hate him so much oh this one it came off easy this time he's little bastard I swear I said there it had to have been 15 minutes straight trying to get this damn thing off one day and I was not to aya promise you oh excuse me miss kidney probably can't hear me good there we go by God means I get hit on it's because I've game in today just relax and I don't know but that member berri it's some of the best taste in weed I've ever tasted I really want to get it in the actual bud form because I feel like that's when you get the real flavor from it and all I've had it in is the pre roll and crumble now we got some LA Confidential for the first time it's okay a little bit too dark and sweetie for me as well as the paradise weights it's really good but it's just not my style and not my kind of but I probably won't be grabbing it again but that's the thing I am excited about and I like going through and checking things out you know we got variety now so and it's getting bigger and bigger I am excited and happy about that I might take a little bit off that's kind of a big one doing a little too much it's such a good little pipe goodness gracious but the taste is so good and so crazy it's like the coughs I'm a taste it's like it's even the coughs are [ __ ] smooth for this it's like crazy in you well um I'm probably gonna be playing some escape from tarkov here in a little bit if anybody wants to join our stream it'll be on my youtube channel and that is lately lately late I believe it's like the my twitch channel sorry is lakely and my youtube channel is lake if you guys want to check me out you know check me out so if you enjoyed it and you want to come along for the ride we're gonna definitely start uploading a lot more content yeah but besides that I'll catch you guys a little bit later on all right let's go play some video games have a good day peace one love", "HXRMQzwEL6Y": "what's up guys thanks for tuning in for another west coast weed tour review i'm here with my friend riley from trippy hoop cannabis and he is going to be smoking the riff oh gee by ember valley and so this is ember valley's iteration of an og kush so i'm really excited about that i'm gonna give give riley one of these nugs there you go this is um it's a little wet it's impressive you like that so presentation wow that's fruity wow what the [ __ ] that does not seem like an og kush riff oh gee honey coming with the diverse turtles that's very different wow um presentation you know this is a california brand so um it's a little bit different presentation from a washington state label but the lid's cute is the best part about it it really reminds me of gabriel actually which is very interesting um product appeal what would you say your products appeal is for this one do you like og kush i do i do honestly and i really just enjoy like the fact that i'm that we've had two different like smells basically it's a similar kush yeah this definitely is my more my style i definitely would enjoy something that's a little more fruity yeah smell and taste that's just my preference yeah um but yeah as far as the presentation goes like the that's fine like it starts the packaging goes it's fine but i think the the flower like you know i just that's why it's very clear glass so you can just see the flowers best you can put up to a light yeah because that's honestly most wheat smokers that is what we are looking for is uh the packaging only does so much it's not going to get you yeah for sure yeah so we're looking for trichome density and if you can see that through packaging that is it is sticky yeah yeah okay right nice awesome awesome smells great we're gonna see on taste potency this guy tests on average 24 to 28 percent so really good for amber van gaal valley this is very sticky it's very sticky trying a little ball as possible charlotte's web out here classic handful packings please absolutely my friend thank you all right let's give this a go so i hold my letter yeah i do see how you won't be late it's very clean yeah yeah nice clean for the taste it is it is how slight like it's not your typical og kush for sure it does just have a little like not quite fruity undertone but it's not tiny at all that's hard to yeah so you're not getting that that tarry flavor that we got no it's there a little bit but it's definitely not as prominent when i assume because if you had something that was a little more traditional then yeah i would assume that this is definitely a little it's just clean yeah yeah which i'm looking for all the time like i cough pretty heavy off like normal to like anything really yeah and that was an easy hit to take it wasn't harsh at all nice that's what i'm looking for that's literally what i would want awesome so one thing i would say about their packaging is there isn't anywhere to find more information except for just their website um so hopefully their website's really informative but i've been digging people for not putting social media on their packaging or not putting 20 20 baby yeah let's do it let's do it i want to follow you you want to follow me you have fun we do um we would definitely recommend yeah for sure recommend it and you want to give it an overall score ooh i'll go eight four eight four eight four on the riff og by ember valley awesome thanks guys", "Yp0Mr_16r4U": "all right what's up guys gals got Jim Burns here pinky burns burns McGurn whatever you want um we got some beautiful meds here today um finally I got it all nice and cured it's been caring for about close to two weeks now and this

what that's about we're going to put a little bit us in our pipe today and just smoke it up for my boy green organics um s dog been bent buds first quite sometimes pull a bit us in them maybe I can get this all kind of zoomed in on I got a couple of the really nice nugs but this seems to be working for me right now um I literally shot this video like three [ __ ] times before I finally got my [ __ ] together like first the batteries were dead so I charge the batteries but batteries back in start shooting another video and the memory cards fall and that's all I grace I've ever card and now I'm sitting here right now and we're about to get hey major burns hi you know I'm Sam my dog right now is at the vet she had to get like a little less cyst taken out we thought it was like a little skin tag but then when we checked it out it happened to be a cyst on her shoulder she's only about a year old right now we've been no it's just been bothering me so she got it taken out and she's in recovery right now so we're gonna go pick her up in about it Iowa anyways look at this beautiful stuff cuz it's about to get blazed hot definitely all right let's zoom out here and get my get a little major burns medicated up on this ph we got a pretty nice day here um it's like right now it's 38 degrees outside right now look was 67 degrees yesterday but Aaron let's get this video style on go go boom boom boom get this new board out of there oh yeah we got these really awesome amount shears from my my in-laws it's fisker shears and they're pretty pretty awesome and it's got this awesome little bull hangs on your side when you pull it out it usually flicks the button when you pull them out but um there's a pretty badass and on this side it's like a knife and on this side it's like a Syrian if-- pushes bug down boom all right you know any growers know what the dealio is you constantly a trim shut off blah blah let's get this rip on give it a little review on this made my buddy conscious and so we can see what the dealio is I'd really like some more beans of this if you watch this and maybe we can figure something out meds for beans whatever you know here we go all right let's rip it up nice purple Bowl rogue dragon style hmm shit's good real good hmm it's just got this really nice um dank taste to it I believe it's probably coming from that um from that cheesequake and then the Purple's coming from Blackwater it's good another hit on this because it's so good we have some really nice what I end up doing was making some sugar here trigger wax so we've been deaf and hard on this getting situated and whatnot I made it from alien Aloha and a whole [ __ ] ton Keef and it was basically it's basically a huge like I want to go mow the lawn kind of DAB deal but this strain really nice I feel it can it's like an all-day kind of a strain if you medicate a lot more then it can have more indica effect so I don't you just keep blazin they'll do the job but alright everybody have a good day and remember major burns just says keep smile peace", "BJsj_tl7yAA": "what is up world so today we have gotten some wonderful bud from doctor's choice little west coast oh gee if I can [ __ ] focus on it and we're going to review this right now put it in the grinder smells like peaches just like a lot like peaches and it's an OG so it's gonna be an indica heavy it's amazing and the hairs on it are just bright orange and it's like I agree it's so good I'm so excited to try this guy's so what we're gonna do the smell smells like just like I already said and what we're gonna do is we're gonna do two hits off of it to bowl rips see how it goes see how the initial high is you know it makes me feel and then we'll go from there cheers everyone positive vibe warriors and toxic release [Music] keeps you right now whoa thank you I'm very relaxed instantly very tasty very tasty I will have to try and focus on what it tastes like in the after the second time I take it cuz right now that first one heading I didn't I didn't focus on the taste but oh man for those of you really like indica heavy stuff west coast og man no doubt I'll get your day started right that'll get your day started back alright let's uh let's load a little bit more in here good stop alright so as far as the initial height goes it's like you can see by my eyes it's a pretty it's a pretty high it's a pretty big initial I the uh I can feel it creeping on me and just kind of sitting there and you know it's a nice high it's very good it's very good for anxiety it's good for anxiety it's good for sleep definitely I am feeling a little euphoric which is good so that's that's a positive let's do you uh let's do another one let's do another rip of this before we keep talking shall we and I'll try to tell you what the test is what it tastes like I have very savory taste hints of fruit hints of floral sorry my eyes are closed I can't oh there we go that that is some good stuff guys if you are wanting to calm down to get some sleep to relieve some pain this strain is good and then this one is kind of strong so I would wait to do anything for like five or six minutes until the high is fully settled but but I I in at five minutes and thirty seconds now guys I have stuff I need to do this was just a quick little review for West Coast oh gee and it was [ __ ] amazing wow that is that is something I will purchase in the future it's good stuff look for West Coast og where you guys know positive vibes toxic release", "3mAUDxJsats": "hey you guys welcome back to my channel i hope you guys are having a really really good day and if not i hope by watching this video you feel a little bit better because you should don't let [ __ ] get to you okay things get better anyways you guys so today i am here and i am doing a review on something that i have not reviewed on my channel i love reviewing things that i haven't reviewed yet you know it's always something new because it's new for me i try it out and then it's like you might already know about it but you might not you know so i am reviewing stizzy yes that's right your girl got a stizzy battery she got herself a stizzy pod and everything now let me explain why i got this basically i think i told you guys in my last video i don't know if you guys seen it if you haven't go check it out but basically in the last video i reviewed a raw garden car and when i got that car that day they were doing promotional deals on stizzy on at my dispensaries so they were doing like a 40 dollar half gram or full gram i think it was i think it was full gram 40 full gram pods and then you have to buy the battery so it still comes up to like 70 something but um to me that was a good deal because usually they're like 65 to 75 dollars so i was like you know what i always was i i have tried stizzy because other people have had it but i never had my own so i knew it was good i knew i liked it but i wanted my own to really like see how i felt so i got it and i don't know what to tell you i'm just kidding uh no this [ __ ] is okay let's let's get into the facts first let me tell you what flavor i got is it indica is it steve as a hybrid i'm not even telling you everything so let me tell you um talking too fast this is called oh g kush ogee kush and um the the type of strain it is is indica and the flavor that it is is rainbow flavor that's what it said on the box i did have the box i can't freaking find it usually you know i keep the box when i'm doing videos like this so i can have my points straight but um i remember pretty much how much thc it said you know uh this has pretty much 85 to 86 percentages maybe a little number here and they're off but it's 85 to 86 it wasn't 90 it wasn't nothing like super high like that but it was like 85 to 86 percentage of thc in here this is a full gram and you guys i have used this a lot it's almost gone not almost but it's like literally at a half mark a little less than half probably and i really like the way the pen feels like i just like the smoothness of it and everything so let's get into the battery first so the battery pretty much simple basic stuff it's honestly like all the other ones that i have it's red when it needs to charge it turns white once it's charged and it takes like about i would say 20 to 25 minutes for it to get like a full charge but it's super quick it does not take hours or anything like if you it is dead and you need to charge it 10-15 minutes and it should be good to go for you to hit it again um how long does it last for me i don't know because i never really do like i'm only hitting the pen all day then i feel like i would know more but i feel like off of a full charge and i use this you know as my convenience not really as if i well if i have it first of all and as if i'm trying to be convenient with it so i would say for me and for me to use it probably like two three times a day periodically here and there not like a lot not like too little either i would say probably last me like good three to four days you know depending on how much i used it you know if i took like a lot of hits or whatever then you know it's probably gonna be a little bit less of a day so yeah i'm just kind of like what the hell and stuff like that i was super sketched out right now yeah i was super sketched out right now because i was literally just like talking to myself and this random dude would like without a shirt or whatever he's just riding his bike up the street and he's like on the other side of where i'm parked at but he like starts coming like right at me and he sees that i'm talking to myself so he like kind of comes like right by my car and then i just stopped talking and then he kind of just looks at me and he's just a [ __ ] freak dude you're a [ __ ] freak you guys he's a [ __ ] freak oh my god oh my god like i'm fine my house is literally right there i'm parked in front of my house mind you now i'm not in like a neighborhood where i'm not supposed to be at or i don't know that i'm literally right at my house and he's a [ __ ] weirdo he's just like scoping things out and oh no honey i am the neighborhood watch over here trust me i might be high but you're not gonna get away with [ __ ] anyways so back to my pod uh this is a indica rainbow flavor um 85 86 quote me if i'm wrong i might be but no it's honestly really potent i get high as [ __ ] we are going to smoke some of this together because why not we always do that but um i want to get my facts out of the way and then i want to smoke because i feel like when i start smoking and then i try to tell you guys about the product i kind of ramble on or i kind of lose where my facts are so yeah um this hits me pretty fast i mean i feel like sizzy's good so i know it's gonna hit me but um the flavor is amazing literally tastes like freaking rainbows like i would say skittles it really it kind of has a similar taste to like like the rove one that i tried and it's a little similar but it said in rainbow so it just tastes like kind of candy-ish you know what i mean but it's not like too much um as far as like the like how would i say it like as far as the how long it lasts for me pretty long but it also depends on like how much i've been smoking all day of it or like this and that but i feel like if you were to have a drink and and if i were to be like oh should i smoke a whole joint or should i just smoke like take a couple hits off of this i will go with this here's why because you can literally stop when you want and you still have your product with like you know with like a joint or like a blind you have to smoke all of it or you could put it out but it's like kind of not the same the next day you know it's just sitting there but uh no it's the same but it's just me but super lightweight i don't even feel it um i think all of the batteries are let me show you guys the oil up close i'm not even show you so yeah that's what it looks like i feel like it's like a nice little honey color like a like an amber color but not too dark it's definitely not that dark like in person it's like a golden honey color like very golden not like a poopy brown um i really don't have any doubts with it and i want to try more flavors from stizzy now now that i have my thing i'm excited because they even have live resin pods you guys so definitely be on the lookout for a review for a live resin pod because i love i love live resin because it's honestly a cleaner more better of a process for smoking that's why it is more expensive so but yeah you know it is still good it's good it hits good you know what i mean it hits me hard um it's smooth as f doesn't give me that harsh cough or nothing yes if i do like maybe a blinker or something i don't really do blinkers because i think they're kind of a waste of product don't come for me that's just me and i don't i i can't take all that smoke like i'm literally gonna die and my hairs are gonna come out of my hair my head i mean so yeah um very good the quality of the oil is good it burns slow i feel like it took me forever to get to this point i think i got this in september i think or a little bit after or something like that but almost when i was running out of that other cart i got this and it's it's already the middle of october and i feel like it's gonna last me this probably like another week and a half you know so i feel like it's gonna last you a long time it is a gram so i feel like grams usually lasts a little bit longer than a half gram does but this is amazing i mean i feel like i say that about every card that i try because i just end up getting high as [ __ ] and i'm like oh yeah but i feel like the level of the high is different with all of them like with this one i feel like it gets me really high because it is an indica and it literally is an indica like it freaking puts me to sleep right away like if i'm hitting it and it's nighttime i'm dead asleep if um you know if it's during the day it kind of doesn't really get me that tired but it does slow me down in my tracks like i'm not really like you know i'm not really like thinking about it but well not like thinking about it but like i don't think i'm tired but i do feel things like slow down for me you know so i would check it out for yourself i feel like these are the one of the flavors that i probably have been out for a while like uh oh gee kush i said didn't i say what you guys oh gee kush yeah i feel like this one was probably like one of the few first ones that have been out and everything so for the most part it should be good i think if i were to pay like 60 like if i literally paid full price for this i wouldn't be like all that crazy about it but i do think that the potency is there the product feels good and genuine it feels clean and also that you know it's really potent it hits you right away and that's what i like about a cart like i don't want to smoke half of my cart to feel high i don't want to smoke forever to feel high off of a cart this is wax like it's supposed to get me high as [ __ ] you know more than a joint would more than a blunt would and you should do it with like within a couple of hits not that i'm smoking this all damn day and i'm like not even high you know that's how you know it's a fake car if you're not getting high and you have to smoke a lot of it um always with the legal cards they're amazing i don't ever ever ever encourage anybody to get anything illegal cards or anything like that they're not worth your help you know but just spend the extra money and just be cautious and safe out there so i'm telling you because apparently raw garden is getting sued and they're even legal like who knows what to believe right like i don't know but truly truly truly you guys this this car it hits it's really good it's it feels really good when you're hitting it and honestly we're gonna get into smoking because i feel like i've already told you that i love the product you guys are here to see me smoke and get a little high whatever and that's what i'm going to give you i have my water right here you guys because i'd be thirsty let me tell you you guys that dude is freaking me the [ __ ] out you guys luckily i have a knife in here but like oh my god he's literally like doing circles like he'll go down the street and then he'll go down a little bit and i won't see him anymore for a little bit and then he'll like turn around and then come back up like i think he's trying to kidnap me but i have my doors locked so i should be fine anyways uh dude's a freak and if i die you guys know why but yeah i do not play i keep a knife in here in my car like try me [ __ ] or guys you know like no way bro now the thing is i don't know how to put it back oh it's one of my boyfriend knives just have to do it tomorrow i'll probably take it inside and then he can do it because i don't want to wake up in the morning and forget about it and then cut my hand or something so yeah so we're going to be taking a head off of this let's do it let's do it oh honey it's already hot in here oh my goodness wow what a lame i'm sitting no but seriously you guys as soon as i took that first hit i i just feel it it like i taste it it goes away it's like a very neutral taste like you taste the rainbow flavor but it's not nothing like super dramatic or like super like crazy it it's really subtle i would say it's even less subtle than the rogue one i feel like with the real one you could taste it for a little bit more longer but for this one it's not as long also as soon as i hit it i just kind of feel it like going to my system it kind of like slows me down a little bit you know it is first smoke of the day so i feel like i'm going to feel it a little bit sooner than usual like like for my days where like i'm at home all day and i'm doing whatever i want all day and that's pretty much it and i'm doing uh pretty much what i want all day and if i'm smoking like a couple of joints like here and there here and there it could be every few hours or whatever i feel like it wouldn't hit me as hard but this is good that this is my first smoke of the day because it really shows like how good it works just by itself as its own thing you know very good i'm taking a hit for you guys delightful honestly like it's really subtle it's not like too much that like uh but i feel like that okay the first hit is gonna be a little harsh like you're gonna cough for sure you're gonna take more than you you know because you don't know how when to stop so yeah um but after that it's really easy to smoke this like i really feel like the more you smoke it the easier it is for you to smoke it um but the first one or two hits it's a little like but it's nothing terrible like it's really not unless you're trying to outdo yourself then of course you're gonna die but you're not gonna die but like i don't know i don't know what happens but uh i really enjoy you guys i i want to try other flavors from stizzy comment below literally though comment below and let me know what your favorite flavor is especially with the rye res arrive live resin carts because i want to know which ones to go for i don't want to guess and read you know i love to read i don't mind it but i really do [Music] want to know what you guys think and what you guys like so let me know what's your favorite live resin pod from sizzy and what other flavor from the regular line they're this slip line you would like to recommend because uh this is the distillate product this isn't their live resin one they really mess with it it's it's good it hits it's smooth and it i [ __ ] love the battery like i i just love it it fits in my little hand dude my hand is a little hand you guys i am not a big person i'm i'm five feet okay i'm 411. okay so i'm pretty sure i have little hands little feet little person big head and um it's it's still i can hide it you know i can be like this and you wouldn't know can you tell oh see no smoke so that's what i feel like happens with this or i don't know like i feel like when it starts to go dead you guys and this is a good tip and i'm gonna let you know when you feel like it's not hitting as [ __ ] hard as it used to or you're not getting enough smoke and you're hitting really good uh like you know it's not you it's the cart pretty much ah i want to make a shirt that says that don't copy me um [Music] no um i took two hits you guys and i don't even know how to talk about but no when you're hitting it and you okay you guys so this is the guy let me show you so you guys think that i'm not [ __ ] lying this is the guy that's on the bike right there this guy he's the guy that was like looking at me and like just thinking i was a weirdo but i'm like you're a weirdo you know and um it turns out i guess you don't really know until you know until you just keep sitting in your car recording a video um i guess he is a visitor of my you know neighbor um i know the neighbor we're cool what the [ __ ] but i'm like and now i'm looking at my neighbor like are you weirdo like that no but actually i don't even know that guy i feel like that's not the neighbor that lives there that i know that i usually see i think that's somebody else but the dude on the bike was a freak i was just like why are you looking at me like i'm in my car i'm minding my business like yes i'm not driving away yes it's none of your business but stop looking at me you know like stop looking at me oh my god but anyways so i guess he's over there now so i guess i guess we're okay i'm not gonna get kidnapped over here but um yes so yeah you guys um like i said it fits perfectly in my hands and you know it just works i don't know why i'm not getting smoke you think it's dying you literally hear it when it like unclogs itself it literally like is like yeah and i'm trying to feel it like if it was four hits you guys my eyes are already like getting a little like like you can't tell there but like in person when i really like looking to my eyes the white of my eyes they're getting red my eyes don't get that red i don't know why they don't like unless i'm drunk it's like when they get red like you can tell i'm under the influence you know what i mean baby little hits but you guys i feel like it's starting to move the more i smoke it i barely like took a a few little hits and like i think it was way more in the meaning of the video have we been talking this long is that what it is i'm gonna have to get some water because i'm not gonna lie with this cart you guys like with this car you guys it's just a little like how would i say this it's a little um so you guys even believe um so it's a little like um oh my god it's ridiculous um this car hits you guys like i am so high and i'm telling you like it's like a good feel like it's not even too much unless you keep hitting it it's you're gonna don't do it um i feel like it's it's just the right thing so i'm obviously a fantastic honestly i am so excited to try out some of their other stuff like they're edibles they're edibles ah girl i love them honestly i love doing videos on them because you kiss a lit i don't take them often but i feel like they hit me so hard like hard like i feel like they hit me harder than like me drinking and smoking at the same time you know so maybe like edibles would be some cool from them i know they have some at my dispensary they have like the little little ones little gummy things um i don't know what they're called but they're they're like in a little circle container and then they have pot but i feel like their flower is kind expensive but it's like but like for an eight like for like a wax it like kind of feels like it lasts you a little longer than an eighth one like an eighth but it is going to be good so it probably won't be like i would probably try to save her you know save it for last so funny uh but yeah you guys i hope you guys enjoyed this video i'm gonna take a couple more hits and then i'm gonna say bye because i have been recording this video for like 30 35 minutes and i don't think any of my videos have been that long and i've just been i don't know it started as a review and i just kind of kept going with it yes yes yes i really like it i mean like i said as long as you have some water you will be good you know um but if you don't good luck because it gets too lit and it can just kind of get too slow i would not recommend you going anywhere like i'm gonna take my ass right in that house you know what i mean lay down and shoot because um guys this this pod 10 out of 10 honestly like i said recommending flavors i approve definitely um i feel like yeah is it worth how the regular price i think so like i got it for a deal just because they had deals going on but i feel like if i really wanted this i wouldn't have been mad that i got it or how much i spent on it because i feel like the qualities their potency is there um you know it it's chill and i feel like it lasted me a while like i would say probably it's been three weeks now maybe three and a half i don't know because like i said i don't keep track of like how much i use it throughout the day i feel like it's like as convenient and if i have it because i don't always remember to cab it you know nor do i always remember to have flowers so it's kind of the same thing but i just what i'm feeling some days i'm feeling like flower usually it's like flower then i'm like wax then i'll like drink and then sleep so kind of like that but yeah you guys i hope you guys enjoyed this video i will be doing maybe like a makeup tutorial soon i want to get some lashes and try it out um i feel like my hands look orange okay you guys so i hope you guys enjoyed this video have a great day and yeah i will see you in the next one bye", "1cv-dxjfbHE": "[Music] [Music] what guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny we're back again for another string review today we are checking out another one of the most heavily requested strains on this show definitely the most heavily requested Oh gene this is the Billy Kimber Oh G from garrison life this [ __ ] is gaster when you think of gasps this is what comes to mind right yeah I feel like this there's a million oh geez out there right and we're always trying to think about like what makes one different than the other right there's a lot of oh geez like the old school oh geez they used to have subtle differences that you used to be able to tell like every time you saw Tahoe you could pick it out between OG back and right right nowadays it's [ __ ] Tommy so jeans you know Bobby's OG and everybody's got their own [ __ ] og right out of it it's just names thrown on a different [ __ ] when I look at OG I feel like there's three different main types right yeah and I go on taste when it comes to that it's mainly you got that kind of more fuel II pine saw lemon you're gassy if you will side of the spectrum right and then in the middle you've got more earthy that earthy earthy which is honestly my least favorite in the middle you got I would agree you know this is the CCC official OG breakdown by the way you know there's opinions everywhere this is our OG breakdown three different kinds you got your super gassy lemony like he was talking about and then you got your earthy right in the middle right and then on the other spectrum what do we got we get that kind of more sweet Marshall oh yeah almost say like marshmallow light like if you guys have watched our pure Kush review obviously I think we've done a couple of them now you guys know we love that strain but we love it so much because it's that rare end of the spectrum where it's that cush that super far on that sweet cereal milk and marshmallow we type turf that's what makes that one different from all the rest of these oh geez that we see more typically this one right here I would say is really really heavy on that first side of the spectrum right gassy lemony pungent fuelie but it does have a little bit of that sweet thing in it too right so I'm gonna describe it as being right in them so we got three different sections in the middle we got this time I got this side earthy being in the middle I'm gonna put this one about right in the middle or even a little farther from the middle of earthy and straight gas cuz this is kind of like Sour Diesel II almost like it has the smell a little bit of that gassy rotten sour smell but it also has the OG it also has the structure of a beautiful OG bigot blown out nose but they're not too blown out they still got their density to him but my zip just was filled with donkey dick all [ __ ] huge herbs we have been smoking on this for about a week we've smoked garrison let this is probably my favorite OG to smoke in the last year we got a note down down this stuff I'm just gonna do right now cuz that just stuck in my finger look at this I'll take test on 1 million out outside of the nug we didn't even have to break it up dude that's outside the nug if you break it up and stick your finger on the inside of the nug this stuff is the stickiest weed I think I've smoked in a minute so it's definitely hitting on that cylinder right there 10 out of 10 on the stick factor for sure for once your boy forgot scissors and this is probably the last like a weed that I would want to forget my scissors for or a grinder or something yeah as you can see it kind of just gets stuck to your hands just oh you're gonna end up with a lot of weed and green bump on your hands if you definitely you know if I try to break this up and you got to do this little maneuver and then the hair who out there knows the hair I know I did it another string review with that boom all the oils gone smooth as a baby's ass pretty tight this one when you hit it ooh as you can see it's kind of got a delayed punch you know it's it doesn't feel super expansive as far as the smoke going down but when you exhale it it kind of settles in and it'll kind of come back and just give you a little reminder you know as the buzz kind of settles in coach good but the flavor is there right away right you're fresh up for it let me know what your palates be like oh it's honestly straight sour OG funk which is my favorite kind of OG you know like I said I love sour but it doesn't grow that good honestly it's not that pretty there's a few sour cuts out going back in the day there was something elemental like the yogi or something like that that was pretty but honestly I feel like that resembles this almost I'm just you know obviously these nugs are a lot bigger but fresh off a rip straight sour OG just funk a lot of people sometimes get mad I see people in the comments when we compare sours to oh geez and Kent or kind of refer to that all as like the same family or whatever there are certain wheat nerds out there who have a point and I get a little bit annoyed with that you know but I think what we're talking about gonna make those comparisons is all about the aroma and the flavor and like the terpenes present in that strain I would like to see the actual breakdown of you know 10 different oh geez and 10 different sours by 10 different growers and see what are those common turbines that are overlapping in large quantity yeah yeah definitely I I don't pay too much attention to the terpenes we should probably get studied up on that it's something I would like to demo our more about obviously there's so much progress being made with lab testing and being able to test not only for THC but for you know molds pesticides and then being able to test the actual you know different cannabinoids and just the different aspects of cannabis that go into making that one string rather than things that you're gonna find an OG crisper example that you're not gonna find in other strains which brings me to my next point whatever it is that's in OG just gets me higher than anything else yeah to this day that way true five years ago yeah ten years ago I'm so hot and it's true today just off one bomber guys like we don't have test results on this stuff not that it really matters like I always say but this stuff slaps you in the face man I'm thinking this is definitely 25% plus and like he said a cannabinoid ratio in combination and OG it just hits every time man like every time even the earthy stuff and even the marshmallow is stuff it's all fire this is just our favorite one right here honestly it lives up to the hype the Billy Kimber has been making some buzz lately yeah I feel like it's really blown up in the last year right like different strains have come and had their waves the og wave has really faded out over the last couple years obviously there's people like us a lot of the people that we hang out with that I'll wet too whether it's a grower they always keep the og in the rotate rotation or if it's a smoker they just always you know like to keep a little bit of OG it's one of those strains for me that for some reason I never get tired of I feel like there's a lot of really good new hype out there now but it's hard to find something that checks all the boxes ya know it's like yeah oh gee tastes good it smells good right it looks good as far as like there's when I break these nubs up there's no stem that I have to take no it's all bud very meaty very sticky and most importantly it gives me the desired effect it tracks the punch and I like the type of high that I need below G we've been giving out a ton of nines and tens but you know good weed just deserves a good score and you know we like that we'll stay there till the end of the episode if you think if I let it you know I can walk around with this on my finger all day that's that's the level of stickiness yeah particularly this is just good [ __ ] Weed Man I mean Billy Kimber oh gee by garrison Lane we've been hearing the height we finally got our hands on it and I'm loving it I'm glad we were able to keep a little bit to [ __ ] do for this review because we were mad busy this week and we each got an ounce of this and this is all I have left I can own I could you know this all day you just tweak this number ones like it's just like squirt not gas man just like leaking it out the gas is definitely the main focus right but like you're saying the more you can't smell it all day because I get little hints of different little things yeah it kind of reminds me of the rude boy that we grew in Colorado kind of it's got that real okay honky okay well that I love the Roubaix archive seedbank if you haven't tried another structure too similar look this is this is what I want really good Oh gene to look like some of the nugs as you guys can see in the close-ups were absolutely huge that first glance I was like okay I would have probably you know there's some times where it's an ugly this with a side bud and the side bud and if there's a little bit of space particular I always cut up here some of the nodes weren't I would say maybe broken down great as much as I would want but once I started actually breaking the weed down to smoke it and saw how there's no stem weight in it at all and you know you can't be mad at that at first like I said going off bag appeal I was like this looks great this smells great good trim job obviously OG is usually a pretty damn baby trim job one of the easiest strains to turn up there is but overall I was like yeah might be if I have to knock grants for one thing it might be the bud on the cake factory oh yeah but I don't even think I can hate on that after breaking down look how skinny these stems are I mean honestly I was gonna adopt it for that too but I'm not it's cuz you know these stems are so damn skinny which is great I love low stem weight in my sacks and like you said their word was a little space between you know the main cola and like maybe a shoulder bud right here but at the end of the day this is such good way and we may be lost at the most 1/2 gram instant weight due to that so it's like and that's like being generous yeah exactly after I mean I sub when I got the odds of my gosh by 3 grams of stems in there after smoking it down to this last eighth right here and seeing how many stems I've actually had this workout is that way it's less than a gram it's super crazy node to stem size ratio right you get you probably won't be able to pick it up on the camera if you look at that one so maybe that none of takes up 1% of the fun in circumference of the nuts dance to men it's hidden on everything honestly I'm gonna go right into written it this is a nice bud we're describing weed in a whole bunch of different ways that we don't normally do that screen reviews I feel like that's indicative of where this buzz kind of takes you yeah we've been smoking this for like I said the last week and I have gotten more creative [ __ ] done this last four days then any time maybe in my entire life as far as videos ideas music for sure we have been crushing it the last four days and it's all been fuel off of this garrison land og I guess it's sparked in some old rituals from the old cush lineage of the CCC for twizzle but like I said I'm gonna go into raking this stuff you know we waited til we got down to at least mine well is my last nug of my own so I'm glad we got to this review it's like he said on effect 10 out of 10 we got more creative [ __ ] done this week than I think we've done in five years at least very cerebral very cerebral very creative very giggly very just all-around like the great buzz double-fisted oh really we look for OG aren't it could be you know obviously overall as a bud it could be more frosty okay you guys see me in these [ __ ] videos I see a lot of people in the comments she never the time what the [ __ ] yeah I'm high today yeah what was I even saying oh yeah the looks so open all has just weed as a whole it could be frost year but og doesn't typically get that frosty so I'm giving this a town of 10 on look for OG because it's got a frosty it's pretty frosty and it's got that lime green and to wrap it up flavor is just tank 10 straight gastrique funky fuel [ __ ] whatever you want to call it Oh G funky funky funky fmk 10/10 anything yeah I really don't think I need to go into too much detail about this one this is the guy blue guys you guys know how much we [ __ ] love oh gee we had a one on this show we our anthem song is about is called OG this right here is everything I'm looking for in an OG the reason why this is a 1000 is because if I was trying to explain oh gee cut to someone who had never seen it smoked it heard about it before and I was trying to explain yeah this is just the best train that has been consistent for the last 15 years it's the one that has stood the test of time right and it's for a good reason this right here is a perfect example of a batch that I would want to show them this really exemplifies all of the main traits that make you special yeah and another quick point to make is that for the most part overall OG has become watered down over the last I'd say five to seven years especially it's more difficult to find a really really good quality OG at this than it was in the past but you also got to realize that Oh G is also in everything today oh jeez in cookies oh jeez in [ __ ] all these new genetics it's in gelato some way some way or another it's an I feel in here if you go far back enough to cookies or whatever you know like I feel like it's used more than anything in print give it to give you the desired effect to really add some kick to some of these other strings that may be more flavorful but just don't pack the punch that you're looking for and exactly so yeah garrison Lane OG Kush garrison Lane Billy Kimber Oh G cush right here Wham definitely check this out if you are in California if you are in SoCal shouldn't be too hard to find yes let us know down there in the comments what strain you guys would like to see reviewed next make sure you smash that like white and turn on notifications you don't miss the next string review which will be next week that's right when we return for more that's right two twins and I call on both Jasmine's no but what they calling me Kat okay boy pegs been smoking on Krypto fat daddy chest like a missile [Music]", "O4nYkP7Ko1A": "so guys back after another video not like you're ready to do it uh but we're doing the what is this napalm again because you two took it down you two took down our first one so we're gonna redo it let me show you what we're working with over here it comes with seven grams of premium indoor flour one gram of live resin and a left ticket infused rolling paper with a glass tip they call it grenade xx large though infused prero hey grams total that's cool let me show when i take oh there it goes look at that oh yeah we should disassemble it in there though like instead of sending it hole take it apart smell like that it's like ass you can put your markers all over it you're like yes it's freaking huge look right away i'm not i'll bring the paper we [Laughter] ah [Music] we just can't show ourselves we thought that that's with two eyes but it's not i thought it blinked at me on top of that there's the lights on top of the carpet freaked myself out i was like oh my god i'm going to be able to see how far it's foggy it's pretty [ __ ] pretty still a long way to go it's at the beginning oh [ __ ] well it took us like two three months to get a hold of these since they came out we're looking for them yeah so we bought four yeah we ended up buying four 200 each we drove an hour and a half hour and a half for my lady after three [ __ ] months this is not the cookies collab though i wanna try the cookie i heard the cookies wanted gas this flavor was agent orange yeah i'm guessing they've came out with like different flavors my foot is like so drive from hiking today oh it's [ __ ] [ __ ] and that [ __ ] has not gone anywhere it has not moved the pack the last video we did the parkours they got us pretty high we'll see how high this gets us see how hot bikes this car gets there's not a big car win a bmw it's not a big car man it's so pretty look at the tip as you said way hi it is [ __ ] foggy in here [ __ ] look you can't see this [ __ ] whatever you see i'm crying you're getting to see the bag there's some good [ __ ] right here man i didn't have no [ __ ] like this before man yeah i like chinese i'm waiting something white supposed to record those things i'm

because i have bucks it's only been what 10 almost 20 minutes how far are we into it almost done to it i'm done with it oh [ __ ] this morning okay let's talk right oh yeah sure just for that we got done i give it a 10 out of 10. yeah it's way better with two so if you're gonna smoke this dude with only two people by yourself with two people yeah because we did with four the first time and it didn't hit as hard maybe it wasn't as good as the first one maybe the first one was cured better because we waited longer you know set in the jar longer can you see how funny it is says foggy's foot all right we close the doors it's still [ __ ] here but damn look look at all that smoking we already aired it out y'all like subscribe tell me if i like the video and what to do next you guys know what to do next yep bye", "QK6ILN8mHeU": "hey what's going on everybody jay ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com i've got an official west coast we tour review today featuring ember valley one of california's most popular a bud tender favorite across the state i'm very excited today's strain is the berry jack hybrid thc listed at 23.1 percent we've got cultivation date march 2nd 2020 packaging date may 7 2020 so we're looking at cannabis that is you know roughly five and a half months old packaged on may 7 so roughly packaged uh three months and two weeks ago so definitely something that should be good should be terpy should have a lot of flavor i'm personally excited so let's dive right in i will give you guys a one hit review and then two hits with the score per how i usually do it in my joint effort pre-roll series i open the tube as i smell it there's this slight fruity chemically smell but unfortunately it does look like there is a bunch of flower cannabis outside of the pre-roll and in the tube so let's check this out here yeah there's definitely definitely some good some shake coming out of here it looks like it's probably coming out of the mouthpiece which would make sense because as you guys can see there is a complete open circle in this joint mouthpiece there is not a crutch super interesting that there's not a crutch here hopefully it doesn't impact a smoking experience but i'm definitely sure that cannabis is floating out of this and into this too because there's you know because there's no approach we've got a nice evenly stuffed j that is how it came in the joint i did not unravel it yet so i can see that is as this is bouncing around in the tube because it's not twisted flour is leaking out of the joy tube so a little bit of quality control there but it's hard it's tough with the pre-rolls it really is because so much happens um you know sometimes it's only done by hand sometimes brands only use you know machines to stuff them etc i'm not sure at the details so let's just dive right into the smoke shall we the dry hit has flavor but dry hit us flavor and i didn't get scooby snacks in my mouth when i just did that dry hair so that was nice all right here we go you guys ready so on the first hit right there very smooth um not much flavor the aftertaste right now [Music] it's just really that of burnt smoke burnt paper uh a little bit of burnt earthiness i'm not getting a huge terpene profile that i would think would come with berry jack so second hit usually we get the better taste let's check it out yeah so per usual second hit much more flavorful you guys can see i got the cough that time um let's see i'm getting notes of berry i'm getting limonene i got a little bit of pinene again this is the berry jack so i would expect a little bit of that terpinoline a little bit of that pinene the limonene that you would get in a jack herrera cross or a dutch treat or an amnesia hay something along those lines but this berry here gives it this earthiness and those these berry tones i'm really liking it let me hit it one more time and i'll give you guys the official score out of 100 simply because that first taste did not that first hit did not do this justice the second hit was so tasty a third hit is necessary here we go all righty so i have 10 categories for this uh pre-roll review the west coast we tour official official rating system does 100 points ten categories each uh presentation first you know i look at the ember valley tube and i think you know it is a basic joint but i really enjoy the logo the font and the white and red coloring i think it pops so although it is a standard joint tube um you know plastic not glass i'm gonna give them a decent score uh probably you know somewhere in that eight to nine range um simply because you know i do like their red white and black that they do i think it's attractive appeal same thing ember valley has lots of respect and clout here rightfully so and rightfully earned in california so i do feel like the appeal is there again i'd have to go eight to nine closer to a nine the color you know you talk about the color what is color meaning canvas well when i look at the joint and i look at the color of it you know if this joint were wrapped in the same paper and i could tell that the wheat inside was brown well then the color would be bad so color on this is appropriate for a flower pre-roll there's chunks in here i can see some some good bits of pre-roll is an attractive color you know it could be barf brown or green it's just not attractive so the colors there the smell when i opened the tube i said that there wasn't really a terpe smell but to correct myself there was berry notes there was this you know slight gassy musk maybe not gas but this muskiness and i think that's evident that it is one of the very uh notes or natures of this strain the berry jack so smell i'll give it you know maybe a high six maybe a low seven now when i talk about the taste the first hit not so great and as a consumer that first hit is usually everything that's going to determine whether or not they really want to keep smoking it or how impactful that that experience you know how powerful that memory really is so taste with this i'm gonna give it an you know a nice eight to two you know eight point two five to a five probably closer to eight point two five i like it i wish there was more jack to it um that first hit kind of gave me a little bit of a sour puss taste you know what i mean it just wasn't the best so i'll give it the 8.25 on the taste for this uh it tasted good i don't want you guys to you know be get this get this the wrong way it does taste very good um potency potency potency potency when we're talking potency that's thc 23.1 this is a sativa i'm talking talking talking i got lots of energy i think the potency is right on point um it's hard for me to give it at a 10 out of 10 when the thc scores are low but i do feel that the thc the terpenes are you know creating a nice entourage effect i can feel my heart kind of racing and pumping due to the sativa nature the sativa hybrid nature of this so potency i'll give it the i'll give it the 8.75 maybe even the nine i think it's right up there with where it should be potency-wise for this strain um experience you know i'll give it a nine i'll give it a nine because you know these pre-rolls can range anywhere between 13 and like 18 bucks sometimes you might even pay 20 for the grand but that's that's pretty rare so with that said the experience for me i feel is appropriate for the price appropriate for the smoke the strain i'd say the experience for me is a perfect ah maybe you know i'll give the experience a nine i'll give the experience a nine and the reason why i give it a nine is because again there was some some scooby snacks throughout the j it wasn't twisted perfectly uh the ash is looking good um but that first hit was rough now more information available is a new category this year for us the reason why we added that is because as a consumer i want to be able to look up more information about the strain or more information about the brand you know instagram facebook linkedin etc so lamber valley has a strong internet presence there could always be more information about the strain and pre-rolls you know helping me to guide it you know lighter versus you know the hemp wicks etc so more information available i'm gonna give them a solid eight uh i do feel like more like i say most brands can improve on this more more information should always be available the day that a brand gets a 10 out of 10 is the day that i'm celebrating and filming a video just shouting out that brand hasn't happened and what i recommend i would absolutely recommend this berry jack hybrid from amber valley i feel like it's worth smoking you know 10 out of 10 times i just wish this particular joint was a little bit more less messy you know the pre-roll being kind of undone at the tip kind of impacts it but yes 10 out of 10 i would recommend an overall score for me ah when i taken things all in consideration and just to give it an overall rating i'm gonna stick with a solid nine um i think you know the strain the flower the actual cannabis side of things made it a very positive experience but i definitely feel it's important to highlight some of the other things you know the scooby snacks um you know there could always be more information available online uh there aren't actually any terpenes listed here on the joint tube so i feel like that is kind of a missed opportunity that could be still capitalized on over the you know next few years so overall score 9 out of 10 this is a high quality pre-roll i highly recommend you guys visit any of the dispensaries in norcal or socal that carry amber valley there's literally i believe 150 to 250 dispensaries that carry amber valley maybe more if you guys have any questions about this product any of my ratings or rankings please feel free to drop a comment and send me a dm i would love to talk with you about my thinking about why you know why i chose these numbers and

update on the og kush well guys starting yesterday i switched the light cycle and we are now at a 12 12 light cycle guys we're gonna be putting this bad girl into and we're gonna start with the flowering process all right guys so really what i just been doing is i just been training it kind of just you know bending it down a little as i go tying it down as you can see but what i probably would do is unloosen these branches and just let it grow up like it needs to or just let it do whatever it wants to do um yesterday guys i gave it the first dose of flowering medicine or notes and it's some of this local stuff that's made here in uh my hometown in lansing michigan and this is a a flowering solution guys now i use this on my last grow on two plants and holy smokes let me tell you this stuff is amazing guys um i never used it before so i was kind of skeptical as to what was it going to produce for my yield and what was i going to get out of that certain plant all right like what was my yield going to look like i was pretty nervous because i don't exactly know the product as of last year i didn't know nothing about it i just you know kind of went with it and i was just like hey you know this is made in my hometown i'm gonna just support them you know what i mean so i bought the product and let me tell you guys i was really really satisfied it was pretty pretty impressive results guys off of one plant i'm talking about the nugs were so dense and so just chunky you know and i i was i was impressed guys now i'm having an issue kind of i'm not exactly what the issue is but there's a lot of just dying leaves like i'm talking about literally they're crispy guys so i've just been peeling them off like here look at this i'm not exactly sure what's going on here but this is like all dead guys all of this so i just peel all this [ __ ] off it's just like old branches and [ __ ] i'm i'm just confused i don't know we got a bunch of uh like dead stuff it's all lower action though you know it's not like none of the top leaves are like dying or nothing it's just like um all of the top is still growing and you can still see growth but like like i said see right here some of the bottom where it's just like crispy to where if you touch it it just literally disintegrates um so i just been picking them off guys i'm not exactly sure what the issue is here um i'm not even gonna worry about it though it is what it is and like i said i just keep training these bad boys or bad girls should i say sorry we don't want no guys in here um yeah i'm just bending the branches down guys just kind of you know training it a little nothing nothing crazy i haven't super cropped it or nothing i just simply tied it down with a few tie downs and yep that's it guys so far so good this is like i said day one of flower so let the races begin and we're gonna see what we yield out of this little fella this little lady should i say gotta keep saying fella but yeah guys that's the og kush looking pretty wild right now probably need to do a little defoliation but instead of doing that i just kind of tuck the leaves down a little wherever they're in the way just tuck them down you know and yeah that's it right there guys og kush day one flower under the mars ts 600 doing the damn thing y'all all right so next time stay high stay positive groomies that's the only way to be you already know let's get it", "AgwRYO2zYYI": "welcome back everybody to Maya part three year of a 10 strain indoor grow which is now increased to I believe 13 strains I'm just gonna jump right on into it because I don't want to treat it incredibly long the video this is Sagar Malthus seed strawberry to light third generation clone looking ice in the back over here we got a Cali

hope all right let's start we got some new babies going on this is not sleepy time so don't ask about this this is a bald cush I'm just gonna give it to a friend it was a leftover clone for Mike what is now a filled cloning area with a ball crush the tops of the other plants and other stuff what not least five in the black square pots four inch pots these are TGA so cool corkle regular seeds all five have sprouted for me and it looks like one two three four and all five are sitting out there I believe we also have alpha chronic GM seeds jackpot royale one two and three of those along with a Barney's farm a critical cush if you said go ahead and pop these and we're probably going to be doing a dirt run here pretty soon so all you dirt growers I want to stay tuned to this channel because I will be doing a dirt run which is not like me I am a hydro head as you can see in my flour room but currently let's just say that with all these strains I have right now that I need to determine which ones will be the best ones for me to run just like the others so these are doing these are doing alright I believe it's what day day ten a flower beginning of day eleven just barely into day 11 starting um and I got flower tops just starting on my flowers my plants feels great all right everybody that was pretty much it just a quick little video of all I got going on all uh all of my mother's my babies I am a UH I like to grow from a seed as you can see my friends so I've got some top-shelf genetics here I'm working with and yeah so we're gonna stick to like the cushion the hoji strains this year and maybe a gdp and a plush berry and a cortical and a strawberry diesel and you know whatever I get around but yeah for those who are interested the jackpot Royales those are on Las

your own", "ZMCyCHrK4Yk": "I smoked how you doing I'm back today with normal video and we are going to be taking a look at the famous white widow cannabis train this train is proper old school cool if you've been in Amsterdam in the 1990s you would have encountered this and it's still around today guys so I managed to get myself a lovely sample of this one below but I've got it here for you guys today I hope that you are ready for another iced mocha review and that wherever you are you are going to be smoking along and let's take a look in a bit more detail guys the first thing to say about the white widow is oh my god the buds the buds are fantastic they have been clearly cut to perfection and has left this strangling really really tasty and delicious you get this sort of earthy almost woody smell coming from the buds that just reminds me of an old bag of weed when I was like 15 16 when I first smelled it it might have been this strain or something very similar because this to me is the traditional cannabis smell it's got no some additional smells low fruitiness no berry no hazy it's just got this cannabis stench which is delicious I've actually had a cure in for a little while longer who's ready to go put it in a glass jar and smelling better over the week that I've had it so yeah this is [ __ ] tasty guys and it is a really good kind of a strain and my pleasure to review with you guys today so what we're going to do now is I'm going to show you a close-up of the butt and you can have a look at yourself see just how good it is really really good trim job then really dense I think it's due to the way that it's been imported I don't know where this has come from it wouldn't surprise me if it was someone like Holland it's quite compressed but not too much so the buds are solid but they're not sort of over crushed together and as a result you get this lovely sort of odd formation here yes they probably did look better when they come straight off the plant but I cannot complain with the quality of this bit of cannabis because it looks and smells and tastes absolutely delicious so the overage hairs in this or I'm sure we have close up you've seemed in a lot more detail but looking with my eyes they aren't very apparent they're not like some kind of estranged UCLA while big orange hair some overtaking the bus which somebody mentioned to me could be a sign of heat stress this hasn't got any of that is all quite uniform in color Oh school old school cool is a cross between a Brazilian sativa landrace and a resin heavy indica which is from South India and it's bred quite greenhouse seats and it was bred a long time ago it's one of the most famous strains in the world I know all of this anyway but I just wanted a little bit of backup what I'm going to do today I've actually purchased a new micro Greek and this is my new bomb because that one broke and I'm between bombs at the moment to grind up some of this and we're gonna pack it into the bomb we're gonna let you know how it tastes and what the effects are so gonna grind up fresh grind up the house move these are when they're fresh you know don't get this up a blind off to use their few times look at that it's almost working your hair got using it just gonna keep that spoon look hypnotic [Applause] anyway this but some of this why we don't net and shame to to break up those when we've still got some nice juicy little mugs say goodbye to this mean actually this grown-up ever get stuck with the resinous crystals as you can see it pops out by lighting the grind up because it's nice and compressed and tasted that looks lovely smells like old school kenja without further ado I'm gonna put some in my bomb now my first form of the day and then we can stop letting you guys know what the effects are like goes the only issue with those plastic binders that haven't got a sort of compartment for the week to go through to it you don't catch the leaf or the the stalk sometimes a little bit comes through or stays in there whereas when you use the bigger crime is you've got that extra layer which is sort of usually catches a lot of the leaves that I've got obviously this has been trimmed well so there's not a lot but just a little bit of smoke in the middle was was left in that so just that to watch out otherwise I would have liked my bottom tastes nasty and that's not what we want put some hemp wick here I've stopped opening new hemp wicks I need to find some of my old ones and to be honest I don't know if I see the flavor difference you know I mean I need to do a video comparing it because with a lighter and we have wick icing tastes relatively similar but let's see guys let's see how this one widow tastes through the bomb and I think it goes nice Cheers [Applause] [Music] mmm very smooth very smooth fog the place is incredible like I think because the bonds smaller it seems to be quite a little to taste it'll be better than my previous bomb which I'm really surprised this was eight quid and that's not like a lot to pay for a big glass until I've got this top of the market still just because I saw and it reminded me of my one in Amsterdam and I was like [ __ ] it okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and it trips me this one is brilliant the pole is there three times the size of the other bunk I'll be using even though this is smaller yeah really good experience I can report that that was really tasty I'm still bit ill at the moment as you can hear from my voice I'm still struggling I've got quite a bad cough in terms of smoking it for a bong it's really really smooth it's a lovely flavor it's not harsh it doesn't make you want to cough up it's a pure sort of taste and it is a hybrid of indica and sativa so it's quite a balanced strength so you get the relaxing chilled out feeling of the indica you also do feel quite happy and uplifted as the sativa side of the hybrid kicks in so how am I feeling now the bong is starting to wash over me now and I'm feeling the familiar sort of relaxing feeling spreading across my shoulders and working its way down the double-bond first thing in the morning was a great idea it is poke me up I was tired this morning his self my appetite I'm now gonna go and have some breakfast and it is yeah a nice bit of weight guys so I'm glad that I could share that with you and I really hope that you've enjoyed the white widow review parallels can be drawn I feel between this and the Northern Lights train that I reviewed the other week because they're both old school strains and both of mantastic I'll pick them both up whenever I get the chance to it actually tastes really nice in a vaporizer as well very clean very fresh and that's the sort of thing that you want guys in the daytime smoked because you're not gonna want something that's just gonna blow your head off if you've got stuff to do something like this white widow is a lovely stroke once your thoughts and opinions on this guys have you smoked white widow when was the first time you smoked what we know what did you think let me know you can find us on the web I smoked Marco got UK and I smoked mediator code at UK find us on Instagram Facebook Twitter snapchat we're everywhere hit that like and subscribe button to support the channel and help us grow make sure you tell your friends about I smoked I voice and abyss consumers in the UK will be back soon with another video keep talking guys hey guys so it's been about 20 minutes since sudden bongs how am I feeling I'm feeling great actually and it's not something that I expected to overpower me it is as I keep mentioned in old-school cool and it's a really relaxing but also a lovely mellow strain so I am completely functional while I got the nice relaxing effects of the indica in the uplifting effects of their sativa side from the balance of the cross I don't feel like smashed if you watch my holy grail video last week you'll see their aftermath which shows me looking quite [ __ ] I don't feel like that at the moment I actually feel quite did not but I didn't feel good before but I mean I feel relatively sober still off they're doing two bombs of it so yeah it's a great strain guys I have been smoking it for about a week now and that might be something to do with why my tolerance is probably quite high to this particular strain but yeah in terms of the THC content I wouldn't say that it's a it's up there with some of the strongest strains by is the lovely smoke", "h-sNabzRd1M": "[Music] what's up y'all this is dr. greenthumb it's not necessarily a strain with you because it would be kind of [ __ ] up if I reviewed my own strain cuz I know how good it is and y'all would say oh y'all just show love do your own [ __ ] just corny so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just tell you about it you know I'm saying because a lot of people are curious alright um first of all it's an OG straight up OG Kush and no no cross it's one of our oldest cuts you know I'm Sam back from 97 and it's been a you know very potent strain of OG people have have gotten cuts from it and created their own but ours is called insane oh gee and it is [ __ ] insane so um the latest test that we had on it you know it tested let's see twenty twenty point twenty four point seven for Delta 9 THC and for THC OS twenty one point twenty seven percent no I'm saying and it tested clean as it should test clean because we don't [ __ ] around CBD levels 0.6 and the tetrahydrocannabinol total potential twelve point seven milligrams going out to one point twenty seven percent it's very tasty and potent plant you know when you pop the jar open and you look if whether you have a microscope or not you feel like you stumbled into a diamond mind because it's just so goddamn crystalline shiny and [ __ ] like that [Music] pretty [ __ ] awesome you know I'm saying the the the job we do on this front to back from start to finish his top-notch we don't [ __ ] cut corners we do it right you know if I was reviewing this strain and it wasn't mine I would give it five green thumbs but that's not fair no I'm sad but we're just telling you about this string you know this this is the type of [ __ ] we're like do you smoke too much of it for your first time and you will log out you'll go into sleep mode like your laptop straight off the top then you won't even realize it's happening till somebody [ __ ] wakes you up and you look in the mirror and you got you know designs on your face cuz your [ __ ] homies and homegirls decided to be artistic on your left or right cheek or maybe your forehead no I'm set the flavor is the flavor it's one of the one of the top oh geez out there you know I'm saying there's a lot of great oh geez out there we've definitely told you about a nameless genetics celeb vote G you know in a number of them we just did the Alpha og which was also [ __ ] awesome so you know there's a lot of great OGIS out there and I would like to think and and buy some of what the fans say this is one of the top I mean so if you haven't had some insane OG you should definitely try it if you're in Los Angeles you can go to CHR and most times they have it right now they're sold out but we're about to restock them in just a minute there's not so much I could say about this particular strain we've been doing this a very long time and and you know we've you know honed in on our craft on producing strains this insane og is one of the top shut the [ __ ] up sorry guys sometimes that happens in the temple no people smell this weed down here and they want some and their goal crazy up in the treehouse because you know they're like he's not even doing a spring review menu just telling people about the weed why can't we just go down there and share it with him no one day guys one day but anyway I just wanted to you know check in and let you know about this insane OG no I'm sad and go to odd and the insane oh gee Instagram and check out what shops are carrying it where you get it and along with the concentrates get run with it on top of the line [ __ ] you know I'm saying and you the facts the the people who have actually tried it can actually tell us how many thumbs up you think it should be for you guys who haven't tried it just shut the [ __ ] up with your outside [ __ ] cuz you ain't even really say anything alright the doctor has got to go my hotline is off the hook man thank you very much I would give it a hundred thousand green thumbs as possible but you know hey it's my [ __ ] [ __ ] off if you don't like it [Music]", "xta5lE5Y5xg": "what's up youtube this cap uh back with another video um got v here today what's up y'all uh we got a review for y'all today uh we got stizzy yeah we uh do you remember this authentic oh yeah you got the uh the scratcher on it let you know that it's authentic yeah i got it from uh the remedy room a remedy room in jerupa valley california which is closer it's close to corona california anybody's around those parts and that's where i said but it's a cool little dispensary everybody's nice welcome yeah she go she brought some other stuff back but we just gonna do like one video because i don't want to make the videos too long so we're gonna do the uh stizzy og kush today um so then we're gonna be smoking so you already know if y'all smoking y'all can smoke with us oh and uh i hope everybody's doing good hope everybody having a good day um everything going good with us so but yeah just gonna start this yeah i'm gonna open up the i don't know i just like black i think [Music] uh liquid karma as well so yeah it's been a minute since i had uh since i had a pen yeah that's what it looks like show off the stairs i think that was dirt it was a nice little addition because i know they said like they revamped all their like products and stuff they come with a charger it's pretty simple i like it small it's discreet i mean if anybody know about jewels um or those other little um [Music] this is somewhat like that oh you was reading it already yeah i was gonna read it all right okay so the total tac in this og kush pin is gonna be 89.47 percent uh total cbdn is 3.93 milligrams and it also has i don't even know what this is like at 90. i don't know but it's 89 894.69 milligrams manufactured date for this was 7 31 2020 and it was packaged on 7 31 2020. now you just pop that up yeah mine popped out so be careful when i did it i did it so hard because i couldn't get it at first and mine just popped all the way out the package that's what it looked like look how clear that might be yeah when i do and then when i put it in my pen if i'm taking it in my pocket i put that over there yeah so just just take it i guess that's it like a little magnet you see it lights up at the end when it's you attached this time you move closer oh yeah all right how does it taste yeah i haven't tried the og kush man i was really excited i'm kind of mad like it's it's smooth uh i mean it's strong but it's like a smooth it's smooth i can't really think about the taste it tastes real piney yeah so the reason why i went to this particular dispensary to get it was because on their menu it said they had the og terpene infused and that's like the new ramp version of stizzy pins like their little pies or whatever so i wanted to try with the terpene infused because they said that it makes it taste a lot more authentic like actual flower weed versus just a cartridge but when i got there all they had was just the regular um premium pods so i was mad and didn't get one for myself is that a lot i don't really yeah i mean i'm guessing yeah because somebody's saying like i think i had something like say 70. focus for a second and then you think i hit it too many times because then you know i've been drinking that don't you come on man thank you today there we go yeah but that's what we're working with right there that's so that's all right yeah i got my pen i got a i got granddaddy purple in mine right now oh my god clear look good this is a four gram oh yeah it's a whole grain this uh this is kind of strong i mean it is uh og kush it's that indica the hannah could get you right would they they say anything about it when they talk to you no i just i look at the reviews that's how i like if there's a particular strain i'm interested in i'll look at the reviews and this one had a lot of reviews and they were good reviews it was like 4.5 it's gonna be perfect for me when i'm on set they already got uh stuff up now just make sure you keep this in the car just in case you got charged yet and it i feel like it charges pretty fast yeah and then with these like for me i know the people that hit on these like all day just me this is just like if i'm in like a setting where you know you can't get to it or you don't want to you don't want to be smelling like these that's what these are that's what i use these for real i always prefer the real thing but yeah this is good it's like it's strong like when you inhale it but it's like not like yeah that's what i like i really enjoy about these dizzy pens is and their paws is the fact that it's not like normal vape pens and i don't know if it's just like people to step that game up all around with vape hands but back in the day when we first started with uh concentrates that [ __ ] used to kill your throat but this one so smooth yeah i like how it look what are you saying they had other colors yeah they had like gold silver i think they got maybe a rose gold one they had a camo one but i just thought black that rose gold up yeah black and then it's not so noticeable yeah that's why i got it because it's more discreet [Music] and it looks just like uh yeah that's all it comes with all you need is like it comes with the cartridge the uh you know here's the pin part and then you got the uh little charger i don't know i guess is what eight well yeah you have to buy the pan in the the pie separately you know they sell that separately unless you could get a deal popping off this right here is 50 but i feel like it's worth it especially the way we smoke it in like we smoke it like he said every day all day we just hit it when we can't really hit flower so it lasts a while but the uh one thing i'm waiting on to try is that marathon og yeah yeah yeah and then we got some a couple of nipsy shirts that we're gonna uh show y'all another video i got a hoodie and she got a t-shirt so we're gonna review that probably we'll probably review that tomorrow and i know uh i was supposed to uh remember i said i was going uh chris smoke so i got it uh we're gonna stop on the 20th so that's what uh he's going to stop on the 20th i'm going to be instructed i'm going to be cheering him on from the background hey i tried it man it was harder than i thought it'd be different like i guess i could still move out i just use that time to work out because if i ain't like you just chilling and you trying to uh you know stop smoking for a little minute you know you gotta keep your time it's gonna be yeah so say the 20th i'm gonna stop hopefully i'm gonna try to drink a lot of water i mean i drink water but i don't know like i should so i'm gonna try to just drink strictly water while i'm uh that'll probably speed up speed up the process why ain't gotta really go like 30 days hopefully i just gotta go like 20 15 20. and i'm praying is the last time i ever have to stop for something this is whack that people even have to do that over some marijuana oh i watched the uh movie uh on netflix called uh the platform that's uh oh i i tried watching that movie i did not like that it's the it's a weird it's disgusting it's disgusting but it was good though it was like i couldn't stop watching it like it was good yeah but it's basically about i don't know if y'all seen it yet but it's basically about it's like i guess it's like a prison and um it's like i don't know how many floors it was it was like 300 something floors and this floor has a a big hole in the middle of the floor and you got two people to a floor and that square opening in the middle of the floor they have a table that comes down what do you say it's the platform yeah the platform that comes down with food on it so everybody at the top like who's ever on the top floor has the first uh gets to eat first and then it goes down but you're on that they only had uh i think like they look like they only had like three minutes to eat yeah you don't have a long time to like eat your food like you got to eat quick laura's going to drop to the next floor so this is like a big square platform with a bunch of food on it and you got to uh as soon as it comes on your floor you you eat but you can't take nothing off and keep it like you got to eat it and then once it goes down if you still got any food in your hand you got to put it back on the table remind you like people eating it and just stuff coming out of their mouths everybody's eating from the same the same like plate basically you're eating everybody's leftovers food falling out their mouth and spitting on it like yeah so it's just like it's a disgusting move but then it bothered me it was that open square because you know i like if you're in a building and it's like i don't know how many stores like 200 stores or whatever that's terrible and you like at the top four and you look down the middle and there's nothing keeping you from falling yeah like it's just open like if you're a sleepwalker that's over with that's that's it and see and i think that's when i would become a sleepwalker i think it'd be stressing me out so much in my mind that i'll probably do something like that when i'm asleep yeah it was a crazy movie i think i made it and uh and i watched it when it first came on netflix i made it to like the maybe not even the middle part of the movie but i just it was so slow i mean it was an interesting movie but it to me it was like slow and weird i just yeah it's kind of one of those psychological moves because the angle i did not understand the ending so i didn't i couldn't get that far i was like and then you had people committing suicide because like each floor whatever floor you're on you're on that floor for a month you're only on that floor for a month so uh i guess they put some kind of gas in the room and it you know it puts you out and when you wake up you're on another floor so people will and the moment when everybody wakes up you're gonna hear people screaming because people realize what florida on because if you're on like the lower floors you don't by the time that platform gets you all the food's gone so yeah so basically the higher the floor you are the better your life's gonna be yeah so right that that i don't want to get out of home i feel like we just said the whole movie it's disgusting as far as like the food and but it was good i mean i enjoyed it you got a weak stomach that ain't none you won't watch though yeah she watched the live uh the movie alive on netflix before i said last night you like yeah it was good i feel so bad for him [Music] uh the train of busan that the part two they just netflix say they getting it next year i ain't trying i can't wait that yeah why that long what is it like it was a real movie that came out there it's already been out like i think uh it's an asian movie i think i think it came from it was made in korea yeah i ain't lying nobody when it comes to uh horror movies the asians make the uh they make the best movie because train the booze to me that was great that's probably the best zombie movie i've ever seen that's great and you know it's good when it's like when you got when it's in another language so you got to just read the captions yeah you know it's good when you don't even realize you even reading anymore but that's a lot of that's like the best one i've ever seen out of all the zombie movies i've seen that's the best one the award was he was good yeah they taking too long they they supposed to double back on that one that's right that's the only thing i hate about sequels bro they don't know they take too long to put them out yeah i won't be understanding why they like avatar it's been like man that's been 10 years since the uh it's got to be because remember lola was trying to go halloween as natori i think that was her name but it's supposed to come out next year at the avatar part two yeah i'm gonna have to watch them but i guess maybe that's why they do it and make you watch the first one all over again i haven't seen the first one like three or four times already but i know with that type of that type of effects on that move i know it's gonna take a long time man all right yeah well i guess we're gonna end it on that note then cap high man we ain't like we've been smoking yeah man let's just hit this pen we're drinking uh whatever that is what is it called liquid karma yeah so we got some gummies too yeah i think we're gonna uh we could uh we'll probably shoot another video today later tonight when uh this one come when i come down because i ain't gonna laugh and i feel like i just knew i seen that these all right i like these y'all they probably annoyed with the trying to get it focused yes i'm sorry i just wanted y'all to be able to see it come closer yeah oh yeah shout out to everybody i really appreciate y'all showing uh love on my videos you know the comments the likes y'all welcome to leave comments uh you know

like a meet and greet but yeah i really appreciate all the support um but yeah we're gonna we're probably gonna shoot another video tonight and then we'll do some more tomorrow we got some stuff to

don't give them too much coming soon next video yeah that's uh that's it all right let's see we'll catch y'all in the next video peace", "0JeMer--TB4": "hello and good day welcome to the medical cannabis review I'm your host mr. crazy sim by five thank you for joining us this is my first review and what I hope to be a long series of medical cannabis reviews first I'd like to say that this is these reviews are designed for medical cannabis unit users only that is people that are legally entitled to use cannabis for medical purposes all views and opinions are my own and these videos are intended for educational and informational purposes only so with that being said let's get down to the review today we'll be looking at purple OG Kush which is a pretty famous medical strain or popular medical strain I should say I've gotten it a few times for myself it's my go-to strain for nighttime for sleeping now you might find it to be a little bit too heavy for daytime use it can induce sleeping within 30 minutes to an hour I'd say it induces yawning and it makes your eyes very heavy and basically all you want to think about is sleep at that point just to quickly talk about its genetics as far as I know it's purple purple Afghani and OG Kush it makes for a fairly strong body stone you probably won't feel like going anywhere or doing very much and I would definitely suggest starting off with a small amount well with any strain you should probably start off with a small amount and wait 10 to 15 minutes I would say to see if there how it affected you and if you need more at that point then you can certainly other uses not to be ignored on this strain is some moderate pain relief as well as help control depression it definitely puts you in a happier mood as well as anxiety and stress there pretty much melts stress away one thing it's not that strong of a muscle relaxer as a strain itself it is actually fairly potent like I'm saying you might want to limit how much you take and take some and see how it goes from there another thing this is going to help with sleep apnea as well if you suffer from that in closing I would leave you off with a rating which is going to be four and a half stars out of five this is a great strain I highly recommend it if you see it and you suffer from anything that I've been talking about I would definitely pick it up even if you don't suffer from those things and you're looking for an evening time medicine this this is probably gonna be your one to try out so that's it for this review I want to thank you very much for joining us feel free to like and subscribe and I will be back in a few days with another strain review thank you very much as if mr. crazy 7x5 for the medical cannabis review", "a6Z9Ot5eGvc": "social girl YouTube supersmoker just want to do a quick pre-harvest this is the go gog and this is my seed from the original go gog but i'm still it's still no gog so i got me a little magnifying glass here let you guys get some trike shots get up there get close so this is one of my favorite strands i have in my garden right now but it's definitely some fire i'm on week 8 and a half and

yeah pretty good harvest definitely a good fire thanks a lot for watching guys", "VqRXAxmpl-o": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene this is episode 5 in our 2020 strain review series this week featuring a strain we like to call slur Akane this is a purple punch cross and it is absolutely fantastic on paper we're gonna try it out let you know what I think of it right now here on the ice smoke channel join me as we talk about the background of the Slovak own cannabis strain so this strain has been bred by in-house genetics dos Eidos crossed with purple punch is the cross that results in the slur akane it is not available as feminized seeds according to the seed find a website and people's reports of it I've read some reviews of it online seem to love this strain as an afternoon even in smoke very indica dominant apparently there's some berry notes that are going to come through as well this is actually in a biodegradable bag which you don't see all the time so it's not in a glass jar but the bag is biodegradable so we're not going to complain there I want a big up right own extracts made some extract out of this but not before I've got to grab a little bit just to make sure that I could feature it in the review video so thank you very much my purple punch and dosa dose I am NOT the biggest fan of dos DOS it looks amazing 10 out of 10 bag appeal and people seem to like it but not my favorite strain purple punch on the other hand I absolutely love Larry og of crossed with granddaddy purple I think it is and that is a phenomenal strain granddaddy purple you literally taste them purple hoping that some of that does carry down into this slower cane I don't know anything about the growing method I don't even know who the grower of this one is really for this channel let's talk about the appearance of this cannabis stroke getting this out of its bag then been a long time since I had weed in a plastic bag I will tell you that usually we're talking glass jars sometimes my lower packs but I like to biodegrade bonus the first thing to mention is it is absolutely caked in trichomes it looks frosty and it's frosty as you like really really strong tricone coverage the buds aren't actually what I expected them to look like and I think that might be something to do with the grow itself the reason being if this is an indica dominant strain so I wouldn't expect these small sativa looking lugs or smaller buds this and this was run into extract which is why there's still bits of stalk it doesn't matter as much when you're extracting it and running it through a Pho other than the bits of stalk I think that the coloration and trichome coverage on this one's wicked it's just the look of these buds sort of suggests that something might have gone wrong during the growing cycle maybe a lot left on when it should have been or come on when it shouldn't have done something like that actually looks a lot like weed you pick up in Amsterdam and I actually did ask the guy was low is this import and is that nice grown in the UK I see this all the time when I go to them this is like haze it's like what the standard damn haze would look like right nuclear green it's got a real skunky look to it but then just full of frost frosty skunky look to it pistols are a muted brown color not even very visible actually looks alright not ten out of ten by any stretch of the imagination not the best looking but still got a nice look to it just hasn't developed in the way I would have expected let's talk about the smell of this lower cane so the online information when you look across multiple website it says creamy OG with an undertone of tropical blueberries now when I'm smelling this slur Akane and particularly this batch of it I'm not sure the tropical is coming through so much it's definitely got a creaminess to it and there it is you've got the gasp of the og and then just a hint of that that blueberry sort of or berry not even blueberries just berry just a sort of fruity mix hint right at the end of the inhalation eat or breathe it nice and deep to try and get that not super smeller like some weight I've opened a bag in a bit like whoa throwing smell up my nostrils like this is not the same even sort of really squeezing it it's not got a lot so that's her potential that is coming out and again put that down to this particular batch don't put it down to the strain itself I'm sure there's some Terp heavy slower cane out there on paper dicey does cross with purple punch sounds great but I do think that don't see those crosses can be a bit watery I don't know about you guys let me know what you think of this in the comments but I really don't like dough lotto and actually smell wise the slower cane isn't really overwhelming we-we've smell so I wonder whether that's gonna translate into the taste speaking of taste let us move on and talk about the taste of the slower cane cannabis strain two methods of consumption for the slower king my trusty chongs Widowmaker bun my mighty vaporizer were smoking it and vaping it should give me a good idea of the flavor that this bud has to offer let's just break some of these stalks out because every single little bud has got a little Stoke attest I don't want to be smoking there this smells like an OG mixed with parma violets or lavender mmm it's really nice actually it's not strong and it's not super apparent in your nostrils this isn't what I would deem offensive smelling cannabis if you don't like weed and someone had this in their pocket you might not even realize but whipping it nice and closely you do tend to get that creamy OG violet pom and violet stroke allowing the types meal we're gonna smoke some we're gonna avoid some we're gonna see how it treats us in this section let's just get everything ready let's prepare our vaporizer and then that way I can turn it on because it's gonna take a couple of minutes and what that's heating up we're going to smoke the bong and I'll see you Oh other side Cheers [Music] that went down really smoothly a lot smoother than I was actually secretly expecting it to go down I did think having a look at the appearance and smell of it that it might not have been the smoothest smoke but that shows me that appearance and smell is not everything that went down super smoothly so much so that we're gonna squeeze another one in and I'm we got to the vaporizers ready Oh got a little bit of time my dad would do it join me for this and I'll see you all on the other side [Music] super smooth smoked cool doesn't really make me need to cough there's not much flavor to it that's what it's lacking in the Turks in the vaporizer it's got kind of an old-school og that's really interesting I had that taste for years what is that it's got kind of like a traditional we taste in the Veda just kind of tastes like like Jim realized cannabis taste but in a nice way I mean I like the flavor of cannabis in general so I'm typing I'm feeling it trying to pick out and see whether that any of that violet or the Parma violets or like the lavender final it's the color not a flavor Tyler what you saying I'm talking about lavender palm of violets is the sweet what flavor it out I'm trying to get that now through the vapor but I can't detect it so much yeah this one hasn't got a lot of Terps in its not reached it's sort of Terp potential and I don't know whether this is me having been fortunate enough to be smoking nothing but no-till for the past I don't know three or four months so I've really gotten a full flavor of potential of the weed I've been smoking I'm not getting that from this so much he still tastes clean that's the really good thing about it it just doesn't taste like much you know I mean and this could well be part of this lower cane flavor so what I want to know from you in the comments if you've tried it because I get wateriness from dalat oh right don't lotto don't doze Crosby gelato this is dosed doze across with purple punch tastes a bit like watered-down purple punch you know I mean maybe it's the dosa doze that I'm not enjoying let's talk about the effects of this slower Akane as I talk to you now and as I grind up for another bomb the effects are starting to kick in this is an indica dominant body lead hi it's gonna relax you it's gonna make you feel good and I'm starting to feel that right about now actually yeah I'm feeling a nice sort of body lead but also slightly cerebral like just nice this just washing over my body and a calm just washing over my mind actually in fact kind of notice in different sounds in the air a bit more definitely kind of it's an enjoyable smoke right from how this high starting to kick in this is the first time I've ever smoked it never smoke slower came before I haven't smoked any in the build-up to this review just read about it I've got no resistance to this profile so it should hit me quite hard for what it is as opposed to think I've been smoking for a week now that being said I'm feeling a niceness just wash over me a mildness a kind of relaxation even in smoke don't turn off and we're done with you and I like to smoke invite one after the other cuz it gives me kind of a sense of you kind of feel it as your vape and you feel the high creeping in if you just vape on its own you don't really feel it creeping in with if you get bummed first and then hit the vaporizer whoosh you get a nice little nice little right maybe sort of a mild tiredness washing over me at this point it's considering it is still or it's just about the afternoon when I'm filming this feeling very very chilled out could definitely sit and watch TV or play some video games and it's a nice high you know it's got that kind of and I guess this comes from the granddaddy purple side of the lineage that kind of like hug hi where you kind of feel like like a warm hug do you not I mean it's a really nice really nice sort of feeling I think it goes all the way back to the Afghan strains and then into things like lavender into granddaddy purple through that and then through the slower okay so yeah overall effects wise I'm really happy with this higher it's a nice distinguishable high from other highs you know it doesn't just feel samey it doesn't just feel like I'm up or I'm really there's a lot to it it's complex you know and I like that about it that about covers the effects unless something's up so today we've been enjoying the slower cane at cannabis Train not sure on the grower of this one but I must say is not the not scored top marks from me on this occasion despite the appearance of it being a little bit smaller and the smell of it being a little bit less chirpy than I was expecting the high of it was still really really nice now flavor-wise a little bit on the wall to reside and I'm wondering whether that's such an egg thing that those dos talk to me about dicing those in the comments come on I want to hear from you don't heed those experts effects wise I love the effect of this one nice warm relaxed body lid - a nice and chill in my mind as well just gonna smoke this bong join me for this one and I'll see you all on the other side [Music] yeah just like watery type you know it could be like literally part of it interest in it stuff I like it but it's not getting top marks because of a couple of factors that we've mentioned in the review but what do you think of the slur Akane and what do you think of this strain review do leave your comments below and remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you're enjoying our content to help the channel grow that's it for

cannabis straight reviews so today we are going to be reviewing crunchberries by our friends over at abundant organic crunchberries is an indica dominant hybrid that is a cross between the ever so popular DJ shorts blueberry and triple o G so I cannot wait to try this strain so before I get a look at it I'm going to bring it up on the screen for you guys so you can check it out first and then we're going to look at it together okay so you guys just had a chance to check it out so stoked that we had two huge buds to display for you guys so let's go ahead and let's check out this stuff and see what it is all about so let me pull out one of these bad boys here and I'm going to cover my face so hopefully the the viewfinder finds the bud here but let's take a look at it here this is like almost white it is so frosty you guys like barely any green left on here and a great proportion of hairs this absolutely looks hand trimmed and just back fat THD crystals like there go Hobbs on this stuff you guys the only thing I'm gonna say initially bad about this is like where the terpenes why is there no smell to this but straight when I pop the top like when you're paying upwards of $50 an eighth for ganja like this there's got to be chirps straight out of the jar there has to be now I will tell you guys that when I ground up the herb there was this insanely sweet aroma that just filled up my nose and it was so good it's like a flavor that I am all about so obviously you know the berries is in the name it's got that sweet berry flavor so man I am really stoked to try this out abundant organics you know puts out some of the most fiery looking dank that we try here on our Channel and the Terps once I ground this up we're like right up my alley so I can't wait to try this out so today we are going to be enjoying this out of my Arizer extreme Q vaporizer as you see it is set to 375 degrees so it's going down to the in betweens exactly set the 375 but it's going to she wait a degree or two on either end there as it's trying to come to temperature but then I've got the Arizer extreme queue desktop vaporizer fed in to my scientific inhalations triple filter bubbler we're leaving the first filter out there which is going to be the where we would normally put charcoal or carbon but there's not going to be in the ash that's getting in the second filter which is the water I've got some brand new purified water in there as well as the third chamber which is an organic cotton filter that's going to filter out any leftover impurities it's going to ensure that I get the absolute best taste possible from this crunchberries by abundant organic so if you guys are out there and you are ready to go get the lighters dip the babes fire it up get the Pens fired up because we are going to kick this party off right now okay so I really didn't get much paper but what I did get was like buttery buttery smooth Oh max I'm not even gonna wait to dive in for the second one because I want that flavor so so bad like chasing the dragon you guys let's get it oh mama that sweet sweet flavor and that was like you guys but it literally was butter now the one thing I want to note about this is that flavor that sweetness it's very very subtle and I know like it's got triple og in there so it should have some cushy aroma but I'm not getting any cushy flavor from this just those sweet terpenes which I personally am absolutely a huge fan of now that first or a second drip I should say it was really my first good rip so I am so stoked to try the rest of this out but while I'm finishing out this bowl I'm gonna bring it up on the screen under 25 times magnification macro lens so you guys can see what this stuff looks like up close and personal so here comes the crunch berries by abundant organics alright so here it is this is the crunch berries by abundant organics and even these orange hairs have crystals on them you guys that's unbelievable this stuff is as frosty as it comes it's very very fluffy not dense at all but this stuff is just covered in trichomes and THC crystals all right so you guys just had a chance to check out this crunchberries by a button or organics I just finished Wow my little sash here and I want to talk about it what were the highs no pun intended what were the lows and let's go ahead and let's just get right into it you guys so I'm actually I'm feeling pretty darn good I'm not gonna lie this is like just a very very clean hi now the thing I want to say about this just first and foremost right because this is supposed to be a 70/30 hybrid right to me this is coming on like a 50/50 hybrid so like you know not to energise not to in the couch relaxed for sleepy feeling so I'm getting kind of just a 50/50 I would actually think this is like really good for like you know doing something active I've got you know the brain is like still going but it's it's subdued so it's like it's it's actually it gets like a perfect 50/50 blend and I really really dig that the flavor definitely came out more you know as the session progressed so that sweet sweet flavor did come on and it lasted pretty much the whole bowl now it did get more and more faint obviously as things went on but like there was some staying power to those turkeys in the actual taste which of kaash now I'm like thinking about him like I'm actually very very pleased with that now let's talk about the looks one more time and before we do that I'm gonna bring it up on the screen one more time for you guys to check out okay so you've seen it a couple times here and I mean it I I'm gonna tell you guys it's awesome it's absolutely phenomenal like abundant organics puts out in my opinion some of the dankest looking herb like it's just great great proportions and the crystals are really fat no excess leaf material on here from what I can see and gosh it was just it was manicured so so well they didn't run this through a machine or anything like that and manna I'm just god I'm like sitting in like where are the terpenes you guys where are the terpenes you guys that just absolutely kills me and I know they're there because they're there when you break this stuff up and it's really fluffy it's not actually this is pretty dry to be honest you guys it's not ultra ultra fresh so you know not but that's a good thing or a bad thing since I'm vaping it god I love the look at this stuff you guys and I'm really I'm going back and forth on this ganja because I really do like this high is actually it's very enjoyable this is like just the good daytime daytime strain but because it doesn't have the terms in the smell like the smell is such a huge huge thing but I've enjoying the high and I really enjoyed I enjoyed the taste even though it was kind of subtle you know so I think I would put this just you know on the safer side you know - I give him the benefit enough I'm in-between here's where I'm at you guys this is where I'm at so let me talk through it with you guys in my head here I'm in-between a seven and a half and an eight okay so this is an absolute absolute recommend like I would recommend picking up some of this crunchberries this is like on the premium end you're gonna pay between forty-five to fifty and eight pre-tax for this stuff so it is not cheap but I really I liked the flavor this highest enjoyable but to not have any smell yeah you know what I can't do it I got to give it a seven and a half you guys to not have smell straight out of the jar I can't give it you know if it has to smell no joke if this have a smell it would be between an eight and a half maybe even more than that honestly because I am enjoying this it's really clean I know they purchased this very very well gotten flushed and all that crap out at the end of the process and it was cured a great manicured great seven and a half around here is actually a really really great score but I'm gonna stick it in a seven and a half because I know that they can do better on those terms and I hope the next round whole time if I see this again I'm gonna pick it up so you see this crunchberries buy a bunch of organics you got these jars sick it's like the sickest jar is like the only other jars that I've seen doper than these are the true infusions and like I love love bees so it's going to be seven and a half for the crunch berries from bunch organics from us until the next one you guys take care of yourselves and one another you guys serious piece [Music]", "Y7PEFthrmmk": "what are you two coming into another

ten easy eight and a half nine because it's really could you see close-ups is again multi finest say no more yeah I mean as we go that I say it's little mystery about and this and the strength no one is quite sure what the cross is or some people must be that if you know and I say something wrong please leave in the comments that I say in the last time and yet you know I like learn if it's

Fernando Valley og and I picked this one up from nature's wonder out in Apache Junction last week this is wonderful stuff man I've been hitting all kind of OGIS lately and this is probably one of my favorites man it's a sativa dominant a hybrid or strain and it's an OG Kush phenotype San Fernando Valley og and it's really wonderful from what I found out from the dispensary THC it's in the 80s so if it's high man it's strong I love this and we're gonna hit this right now this is all I got left I was gonna break this down into like two small doubts by Freya trick and open your little ones so anyhow let's get started because this is a wonderful straight and other one medicating with this it's gratefully going places and doing things and probably Greek it's a wonderful waking bake man I

have a good day [Music] you", "iX3jNEKtFxo": "today we're reviewing assassin og also known as sole assassin assassin oh geez an indica hybrid created by the Seoul assassins crew the Seoul assassins were wrapped collective with some pretty recognizable groups like Cypress Hill and the transplants the group kept the genetics of assassin under wraps although it's widely known as a close relative of OG Kush you can tell right away just by the look in the feel of the buds they've got a predominant red hairs throughout and that sticky Kush like texture to them quite similarly to the OG strains assassins known to have a spicy pine like flavor I'm definitely getting that sweet pine taste and even noticing a slight taste of mint you the throat it is rather intense you can really feel it all throughout the nose in the eyes it's very pungent my favorite part about assassin is it's very noticeable aftertaste of lemon and pine my recommendation is to smoke this strain out of a water pipe or a joint something with a full-bodied hit rather than a vaporizer which I don't think would do this strain quite enough justice so after a few minutes to let the set in I've started to notice the body hi is very distinct I noticed we're leaf in stress both mentally and physically throughout the shoulders and all down the arms overall quite a Content stress-free pretty drowsy hi I I'd say great for a nightcap before bed this is putting me quite down very satisfied with the strain overall if like myself your fan of OG Kush I would highly recommend assassin for a good twist on a nice old classic thanks for joining us guys we'll see you next time on Boutique cannabis reviews", "GD9Wf7pxU5U": "and what's up you guys shadows here again with another episode of shadows we'd review now today on em so we're gonna be going over the crown Oh G by Crown genetics this one's weighing in at twenty-eight point two six percent THC and it's fifty five bucks for the ACE it doesn't show if it's got CBDs in it or not this one they don't the lab doesn't really do any of that stuff unfortunately so you can't really get any lower this down so you can see a little better but yeah the lab unfortunately doesn't give you any of that information it just tells you the THC so on this one that's weighing in at twenty-eight point two six percent THC it's fifty five bucks for the eighth and it's an indica now in the beginning of the season when these first were getting tested at the dispensaries this Crown genetics was one of the best it was awesome and then the Maven came in and kind of knocked it a little bit and then the LA Kush with the red and the blue boxes knocked a little bit and then these guys were gone for a while and they came back when they came back they don't have the smell that it used to unfortunately I've already had some of these and tried them and they don't smell as strong as they used to they're just as high a THC content but they're not as smelly and it's not nearly as good as they used to be and let me tell you a couple of reasons why that can be a couple of reasons now that we've gone over in the growing videos is if you get a clone which is a mother plant from a seat you cut a little piece off of there and then you put it in cloning gel and you clone that that's called a clone that is just a piece taken off of the mother plant imagine the mother plant has four helixes of DNA when you take a clone you're cutting it in half then the next season if you take a clone off the clone you cut that in half so you're losing genetics so you'll lose the the Pope not necessarily the THC content because you can still get a real frosty with artificial nutrients and stuff but the actual smells the flavors the high everything about it will diminish the loop over each season and I know this because I've been growing for years I've done it on cyclical cycles where I constantly have things flowering and you have to have mother plants and if you want to keep your genetics after like five years all my plants all my mother plants I see them I get the best of all the seeds I grow all the seeds out see which ones are the stinkiest and the best and then I breed those mothers that's how you get better genetics and that's how you keep your genetics if you don't do that and you keep taking clones of clones of clones of clones of clones what used to be a good stream like this original crown was awesome when it first came out each time I get it each batch has been getting less and less and less smelly less and less good less and less of a high so hopefully you guys over at Crown genetics give me a call hit me up on the comments I'll teach you I'll show you how to do it I've been doing it my whole life I've owned the biggest dispensary in the country I'm retired I'm doing this for fun I let me help you out I'm like I help out a bunch of companies I won't I don't like to give names because I don't want anybody to think that they don't know what they're doing but come to a master come to a professional I have the best weed I know how to do it the best hit me up give me a comment down below I'll talk to you directly and show you how to get the genetics back from where you're at right now because it's still possible to seed what you have right now get the best mothers from there get the best others from there and you don't have to get a male plant to breed with a female plant to get your stuff to take to get seeds those will make 50 50 seats if you want feminized seeds which there's a seed that's guaranteed to be female or at least 90% to be female you get a hermaphrodite plant and you breed that with a female plant how you get a master to clamp there's a few different ways you get a female plant and you stunt it by either changing the light pattern in the middle so all of a sudden it was going on 24 hours and all of a sudden you switch it to you know 16 you know on and then the rest of the day off or you and you can do it that way and there's some nutrients I've gone over this in my growing videos but it's very important to make sure that you keep your genetics going because this was a great strain and now these people are losing and they need to do what said it and seen it get the mother get another mother start the one mother so it's from athletic and breed it with that female once you do that the seeds from that female are gonna be feminized seeds and those are all going to be of a semi similar genetic once you get those and you breed those now this takes time but this is how a professional does it and this is how you keep your stuff once you have this all laid out and you're doing it cyclically it's not that hard and I've done it like I can prove to you how easy it is if you just follow my program but on here you just gotta keep the genetics okay I won't go over any more with it you check out my my growing videos and I'll explain more if you're interested in that but that is why this one is getting worse each time this one I shouted out in the beginning saying it was awesome but each time I've gotten it it's gotten less and less good and that is why and so today we will unbox it again see if maybe they're going back to the better ways or maybe it's getting worse and worse like it has been let's find out today you guys this is crown tonight this is 55.8 this is the most expensive like they charging a lot for this egg it's gotta be the best so I'll put in it right now on camera we will unbox this together and see what exactly you're getting for fifty five bucks cuz that's fifty five bucks plus tax so what are you look in there like I said before if you grow up with good nutrients it will grow really good and really frosty and still have the same THC percentage but it won't be as smelly and it won't be as good and won't get tears high if you do not keep the genetics strange the genetic strands completely so we're dumping loose that we'll see what you get I can tell you right when you open the jar I smell nothing they're gonna doesn't smell like anything but it already did so when you lean in to smell it it smells like dry tea honestly there's no smell in here at all anymore even when you go right up on it and look at these necks the medics are incredible this was a great strain a really good string and it'll still get you hi then you can smell it a little bit we'll crack it but even then cracking the biggest best nugget into berry smell so honestly this crown genetics is going down if they do not improve the genetics the way I said no matter what nutrients you put in there it's not gonna not gonna be any better so please crown genetics you guys got good genetics don't lose them don't screw them up this is what people been doing for years they get a good strain they make a good strain and they're selfish with it and they don't know how to keep it and then they lose it and now nobody has so don't do that please listen to my advice and fix your bud okay cuz this is great bud and it should be charged fifty five if it was the way it used to be but now unfortunately it's I don't think it's worth fifty five I would say maybe the middle range bracket not the lower bracket because of how much trichome and how nice these mugs look but yeah it's definitely not stinky like it used to be so from there let's check it out under the microscope and see what exactly we're looking at now as far as trichomes go this is outstanding there they are definitely trying to make this the best bud they can as far as nutrients and handling and that part of it goes but that doesn't mean anything if your genetics are dying each each batch so like look it on here let me show you how much trichome look at how much Trico look at all those heads they get all those globules there's a ton of trichome on this and a ton of unbroken trichome there's lots of the globules on there still you know which is the heads on the top of the ends the little hairs little things that look like crystals with the heads on it that means it hasn't been handed too much so this stuff has really been handled good it's been fed the right nutrients everything's good on it the cure is even good you can tell by the the squeeze and that how the resin is still on your fingers but it's still crunchy everything is great about it but a little much you know you can't smell can't smell it and you used to be able to smell it when you opened it it's not but just within like four batches they've lost it so hopefully they can bring back its up let's give this one a try shall we you guys want to grab your bonds at home that's all take one together clean my bong out so I'm gonna clean that bowl out real quick oh and I got a new ball if you notice usually I use my three foot roar ball but these guys over at the cave shouted me out and sent me a three foot rub um now this three foot roll bong is supposed to replace my enroll because they're like dude your roar is like 20-something years old dude that thing is worth a lot of money you shouldn't use that you what if you break it in all this stuff so they sent me this bong to use and it's it's very similar doesn't seem quite as good as the roar but the price is like one-third the price of the roar so you know not too bad so I'm giving these guys a shout-out thank you for the bomb you guys are awesome and let's give it a try shall we so we're gonna get that best not the one that we were looking at under the microscope crack out that you're the sickest knight in the jar first time it's probably been handled by fingers guys got your pieces at home to do this together right let's do this gives you a rush it's still gonna give you a head rush it's got high THC percentage and it's still a decent strength let the flavor there's no flavor there anymore flavors gone unfortunately it just tastes like smoke yeah this crown OG unfortunately was a really good strain the meds look really good it's really frosty it'll get you high still but there's no flavor anymore if you're looking for flavor try a different string type of le cush red box for the blue box or the Maven OG or something but this one I wouldn't say it's worth 255 anymore it's probably bumped down the like 45 or in the mid range somewhere so if you get a chance this crown OG is good but if they have an LA cush or they have a maven something like that try that instead to this and doesn't have to smell over the flavor anymore you guess so that's my review on this one I'll see you guys later late", "C176A4KbkgA": "good morning July 27th 2015 about 15 to 9:00 in the morning you can see it's this garden is just about to get sunlight it'll start getting light at around 9:00 and by 9:15 or 9:30 it will be fully engulfed in bright sunlight which will last until early evening this tree here to the to the west will begin to shade this at little after 5 o'clock around 5 o'clock and also this tree to the south begins to cached on this spot in about mid-september so we always have had a problem with bringing plants into fruition completely mature complete maturity before the sunlight diminishes and destroys the quality so in the past I've used flower and initiator saved I turn Romana in July 10th I mean it's you the August 10th and that will usually bring in the crop before the end of September now this year I've added a new experimental feature we have these 30 watts outdoor LED lamps there are 5500 k rated there these are the the cob type very powerful LED lights I've got some footage here I'll show you in a minute how this looks at night and it's amazing that these two 30 watt lights can like this very well and the whole intention of this is to extend the daylight period to roughly 17 hours a day and this will allow the plants to develop more completely during these next two weeks before the flower initiator comes on and also when I switch over on August 10th when the night becomes 10 hours long I turn the flower initiator on and the plants respond as if the nights of 12 hours long and they go into flower now with the light extension with these 30 watt lights I expect that I will have a stronger flowering response than I have in the past and anyhow we'll see how this proceeds again this is a new experiment and it should bear fruit it's looking pretty healthy for the most part pretty flawless just put some metal stakes into the ground and attach this metal lightweight metal framework to hang these to spin these and it just has a 50 foot extension cord coming down from the small greenhouse above and then just a means of splitting the energy to the two lights and the timer's up and underneath as I said so that it's not exposed to the weather out here you show a little bit of this after the lights come on later really quite right for just 60 watts of energy I hope believe it's adequate to keep the phytochrome switched into the act of innate state and to allow for the data to appear quite longer for plants and actually us so some trimming techniques in the morning Sun sights sunshine is hitting the garden area the lights are still on they'll be shutting off in a few minutes they come again on in the evening at around 7 o'clock and stay on until 10 o'clock they come on in the morning at about 5:30 so it's giving it a pretty long day and we'll see some benefits from this I'm sure most of these plants are a new variety this year I should say a variation on an old variety I've taken my my grew strain that I've been making over the years been breeding in lots of different strains all the major land races are have been represented at one point or another and it's very good on its own and now we've blended it's with us San Fernando Valley oh gee and so we'll see what the results are we're hoping that the fast-growing large yielding big buds from my variety will fuse with the og and create a really nice combination of the two in terms of flavor yields and density of Bud now an observation see these lower branches down here that are getting quite long already trying to reach for sunlight and throughout the plant you'll notice that these branches are elongating in the past I've used a technique where you just reach into the center of the cluster and grab the little bud in the center and and do that and that will split the buds at the ends it cost two buds instead of one the end buds are always the better buds well this year we're gonna try a different kind of experiment I'm gonna today I'm gonna cut half of the branches on this plant back I'm gonna cut them back to the second or third at the bottom the third internodal set here Oh on the waist and I'm gonna cut half the branches on the plant back to the second or third module longer at little lower shorter as they go to the top oh my god that seems horrible I know but in any case I'm gonna go through the whole plant into half and when those plants start to develop more growth on the tips then I will go back and cut off the other half I'll do this over the next two or three days this will double the number of buds will shorten the branches so that when they become long they will not be so heavy that they drag down onto the ground and usually the in buds are the best so and I found in the past that if they're closer to the main stem they tend to become larger and better buds and they don't look too good at first after you've paired them down but they'll respond really nicely in a few days bud so this is an experiment this year you can watch this one as well and we'll see how the combination of the lighting and the trimming technique pan out that's a 35 year old plant that's just going into the flower for the first time this year and then we'll have another report and probably two weeks not a lot it's going to happen for until August 10th I'll give a report when the flower initiators come on and show you how to plant how tall the plants are at that point sayonara you", "-mz1st38oS4": "what's up YouTube big Tom science the pre 98 bubba and indeed it really is the pre 98 it does exist and it was actually a d'assaut this bud comes from my clone that I originated in PB and somebody

these don't know what these are these are cannabis infused rolling papers it says right here 5 cannabis infused rolling papers there's a flavor it's reckless rainbow so I don't know what that's supposed to mean or what that's supposed to taste like but I hope it tastes really fruity it's a 5 pack made with shatter Lumpy's flowers I don't know what that means but lumps that is Lumpy's flowers that's like the instagrams I guess it's probably like the shower what the shower was made from their flowers so thankfully the Lumpy's flower lip ticket laboratory so that's where you could probably get these on Instagram to is if that's there at lift ticket laboratory it says there is 15 milligrams of THC per rolling paper and 0.0 21 milligram CBD that's probably how much like it takes you to get like a decent high because you got to count the fact that we're gonna stuff this with weed and there's 75 milligrams of THC in the whole package and zero point I don't even read that I'm CVD yeah so that's pretty lit you know what's funny I've been calling these lit take it's for like a really long time for a couple months because I've had these for a while now guys shout out to sack beds nine one six they gave this to me to shout them out and try them and all that but like you don't want dude I've had these for so long and I have been calling them the wrong damn name they're called lit lift tickets that I've been called Himmel it tickets I'm freakin dead it smells like [ __ ] shattered it smells like IRAs okay so there's like a sheep in between them all that shows you that they're sticky is how this is sick okay so you rip you take it off of this I'm not too sure like how to do this but dude this smells like shatter man doctor picking is wild all broken up here I have the wedding punch [Music] ever grams of wedding punch [Music] I want to put some more wheat actually for once he's the grinder I don't know why use a grinder but it made the weed like really really fine in that already like that so here's 2 grams such a backward roller I really hope this is the right way that I'm doing this because there is like no instructions on like which way this was supposed to be rolled and like there's no line of like where the paper is like there's a slight line like you know like that sticky line to where the paper is sticky and we're like you know that's where you're licking it it didn't really have one of those kind like a very faint line and I was like unsure [Music] to think this whole entire thing is gonna get me high not even cuz I'm just the wheat it's like amazing the papers gonna get me high dude that's insane I feel like it's almost blasphemous to cut this off but happy it's thick paper it's very nice [Music] [Music] [Music] this is my first time ever tried these lift tickets shoutout sacrament I want six this is lit reckless rainbow I really don't know what this flavor is but it's very nice I can taste the blood tastes amazing but I know what this weed tastes like I could taste like another flavor very nice and that has to be the paper it's almost like a flavored paper but you know what's getting you high whoever came up with this idea you are a genius [Music] it's a little harsh on the throat [ __ ] alive it's not the easiest to burn it's burning its predict pretty nicely but it's cut a rough and it's getting it really resonated really quickly all in all so far like these whatever I commend them yeah this is a cool thing to try I think that everybody deserves to try like a really cool thing like this but I also think that if you want to spend too much cuz these retailed and where I got them at least for the guy I met you know sach meds nine one six these are 20 bucks he was selling them for it I don't know how much other people sell them for but you get five papers that's five bucks of paper basically like you know technically they've paid twenty bucks for the whole thing five ten fifteen twenty you know actually you know that's that would be 25 I can't do better I'm [ __ ] stoned but still you get the gist though that's like a lot of money per paper like we're in 20 people you shouldn't pay more than like a dollar or whatever I don't know like 30 cents I just like you have to like really want these to buy these like you really want to try them other than that I mean I don't know I'll smoke the whole thing so you have to [Music] so far does it really feel any different than if I just smoke the weed alone and I started doing this I'm already high as [ __ ] I've really started to feel it now I'm not too sure where I feel it it's weird is I just feel it reading the package business a if it's a hybrid or a sativa or it doesn't really say anything on it besides the flavors are like the name and where it's from so I don't know what I'm smoking I just feel it I tasted I'm mmm nice [Music] this package advised me of like a Willie walk-up reminds me of like nerds Willy Wonka nerds are so [ __ ] reckless rainbow it's like one of those um sin nerds I don't know they're nerds ropes but this dust age really gets like okay a regular joint right you were to smoke it down to this size by now it would taste like gross especially the fact that it's resonated in [ __ ] it would taste disgusting but this is still has a very nice flavor so you can tell there's something going on here it's really

yeah i'll move on as you can see very uh leafy plan as you can see you've got a lot of colors i'll put them down but the bird's not as frosty as i like i think i had the cabbage a bit dry at the start of the grow right um but it does have a bit of it's really firm as well smells nice yeah west coast oh gee as you can see this one's really soft stuck it can get really tall but as you can see loads of cooler heads used by kate so yeah she's come on really really well this one like i said it's coming to finish i did give it one last feed not too long ago and since then i've just been giving her water like just trying to flush my naturally just let the new slowly drain late and then so yeah i reckon over the next week this plant probably finished uh cut down um and then we'll see what it's like then he's obviously you know drying like you lose a lot of weight so uh you know and like i said this plan i got massive but it's the first one i've grown in a very long time well in quite a while uh so like i said i just need to address make sure it's a bit more humid in there because it you know has made the bed a little bit dry but you know the frost still come on the birds have still got a bit of tap to it you know and at least you don't have to pay to buy loads of bird when i've got my own beautiful bird to smoke so yeah like you said this is probably the last video i'll do this plant so i hope you will enjoy watching it and you know that been is good uh program for a while um for us different reasons but like as time goes on i hope it'll be better and better since this one's finished there's going to be a gorilla glue going straight in that's from flashbed seeds as well i think so yeah i want to go strawberry pie but i'll be doing a video of that that's also fast bud seeds as well so this is west killsteal g day 66 so like nine weeks in three days and that is um and then like i said as you can see she's um even though she didn't get very big it's definitely got a lot of bird on it like i said so be nice for me it gives me a nice bit of person to smoke and you know if i can have just a cut of plants ticking over just to keep me in personal and harsh and a bit of rosin and stuff like that i'm happy with that so yeah so yeah i can set up you enjoyed the video this is market bye", "LVZrPo3Ip6E": "hello this is Joseph Rogers with the kids hat podcast and we have another string to review this one is by a farm here in Bremerton actually so grown and raised in Brampton and soon to be smoked in for Emerson it's called rude boy oh gee the strain it's a hybrid 17.7% THC the farm is called Vaz rod hair up products spelled VA j ra DHA RA and I guess it's short for the short version is vag products but they have a particular name for some of their hydroponic apparently and wouldn't you know it it's called Brummell oh look at that brim below hydroponic with the Breville oh inside of the fairy art how do you not buy that crafted in Bremerton right how do you not buy Breville Oh brand weed craft handcrafted in Bremerton here's the stats for you Rudeboy OG 17.7 you see the total there the name of the grow and i mean look at these the color of these nuts I mean it's got purple undertones to it really dark colored I mean look at that oh my goodness a beautiful beautiful beautiful [ __ ] right there so let's break her open I love freshly breaking it open on camera because this just adds to the legitimacy that I'm not swapping out weed or whatever you know it's important to know that this is all 100% legit not playing favorites but I'm excited about doing our first review of weed that's done in Bremerton so we're gonna see what that's all about all right so packaging looks good oh man I could smell that all day oh man that smells so good look at those nugs in there that is so cool bro Rudeboy OG so let's go ahead and dump her out on here so we can have you guys take a closer look at what we're messing with here we have a look at that just overflowing the camera with this faith so let's try to get it all pretty oh try to get it all pretty for you get some nice visuals take one of these nugs on for the smoking test oh yeah there we go looking good leave this one right here it's like all dark for some reason I'll put that one on top put this one over here hopefully that camera holds up pretty good right there even move it back a little bit oh yeah look at that look at those mags man frosty s nuts looking good this is the little tree that I'm gonna load up for you give a nice little close up once again with my dirty nails cuz I haven't showered since yesterday so alright let's see here just go ahead and load her up see what the rude boy oh geez all about my farm here in Bremerton oh man that's good that is incredibly smooth and tasty my goodness and I mean look at that it you can already see ash off the first kit that is some true hydroponic [ __ ] right there come on camera focus for me baby focus for me give it to me give it to me camera there it is there's the focus first hit sometimes it takes two or three hits to get that kind of hashed result that's first hit man that is some good [ __ ] oh yeah oh man that burned to good I think I have to load another Bowl here damn it you know I forget to do I got so excited about smoking that I forgot to break it open and give it the smell test uh-huh no I'm talking about see that that Bulls already gone that's gnarly sucks down one down let's grab one off the spinny thing ah there we go oh man it's got a very lemony I mean I know ice melted four straight out of the jar but like I said before that's always a different smell straight out of the jar then if you let it sit for a minute so let's break the rope and let's get the sound of that get that broke open yeah nevermind but Stu stuff didn't really make a sound oh oh yeah it's got earthy piney undertones with some citrus no man is just smells really good look at that broke open and that is exceptional exceptional stuff I'll come on camera must need to wipe you down or something because you were doing good just the other day oh yeah that's some good quality bud right there man I'm gonna load this one up big fat bowl some breed boy oh gee oh man and then we are going to hit this green hmm very tasty I want to take a closer look at one of these really colored ones up here like this one right here I mean look at the color on that that is just crazy let's even get the camera to play along will for me I don't know if I can really illustrate to you guys the color but it's like dark and some spots light green and others with orange hair is everywhere I mean that's just perfect perfect perfect I'm gonna try I'm gonna give another try cracking it open see if you can hear the sound of me cracking it open yeah yeah breaker open yeah beautiful beautiful beautiful in sight oh man I mean unfortunately there's really no way for me to like really illustrate to you the uniqueness of this smell other than the description I gave but it's just not enough you have to experience it for yourself it's very unique and I could tell it's a low-percentage TAC it's 17 total 17.7 total percent because I've already smoked one small bowl and I'm starting to smoke this one and I'm just now starting to feel it probably because I have a higher tolerance and there's nothing wrong with low-percentage Weed Man when you go to the store do you see something that 17.7% don't automatically pass that up because THC is and everything it's how it's grown how it's grown someone can grow with 17% you can match it up against the 24% and sometimes all the time you're gonna get a better feeling hi so the 24 percent might give you more of a head buzz or a body hive but some of the lower percentage stuff don't rule it out definitely don't rule it out if you're looking for mellow you're still looking to function you want to be able to smoke a big fat bowl and still go to your [ __ ] class reunion you can you know whatever floats your boat all I know is is I just could not pass it up groaning here in Bremerton baby bream oh-ho who else you want to impress your friends at a party in Bremerton man get this [ __ ] grafted in Bremerton will be like people grow weed and Riverton like yeah there's three or four shops actually or grow-ops here in Bremerton and badge va-jay-jay products is one of them and I want to say I've had VP in the past which is badge I think they're going from VP to badge but yeah I've had their stuff before a while ago but man this is this is impressive guys good work yeah look at that perfect this is probably out of all the recent reviews that I've been doing this one probably burns the best I mean this is just pure pure perfection you cannot you can't do any better than this it asked first hit that's insane no pesticides used hydroponics yeah that's probably the reason why aquaponics we're gonna get that soon with some Gardens probably get some fish poop in there fertilize that soil nothing wrong with that man I'd love to get it off the plants garden beyond just for fruits and vegetables [Music] yeah easy five out of five Tommy Chong's birds good smells good tastes good the buzz is good I still feel like I can function definitely feel hi fill up my face and eyes feel more relaxed a long day of work today so definitely needed to smoke this bowl and relax but yeah check it out man I would definitely love to hear from you guys subscribe to the channel turn on the notifications anytime you see me reviewing a strain and you're here in Washington you can go and you will shop in Washington sometimes pick up the same exact product some of these grow-ops man they go all over the state selling their product in the shops you can also go to Leafly calm and take a look at where the you can find some of these strains but you already know where to go to get the best [ __ ] for the best price you already know right there right there so go pick up some Bream a little hydroponic it could be a different strain but Rudeboy tell me what you think give it a nice little review leave a comment thanks", "x7X1hlA2BS4": "humbug

[Music] yes [Music] [Music] tomato [Music] [Music] next bye next two days [Music] looking about yourself so I can pretty [Music] [Music] got some great companies coming up in the next week right here so I'm excited to be these companies guys is there well more people companies you guys know I only smoke the best when I get the bad it's done I haven't really gotten much bad stuff yet tweedle farms one of my favorite consistent I know what to expect I've never gotten about anything once and the one time they send me the wrong strain what did they do they gave me that strain and sent me more of the right strength so I mean reach out to Brock boktai CPG is okay I really don't like that company because their mugs are usually so small they got very high quality and flowers but I like the experience of getting the real big buds and why not so I just I don't know and I bought an Alex remote so I'm just you know but they got very good home flour - we got five leave well this is extremely medicinal good company I love them to death I fell in love with them - they're one of my favorites shout out to Chattanooga Tennessee you know I also wanna let you guys know fields of hemp got nothing but consistent fire consistent fire extremely great company feels about fern Valley was extremely fresh flower did get anything to dry their stuff was really really really really good I was extremely impressed with them guys check them out CBD hemp direct is I've come to the conclusion okay I mean anybody could bomb afford CBD hemp today their stuff is okay it's just okay they got a few strains that are fired but other than that they're okay I mean I really don't like even when I bought the Girl Scout cookie the Special Reserve it was nice nuggets very dense nuggets but so tiny time you know so yeah I'm saying I need that kind of but I'm excited to try bakers range botanicals there's another company here I'm going to be trying honey stem flower they got fire but they only have two strange boys but also guys I'm going to be trying this stuff called mais adult okay and what that is is it is a CVD derived you know extract and it is put into my Internet's terrible here at emigrated it is the nasal delivery of CVD results in absorption of six to eight times as much CVD compared to oral routes which means you can take much smaller doses for the same effects that would be like getting creatine monohydrate or creatine hydrochloride okay hydrochloride obviously will dissolve in water like that and it will be absorbed by your body five times stronger than the creatine mass gainer one which will give you the bloated look when I go for is like I try to always stay like tight tight muscle with the less body water you don't want water weight it makes you look artificial so with this you are getting more absorption through your nostril membranes of the CBD Nate what is this one called this one was called the neighs adult okay and it is anywhere from thirty four ninety nine to forty nine ninety nine and I loved it I loved it the moment I saw it I fell in love with it and even this the flavor is it all right so it's got um I'm sorry but I can't seem to see it right at this moment what was it I can't remember it's sis I think they said it's got Y meaning power meaning that the the flavor of it's good because of the terpene profile but yeah so I'm excited for that I just shouted out guys some reputable companies in case you guys have any questions hit me up because I've tried on the low-low I've tried a lot more companies which weren't worth reviewing but let me know because I usually have answers to any questions you have so other than that guys I'm rambling at this point and I thank you for watching my videos twenty minutes long it was a pleasure smoking with you all tonight sorry about the initial review but the OG Kush is not straight-up done and it says regular guys once again California flowers it's a scam serial numbers aren't and the QR scan code is

batch I got was really dark with like a cheesy not really it's easy but kind of a really miss the darkest greenish look with some Ambarish tri crumbs that makes more sense it's not really white coated it's kind of like Ambarish tri chrome coated that OG Kush is of pure indica no sitive in it at all it's a cross between Los Angeles strain and era Los Angeles strain and the San Fernando Valley couch and it's just one of the strongest cushions out there are strong Senecas out there at least and taste is amazing it's like a an overpowering cush flavor with a like just a hint of pine and it's just overpowering you know so pungent ineptly dream really comes out a lot that flavor and tropical blueberry is one sweet undertone if you haven't checked out my pleasure in bud Rafi you need to go ahead and do that oh man so that is e cush that smoking on it the last few days particularly in the night time I don't really smoke that much in the morning because how it makes you feel it's just do nothing really and it's not particularly a demotivating train but it's just heavy-hitting indica and it's got that heavy body effect and to help you sleep great honestly if you don't smoke it directly

the last chunk of this eight yeah it's a hybrid it clocks in at twenty two point six percent total cannabinoids got one point three five Terps so it smells it smells like a sweet piney like it like uh like if a pine tree had candy growing on it it's really uh it's really dusty little orange hairs and crystals and the tips are like dark green I don't know if you can see that but like the tip the tips on it are really dark green I got a pre-rolled here with some with some diamonds so we're gonna try that out I've already tried it and out of the blue dream it's pretty good blue dream the blue dream the blue strain family are not one of my favorites but this one's pretty good I'm having to give it a I gave it a seven I think before when I smoked through the first couple times like seven point seven point seven sorry and now I'm putting diamonds in it that'll easily make it an eight whatever so we're gonna find out right now yeah it's just definitely taste good I just um I think it is my personal preference because I think I was I used to smoke a lot of like blue cheese and blue dream when at first when the Junaid first hit the UM hit the market they stopped kind of affecting me the same way now they just don't do it for me as much they don't they don't they don't kick as hard as they used to I guess my body is just you know tolerant to that genetic that genetic makeup at that strain still has that sweet taste like it's a sweet sweet but piney you know it's like walking through a candy forest put like in your lungs I'm already halfway through this with the diamonds I'm gonna go ahead and give this an 8 but by itself this blue dream strain I would give it it's by culture by the way it's a cult of hybrid culture boom though they hooked me up with these bracelets see the other day I'm joints a dope yeah art side passion you can definitely tell that they had the passion when they when they craft these beautiful flowers they are like I said there this is just a little beast like there's a huge nug in there should I should have recorded it but I didn't sorry [Applause] and tasty though I love those diamonds I've been putting diamonds in every J sense like [ __ ] spoiled that's what did I am but it's what I need this is my medicine for ruse this little good taste I'm not smacked like it although so like usually by half like half a Jane it's the best part of the J you know if you're not smacked by half the Jing then your flower is definitely not a nine or even an eight that's not an eight dude it's with the Diamonds gave it a little extra boost so like I can feel the diamonds kicking in the flower it's um we get like a seven five seven seven I spoke to by itself before in it had that sweet piney this hey this one's the taste sweeter because of the diamonds in it the diamonds in turps sauce some it's like really sweet tasting the other one was more like sweet and piney which is good which I like I like the piney ones I like the the purple the purple flavor e ones you know I like the funky cheesy ones those are like my favorites get hey with cheese look it's resident up right there see the dark round tip it's all googly goo well don't forget to Like comment subscribe you know do all those things that you do keep on medicating until next time peace", "bVaYGonmom8": "what's a YouTube just a little update again from my last row some new strings I'll lift the up old and in with the new these guys right here you're looking at on these are just clones music from progressive options out there and can come in California these are their camp dogs you slept really good on their website so I wanted to pick these up I was talking to the guys over there they said these are big yielders and the quality is really good that's kind of one of the good things that I like about progressive options they've already you know did the Phaedo hunt and they already got certified cuts a couple of other things going on in here are the oh geez in the back so right here these are all Tim dog trivia there's 12 of them and then they'll be here in the back we've got some old cheese I grew these a long time ago a feminized seeds from them and these right here but you know the thing that exceeds you could also get some Herbie's so I'm watching out for that just kind of watery so there's no co2 in here and these guys get thirsty so just got done watering them anyways besides the oh geez because Christmases because in his pocket just smelled it I mean this stuff was so deep you could keep it in your car and it stinks up the whole car like if you smoke in there so this is something you've got to watch when you carry it because it's going to speak so on the back we looking for that Pinot I grew out 12 seeds I think I ended up with the leaven that we're a keeper and from the 11 now I got a narrow it down to see which one's the peeper which one's the army you know how I build them up you know hun another new addition is uh got that uh that uh what does it call cush dreams for her dream yeah it's push dreams and that's when DNA genetics that's this one right here and then I got this little one I popped this one late but I had to well actually that pop yeah pop too and one of them didn't make it and this is the one that did make it and it wasn't you know how it is when you pop regular seeds you gotta make sure you have an extra one or a feel alone because one could be a male most of time on male you know things it out and this little guy right here that's the other history DNA genetics but I like the way this one's growing because this one I believe it or not I'm tufted a week later than the illa genius and I it's already passing a month CBL oh geez and these cam dogs are just as growing every day these are beautiful so that's what we got going on from the last time we talked I installed don't try to grow in the summer if you don't have some kind of air conditioning for your side Start menu split way better than up then doing a poor boy HC I'm so glad that I didn't go that route it seemed like the easiest way to go because the media label is a [ __ ] to install I kind of put my attic we had 25 foot line so I around that outside and I couldn't even run it down to the floor I had it mounted to the wall so about 660 and that was with the mini split and the copper lines but then I still had to buy the mounting bracket also the work was for teenage buy for which I needed another wire so I got an actually on me and honestly that wasn't even enough feet on the wire for some reason it was 25 feet but they didn't come out to 25 feet when I stretched because copper lines barely made it by 4 inches and I had to extend all those wires the 13th floor and let all the chocolates install which was my first time installing something like that you know so now I got the hang of it but went into it was really difficult but I finally got it done it on the line and I can split this up my champs are just I mean they're nice the exhaust briefs and the last thing I need is for the odor to leak out that's pretty much it should be through these flowers to help skin dogs are really catching up and they're actually little clones now it's starting to look they're teenagers now but these ones over here these up right here they look like you know let its head it's man so once they grow out and eliminate some and keep keep the best one out of them so I'm not gonna clone them and then you know I'm just gonna do it transplant them it's a seven gallons and then just be process of elimination which will probably start showing in week two maybe three but I've had some stuff for mommy right in the middle and it's like do I keep it or not and sometimes he's hurt manic they look dankey you know but at the same time I do you want to risk Furby your females really looking forward to seeing this misuse by DNA genetics I only got three beans from them because I got a bunch of other stuff which the training name and closure could and then I got a freebie which was Sour Diesel and I really want to see because you thought it said it was rare but the funny part was when I want to get more because I tried out a new seed bank besides attitude attitude weird on the checkout at the end of the checkout my credit card and I guess come and find out that was dude it because it was a charge coming from a you know out of the country so they automatically denied it which I thought it was something with the website so they when I winced it get up from T SCC or something like that it denied it again and then my bank called me out telling me you know if you authorize his charge and I said yeah you know I tried to authorize it because it automatically didn't allow it again either but this time I use a different credit card so this big immediately upon subpoenas yeah I mean that charge now you can make your purchases so they know what I mean purchases and the seeds went through in there honestly I just bought a few hundred dollars with the seeds just to test it on because I never use that I've always use attitude in the past which this one I'm really glad I like because it's weird and then you got to buy all this stuff and then hands up coming out so way more than you know you at all that's a genetics too so I want to get that one July I believe but these these oh geez are all because the when I had this cut and there were some fire so I'm hoping those turned out the same way and then got these uh cams as backups so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna run these mainly and the oh geez are the backups now is that you know like I said think of her get a mail or whatever so that's why I got the cans cuz I already know they're certified and then the oh geez both laugh lined up when in there maybe i funny too and then this cush dreams there's that one thing I learned in the past you know don't put all your eggs in one basket with one string you want to have multiple strings to take you to find that one you want to keep because something on the website a you grow it you know or maybe you know there's there there's fire but maybe it's not your string you know that you'd like and that's why I told you to run multiple strings until you find that one you like that last girl are really regretting it now it was blue dream it was blue treaty's yielded crazy is you see in that last video those are some monsters yield makes you wonder and then after growing that last batch that I I mean that the next were not dance where maybe it was just that be knowing under me because what happened was I thought I liked one phenome and then I faced up the other those are regular seats to so and then kind of curious about feminizing growing feminized seeds but I'm interested in doing that will actually bind feminized seeds besides the ones I have so anyways so yeah it just didn't work out I'd like to get yields and that that Dutch from shorts that did have yield and not only that but the quality of that smoke was really good and their seats are not cheap I was looking on the for then there are 20 dollars in a year Oh for their seats because Sookie you magic I mean but you know what it meant but what do they do all you need is a few of those just get your veto and what you do man those those that's fire right there I had that but the yields that those yields lasted me a long time I mean I was like I have some weight from those and then that Julius Caesar came it was just like pathetic wait man delicious horrible and then the quality quality wasn't all there like how I thought it was managed Turkish times SAV now I'm not even really I just want a good smoke and I don't like those nuns that live like they're they're big and then they don't weigh anything that was the situation with the view sleep which I thought was oh yeah it was a deep diesel keys so yeah I mean it was a good smile well like I said they'll wait on it I mean I like dense notes that's me I like to have a bag and you know nothing next to the plans you know I see the ones only what you need and you hang it from somewhere but I don't think that's I mean they work great but I like to know like different spots of the bargain so looking forward to this role I'm just waiting for them to get bigger cuz I like to run bigger plants and less numbers things I've seen a lot of plants just keep working but thing is is you know got to keep it legal and one of the parts of being legal just keeping your numbers down and that's what I'm doing so and like I said this is a SB 420 California legal grow up you know so I said guys you have any questions or comments just get at me and I'll be right back like I've said in the past I've used my phone and the comments are kind of weird so I will get back to you I just got get on the laptop which I'm already hit on but anyways you guys have a good one and keep you updated on this grow thanks a lot peace", "kaBVuIxmyeM": "[Music] everybody we're out here we're doing the video and Australian we got for today's CAPTA so G and I grabbed this from Green Farms in Mesa and from what I found out this is an indica dominant strain and the THC rose on this game be about 18% so the most moderate lower moderate levels as far as the genetics go this is a cross between Afghani and Northern Lights for what I could find out from my own personal experience this is a good day time in the car it's it's comfortable its relaxing it's very mellow but it wasn't locking for me I didn't get the couchy effects I wasn't Mathare Jack wasn't dragging my feet or you know nodding off in comfortable places I actually have a really good day with this I went all kinds of places I even went to the school when talked to counselors about going back to school and stuff like that so I was doing all kinds of stuff with shopping or driving around and this is good for like if you have social anxieties if you just have any kind of that you get panic attacks easy you know you don't like be on crowds this is a good string to get you nice and comfy you know to be around other people being around strangers opening up the people because for me I got that kind of a problem and I went to the school to the Medical Institute to go find out what but the class is scheduled all the information and I thought myself just be able to like really flow well with the with with the man I was talking to about the butter school one of the counselors that they set me up with so yeah I felt like it was really good I was functional I was able to kind of like communicate and talk nicely and all that stuff so was really good I felt like if you got stuff to go like job interview court you need to settle the nerves you know but you don't want to be like stone or like you're high but you still want to be functional but still you know if be chilled on the nerves and just kind of relaxed and mellow this is a good strain for that man so yeah it does have a little bit of cough to it but it is smooth it's not far anyway still wonderful strain show you what the hits like and the taste is nice it's very um it's got this earthy pungency its kind of far all kind of gassy it's got a whole bunch of flavors mag it's really Danko overall but anyhow sure real quick that's nice this cactus OG does have a good taste to it I think that never any ball there we go anyways cactus OG wonderful strain goes down smooth nice mellow relaxing hi you will catch the munchies a little bit nothing too much cottonmouth was there so have some water Andy but for the most part my it's a good movie strained relax chill kick back shoot the breeze take it easy guys", "eyQ1s0VAolk": "hi stu's reviews here i've got fuzzies again i haven't had one of these

bugging the [ __ ] out of everybody in the condo complex this is a great freaking pre-roll it's incredible i haven't had one of these in a while they are fantastic the fuzzy's uh infused pre-roll here

recap on the stroll we have a traumatic ballast up there on the ceiling pushing eight open bulb life just basic batwing reflector reflectors eight bear bulbs forty-four u-dub purple OG plants all in five gamma maker pots with pure cocoa almost 42 inch tomato cages hooked up on automatic drip lines in this beautiful 8000 want room [Music] plants stretched up they're filling out nicely nice and green as you can see I do have the white balance set here on my 5d mark ii camera still have a gap here in the canopy but the side rows are starting to fill in you can see that's pretty well filled in this is pretty well filled and even kind of tight here close weak so I'd say by next week day 21 when things stop filling out it should be on the move these plants over and just have minimal space in between each row so it looks like they're filling out more than I thought they would what else to say Oh current temperature is 70 degrees with 56 percent humidity actually just turned down the lights they're 1000 watt mode I turned down a 600 watt mode because I wanted to have less light when I shooting but you can see here 69 degrees now only because I've turned the lights down once I turn it back up mm ah this will go back up to 70 planets looking very healthy spuds starting to form I guess we can try and get a little bit of a focus here now you can see little buds I mean only date 14 not much to brag about so anyway I'm gonna keep this video short there's not much else to say you know just been wandering the plants with the full psycho lineup and also supplementing with cal-mag at 1 milliliter per liter pretty much all my nutrients it's all psycho all one milliliter per liter except for a and B the base nutrients I feed it to Millie's 4 meter give me an easy about 1.6 or so I will be boosting that up in the next couple used to 1.8 by probably deciding an extra hundred milliliters and electric Eagle runs for each the AL abhi base any guys any questions comments let me know

makes it dank if it's like beautiful and sticky average slowly and gets you really stoned yeah it does stink I mean it's really strong like it is only because it completely overwhelmed on the screen

on YouTube I just want to do a quick update [ __ ] on all day is a little sunday so not sure on the day I think it's the third though 33 looking at the bedroom start over here so these three right here sour diesels no you guys can see at the right notes go inform now the soil line member I'll sand in the last video I had accidentally a then you can the hydro line or soil which I mean I'm sure it's not too much of a problem but as you can see we had some fading going on on the lower leaves now all the new growth is just lush see I mean that's beautiful just absolutely beautiful and they're all look like that the easels it was a pretty link let you sell the easels just felt like giving the side view as you get to see so I'm guessing these about like two feet about three-game passante not sure exactly all right right here strawberry cough it's kind of growing the slowest but it's a definitely looking beautiful that'd say that's about a foot foot some inches maybe four and a half and behind her thinking yeah that's XJ 13 right here is not mildew that is my soul for bass spray so what that does is it a it covers the leaf surface and it changes the pH of the leaf surface so that's that it kind of codes it with a white layer and it just makes it a um uh well just make this little team can't thrive in that you know on the leaf surface so anyways she is looking really good really good I mean they're all looking really good so strawberry cough XJ Chernobyl take a look at that Chernobyl that a golden ticket cut to so ya see what that does it's very healthy i'm liking the way it's bushing he'll just take this strawberry come out of the way x that's XJ and that's golden ticket at Chernobyl she's got a nice bushiness to her as you can see this XJ has grown more vertical miss and height this one's I mean it's doing the same but it's also bushing like you see all these go through in the diesels of course are really lanky as you can see um so yeah that's that is the Chernobyl on that right side just clear that up this right here is black water which is sfv OG kush cross with mendo purps looking absolutely just beautiful I mean just just gorgeous get these leaves just pure health so I'm really looking forward to see what this strain does black water and his cali connection strain but i got it as a cut all of these in here are cuts no seeds don't have anything

do I've already done a review of this train but I'm doing going to do a bit of an unboxing because it feels like it's in a different package so I just want to make sure that i'll show you that tweed is on the right direction so Tweety does my license producer I have a prescription for my doctor and I use my license producer fairly heavily I've been pretty happy with tweed I know a lot of people are pretty anti license producer but I've had a pretty good experience and so I can't complain I just want to say that not exactly hundred percent for the mmpr the way it's laid out but it's worked out fine for me as far as keeping me legal and so I think it's a good idea for anyone who's worried about the law and tell the law changes so let's do this tweet okay tweed comes in the mail as all vices producers are required to do I don't have storefronts they just send it in the mail and I used to give me boxes that are like this now I have some my paraphernalia in there but it's a fairly big box and then came wrapped in a type of psychosis sent free smelly proof tin wrapping and vanna k yeah the tin wrapping and the plastic wrapping and then the box and blah blah blah it was a big piece of package so see what we have here yeah a little tiny box awesome this is beautiful this is extremely this is way better this is an extreme improvement off during before it's funny I got my first my last package I got for them I did a review you'll see maybe earlier look through my videos and you'll see it but they had a box that was just like this and it was it was that big so it was much thinner it was much less packaging still a bit big because there was a lot of space that needed to be filled in the box it wasn't it wasn't full with my one little bottle and so this looks like about a third super happy how small it's getting tweeds on the right path there that's got a little story on the back and a little story on the front your order has arrived beautiful thanks tweet what else comes in it there's a little piece of cardboard these are the documents that are government documents that are required looks like a little receipt you'll see it's got consumer information see the government to counter the logo on there says what the product may be used for what the ingredients might be talks about 70 different cannabinoids there's a lot of good information here there's a lot of jargon in here about them not really promoting it as a medicine and things like that so if any of you guys know the Health Canada didn't decide yes marijuana is good and it should be used in the medicine what happened with Health Canada is that they they it being illegal was challenged in court by patients and so when the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that there needs to be access to this medicine that helps people that's when the nma are was laid out and then the Conservative government changed its to the MMP are released another regulation and allows the licensed producers only the best quality stuff only the best quality stuff from your friends at tweed you get the stuff min comes with a little sticker you can see shipped and sold dates and I have it handy but a little card I put in my wallet and in the card on the card so it has a little place for me to put that sticker imagining in a pullover situation that would be what you would show them although really what you need to show them as your prescription bottle so let's just look in there there's a floor in there looks like a little bit of wasted space peel up the floor it's just a filler box there's nothing in there so I imagine if you ordered a second bottle they would just stack them I think that's the space for the second bottle alright break that box down they've got a cool cool of marijuana pictures on the inside cannabis plant it's got some logos on the side I might as well show you as well sort of like tweed mission statements maybe toss that recycle that so has shown before in my videos you have a little tin seal there and the seal is hmm keeping in that beautiful smile oh that is amazing tweeds always got great smelling bud site I'm really happy with the quality all around in general from previous orders let's clear a little space in my Roman area I'll dump this out this is a 5 grand purchase i made this know if you can see that but there's a little bit of a little bit of garbage at the bottom I I never see this with tweed but it's a I shouldn't say garbage but it's I'll just show you on my little card here its leafy mess I came out of my bottle usually it's just flowers so I'm going to throw this on a scale now that I'm curious if that takes up some of my weight often I've found tweet is a little underweight I think they might dry out a little bit before it gets to you so I'm only putting the butt on there now and it's 4.6 so i paid for five grams and I'll throw this little bit on 4.8 is what it came to 4.9 with that last little bit so a little bit under and almost half a gram is this shape so it's not very good but when you take a look at the flowers are fantastic so this strain here runs before dollars eighty cents a gram which is cheaper than I can get it at any dispensary I don't so there I don't really go for the high-end stuff tweet us a lot of high-end stuff but i find the low-end a tweet is extremely high quality so i don't really go to the low the high-end very often just to save money a bit of a heavy user don't want to be spending you know no one would be spending twenty bucks a day so so i go for these lower costs flowers and there and they do well they're really nice I have no complaints I've never had a complaint on any of the any of the flowers I've gotten from tweeds so that's why I stick to the low end they do have a kosher kush which I've really i really want to dive into soon I now I've gotten a dispensary and been super happy before i think i got it at ocean grown and it's pretty nice strained so you know over the Christmas holidays i might treat myself to a little little higher-end kind of deal grind it up in my zoos vortex and it's really dry as all the stuff i get from tweet is bone dry and i'm not sure if that happens before or after it's been packaged like I lot you know it's 4.9 I've had 4.88 several times so maybe it's trying out a little it before it gets too could be it could be the case grinds up nice and easily like this I find even though it's a dry we eat it's not super chunky this bogert I should also say I'm cut its called Bogart I'll show you the bottle in a second I'm done rolling but it's actually og cush and so tweed puts new names they make up their own names and they use those as their main I don't know what you called their main strain name instead of the original lineage I dislike that I mean it's okay maybe for new users but say someone is a new user an older person let's just say for example a lot of older people starting to use cannabis with this medical use allowance as well as dispensary pillow for cajun prolific ation say they buy a boggart from tweed and then they go to a dispensary and they say oh gee and they see og cush it's the same strain but they have no idea that it's the same strain me maybe with some Street knowledge I might I have a little more knowledge about strains and I might I might be able to pick out a good portion of the strains and say hey this is that strain originally this this this Bogart is actually a og cush you know I don't know yet you need pretty good knowledge so I think it's a little confusing and I don't really like it the names aren't bad they come up with some good names but why name something that has a name I just I just don't really like it it's not my favorite yeah hmm something about the way tweaked roses just has a very very appealing taste and and sent let's just give you a quick little view of the bottle here yeah Bogart and then ran underneath it says og cush and I'll just turn it around 15.6 THC that's fairly low for a ho jee cush I like I like a plant around fifteen percent though it's it's usually about the right strength for me it doesn't max out my mccann of a noid system I don't I can smoke it and I know there's still head room left you know when you max when you're maxing your can of cannabinoid system oh I don't know if that's really the great way to put it but smoke a really like say you're smoking shatter you're about as high as you can get right away your maxing that out there's no Headroom there and so once you smoke a few times in a day you built up a bit of a tolerance and just a not a long term tolerance but that day so you you have to smoke more and more and more I guess is what I'm getting at and so when I smoke a 15-percent I never max it out and I find I can continue to smoke the same strain for it tonight and always be finding a good level I just have to you know maybe take a few more puffs on my third or fourth session so let's light this up and give it a little all go let it go as you can see it and get around to building my shelf see out there over there painted my painted my brackets and didn't use the right paint start flaking off so I got and just got a hold of new brackets it'll be up today hmm I don't know how they do it I guess it's something to do with the terpenes they have some very very good curlers in my opinion there it the taste is glorious burns pretty speedily because it's dry give you a little look here at the ash change my light position so maybe you get a better look at the ash pretty white it's pretty damn good nice and clean it's been flushed fairly well you can tell hmm love it so that og cush Bogart from tweed I just want to give him props on their new packaging I'm going to send him an email tonight maybe with a photograph some of these leaves see what they have to say about that when I talked to him about the under weighing of the plants before of a you know I usually point to say something like that below the white one point one point two they said that they use a very precision scale above above the blah it basically told me I was wrong I mean in a nice way they're always nice but you know the shake at the bottom i'm not wrong with that i can see it hmm OG Kush all right well I've already reviewed this one so I'll go too much into depth beyond that let you guys",
